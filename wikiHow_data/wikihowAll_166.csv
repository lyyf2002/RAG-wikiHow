Teach kids how to use the Internet for research and homework.",How to Teach Kids About Computers2," Examples of computer etiquette include understanding that food and drink must be kept away from computers at all times, and that keyboards, mouses, and other accessories should be handled gently without pounding or other physical abuse.


Monitor kids' computer use at all times to verify that they are handling and treating the computers safely and respectfully. This can help prevent kids from causing any accidents that can permanently damage computers; such as dropping laptops on the floor, or spilling food and drinks on computers and keyboards.

, Since most computers are driven by commands from a mouse as opposed to keyboard commands, teaching kids how to use a mouse is a major first step in learning about computers.


Modify the mouse settings on your computer to achieve a slower mouse speed, if needed. A slower mouse speed can help kids become familiar with the process for using a mouse, especially if you are teaching young toddlers or children who are still developing their motor skills.

, Kids should be taught to position their hands appropriately over a keyboard to type, as opposed to adapting a ""hunt and peck"" typing method.


Use typing software that teaches kids about proper hand and finger placement on a keyboard, and that contains a series of lessons that progress as kids develop their typing skills.

, The Internet can be a resourceful tool in completing homework assignments, and can be an ideal way for kids to strengthen their computer skills.


Show kids how to enter specific keywords and queries into search engines such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo. For example, if a kid's homework assignment is about alligators, show them how to enter specific keyword phrases into a search engine, such as ""types of alligator species,"" or ""breeds of alligators.""
Teach kids about ways to find legitimate information sources. For example, show kids how to choose websites that can provide reliable information on a topic, such as websites that end in either "".edu,"" or "".org.""

Make sure your computer is plugged into a power source.,
Locate your computer's power button



 

.,
Press the power button





.",How to Start a Computer1," If you're using a desktop computer, you cannot turn it on without first plugging it in; laptop computers can run on battery power, but should be plugged in to negate a low battery or other problems while starting up.

If you're plugging into a surge protector (e.g., a power strip) instead of a traditional wall outlet, you'll also need to make sure that the surge protector is on.
A laptop's charger typically plugs into the left or right side of the laptop's housing.;
, The power button symbol resembles a circle with a vertical line through it. Power button location will vary from computer to computer, but you can typically find the power button in one of the following locations:


Laptop - Left, right, or front side of the housing. Sometimes the power button also appears as a key near the top of the keyboard, or as a button in the area above or below the keyboard.

Desktop - On the front or back of the CPU, which is the box-shaped piece of hardware to which your computer screen connects. Some iMac desktops have the power button on the back of the monitor or the keyboard instead.

, You don't need to hold down the power button to turn on the computer. You should hear the computer's internal fan and disk drive begin spinning; after a few seconds, your computer's monitor will also light up and display either the start-up screen or the login screen, depending on whether the computer was off or sleeping.

For a laptop, you'll first need to open the screen by pulling it up and away from the laptop's housing.
If your desktop computer doesn't turn on, try pressing your monitor's power button as well. It may be the case that your computer is on but the monitor is not.

Sit up tall.,
Sit close to your keyboard.,
Adjust the keyboard height.,
Adjust the tilt of your keyboard based on your sitting position.,
Use wrist rests.,
Position your monitor properly.,
Position the source documents directly in front of you, and use an in-line copy stand.,
An articulating keyboard tray can provide optimal positioning of input devices.,
Take small breaks during your workday to release some of that muscle tension.,
Exercise your hand by pushing on top of your fingers, and using backward resistance movements.,
Done!

",How to Sit at a Computer," Push your hips as far back as they can go in the chair. Adjust the seat height so that your feet are flat on the floor and your knees equal to, or slightly lower than, your hips. Adjust the back of the chair to a 100°-110° reclined angle. Make sure that your upper and lower back are supported. If necessary, use inflatable cushions or small pillows. When your chair has an active back mechanism use it to make frequent position changes. Adjust the armrests so that your shoulders are relaxed, and remove them completely if you find that they are in your way.;
, Position it so that it is directly in front of your body. Make sure that the keys are centered with your body.

, Make sure your shoulders are relaxed, your elbows are in a slightly open position, and your wrists and hands are straight.

, Use the keyboard tray mechanism or keyboard feet, to adjust the tilt. If you sit in a forward or upright position, try tilting your keyboard away from you, but if you are slightly reclined, then a slight forward tilt will help to maintain a straight wrist position.

, They will help maintain neutral postures and pad hard surfaces. The wrist rest should only be used to rest the palms of the hands between keystrokes and not while typing. Place the mouse or trackball as close as possible to the keyboard.

, Adjust the monitor and any source or reference documents so that your neck is in a neutral, relaxed position. Center the monitor directly in front of you, above your keyboard. Position the top of the monitor approximately 2-3” above your seated eye level. If you wear bifocals, lower the monitor to a comfortable reading level.


Sit at least an arm's length away from the screen and adjust the distance for your vision. Reduce any glare by carefully positioning the screen, which you should be looking almost straight at, but partially looking down. Adjust any curtains or blinds as needed. Adjust the vertical screen angle and screen controls to minimize glare from overhead lights.

, If there is insufficient space for that, place the documents on a document holder positioned adjacent to the monitor. Place your telephone within easy reach. Use headsets or a speaker phone to eliminate cradling the handset.

, However, it should accommodate the mouse, enable leg clearance, and have an adjustable height and tilt mechanism. The tray should not push you too far away from other work materials, such as your telephone


If you do not have a fully adjustable keyboard tray, you may need to adjust your workstation height and the height of your chair, or use a seat cushion to get in a comfortable position. Remember to use a footrest if your feet dangle.

, Studies have shown that constant sitting is very damaging to your health. Try walking around for a couple minutes, standing and doing stretches—anything to break up a full day of sitting on your bottom is good for you!


Take short 1-2 minute stretch breaks every 20-30 minutes. After each hour of work, take a break or change tasks for at least 5-10 minutes. Always try to get away from your computer during lunch breaks.
Avoid eye fatigue by resting and refocusing your eyes periodically. Look away from the monitor and focus on something in the distance. Rest your eyes by covering them with your palms for 10-15 seconds. Use correct posture when working. Keep moving as much as possible.

, Do a minimum of fifteen reps for each hand at least six times every day. This simple exercise will prevent you from developing carpal tunnel finger problems in the future. Even if you don’t have any problems right now, you may prevent pain later in life by doing a few good exercises.

Personalize the computer.",How to Set Up a New Computer1," Depending on where you purchased your computer and what options you selected, you may or may not have the following items:


CPU Tower - This may be all you have if you just purchased a tower. If that's the case, you will need to obtain a monitor, mouse, and keyboard before you can use the computer.
Monitor - Not all computers come with a monitor. If you're upgrading your computer, you can usually use your old monitor.
Mouse and keyboard - Most complete systems come packed with both of these, though you may want to consider upgrading for higher-quality peripherals with better ergonomics
Speakers - These are sometimes built into monitor, and are not always included.
Printer - Some systems come packaged with a printer, though typically this is purchased separately.;
, Place your CPU tower near its intended location with enough room for all of the fans to move air. Towers typically have fans on the rear of the case, and sometimes have fans on the sides, front, and top. Avoid placing the tower between sets of drawers or inside of a cabinet. If you are using your computer as a home theater PC, make sure that its spot in the home theater cabinet has plenty of air on all sides, and that the cabinet is not enclosed.

, Plug the monitor or TV into one of the monitor ports on the back of the tower. Most modern computers have an HDMI port, which is the easiest to connect. Monitors typically use DVI or HDMI connections, but some older ones use VGA.


The monitor will also need to be plugged into a power outlet.
If you have a dedicated graphics card, ensure that your monitor is connected to the graphics card and not the motherboard. You will not be able to take advantage of the graphics card unless the monitor is attached to it. The monitor ports for your dedicated card will be located lower on the back of the tower.

, Virtually all mice and keyboards plug in via USB. If you are setting up an exceptionally old PC, you may need to connect the mouse and keyboard via the PS/2 connectors. These are typically located at the top of the back of the tower, and are color coded to match the keyboard and mouse plugs.

, Plug your speakers into the back of the computer using the color codes as guides. Ensure that all the channels are placed on the correct sides, and that the speakers are plugged into an outlet if necessary.


See this guide for more details on setting up computer speakers.

, If you can, plug it into a surge protector or uninterruptible power supply (UPS). This will help protect the computer in the event of a power surge or power loss.


You may need to flip the switch on the power supply to ON. The switch is usually located near the power cable.

, Press the Power button on the front of the computer to turn it on. If you bought the computer with an operating system such as Windows or Linux preinstalled, you will be guided through the first-time setup process for the operating system. Follow the prompts on the screen to enter your location and create your user account. If your computer did not come with an operating system preinstalled (this is rare), you will need to install it yourself.


See this guide for details on installing Windows.

, Before you can download any programs or start using the internet, you will need to connect your computer to a network. You can either connect wirelessly if you computer has a wireless network card, or you can connect to your router or modem via Ethernet.


See this guide for details on setting up a wireless connection.
If you want to connect via Ethernet, connect the Ethernet cable to your computer and to your router or modem. You won't need to perform any additional setup. See this guide for details.

, Chances are that your installed operating system and programs have been updated since the computer was built. You may be prompted to download and install updates, which is essential for keeping your computer secure and stable.


See this guide for details on installing the latest Windows updates.
You may be prompted to restart your computer to complete the update process.

, Now that you are connected to the internet and Windows has been updated, you can start installing your essential programs. If you're upgrading computers, don't just install all the old programs you used to have installed. Instead, take some time to evaluate what you really need. Only installing the essentials will help keep your computer running smoother.


Antivirus - This should be the first program that you install, no matter what. An antivirus helps protect your computer against malware and other malicious software, and is essential if your computer is connected to the internet. See this guide for details on installing antivirus software.
Favorite browser - Windows comes installed with Internet Explorer, but many people prefer other browsers. There are a variety to choose from, including Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
Word processor/productivity - Most people use their computers as a home office, which includes installing a word processor and possibly a spreadsheet program. Microsoft Office is designed to integrate into Windows, and you may have a trial already installed on your computer.
Games - Everyone likes to relax once in a while, so consider installing a game or two! Windows supports the most games out of any operating system, and there are countless ways you can find and purchase them. Some of the most popular storefronts include Steam, GOG, Origin, and Desura.

, Once all the boring stuff is out of the way, you can start making your new computer yours. You can change your desktop background, install new cursors, change the fonts, or even completely change the way Windows is organized using special software.


See this guide for details on completely customizing your Windows desktop.

Understand the process.,
Remove the hard drive from the Windows XP computer with the missing password.,
Put the hard drive into an external drive enclosure and connect it to the other PC.,
Boot the second PC and log in with its Administrator account.,
Copy any data you need from the Windows XP hard drive to the second PC.,
Put the drive back into the original computer.",How to Retrieve Passwords in Windows XP5," Use this method if you’re unable to get the user’s password with other methods. This method won’t allow you to find or reset the password, but you can access the user’s files so that their data is not lost. You’ll need administrative access to another Windows computer for this to work.

You will be temporarily removing the hard drive from the Windows XP PC and installing it in the second PC. To use this method, you’ll need to have some familiarity with removing a hard drive from a PC as well as putting a hard drive in an external USB hard drive enclosure.
If you don’t have an enclosure, you could also put the hard drive in the other PC.
If the computer with the missing password is a laptop, the instructions are similar, except you’ll definitely need an external hard drive enclosure to connect a laptop hard drive to a desktop computer (and vice-versa).

, With the computer turned off and unplugged, open the case and disconnect the hard drive., Alternatively you could open the second PC and install it., Because you’re logged in as an administrator and have the other hard drive connected to the computer, you now have access to everything on the other hard drive., Press ⊞ Win+E to open the File Explorer.

The second hard drive will show under “Computer” or “This PC,” depending on the version of Windows you are using. Double-click this drive and navigate to the user’s files, which are located in C:\Windows\Documents and Settings\User, where “User” is the name of your user.
Press ⊞ Win+E again to open a second instance of the File Explorer, which will make it simple to drag files from your user’s directory to the second computer. You can drag the files anywhere, including a flash drive.

, While you haven’t recovered the password, you’ve copied the user’s files so they haven’t lost any data."

Choose the song you want to create a music video for.,
Begin to understand the song.,
Think heavily about the content of the video.,
Gather your equipment.,
Enlist some actors and start shooting.,
Get all your footage into a non-linear editor like Adobe Premiere Pro.,
You're ready to put your video on Youtube, Vimeo, Facebook...",How to Make a Music Video for Free," This is a very important first step, as you will want to choose a song that inspires you.You could use a licensed song and not make any money from it, but this is probably not the best thing to do. There are many problems associated with using copyrighted music, most of which are legal problems. If you have any friends who are musicians, they will most likely be over the moon if you ask or ""offer"" to make a music video for them. Don't feel nervous about asking either, everyone starts somewhere. Or consider writing your own song for the video.;
, Listen to to it over and over excited or angry? The things you feel while listening will most likely work best as themes for the music video. You should have a pretty good idea for the vibe of the video by the end of this step.

, There are two very important decisions that you have to make now that will affect the tone of the video. Plan your story and your shots for the video, with storyboards if you want, test out the different styles. Consider these questions, and come up with full answers and the reasons why you chose them;


Are you going to have a narrative/story?
Will you feature particular people, such as the band members?

, You'll need a camera and lights. For the camera, any digital camera or even your iPhone will work, but if you have a nicer video camera, feel free to use that. Unless you want dialogue, you probably won't need any sound, as your soundtrack will simply be the song. Look up some simple lighting methods or just experiment yourself.

, You'll need someone to sing the song, if you opted not to have the band or artist perform it. You'll also need secondary roles and extras, so enlist as many people as possible and get them to join you for free. Then shoot your video. Make sure you overshoot - grab more takes and more footage than you think you'll need. You can never have too much footage, and it will be devastating if you realize you have a 10 second gap in your music video.

, If your system can't handle this program or if you don't want to buy it, download another video editing tool from the internet: there are free trials available, or Windows Movie Maker. Believe me, its not that bad.Put you song into the timeline as the constant element.Cut your video to it, this will take a lot of time and messing around. It may seem tedious, but just remember to watch what you have every now and then.

, Everywhere really. Get it out there and be proud of it. This is your first music video and you spent 0 dollars on it. Show it to the artist.Do not be self-conscious about your video. It is better than everyone's who DIDN'T make it. Don't compare yourself to others.

Establish the perimeters of your computer lab according to your organization's rules.,
Seek the help of an IT service or IT department, if you are not knowledgeable about computers.,
Post a ""Computer Lab Rules"" sheet that clearly states computer lab restrictions.,
Plug all your computer equipment into a surge protector.,
Set up a firewall.,
Set up weekly updates or automatic updates for your lab computers.,
Install an anti-virus program on the computers and/or network.,
Install an anti-spyware program on your computers and/or network.,
Back up your computers on a regular basis.,
Use the hard disc cleanup and defragmentation utilities regularly.,
Do not unplug printers, scanners and other connected machines when the computers are on.,
Turn off all computers by selecting the shut down option on the desktop.,
Clean your computer lab regularly.",How to Maintain Lab Computers," You may need to decide what search terms or websites you want to deny to your lab users. You will also want to establish the criteria for your firewall.;
, Ask the users to seek the help of the administrator or IT staff if they have a problem.

, These may include prohibition of food and drink, downloading software, opening attachments, removal of equipment, access to illicit sites and more. Many labs maintain that anyone caught breaking the rules is removed from the premises.

, Spikes and surges in electrical power can break or damage electrical equipment, as well as lose lab users' data. This is especially important in country computer labs and places that are prone to lightning storms.

, This is a protections system for your computer lab. Choose a network layer firewall that will deny access to sites or programs that don't fit into the acceptable criteria you have chosen.

, Many computer programs, such as Microsoft Office Suite, update their software and protection regularly. You will want to schedule these updates for a time when the computers are not in public use, and you may be able to do them from 1 central computer.

, This will usually stop a program from downloading if it suspects a virus. You can run daily or weekly reports on the computers to check more carefully for viruses.

, Spyware programs install themselves onto computers to gather personal information. Anti-spyware programs can stop these harmful programs from corrupting or filling up your computer.


Some computer labs choose to download a spyware program purposefully onto their lab computers. These programs are sometimes called ""keyloggers,"" and they can gather data about how the lab computers are being used for the system administrators.
Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs are especially important for Windows operating systems. Schedule scans on both programs every week. Apple computers have been less susceptible to viruses in the past; however, they are increasingly under threat.

, If your computer lab becomes corrupted by a virus, you can return to the previous backup to restore it.

, These Windows utilities regularly remove temporary files and keep the hard drive from fragmenting. If done on a weekly basis, the processes will be shorter than if you do it on a monthly basis.


Go to ""My Computer"" and right click on the ""Local Disk"" icon. Under ""Properties"" select ""Disc Cleanup.""

, Eject any USB devices before unplugging them. You may need to post this on your ""Lab Rules.""

, Avoid pressing the ""Power"" button to turn off computers. If this is necessary, run the computer in safe mode until you know what the problem is.


Ask your users to press the ""Control,"" ""Alt"" and ""Delete"" buttons if their computer freezes, rather than shutting it down with the ""Power"" button.

, The following are effective ways to clean a computer lab:


Dust computer screens using a thin, soft microfiber cloth. Dedicate 1 cloth to be used only on the screens. If dirt and debris from other surfaces gets caught in the cloth, it can scratch the computer screen.
Vacuum the floor every day, if possible, so dirt and debris is less likely to gather around the computers.
Dust all surfaces of the computer. If the fans in the Central Processing Unit (CPU) fill with dust, the computer can overheat. Use a thicker microfiber cloth to pull the dust from the surface. Some types of microfiber cloth have been shown to attract and trap dust.
Use compressed air to clean out keyboards. You may also choose to use a disinfectant sprayed on a lint-free cloth on the keyboard and mouses, for sanitary purposes.

, Be sure to record the name of the Excel file for later use.

, The pathway for the folder typically is: C:\Users\\Documents\MATLAB. Be sure you save the file as an Excel Workbook in order to have the proper file format for the import. Once this step is complete, you should see your Excel file in the current folder section in MATLAB.

, Identify the range of each column to be exported. The range of the column is the first cell in a column to the last cell in a column. The proper format for this range is the first cell followed by a colon followed by the last cell (I.e. “B1:B30”)

, Enter the command var = xlsread('filename', 'xlrange'); into the command window for each column you want to import. In this command:


Var is a variable name of your choice (Example: “x” or “y”)
Filename is the name of your excel spreadsheet
Xlrange is the range of the desired column in the form “X--:X--“,with X being the letter of the column followed by the cell number.

, Enter the command p = plot(indep, dep1, indep, dep2) in the command window. In this command, indep is the independent variable and dep1 and dep2 are the dependent variables. If you wish to graph more than two dependent variables, follow the same format and add a dep3 variable. If you wish to graph only one dependent variable, only graph the first pair of x and y values (Example: plot(x, y1)).

, Enter the command set(p,’color’,’’); into the command window to change all the graphed lines to the same color. In this command, p is a reference to the variable you set your plot equal to in step 6. If you wish to change the color of only one line enter set(p(x),’color’,’’); into the command line. The x in p(x) is the number that corresponds to the order that the lines are plotted in (Example: y1 = p(1), y2 = p(2)).

, Enter the command set(p,’LineStyle’,’style’); into the command window to change all of the graphed lines to the same style. If you wish to change the style of one line only, enter the command set(p(x),’LineStyle’,’style’); into the command line. In this command, the x in p(x) corresponds to the number in which the lines were graphed (Example: y1 = p(1), y2 = p(2)). Common line styles include:


dashed lines= '--'
dotted lines = ':'
solid line = '-'
dash-dot line = '-.'

, To label the x-axis, enter the command xlabel(‘text’) in the command window. To label the y-axis, enter the command ylabel(‘text’) in the command window.

, Enter the command title(‘text’) in the command window. The title will display at the top of your graph.

, If you wish to enter text near your graphed lines, enter the command gtext(‘text’). Once you enter the command, a cursor will appear on the graph allowing you to click the area you wish to apply the label. The label can be put anywhere in the graph space.

, If you wish to put grid lines in your plot for easier reading, enter the command grid into the command window. Entering the command again will remove the grid lines.

, Click file on upper right hand side of the MATLAB graph screen followed by save as in the menu. Save the graph to the desired location."

Get the sketchy look!",How to Edit Photos," You can do basic edits with programs like Picasa and Instagram, but if you want to make your photos really look amazing, you should get a program specifically designed for serious editing. This doesn't always have to cost money! Programs like GIMP are free. Though you'll have to learn how to use them, they'll make a huge impact on how your photos look.;
, When you're going back through your photos to edit them, one thing you can look at is how the photo is cropped. Changing where the picture ends can vastly change how it looks. Try following the rule of thirds, which suggests that photos look better when the frame is visually divided into three equal parts. , This is a common setting for any photo editor. It makes whites brighter and darks darker, making an image look more dramatic and clear. Be careful, however: you lose a lot of minor details when you increase contrast. Don't go overboard!

, Saturation is how bold the colors in a photo are, and a saturation adjuster is another common feature in photo editing programs. Sometimes, the photo can be improved by lower the saturation (moving towards black and white) and sometimes it can be improved by increasing the saturation. Experiment!

, This is another setting which comes mainly with Photoshop but also with some other editors as well. This is much like saturation, but it works much better with skin tones. Essentially, if you have people in a picture, start with the vibrancy. If you only have a landscape, you can use saturation.

, Instead of just applying blur or sharpen filters across your entire picture, use blur and sharpen brushes instead. This will give you more precise control. This is important because pictures usually only need a little blurring and a little sharpening. Sharpen small areas to make important details more crisp. Blur areas like certain parts of the skin on faces to make blemishes less noticeable.

, Really heavy editing can quickly make pictures look really fake. It's like putting way too much makeup on a really pretty woman. After awhile, she just looks like a clown. If you're going to make someone look thinner, don't go over the top. If you're going to change the colors, don't make them look unnatural. If you edit things out of images, check to make sure you didn't miss anything that will show the edits. You don't want to end up on Photoshop Disasters!

, Cliches are artistic crutches and can make excellent photos come across as boring and unprofessional. For example, black and white photos with just one thing colored (like a nice pair of red lips) are over done and now tend to come across as cheesy. If you really want your photos to be taken seriously as art, try to avoid cliches like this one.

, There are plenty of free editing applications available in the App Store, as well as affordable ones for under $5. If you want to explore different styles, then download a few apps and play around with their effects. Examples include:


Instagram (Free)
Adobe Photoshop Touch ($4.99)Apple iPhoto ($4.99)Aviary (Free)
BeFunky (Free)
EyeEm (Free)
Wood Camera (Free)

, For best results, choose a well-lit photo with a clear object like a person, plant, animal, or building. The clearer the photo, the more effective the edits will be.

, Most apps give you the option to either take a new picture (look for the button with the camera on it) or choose one from your photo library.

, Every app is different, but many of them, like Instagram, have a variety of ""filters"" or ""lenses"" to choose from, which essentially do all of the editing for you. Some apps give you the option to adjust the intensity of the filter, giving you more control over the final result.

, In photography, exposure refers to the amount of light that falls on a photo. If the photo is too dark, then you might need to increase the exposure. If you want the photo darker, then lower the exposure.

, Some apps allow you to adjust the saturation, or intensity of color, in a photo. Increasing the saturation of a photo can make the colors pop and make the photo more eye-catching. Too much saturation, though, can make the photo look harsh and almost cartoon-like.

, Blur the photo to make it look more dreamlike and distorted, or add a light leak to make the photo look old fashioned and damaged.


Light leaks used to be considered an error, occurring when light (usually from the sun) leaked onto the film and damaged it, but today, light leaks are considered a stylistic effect that many people find aesthetically pleasing.

, If you want to change the shape or size of a photo, then select the ""crop"" button (which will usually have a square on it) and adjust it as desired.

, Every app is different, so if it is your first time using one, you might want to go through and check out all the different options for how to edit the photo.

, You can do this by physically dragging the file over from your desktop or by importing pictures directly from your camera. To do this, use the cable that came with your camera to connect your camera to the USB port on your computer.


Make sure that your camera is on, and then open up iPhoto if it isn't open already. You can either import all of the photos on your camera by selecting ""Import All,"" or import photos individually by highlighting photos and then clicking the ""Import Selected"" button.

, It should expand in size when you double-click on it.

, You will now see several editing options at the bottom of the screen, including ""Rotate,"" ""Crop,"" ""Straighten,"" ""Enhance,"" ""Red-Eye,"" ""Retouch,"" ""Effects,"" and ""Adjust.""


To use an effect, simply click on the button for the effect you want to use. When you are done, either press ""Apply"" to save the changes or ""Cancel"" to discard of the changes and start over.

, To do this, simply click on the ""Rotate"" button. The photo will continue to rotate each time you click it until it returns to its original position.

, Cropping is a very basic editing tool that allows you to adjust the size and shape of a photo, as well as cut out any unwanted parts of the photo. When you click on the ""Crop"" button you will be presented with an adjustable rectangle that lies directly on top of the photo. To adjust it, simply drag on the corners of it until you reach the desired size and shape. You can also move the box around by clicking anywhere inside of it and then dragging your cursor to move it around.

, When you click on the ""Effects"" button, a small screen will appear with various filters for you to choose from. These include ""Black and White,"" ""Sepia,"" ""Antique,"" ""Fade Color,"" ""Boost Color,"" and more.


Some effects let you adjust the intensity of the filter. To do this, simply click on the effect and then adjust the numbers that appear on the bottom using the left and right arrows.

, To make more complex edits, click the ""Adjust"" button just underneath the picture. A new screen will pop up with options to adjust the exposure, saturation, contrast, definition, highlights, shadows, sharpness, temperature, and tint of the photo.

, When you are finished editing, click the ""Done"" button on the right side of your screen.

, You can do this by dragging the file from your desktop into the program or by opening up Photoshop, selecting ""File,"" ""Open,"" and then selecting the photo you want to edit.

, Before you get started editing, make a copy of the original photo in case you make mistakes while editing. To do this, select ""Layer"" and then ""Duplicate Layer."" This will create a copy of your original image.

, Cropping is a very basic editing technique that allows you to change the shape and size of an image and to cut out any unwanted parts. To crop the photo, simply click on the ""Crop Tool"" icon on the lefthand side of your screen. Now, click on the photo and drag your mouse to create the desired size and shape of your square. When you are done, click on the ""Crop Tool"" icon again. You will be given the option to save the changes or to cancel and return to the original image.


If you are having trouble finding the ""Crop Tool"" button, simply hover your mouse over the various buttons on the column on the lefthand side of your screen and wait for the descriptive text to pop up.

, Layers are a useful tool to use in Photoshop because they allow you to edit your photo without tampering with the original version. Layers can be turned ""on"" and ""off"" as you continue editing, so nothing is permanent (unless of course you save your final draft).


The ""Adjustment Layer"" button is located at the bottom of the Navigator Panel on the right side of your screen. It is a black and white circle with a diagonal line through it. When you hover your cursor over it, it should read, ""Create new fill or adjustment layer.""
When you click on the button, a drop-down list will appear with various editing options. They include Exposure, Brightness/Contrast, Selective Color, and more. When you click on one, you will create a new layer for that effect which you can adjust and turn on and off.
To turn a layer ""on"" or ""off,"" simply click on the image of an eye that appears right next to the title of the layer.

, Again, do this by first clicking the ""Adjustment Layer"" button, and then selecting ""Exposure"" from the drop-down list. This will create a new layer on your Navigator Panel entitled ""Exposure 1."" A small screen should pop up with options to adjust the exposure, offset, and gamma correction of the photo. Simply slide the dial to the left and right to make changes to any of these effects.


The exposure of a photo is essentially its brightness. When you slide the dial to the right, the photo will become brighter, and when you slide it to the left, it will become darker.
The offset and gamma correction options allow you to adjust the dark tones and midtones of the photo. This can help balance, or ""offset"" the harshness of color that occurs when you increase the exposure of a photo.

, Do this by creating a ""Selective Color"" layer. You will be presented with a small screen that allows you to adjust the red, yellow, blue, cyan, green, magenta, black, white, and neutral tones of the picture.

, The Levels tool allows you to change the overall image tone and contrast. To do this, create a ""Levels"" layer in your Navigator panel. You will be presented with a histogram palette with three different sliders right underneath it: the black tone slider (on the left), the white tone slider (on the right), and the midtone, or gamma, slider (on the right).The position of the black and white tone sliders creates a range for the input levels of the image.The black tone will originally be at 0, and the white tone will be at 255. To adjust the range, simply move the black tone slider to the right and/or the white tone slider to the left.
Drag the midtone slider to the left to darken the midtones, and to the right to lighten the midtones., Photoshop can be hard to use: it's definitely got a learning curve! But once you get the hang of it, you can get your photos looking like they belong in a gallery before you know it!

, Sometimes, one color not quite matching the rest in a photo can make the whole thing look off. A basic adjusting of the hues can save a picture!

, You've probably seen those spammy, virus-ridden apps and websites which promise to make your photos look like a drawing. Did you know that this is an effect that is easy to get for yourself, without the bonus malware? This can be a fun edit for your photos.

Media editing and creative works,






Games and overclocking,






Computation and scientific works,






Business and office works,






Daily household works and Internet surfing.






Also, you might like to have a media entertainment box.





;
, In addition to the job that you are doing with your computer you need to trade off for the budget that you are willing to commit. If you are earning from your computer you have to reimburse enough and generously to protect your work.

, Using the CPU manufacturer guides, select the CPU that can handle your workload, and meets your budget constraint.


A CPU is an electronic device, essentially in the size of an ordinary postal stamp with hundred even thousands of connections molded on a bigger rectangle such that can be handled by human hands. Most recent CPU has more than 2000 pins for connection.






Size of the rectangle and number and arrangement of pins is called the ""socket"" of the CPU.






Ordinary CPU's (in alphabetical order) are from AMD and Intel. There are several other CPU manufacturer for smart / mobile phones, specialised and industrial usages such as ARM or powerful SPARC CPU's.







, Having decided on the job and CPU and its socket, your choices will be narrowed down to certain categories of motherboards. In geek jargon, a motherboard is called a ""mobo.""


The connection of mobo with CPU is decided in terms of the CPU socket type. Socket of the mobo is the place that the CPU attaches to motherboard. The socket of the mobo should be compatible with the CPU.






The chipset is the main parameter in selecting the motherboard after you decided for the socket. While the CPU shows how powerful a computer is, the chipset shows how agile a computer is in interfacing with its human operator. The CPU is the master and the chipset is the butler.






The chipset should be accommodating for the selected CPU.







, Excessive heat on a CPU can shut the computer down, reduce the life-time of the CPU or even fry it to death. New CPUs come with a cooler (or an HSF: heatsink and fan). This is called the ""stock"" cooler. You could buy or for certain works have to buy your own HSF. Coolers have two parameter to consider.


Performance; that is, how far they can reduce the temperature of CPU when it is doing its normal job or while its performing heavy duty jobs such as running a game or editing (coding) a video clip.






Created noise. All the coolers have a fan for ventilation and exhausting the hot air around the CPU that can create different levels of noise. Modern expensive coolers use a liquid in a radiator type of circulation; still, they need a fan to work.







, The duet of CPU-chipset dictates certain type of memory for the manufacturers who produce the motherboards.


Based on that duet the manufacturer of mother boards creates a range of options for the buyers to select and later expand their memory size.






Each motherboard has certain number of slots to add memory to the motherboard.






Hence, you need to buy a certain amount of memory RAM for your build.






Memory is better to buy in pairs (dual channel) and more expensive in triples (triple channel) and quadruples (quad channel).
The speed of the RAM (expressed in MHz, such as 1333 MHz) and its technology in terms of ddr, ddr2, and ddr3 are other factors for purchasing them.
Modern RAM is covered by a heat radiating cover.



, Many motherboards for handling simple jobs have an onboard graphics circuitry with a one connector or two to be attached to your monitors. For heavy works such as games and video editing this is not enough. Such users either do not buy mobos with onboard graphics or they have to extend their graphics capabilities using specialised graphics cards. In such cases, then you should consider the necessary extension bus(es) for attaching graphics card(s) daughter-boards. It is becoming usual to have two graphics cards in extreme gaming or even three of them. They need to be bridged together to act as one powerful graphics card (such as crossfire).


Modern multiple graphics cards are identical in status and need not to be separate master and slaves.






Very powerful graphics cards might need more space and fill the space of two ordinary cards.






Certain graphics cards have no fan to reduce their heat and are called ""silence."" Most of them have a fan or two that adds to the other noises of the computer.







, A larger motherboard can have more connection buses for later additional specialised daughterboards, such as the mentioned graphics cards.


Modern motherboard buses are PCI-e, in different sizes such as x16, x8 and x4 which is the smallest. Still there are one or more PCI for legacy cards, though these also gradually are disappearing. Modern boards do not support the older AGP buses used for older graphics cards.






Consider you like to add graphics cards, sound cards, TV-FreeView cards, Fiber-Optics networking cards and some other items later on your computer.







, Besides the extension buses, one looks to peripheral device connectors. These device could be keyboard, mouse, monitor, audio and network connections, and USB connections. Recently, SATA connection for external hard drives have been added to the array of modern mobo connections.


A motherboard has extra connections onboard to be used for connecting to the front and rear panels of the computer box (case) for additional features







, Almost all recently manufactured motherboards come with onboard audio and onboard networking capacity and you do not need to think about them, except that you want to enjoy extreme audio experiences and newly emerged optical fiber networking connection to the Computer. Such people should consider having enough buses on the motherboard for these extensions.

, A Computer box is called a ""case."" Desktop cases are not fashionable anymore due to space they take on your desk and lack of elegance.


If you want to build a media box for entertainment and put it next to your TV, you should select from a range of specialised size, stylish media boxes.







, In selecting the case consider number of ""bays"" for open and hidden devices that come in 3.5"" and 5.25"" form factors, and front panel connectors for USB, audio, and recently external SATA; also ease of opening of the cover and number of fans and ease of ventilation.

, It is prudent that you decide for the power supply unit or PSU of your computer. Depending on your budget, go to the quietest PSU. Many intermittent faults of a computer are attributed to low power low quality PSU. A modern computer should not have a PSU with less than 500 watts of power. There are on-line sites that calculate your necessary power. Multiply their number by a factor of 1.5 to 2.


Do not compromise for the budget of your power supply or your expensive computer and data that you have in it might be end up into the bin, all charred.







, Your operating system becomes installed on a hard disk drive (HDD). Buy an internal hard disk with a minimum capacity of 320 GB and 3.5"" form factor. Cache of an HDD is important in speed of your work. A larger cache makes a HDD more expensive. Almost all the HDD brands have the same quality. Recently, solid state drives (SSD) have solved the problems of noise and heat that HDDs cause, though still expensive.

, You'll be able to read and write optical media. An internal dual layer DVD r/w is the minimum to buy, and is very cheap.

,, Most people use a Windows operating system. If you get an Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM) version it is cheaper. An OEM marries with your motherboard and cannot be transferred to any other motherboard you might decide to buy in future to replace your present one. A so-called, retail version (or RTM: Released To Marketing) is more expensive but you can decommission it on one motherboard and put it on another motherboard. You might like to be adventurous and use the very powerful, but free, Linux operating system or free Solaric operating system.

,


If you get these things from the same shop, the vendor is obliged to give necessary advice, replace defected items and compensate for small bits and pieces.







, These are more adventurous but sometimes so cheap that it is well worth the risks.

Certain kinds of math are very important to geeks.",How to Be a Computer Geek," Hardware is the physical stuff that makes up the computer and the media that is used to connect computers to other computers.;
, Software is the stuff that makes the computer work and it includes the applications, protocols, and the operating system.

, There are some programs one can use in order to learn the specific specs a computer has, if you do not know off-hand. E.g. CPU-Z.

, Learning to use your computer's command line (MS DOS Prompt/Command Prompt in Windows, Terminal or Konsole in Linux) is essential to at least boosting your efficiency on your computer. In Windows, the DOS prompt isn't especially useful, but it's a good idea to know how to use it. However, in Linux or UNIX, Mac or BSD, or other Unix-like operating systems, it is important to be able to use the command line so that you can work more efficiently via bash scripts.

, This isn't especially important, but this will definitely boost your efficiency at the computer, and make yourself look more sensible.

, If someone does something on a computer that you would like to know, ask them about it.

, This is one of the most important things to do. Don't confuse certain types of languages with others. Interpreted languages like BASIC aren't very good for true computer programming, but if all you want to do is write a simple computer game, it's fine. HTML or CSS are for web pages, and it's a good idea to know them, but they won't be especially useful for really programming your computer. It is recommended that you learn the scripting language of your prompt (e.g. Bash) as that will bring power and simplicity for a novice programmer and admin. However, you may learn any language you like.

, This can help you out a lot if your or someone else's computer breaks down, which will also increase your reputation as a computer geek. You may learn the advanced methods, but that may require lessons from an actual computer geek.

, By interacting with other PC users, you may find that they know things that you don't and vice versa. However as a computer geek wannabe, you'll want to know more about computer than your friends, at any given time.

, Not only will you build a name for yourself, but it is good practice and can help you learn about situations and problems you have not encountered before.

, This will come in handy when you re-install your Operating System.

,, Of course, you should know how to use it!

, Most computer geeks will use an open OS such as *BSD or Linux, because it is (usually) free and allows them to do geeky stuff such as programming, running servers and using a command line interface (CLI).

, It is important to know shortcuts as it shaves off valuable seconds of your precious time.

,, Skip overwhelming or overly-complicated ideas. Instead, focus on learning the knowledge and skills you may need to accomplish a big idea in the future.

, Computer geeks aren't too smart to learn something new about computers. True computer geeks are always learning, and when they don't understand, always asking for help. Collect knowledge. Put things together. Read articles on Wikipedia, join computer forums for your programming language or just regular forums, and ask questions. If you have trouble learning, write things down and quiz yourself. Whatever your methods, be sure to be continuously learning more about computers.

, One bit of data is a binary digit - a one or a zero. Eight bits make a byte. Learn how many bytes are in a kilobyte (KB), megabyte (MB), gigabyte (GB) and so on. While most people think that there are 1024 megabytes in a gigabyte, there actually aren't. There are exactly 1000 megabytes in a gigabyte. The things that most people are speaking about are gigabytes and megabytes. Do some research on the topic of data storage. Once you have that down, get comfortable with binary. From there, learn to use octal and hexadecimal, and how to convert from one base to another. When you understand why programmers always get Christmas and Halloween mixed up, you're well on your way to becoming a true geek.

After finding a place near your desk to put the tower, you will need to connect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse, as well as plug the tower into a power source.


These are the only things required to be connected to the computer in order to use it. You can add more peripherals and accessories later.
If you are using a new laptop, you will have significantly less to set up. Plug your laptop into a power source to ensure that it is charged, and then power it on to begin.;
, If you are using the computer for the first time, you will likely be asked to create a user account when you turn it on. This account will hold all of your documents, pictures, downloaded files, and any other files that you create.


If your computer is in a public setting, you should create a strong password to protect your personal information. This is highly recommended, even if your computer is a home computer.
This guide will show you how to create a new user account in Windows 7
This guide will show you how to make a new user account in Windows 8

, The desktop is the main work area of your computer, and will likely be the most visited area of your computer. Your desktop appears every time you log into your account, and contains icons and shortcuts to your most used programs and files. The desktop will look and function differently depending on which operating system you use.


Windows operating systems (except Windows 8) are characterized by the Start menu in the lower-left corner of the desktop. The Start menu allows you to quickly access your installed programs and settings.
Windows 8 has replaced the Start menu with the Start screen. It functions much the same way, but is fundamentally different in the way it displays information.
OS X allows you to use multiple desktops to keep things organized and under control. See this guide for details on how to take advantage of multiple desktops.

, The mouse and keyboard are your primary means of interacting with your computer. Take some time to get familiar with how they work and how you can interact with your operating system and programs.



Learn how to use a mouse to navigate. Your mouse allows for pinpoint navigation and control, and is necessary for a wide variety of activities. Getting familiar with how to use the mouse will go a long way towards making you a more proficient computer user.

Practice some keyboard shortcuts to improve your work flow. Keyboard shortcuts are combinations of keyboard keys that perform a function in the program or operating system you are using. For example, in most programs that allow saving files, pressing Ctrl+S (⌘ Cmd+S on a Mac) will automatically save your current file.

, Even if you built your computer yourself, there will be some preinstalled applications and utilities that you can use without having to install anything additional. If you are using Windows, click the Start menu and browse through your available programs. If you are using a Mac, check your Dock and Applications folder.

, Installing software is a very common task on a computer, no matter what kind of computer you are using. The process is usually very straightforward, as most installers give clear instructions for each step.



Installing Microsoft Office is a good place to start if you are using a Windows computer. Having access to a word processor is invaluable, and is one of the main purposes of many people's computers. Many Windows computers come with a trial version of Office already installed.

Installing software on a Mac is a little bit different than installing on a Windows PC. This is mainly due to the underlying structure of the Mac operating system. Many Mac users find installing and managing programs much easier on OS X instead of Windows.

, You can use your mouse or keyboard shortcuts to select files on your computer and text on documents and website. Click and drag the mouse across the text you want to select, or press Ctrl+A (PC) or ⌘ Cmd+A (Mac) to select everything in your current location. Once you've selected files or text, there are several different actions you can take.

, Copying and pasting is one of the most common actions taken when selecting text or files. ""Copying"" a file or text leaves the original intact, while creating a copy on your computer's clipboard. You can then ""Paste"" the file or text elsewhere.


For PC, copy by pressing Ctrl+C and paste by pressing Ctrl+V. You can also copy and paste by right-clicking on the selection with your mouse and selecting the appropriate option from the menu.
For Mac, Copy by pressing ⌘ Cmd+C and paste by pressing ⌘ Cmd+V. You can also copy and paste by right-clicking on the selection with your mouse and selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

, Many programs such as word processors, photo editors, and more allow you to create and save documents and files. When working on a computer, it is wise to save often. You never know when the power might go out, costing you hours of unsaved work. Get in the habit of saving often, and if you are making major revisions to a file it might be wise to create a new copy. You can quickly save your work in most programs that allow saving by pressing Ctrl+S (PC) or ⌘ Cmd+S (Mac).


If you have a lot of important files on your computer, consider setting up a backup system. This will ensure that you have at least one extra copy of all your important files should something happen to your computer. Windows and Mac OS X both have backup systems built into the operating system.

, As you use your computer more and more, your personal collection of documents, media, and files may start to get a bit out of control. Take some time and organize your personal folders. You can create new folders to help create a directory of easily-accessible information.

, In order to connect to the internet, your computer will need to have access to an internet connection. This may come in the form of a wireless network, or you may need to connect your computer directly to your network's router or modem. All of this depends on how the network at your location is configured, and the capabilities of your computer.



Connect your computer to a wireless (Wi-Fi) network. If your home, office, or school has a wireless network set up, you can use your computer to connect to it. Most laptops can connect to a wireless network without any fuss, while some desktops will need to have a wireless network card installed.

A wired network connection can be faster and more stable. If your computer is physically close to your internet access point (router or modem), you might want to consider using an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to the network. This is much more viable with a desktop, since they are typically immobile. A wired connection will not experience interference like wireless network might, and transmission speeds are much faster.

, The web browser is the software that allows you to view webpages, watch online videos, download files, and do essentially everything else internet-related. All computers come with a browser installed by default (Internet Explorer on Windows, Safari on Mac, and Firefox on Linux), but there are several popular alternative options.



Google Chrome is one of the most popular alternative browsers available, and allows you to connect and sync with your Google account. Chrome is available for free from Google.

Firefox is another very popular free browser. It is very customizable and contains a lot of powerful security options.

, Before exploring the internet, it would be wise to install an antivirus program. These programs protect your computer from viruses and other malicious software, and are practically required when connecting to the internet. Most computers come with trial antivirus software installed, but there are plenty of powerful free alternatives.

, There is a lot of bad stuff on the internet, so be sure to stay safe while browsing. This means avoiding giving out personal information, only downloading from trusted sources, and steering clear of viruses, scams, and other illegal and dangerous activity.

, Emailing is one of the most common forms of communication these days, and knowing how to send an email is now an essential computer skill. You can set up a free email account with a variety of different services, and can be composing an email in just a few minutes.

, The internet is chock full of different types of files that you can download to your computer. Popular types of files include images, music, and programs. There are thousands of places to find files to download, and a variety of different ways to do so.

, If you're setting up a home office or are planning on using your computer for school, you're probably going to want to print sooner rather than later. Installing a printer on modern computers is incredibly straight forward; simply plug the computer in via USB to one of the available USB ports on the computer. The operating system will do the rest.

, Networks allow multiple computers to interact with each other and share the same internet connection. Connecting all of your computers and devices can give you quick access to files across devices, allow anyone on the network to print on the shared printer, play games together, and much more. Setting up a network requires a router or network switch. This is a piece of hardware that all the devices will connect to, either via Ethernet or wirelessly.

, A webcam lets you video chat with friends and family around the globe through programs like Skype and Google+. Like most other computer peripherals, webcams generally install themselves as soon as you plug it in. Most webcams connect via USB, though many laptops have a webcam built-in.

, While virtually all laptop computers have speakers built-in, desktop computers generally need external speakers or headphones in order for you to hear sound. Most computers have speaker connectors built-in that can be accessed on the back of the tower. Computer speakers are generally color-coded, so simply match the colored speaker plugs to the correct port.

, If your computer is located close to your TV, or you have a laptop that you can set nearby, you can turn your computer into a home theater machine by displaying the image on your TV. With the right cables, you can play your sound through your TV speakers or home theater system.

, Like anything electronic, your computer will occasionally encounter problems. Knowing some basic troubleshooting tips can help save you a lot of time and potentially money. You don't have to be an expert, but knowing what to try first can be very beneficial.


The first thing you should try whenever you are encountering a problem is resetting your computer. Believe it or not, this will resolve a large number of issues you are having with a program or function.
If you are having connectivity problems when browsing the internet, resetting your connection may fix your problem.

, Viruses are destructive and invasive files that can pose a serious threat to your information and files. Viruses can slow a computer to a crawl, or cause you to lose everything you have stored. Most viruses can be avoided by practicing smart internet behavior.


Besides viruses, adware and spyware can cause serious problems for your computer and your security. These are often installed alongside other programs, and can be very difficult to get rid of.

, As you add more and more programs to your computer, you'll find that there are some you use more than others. If you have old programs installed that you no longer use, they're taking space on your computer that could be used for other things. Certain programs may be running in the background as well, even if you're not using them, which can significantly impact your computer's performance. Regularly uninstalling programs you no longer use is a good way to maintain your computer's health.



Uninstall programs on a Mac.

Uninstall programs in Windows.

, Sometimes, when nothing else seems to fix your problems, reinstalling the operating system may be the only solution. Installing the operating system is less daunting than it sounds, and can provide a big performance boost. What puts most people off is the thought of saving all of their old files and reinstalling programs. If you've been backing up your files regularly, the first complaint isn't a problem. As for reinstalling your programs, you might find that you use a lot less than you thought you did.



Reinstall Windows 7.

Reinstall Windows 8.

Reinstall OS X.

Install Linux.

, Heat is your computer's worst enemy, and as it gathers dust it will start building up more heat. You can keep your computer running cool by regularly cleaning out the inside of the case with compressed air and a vacuum. Try to clean your computer at least two times a year, more if you have pets or are a smoker.

, Sometimes your hardware will fail, or simply won't be up to the task you want. In cases like these, upgrading your desktop may save you from having to buy a new computer. Most desktop PCs can be heavily upgraded, allowing you to install new drives and more memory, as well as increase the processing and video power.


If you have a laptop, you may be able to upgrade the hard drive or install more memory. Most laptops don't offer upgrades beyond that.

It will also be helpful to observe who they are being mean to, if it is more than one person. What do these people have in common that make your friends target them?
You can take mental notes of your observations, and just store them in your memory, or you can write them down in a private journal. Hide the journal well, though, so it doesn't make things worse if it's ever found.;
, Your friends might be mean all the time, or they might only be mean in certain circumstances. What are the trends?


Are they only mean to people who belong to a certain group (e.g. racial, ethnic, religious, et cetera)?
Are they mean on certain days? What might be going on that this behavior only comes about on particular days? (For example, maybe it is always after a visit with a parent, if their parents are divorced.)
Are they only mean when they are around a certain person or a certain other group of people (i.e. is that person or group influencing them)?
Is it only one friend who is being mean and is getting others involved? Are a few friends all participating equally?
Are they making mean comments to you or to others? Are they being somewhat physical in their meanness, like shoving, pushing, tripping, or something else? Are they threatening you or others?
Is their behavior typical of bullying, or is it something more?

, If you are the only person to whom your friends are being mean, try to figure out if they are bullying you. Use the questions below to help you determine if you accidentally did something that caused your friends to get mad at you or if your friends' meanness toward you is completely unprovoked and unnecessary:


Did you say something that offended someone?
Did you cancel plans with a friend for no reason or hang out with another friend instead?
Could the meanness stem from jealousy of another friendship or relationship that you have?
Have you been mean to them recently, by taking out your anger on them or being judgmental of them?
Is there a past argument or disagreement with them that has not been settled?
Is there something about you that they perceive as bad or a sign of weakness (regardless of whether it is)?

, While you try to figure out what is going on, it is best to avoid retaliating to your friends if they are mean to you. Being mean to them will only add fuel to the fire and make it harder for you to resolve the issue.


You might consider distancing yourself from them for a couple of days to give all of you space and time to cool down.
You could simply ignore the comments they make or things they do.
Practice being nice to them in the face of their meanness. Treat them the way you would like them to treat you.It is best to not talk to other friends about their treatment of you, because that could start rumors and gossip, which very well may worsen the situation.

, Once you have observed your friends' behavior and its trends, it is time to start thinking about how you are going to approach them about the issue. You will want to take care to be calm, rational, and supportive.


It is important to confront your friends about this. You do not want to avoid them, because this will not be effective in solving your problem.If it is multiple friends, decide whether you want to talk to them one-on-one or all together. If you talk to your friends separately, there is a good chance that the first person might tell the others what is going on. This could be a good or bad thing, depending on the dynamic of your friendship. Keep this in mind as you are choosing which option to do.
Pick a method for staying calm, if the conversation starts to get heated. For example, you could take a few deep breaths, count to 10, or politely end the conversation for now with a promise to resume it later.
Have a back-up plan to go to a trusted adult if the conversation does not go as well as you hope. Consider going to a parent, guardian, teacher, or guidance counselor to seek his/her help with the issue.

, It takes a lot of courage to stand up for yourself in this way, and you want them to take you seriously and understand that they are hurting your feelings.Come up with a script or talking points of what you want to say.


“I want to talk to you about how you've been making me feel lately.”
“You might not realize it, but you've said many things lately that have hurt my feelings. Sometimes you say these things to me, and other times, you say them about me to other people.”
“When you said (_________________), it made me feel that you don't want to be my friend anymore.”
“Is there anything going on that you'd like to talk about? I know you've mentioned that things have been a little tough at home lately. I want to support you.”
“I really want to come to an understanding about this with you so that we can continue to be great friends.”
“I need you to respect my feelings, because this bothers me, and I otherwise really enjoy being friends with you.”

, If you decided to talk to your friends all at once, this might be easiest to do at school or at a time when all of you are hanging out. On the other hand, if you decided to talk to your friends one-on-one, work out when you will do that.

, Be sure to follow through with the conversation on that day, because you need to resolve the issue with your friends.


Show confidence by maintaining eye contact, having a conversation with them (instead of yelling at them), and giving them the opportunity to share their point of view.
Have your script or talking points on paper with you so that you remember everything that you want to say.
Avoid being mean or rude during the conversation. Again, this will only trigger negative reactions from your friends, which will not help you get to a resolution.

, There is the possibility that they have been mean to you because of something you said or did. Be open to listening to what they have to say.


Do not interrupt them while they talk. This is rude and shows them that you think you did not do anything wrong, when in their minds, you might have.
Listen actively. When they are done talking, paraphrase what you heard them say: “I heard you say that...”
Be compassionate. If there is an issue that is bothering them, but it has nothing to do with you, then support them by listening carefully and offering to help.

, These negative conditions are not conducive to coming to a resolution.


“This is starting to turn into an argument, and I don't want to argue with you. Why don't we try discussing this again in a few days, when we've cooled off?”
“I can sense that this is turning into a bigger conflict. I don't want to make the situation any worse, so I'm going to go ahead and end our conversation here for now.”
“I appreciate that you've taken the time to listen and talk with me, but our conversation is becoming really negative. Let's take a break.”

, Once you and your friends have shared your perspectives on the issue, work together to brainstorm how you all can move forward positively.


Be sure to offer your own ideas. Do not put the burden of fixing the problem all on them.
Think of ideas that will really be useful. Will you all promise to tell each other immediately when someone says something offensive or rude? Will you all promise to be understanding if someone gets snappy during a hard time in his/her life?
Also be open to giving support if your friends' meanness has been the result of something going on that is unrelated to you. If there are issues at home, with another friend, or with a class, for example, offer ideas for supporting them through resolving that issue.

, It is incredibly important to sincerely apologize, if you really value their friendship and want to maintain it.


This can be challenging if it turns out they are upset with you over something that you feel you were “in the right” to do or say. If this is the case, you may have to come to a middle ground with them through discussion.
Make sure you give your apology genuinely. Your friends likely know you well enough to know when you are lying, so do not do them the disservice of lying in your apology.

, Show your friends that you value them by helping to make sure this issue does not arise again. If you do not follow through, then your friends receive the message that you do not care about them.

, If your friends continued to be mean to you during the conversation and showed no interest in resolving the issue, then it is time to implement your back-up plan of going to a trusted adult.Share as much as you feel comfortable with sharing about the situation so the adult can have a thorough understanding of what has been going on.
Be open to his/her ideas and suggestions about how to handle the situation. Especially if it is a guidance counselor or teacher, he/she is likely trained in resolving these kinds of issues.

, Again, if the conversation did not result in any positive outcomes, and your friends scoffed at you and showed no interest in repairing the friendship, then it might be time to consider distancing yourself from them.


Find new friends who truly care about you and value your friendship.Make plans with them instead of with your old friends. You can choose to explain to them what has been going on or not, but it will be helpful to have a support system.
Be friendly toward them to try to keep the relationship amicable, but do not make spending time with them a priority.
Do not make excuses for their behavior when it is unwarranted. If your friends are truly just being mean to you because they can be, then you need to let those relationships go."

Unfortunately, since that is the fetal position, you'll have to make a few changes to be able to do anything. Sit up to free your arms for work. Since doing this puts weight on your back, straighten out so that the weight not supported by the back of the chair transfers neatly down your spine without strain on the back muscles and connective tissues. And balance your arms and legs so that they don't pull on your back or put stress on the more delicate extremities. This will free your full attention for work.


Use what you have. You might not have a particular kind of equipment, your equipment might not have a particular adjustment, or a particular adjustment might be incompatible with your work (perhaps you're a receptionist required to sit erect). Go through all these steps and get as close as you can to the suggestions outlined here. Adjustments to one part of your setup can often mitigate deficient adjustments to others. Then consider where money might well be spent on additional equipment to fix remaining problems.;
, Look for:

Surface:






Vinylor similar smooth plastic requires little care. (""Bonded leather"" is essentially vinyl, not leather: don't pay extra for it.)
Leatheris stylish and also tends to stay clean. ""Full grain"" leather is best; ""top grain"" is a middle grade; ""split grain"" is cheaper but can still be fine.
Cloth is grippy, breathable to prevent sweat accumulation, and can stay cleaner if treated with fabric protectant such as Scotchgardby the manufacturer or after purchase, preferably when brand new to protect as clean fabric as possible and not seal in dirt.
If you're buying used, you may prefer an impermeable surface such as vinyl, shiny leather in good condition, or wood or hard plastic (for which you'll need an exact fit) because it can easily be made about as clean as new. Natural materials often require more careful cleaning than synthetics.


Support: Mesh is a surface and a support. It allows air to circulate for coolness. But since each part is supported only by adjacent parts, it tends to sag like a hammock or waterbed, and ramp up toward a relatively immovable edge supports. Adjustments within the middle of large padded areas, such as for the lower back, and clever design of edges which the body will contact, such as a rolled-over or foam-padded seat front, can help. Foam supports better, lifting each small area discretely from underneath, like a mattress. Avoid thin, soft-when-new foam (or, with used furniture, foam with softened or compacted spots): it will rapidly ""bottom out"" under heavier areas.






Style: The chair should support the back and the shoulders. This style is often known as a ""manager's"" chair. Your neck should be straight so your head will balance itself and not need the headrest characteristic of an ""executive"" chair. While an executive chair can work, be sure to check that it has the full range of adjustments. Some are more ostentatious than practical.






Fit: There are many different kinds of chairs carefully designed many different ways. Most of them probably fit someone very well before the manufacturer decided to make many, many copies. More expensive ones often adjust more to fit more people in more positions. It's generally best to try out and buy a chair in person to make sure it can fit you, and well worth paying a reasonable premium for having the facility to try it and the salesperson to explain it. Sit in it at a desk as if typing, not just relaxing or hunching attentively forward. Look for one that fits well with each of its major adjustments somewhere in the middle of its range, not all the way at one end: you might decide you'd like your chair a little different later.






An old-fashioned highly adjustable wooden chair looks great, but make sure the contours fit you perfectly and the armrests (which are typically not adjustable) are at a proper height and will not interfere with keyboard placement. If they do, they'll support you just as well as a foam chair; your body would mesh to that shape. These chairs tend not to have upper-back support, though.






You can even Make a desk chair from a car seat.







, You may need to fine-tune some settings once the others are about right.


Adjust the back tilt. The further you recline, the more the weight of your torso rests on the chair back and the less it presses down on the backbone. Try 20 to 30 degrees back.This substantial tilt will also gently pull you back into the better-supported reclined position rather than letting you slump forward into a slouch after you lean forward out of, or to show, interest in something.Lock the back in place at the proper tilt.
If the back can't be locked, see if you can set the maximum amount of recline and reduce the tension so it readily flops into place.
If the amount of recline can't be adjusted (on some chairs it may lock at each end of a range, neither of which is desirable), adjust the tilt tension so that the chair tends to balance at the proper angle when you relax in it.
Reclining more would reduce the stress on your back even more, but would require odd placement and angles for the monitor, keyboard and other office equipment.


Adjust the seat tilt. The seat should be tilted back a little so that your hips are not extended unnaturally, and the angled downward force from your back doesn't tend to slide you out of the seat. Some chairs tilt the back and seat as a unit; others tilt the seat with the back, but not as much, through a more complicated mechanism often called ""synchro-tilt"". Some might allow tilting the seat separately. See which you prefer.
Adjust the back height. Chair backs often have a more protrusive part to go under the mid-back, and a hollower part for the shoulders. Adjust the back (or, on some chairs, different parts of the back) to put these in the right places.
Adjust the seat extension. Chair seats often have a hollower part to go under the upper thighs and a fatter part to go under the lower thighs. Slide the seat forward so that the lower thighs are well-supported, but not so far forward that there is pressure on the inside part of the knees or associated tendons. The tailbone should go all the way against the back of the chair.
Adjust the feet. The feet should be supported at a neutral angle (extended a little), and at a height such that the legs neither dangle and pull on the knees and themselves, nor push up the knees allowing the hips to twist forward and not support the lower back as well. There should be a moderate amount of pressure on the lower thighs.

The best way is an angled footrest. Some are adjustable.
Don't wear high-heeled shoes; if you must, prop the balls of the feet on something for a comfortable angle in them.


Adjust the arms. The armrests should be close to the body, so that the arms don't tend to slide out from supporting the shoulders. The armrests should be at a height just a little lower than that to which the arms would dangle naturally on their own, so as not to allow the arms to pull on the shoulders or push them up. The wide part of the forearm muscles, the central outside surface of the forearm bones, or both, should rest on the armrests. The forearms should balance in such a way that the wrists extend straight from them (as viewed from the back surface of the hand) to a point an inch or so over the keyboard, propped up gently by the natural relaxed curl in the fingers which are resting on rather than striking keys at any given time. This will balance the arms so there is no weight continually to be supported by the wrists, except a tiny amount supported by the fingers in their naturally curved positions, or hanging continually on the shoulders. Allow the upper part of the upper arms to rest against the chair back, in plane with the torso (but elbows out a little so the arm muscles can all move freely). The elbows can rest on the arm rests too, but much of the weight should be on the fat part of the forearms.

Broad, convex, padded armrests are best.
The armrests and their supports should not extend forward much lest they interfere with the keyboard drawer extension. The armrests normally extending forward from a post on some chairs can be reversed side to side to extend backwards. The then-backward-extending part is ignored, and the forward-extending part is just long enough to set the forearm muscles on. The armrest for the non-dominant arm may need to be a little higher because the muscle leaning on it may not be so large.
The distance from the armrests to the body is often nonadjustable. Avoid a chair that is very wide, unless you are too.
The wrists should not be supported directly, only by leverage from a well-balanced forearm and weakly by the relaxed and key-striking fingers. They have many tendons running across the inside surface that control the hand and wrist with muscles in the arm.They tend to bob outwards with use and are much more sensitive to tangential pressure than the arm muscles. Wrist pads can actually make them sore.
Don't support the palms directly, either. Without an unusual-shaped support, this would require bending the wrist, stressing the tendons running through it, and twisting it. This makes finger-control awkward, and makes it more difficult to hit further keys by slightly swinging the forearm. It also requires more key striking force to come from the weaker fingers than from the stronger wrist, hand and arm.


You don't need a headrest. The head and neck should be perfectly vertical so they tend to put all their weight neatly onto the bones, requiring only small weak muscle movements to maintain the position.

, An ""ergonomic"" style, curved outward and preferably raised at the center, is best, but takes a while to get used to. It keeps the wrists straight and at their relaxed state of rotation when the elbows are at the user's side or out just a little, so that the shoulders are supported, and the arms turned inward toward the center of the keyboard.


The keys should have a snappy feel for feedback when they are pressed. Don't push them so hard they ""hit bottom"" firmly; the shock is very wearing to the body. If you can't stop doing that, get a buckling-spring type keyboard like an IBM Model M, which can be tapped harder. Those are very loud, though.
Unless you spend much time entering numbers, look for the absence of a numeric keypad so that the mouse can be closer to the keyboard. If you can't get the keyboard style you like without one, try cutting the number pad off.
You might like to try a keyboard like the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. Microsoft keyboards and mice work well with most operating systems and programs, including free software.

, Make it close to flat (retract any rear props). Place it so the typing ""home keys"" are directly in front of you. They should be close to your body, and low enough that your forearms stay straight. Your wrists should be straight and fingers curving gently down onto the keys. That will probably require a keyboard drawer.


Remember not to rest your wrists on or in front of the keyboard, even if it has an extended area there.

, If you mostly type, the mouse is not very important. Ideally, it should be an optical mouse, which works more consistently than a ball-containing mouse, and on a cloth-covered neoprene mouse pad for smooth movement. If you're left-handed, get a left-handed or symmetrical mouse. Some users like trackballs, which require less wrist movement, but they're less precise and, because sensitivity thus can't feasibly be increased as much, slower. A mouse with buttons discrete from a fat rear part upon which the front part of the palm simply rests (namely, most mice aside from some Apple ones) allows the hand and arm to stay relaxed.


A mouse with a cord is lighter and easier to move than one without a cord. The cord will also keep it from falling off a small surface like a keyboard tray and getting lost. Secure the cord loosely to something near the mouse, leaving some slack, so the weight of most of the cord has no effect on moving the mouse.
Avoid some more-complicated keystrokes by using a mouse that has the full range of common buttons, including at least a left button, right button, and clickable scroll wheel. Five buttons are the most that is commonly used. A scroll wheel that clicks as it scrolls is less smooth but more precise and much better for games, in which each click performs a discrete act such as making a new selection.
A mouse with a heavy, free-scrollable, flywheel-like mouse sometimes marketed as ""hyper-fast"" scrolling reduces finger and wrist motion and increases speed of skimming large documents as one generally need only guide it to start and stop: it keeps itself moving. A heavy trackball works similarly in two dimensions, but at least generally is not available as a scrolling device on a mouse or configured to work in tandem with a mouse for fast scrolling. Some mice have integrated touchpads for scrolling that could work similarly, and in multiple directions, if configured for continuous scrolling at a rate controlled by a static touch.
Some trackballs and touch pads are integrated into keyboards. The best place for these devices is generally a spot on the keyboard easily reachable from the typing ""home"" position, such as in the plastic flange ""wrist-rest"" (use thumbs).

, It should be near the keyboard to reduce arm motion and the need to extend the arm to a less-than-optimal position.


If you're left-handed, consider switching the left and right buttons' function in the operating system.
Increase mouse sensitivity, preferably with acceleration, to reduce the total distance you need to move the mouse. Gentle wrist or even finger motion should be all that is needed.

, Try to keep them near and at the same level at the keyboard.

, The arms and tops of the hands, which contain tendons extending into the arms by which the fingers are controlled, should extend straight forward. The easiest way is with a keyboard ""tray"" or ""drawer"". It should be just about on your lap – the precise height will depend on your arms, their supports, and the keyboard itself.


A big wide tray is usually best because a mouse can go next to it and things will not tend to slide off, but sometimes interferes with armrests.
The elbows should be slightly outward so the hands need not themselves turn inward to reach the keys. This will mean the keyboard needs to be close to the stomach. Pull the tray out, and pull the chair up to it.
Some elegant old desks have central junk drawers with thin panels underneath that inhibit mounting keyboard trays. Adding a keyboard tray in the junk drawer area can make them much more practical. Don't mutilate the junk-drawer area and remove the box's contribution to the desk's structural integrity: just set the drawer aside and add a rail-mounted keyboard tray inside its old home. Find one whose hinged arm (and other components) are shallow enough and fold flat enough to slide into the drawer cavity when not in use. Mount the rail to the sturdy desktop with shortish screws that won't poke through, measuring for and drilling holes through non-critical areas of the junk-drawer area bottom panel to drive them. The rail must come far enough out along the bottom of the desktop to allow the hinged arm's carriage to swing out and down for use while fully secured. For the ultimate in style, mount the junk drawer's old front as a swing-down or swing-up cover for the stowed keyboard (a modification that may not be easily reversible, and beware of interference with legs or the keyboard tray).

, LCD monitors are pretty much universal now, and tend to cause less eyestrain than CRTs. Use digital connections such as DVI (no need for expensive cables; a major benefit of digital transmission is that a problem not large enough to turn ""zeros"" into ""ones"" has no effect whatsoever). Some monitors do not support digital connections; some video cards do not support digital connections or resolutions over 1920x1200, many do not support two monitors, and few support three. Getting these features is more a matter of looking for them than paying much of a premium, except perhaps for triple-head video cards.


If you have a CRT monitor, turn up the refresh rate (60 Hz or slower is badly noticeable as flicker; 70 Hz is better; 85 Hz or higher is good) and consider a glare filter. If you're choosing a CRT monitor, look for one that is vertically or entirely flat, so that its entire surface faces the same way (with respect to at least one axis) and by tilting slightly, can reflect glare from a given direction unnoticeably away from you.
The monitors should cover a wide enough area that you can have all of the documents you would work with at once open simultaneously, and showing enough data that you don't have to regularly click or scroll back and forth, wasting time and struggling to remember their contents.
Place multiple monitors side by side. The neck unbalances when tilted up and down, and the eyes do not move very far up and down on their own, so there is little to gain from stacking monitors.
Bezels can be distracting, particularly between multiple monitors. Choose a monitor with a narrow, unobtrusive, non-glare bezel, preferably matte black or gray. Huge monitors are more expensive per unit area than medium size ones, though. One or more 2560x1600 30 inch (76cm) monitors are great, but 1920x1200 24 inch (61cm) monitors would be a better bargain for most.
The higher the resolution, the better (generally). If text is too small, you can scale it up to be bigger but very sharp.
Covering an area wider than your forward field of view with monitors brings diminishing returns.
Avoid glossy monitors. They look better when turned off, but not much different when turned on, and create glare by reflecting bright lights behind the monitor.

,


Place them toward the back of the desk to reduce too-close focusing. This will reduce eyestrain and possibly nearsightedness.
The most-used monitor should be directly in front of you to facilitate keeping the body straight. Others should be on one or both sides.

Identify the most-used monitor to the operating system as the primary monitor so items such as program menus can be placed on it automatically. If your monitors are different sizes, use the biggest one.


With your head straight, raise the monitors so their centers, height-wise, are roughly directly in front of your eyes or even a little above. This will prompt you not to slump.
Tilt them so that they are perpendicular in both axes (i.e., normal) to your field of view. Multiple monitors should be in an arc, with their centers equidistant from your head. This keeps as much of them in focus at once as possible; your eyes won't have to refocus as you glance around.
Match monitor illumination to ambient light. Don't work in the dark. Keep ambient light as diffused as possible and adjust its intensity to keep white objects in the room not much dimmer than white areas on the monitor – which is pretty bright. You can also adjust the monitor brightness, but with most monitors you will likely prefer to have that turned down most of the way. Match the white balance on the monitor roughly to the ambient light, generally with a setting on the monitor or in the operating system.

, Just as it's easiest to switch attention between computer documents by having them near one another across a wide monitor area, it's easiest to switch attention between paper documents and a computer by keeping the paper documents near the computer and a similar distance from your eyes. Prop a paper document up on a stand next to the computer if you'll just read from it, or on a sturdy stand in front of and tilted up toward the monitor if you'll write on it too. Make sure the stand can't bump or scrape the screen.

,


Temperature. Keep warm. Cold numbs, stiffens and slows the fingers. Excessive heat or cold numbs, stiffens and slows the mind. 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius) is best for most people. If the office is too cold, wear something that is warm and, particularly around the wrists, loose-fitting. If it is too warm, wear thin, loose clothing, and cool off with a quiet fan, or preferably a natural breeze.






Heat doesn't flow well from the heat-producing, contiguous, insulated body core to the fingers when one is just sitting at a desk, so insulating yourself with heavy clothes to conserve enough heat to keep the fingers supple in a cold environment may overheat your core (and head) a little and make you sleepy. A sufficiently warm environment makes this trade-off unnecessary.
Feet don't usually need to do much at the computer, but can distract you relentlessly if they get cold. You can heat them selectively with a heated footrest, or with a heater under the desk – preferably the forced-air type so it can't set fire by radiation, and with all modern safety features – which will consume much more energy and heat the legs and torso significantly too.



Air quality. Keep it clean. Perhaps scented if you're good with aromatherapy.






Stenches, excessive dust, or other pollution will be distracting, and will have to be dealt with according to individual circumstances.

Carbon dioxide can build up in densely populated areas and cause lethargy and a distracting general sense of ""stale air"". Houses generally leak in more than enough fresh air for their limited number of occupants, but one can use a carbon dioxide meter to adjust ventilation equipment for adequate air replacement in a big building. (Too rapid air replacement wastes heating energy in winter and cooling energy in summer.)
Too-low humidity commonly causes dry skin and sinuses in winter. Correct it with a portable or automatic permanently-installed humidifier. Too-high humidity can, most often in summer, cause mold, leading to bad smells and illness. Air conditioning will generally correct excessive humidity: it chills the air and the condensate is drained away or evaporated outdoors. (A dehumidifier is essentially an air conditioner whose warm coils are indoors too; it's generally better to use an air conditioner and keep the cooling.)
Pleasant aromas can improve mood and attentiveness. For instance, citrus may increase alertness, flowers may calm and improve concentration, and forest scent may relax. You can tend to become acclimated to and not notice scents after a while. It's therefore a good idea to alternate them with scent generators on timers: buy an integrated unit, or simply plug an electric vaporizer into a timer.



Lighting. Darkness probably makes you sleepy. It strains your eyes to focus precisely, and your mind as, having shallow depth-of-field from dilation, a lag for focusing precedes seeing much when you shift your field of view. It may come as no surprise that dark winters can even depress you..






Bright, even light is best. Aim for at least two 27-watt-plus compact fluorescent light bulbs (or four-foot fluorescent tubes) to light a small room; four for for a big one.

Incandescent bulbs require wasteful or even dangerously-hot-running wattages for this kind of light. And the color temperature is wrong.
Fluorescent troffers with diffusers, shop-lights inverted atop shelves to reflect off the ceiling, or multi-bulb torchieres are best.
You may prefer the look of a table lamp, but high-wattage compact-style fluorescent bulbs are hard to fit in them. Use a plain white synthetic fabric, namely, largely translucent, shade to diffuse the light while blocking as little as possible. A Sylvania 65W Dulux-EL bulb is particularly small for a high-wattage bulb and a 12 inch (30cm) lamp harp can be bent wider (at the top and back again at the bottom) to fit around it.
Even relatively diffuse light has ""hot spots"", typically the fixtures themselves or the ceiling spots above them, specular reflections (glare) from which can distract. A dark, matte desk surface is best. If yours is light or shiny, try a plastic desk pad. Look for one with a soft-looking, leather-like surface, not just a texture in a shiny surface. A visor or baseball cap keeps overhead light out of the field of view from entering the eyes directly or off the cheeks to produce subtly distracting and tiring veiling flare.Fluorescent lights should have ""electronic"" ballasts which flicker unnoticeably thousands of times per second, not ""magnetic"" ballasts that flicker noticeably, especially in peripheral vision, or at least annoy subconsciously. Cheap compact fluorescent bulbs and fluorescent fixtures often have the magnetic type.


Color temperature (tint).Incandescent and ""warm white"" fluorescent bulbs (2800-3400 K color temperature) are orange, like early-morning and late-evening light. ""Daylight"" (5000-6500K) bulbs are blue-white, like noon sun and skylight. ""Bright white"" or ""cool white"" (4000 K) bulbs are in-between, common in kitchens and commercial buildings. Daylight bulbs look distinctly blue next to the other kinds, but you'll probably get used to them over time. And, because the tint suggests to the body that the time is mid-day, they increase alertness.Bright white provides a partial benefit.
Balance brightness and color temperature. Bright light and blue-white high color temperature are best, but they need to go together.Just as a blue sunset rather than an orange one would make the world look very strange, a daylight-type bulb's blue-white light looks odd if there isn't very much of it. Conversely, intense warm-white light looks dingy. If you find bright light distracting, or don't have enough light fixtures for the intensity needed to make daylight bulbs' light look right, use bright-white.
Eventually you'll need sleep, even if only a little. Constant bright, blue-white light can make you lose track of time and extend your energy past your bedtime and past your intelligence. You may not want too much of it at home. Notice the light outside if possible and glance at the clock occasionally to leave work on time and leave your home computer at a reasonable time.

You could put a daylight bulb on a timer to turn off on a schedule leaving a dimmer, yellower bulb behind as a gentle reminder to finish each day. There are even programs available, such as Redshift, that will automatically adjust your monitor color balance to mimic nature as the hours go by.Sound. Quiet is usually best. White noise is better than distinct, distracting sounds.






Reduce noise, including computer noises, as much as possible. For example, computers make much more noise when they are hot inside, which could indicate a build-up of dust. Also, a higher-quality fan will reduce whirring noises.

Keep noisy office equipment above or below you, shielded by furniture, and with noise-emitting orifices directed away if you can't move it elsewhere entirely. But don't block its vents. High-speed printers can sometimes be set to run a little slower and much quieter.


Earplugs or noise-blocking or canceling headphones can calm excess noise. A white-noise generator can mask more-distracting noise, but keep it near you so its volume can stay low and contribute little to the overall noise level for everyone.
Fast, cheerful music (try Internet radio) can help keep your mind semi-occupied rather than frustrated and pace you through simple, repetitive tasks requiring little concentration. But don't distract others: consider headphones.



Shift and stretch. Even with the best workspace, you'll be more comfortable if you shift about in your chair occasionally. Stretch or walk every couple of hours to relieve and redistribute pressure, stress and strain, and see and hear a few new things. Maybe even humans.

Establish trust in the relationship.,
Talk to one another.,
Work to keep your romance alive.,
Be yourself around each other.,
Be open about sexual preferences and feelings.,
Keep checking in with each other about your open status.",How to Create Intimacy in an Open Relationship," Trust and openness go hand-in-hand. Once trust is broken, it is gone forever. There will always be doubt about fidelity and truthfulness once the trust has been broken. Treat trust as inviolate (something that will not be breached under any circumstance), then your relationship will be built upon the strongest of foundations.;
, Keep your communication open; it will ensure that you're on the same page. At the same time, you can hear his/her problems, and offer support. It will help you feel closer to one another.


Decide on a set of guidelines for openness about who you're seeing. Some couples want to know about each outside partner, and others prefer not to be ""in the loop."" Make sure you agree on your rules and continue open communication within those parameters. Check in often and honestly about whether the open relationship situation is still working for both of you.

, Go on romantic dates. Make sure you make time for each other, not just your other partners. Enjoy shared interests together.



Compliment each other. Positive words will make you both feel appreciated and positive.

Flirt to build the excitement and anticipation. Flirting, even in an established relationship, creates positive energy and ups the ante on intimacy.

, In any relationship, you should be comfortable and open with one another. Being genuine and open will help build your relationship and lead to increased intimacy.

, Not many couples talk about this critical aspect of the relationship, much less down in a serious conversation about sex, unless it is about somebody else. As partners, make sure to keep the passion alive. This validates one aspect of the relationship.


It is important to be open about your sexual intimacy with other partners if you are to have a truly open relationship. Openness is critical to properly protecting yourself and your partner from a health catastrophe brought on by sexually transmitted diseases.

, As people grow and relationship dynamics change, so can preferences for your relationship status. You can't maintain true intimacy in the relationship if you're not honest about your feelings. Make sure you reevaluate your situation on a regular basis - both for yourself and in conversation with your partner. Ensure sure you're still both on the same page, and be honest with yourself and your partner if you start to feel that openness isn't making you happy anymore.


Nothing is ever set in stone, and people do change. However, if you aren't feeling happy with your relationship dynamic anymore, you owe it to your partner to be open about that, rather than holding them accountable for complying with changing preferences that they don't know about yet. If your feelings have changed, you may need to break up, or your partner may be open to making your relationship exclusive - but you'll never know if you don't bring it up, and hiding your preferences will only set back your intimacy, and bring more upset upon both of you in the long run.

Tell the person that you care.,
Avoid false cheerfulness.,
Be sensitive to the situation.,
Open the door for them to do the talking.,
Offer to follow up.",How to Console Someone1," There’s no “right” thing to say when someone is in emotional pain – especially when there is a perfectly reasonable reason for their suffering. Choose your words, your voice, and your manners in terms of what will convey that you care. At the simplest level, this requires that you act as normally as possible. Further, only say things that are sympathetic, non-judgmental, patient, and accepting. These will often be simple, open-ended statement that will encourage the other person to open up.


Another possible thing to say is, “I’m so sorry about ______.” Don’t be worried about mentioning something painful; if they are upset, they are already thinking about it.
Say things like, “It’s perfectly alright to cry.”;
, There will come a time for lighthearted jokes and hopeful statements. When someone is feeling deeply distressed or is experiencing intense sorrow, any cheeriness may ring hollow. Worse, anything that comes across as insincere may be seem to belittle the gravity of what they are feeling. Respect how the person is feeling by taking care not to disregard their current emotions.Avoid statements like, “Look on the bright side,” or otherwise trying to put a positive spin on something that is obviously giving someone immense pain.
In sum, don’t say anything with the sole intention of “cheering someone up.” Instead, allow someone in emotional distress to release any feelings of despair or anger, not repress them.
Focus on conveying the fact that you are simply there for them with statements like, “You’re not alone in this. I’m right here with you.”

, Depending on why someone is upset, you need to avoid saying things that but may come across as insensitive. For instance, never say anything along the lines of “It was God’s will.” Such a statement does absolutely nothing to address how a person is feeling.Whenever unsure, make sure that what you’re saying does not minimize or invalidate the suffering that another person is going through.
Sometimes, even statements that are “true,” must be avoided. For instance, you do not want to tell a mother who just miscarried that she could have another child. While this may be accurate, it ignores her current suffering regarding the loss of her pregnancy.

, At some point, they should talk about how they’re feeling. You may even have to guide them to do so. Say something like, “I know it may hurt to talk about, but you should feel free to talk to me about______, now or whenever you want to.” Feel free to do this at any point after they’ve calmed down – even some time after a traumatic incident.Avoid equating your own experiences to what someone else is going through. Don’t say “I know how you feel,” even if you have had a similar experience.Instead, say things like, “I know how much ____ meant to you.""
Be honest when you're at a loss for words by saying something along the lines of “I don’t know you’re feeling, but I care about you and I want to help.”
You can also say “I don’t know what to say, but I’m here for you, and I’m always willing to listen.”

, Often, people will receive a lot of emotional support immediately following a traumatic incident. Unfortunately, this support will often wane. Indicate that your support will be ongoing by saying something along the lines of, “Hey, can I call you back in a few weeks to see how you’re doing?”Do not be concerned that you’re bringing up something that someone may not want to talk about. If they don’t want to, they’ll say that. But chances are, they need to. Either way, the knowledge of your continued support will be a source of comfort.

What helps is looking at the bigger picture. So often we become enveloped in sadness of the news or the way we'll feel lonely that looking at the bigger picture doesn't seem like an option, you can have a relative or third party friend help you see the bigger picture.;
, You within yourself are your own priority. You are still whole and your loved one is doing this for the betterment of the family and/or person himself/herself. All you can do at this point is surround yourself with love and positive encouragement and keep living your life as you would any other day just know that your main focus will have to be put on yourself and what you do in life.

, You've never been the kind of person to sit around and wait so what you can do is quite simple, plan ahead and be aware of all the possibilities but don't become overwhelmed by them. Keep the bigger picture in mind.

, If you know where you stand with your loved one, make sure to keep things as smooth and normal and calm as possible. This will decrease the stress of what to do and how to treat the relationship. Have a conversation before your partner leaves and decide how you will keep good contact and what to do in certain situations that you know may come up.

, Now that your loved one is off (or maybe has been gone for awhile and your seeking additional advice) your job is to keep connecting with the people around you, don't become completely mentally isolated. Make new friends and share your story, keep getting out in the world and go on a date with just yourself for a change.

, Allow yourself to feel empowered by this bold lifestyle and know that everything IS and will be okay. Celebrate anniversaries on the phone and send letters and whatever your heart desires just keep the bigger picture in mind as always.

, Days will go on and you might feel unhappy feelings at times. That happens and there are no judgements so be patient with yourself and express how you feel to loved ones or friends and definitely the one closest to your heart but farthest from your home.

Don’t rush to establish the next move.,
Maintain contact.,
Accept their silence.,
Help with basic needs.,
Help them make plans to move forward.",How to Console Someone2," Someone enduring emotional hardship may struggle to be decisive, or may simply not know how to behave or what to do. This is an indication of vulnerability, and is an entirely natural reaction to distress. They may not even want to talk about whatever happened, and you shouldn’t push them to do so unless someone else’s safety or well-being depends on it.If someone insists they need space, give it to them. Tell them you’ll check back with them in a few days. Let them know they can contact you whenever they wish to do so and that you’re there for them whenever they want to spend time together.

, Don’t be incessant, but make sure you behave in a way that lets them know you’re still thinking about them, and that their wellbeing matters to you. Call or send a card if a week goes by without hearing from them. Avoid texting, emailing, or using social media to convey condolences, as these communication tools are informal and impersonal.Don’t avoid or ignore someone because you’re uncomfortable with what they’re going through or don’t know how to talk to them. If you’re uncertain about what to do or say, convey your condolences and ask if there is anything you can do.

, If they seem to want you around but aren’t saying much, don’t let their silence bother you. Don’t allow your own nervousness to lead you to talk nonstop. Remind yourself that they may simply want your company. Feel free to ask questions about how they’re feeling, or what they’re thinking about. If they are persistently thinking about whatever happened, they likely need to talk about to it release any pent-up emotions.Avoid asking someone how they feel if you run into them at a social function. While you should encourage them to talk about how they’re feeling, do so in an environment where you have privacy and can give them your full attention.

, Following a traumatic incident, some people will be physically exhausted or depressed. They may sleep more than usual, and may let struggle to complete everyday chores. Help out by doing a load of laundry or cleaning the dishes. Take care not to do everything though, as this may impede their recovery or make them feel pitied. People need to feel capable of taking care of themselves, even when they need a bit of help doing so., When the person seems ready, ask them what they plan to do. Don’t be surprised if they do not know or are not excited to talk about it. Provide some potential routes that they might take while offering to help them do so. Even when making recommendations, try to do more listening than talking, and only offer actionable advice.Any suggestions you make should be based on things they’ve said themselves.
Asking them who and what they think might help is a good place to start.
Stay alert for any signs of worsening emotional distress.
If you ever have the inclination that they need professional help, encourage them to get it. Be prepared to do so by having the contact information to relevant people and organizations available.

Assess the situation as you approach someone.,
Offer to help.,
Ask what you can do to help.,
Listen, listen, listen.,
Stay calm.,
Use humor cautiously.,
Stay with the person until they calm down.",How to Console Someone3," When you don’t know why someone is upset, first ensure that no one is in danger, and then attempt to calm them down. The best way to get the information you need to do so is to ask what has happened. Before doing so, however, assess the situation to make sure you can approach someone safely.Initially, look around. Are others around who may know what happened or may be able to help? Are there any apparent dangers in the area?

, Approach the person and indicate that you’re there to help. If you do not know the person, introduce yourself as well be saying something like, “Hey, I’m ____, and I’m here to help.” If they do not say anything, continue by asking if you can join them and beginning to do so. As you sit down, say something along the lines of, “If it’s alright with you, I’m going to sit with you for a while.”If knowledge of your career might also comfort a stranger – for instance, if you’re a teacher, doctor, or firefighter – you might also want to mention this as well.
Avoid giving generalized reassurance. Though it may be tempting to say something like “everything will be okay,” this ignores how the person is feeling in the moment. Statements like this may even make someone who is upset less willing to receive consolation.

, It’s important to establish what has happened. Keep questions simple, but straightforward, and try to figure out what has happened. Specifics things to look for include any indications that a person may be suffering from more than emotional distress, and what the person needs. Recognize that it is unlikely that you will be able to resolve the situations. Your focus is on getting them calm, and seeing to it that they get further help if needed.Speak calmly, slowly, and softly. Avoid whispering or shouting.
Be ready to back off if the person perceives you as a threat or acts aggressively towards you. If either of these occur, make sure that authorities are on the way, but remain at a safe distance.

, Listening closely to someone, especially someone who is upset, takes patience and care. Holding eye contact may not be appropriate, as someone who is upset may feel vulnerable or embarrassed. Sit with someone quietly, ideally beside them. Make sure your body language is relaxed, and don’t move around. As the other person is speaking, offer non-verbal encouragement by nodding and making affirmative sounds to indicate that you’re listening.
Do not argue with that an upset person is saying. They may be saying things that do not make sense, or that may even be insensitive.
Keep in mind that your goal is consoling the person, not having a conversation, and that their brain is likely flooded with emotion.

, A person experiencing intense emotional distress will also be experiencing changes in their body chemistry that prime them to fight or to flee. Aside from being extremely sad, they will also likely be jumpy, easily irritated, and confused. They will have trouble listening and concentrating, and may not be able to follow what you’re saying. Accordingly, focus on conveying a sense of safety and an environment of calmness.If the person insists on a drastic or unreasonable action, do not argue with them. Rather, propose alternatives and otherwise attempt to distract them from any course of action that may be unsafe.

, While humor and lightheartedness can help people cope, it may not be appropriate when someone is deeply distressed. Let the suffering person take the lead; if they crack a joke about a humorous side effect of something that has happened, join them in their laughter.Humor may be especially helpful in serious situations, wherein a moment of respite might help someone calm down. Just make sure you know the person who is upset will appreciate any humor before trying to lighten up the situation.

, As long as the person isn't injured or at risk in another way, they may simply need to calm down. For instance, if someone received traumatizing news, or witnessed a traumatic event, they may become extremely emotionally upset, but not be in any medical danger. In these situations, an ambulance is unnecessary, and may contribute to further distress. Continue providing emotional support and wait until the person is able to speak with you or someone else about what to do."

Luckily, you can try to ease some of your social anxiety by reaching out to others first. Socializing more in general will help you feel comfortable eventually approaching your crush.Start small. Try to make small talk whenever possible. For example, talk to classmates between classes or chat up a barista at a coffee shop.
Think about joining clubs or doing volunteer work. This is a great way to meet people and push yourself out of your comfort zone by making yourself engage more.
Relax if it feels stressful at first. Eventually, talking to other will be easy.;
, It can be hard to deal with the anxiety associated with having a crush. A great way to sort through your feelings is reaching out to others. Talk to a trusted friend or adult about the feelings you're having and ask them for advice on how to deal. Sometimes, just venting about how you feel can make you feel more confident. Another person can also help you figure whether you want to tell your crush how you feel and the best means to do so.Be careful who you tell, however. Pick someone who's good at keeping secrets and who you trust not to tell anyone. It can be embarrassing to have your crush revealed by someone other than yourself.

, If you already like this person, getting to know them should be fun. The better you know your crush, the more confident you'll feel. Take small steps to get to know your crush better over time.Make conversation with your crush whenever you can. For example, if you are on the school newspaper together, talk to them before and after meetings.
Try to get to know your crush as a friend. Invite them out with your group of friends for a group activity, like seeing a movie.

, It may seem like a small thing, but confidence can actually help a lot with shyness. If you're feeling shy, try changing the way you dress. Splurge on some new clothes that make you feel great about yourself. Wear them to places where you know you'll encounter your crush. If you're dressed up in a way you enjoy, this may make you feel a little bolder around your crush., If you're very shy, you may feel better confessing your feelings in writing. Many shy people feel like they're better at expressing themselves in writing. Think about writing your crush a note letting them know how you feel about them and leaving it somewhere like their locker or desk. You can also try composing an e-mail for your crush.


For example, write something like, ""Hey, I'm too shy to say it in words, but I wanted you to know I have feelings for you.""
Say somewhere in the letter that you're shy, however, and this is why you're confessing in writing. People sometimes get offended that people do not talk over romantic feelings face to face.
Do not send an anonymous e-mail or letter. This could easily backfire if your crush assumes the letter is from someone else or is put off by you being so indirect., When chatting with your crush, try to drop hints that you like them. Use things like social media and text to send them messages like, ""Hi!"" and use emojis like smiley faces and hearts. Exclamation marks work to make your message more expressive., This can work if you're very shy and the friend you choose is someone you greatly trust. Make sure they'll convey the message you want in the fashion you want. You do not want to pick a friend who's likely to skew your words or intentions.Keep in mind, this is usually not the best method to confess indirectly as it puts your friend in a difficult position. Only use this method if you're really struggling to overcome your shyness and have been crushing on the person for a long time.

, Keep in mind, you don't always have to confess a crush, especially if confessing will only cause you anxiety. If confessing doesn't feel like a good idea, give yourself a pass and simply don't do it. Think about what you want out of the situation. If you're hoping confessing will lead to a relationship, it's probably a good idea to confess. However, crushes do not have to go anywhere. If you would rather not pursue a relationship with this person for any reason, it may be best to keep your crush to yourself.If you decide not to confess, you can talk over your feelings with a close friend or family member instead. They can help you manage your emotions surrounding the crush so you can cope on your end without having to confess.

, There is no need to confess all at once, especially if you're feeling nervous. You can work your way up to confessing by taking baby steps. Start by getting a little more flirtatious with your crush to make your feelings more apparent.For example, ask your crush to hang out one on one. It won't be a date, but it's a chance for you to spend time with them alone. This can help you get more comfortable with them, making confessing easier.
Try to pay your crush some compliments. Let them know what you like about them. This can make it easier to eventually tell them you like them romantically.

, Ideally, you should confess your feelings when you and your crush have some privacy. Once you feel comfortable with the idea of confessing your feelings, invite your crush somewhere like a quiet coffee shop or out for a walk. Then, when you're out together, confess how you feel., You can't know how someone else feels without asking them first. Going into the situation assuming you will be rejected will only make you more nervous. Acknowledge that you do not know how your crush is going to react and try not to imagine possible scenarios. Simply approach the situation from a neutral perspective.Remind yourself that, no matter the outcome, at least you'll know. Having a crush, especially one you've been nurturing for a long time, can be exhausting. Sometimes, it's a relief to know the outcome either way.

, Do not beat around the bush. Tell the other person how you feel directly and let them know why you're confessing. This can be difficult if you're really shy, but if you've spent time building up confidence, you should feel a little better about confessing.Say something like, ""I wanted to tell you something. It's a little hard for me to say, but I think you should know that I have feelings for you.""
Let them know what you want from them. For example, ""I'd just like to know if the feelings are returned at all.""

, Rejection happens. Almost everyone will be romantically rejected at some point in life. Be kind to yourself if your crush rejects you. Do something nice for yourself, like taking yourself shopping or watching a movie, and find close friends and family members to vent to.It can help to have others share stories of their own heartbreaks. This can be a reminder that you're not alone.

For example, if you want to let people know you’re taking an exotic vacation, it’s better to engage your network. Try something like, “Just booked a ticket to India. Anyone have hotel or restaurant recommendations?”;
, T.M.I (too much information) on the World Wide Web is tasteless. When you share too much, people stop asking questions and it’s as if you’re simply looking for a reaction rather than a discourse. An Internet interaction, with the same depth as a face-to-face conversation, should be the goal.

, Primarily, avoid controversial topics (politics, religion, etc.) in such a diverse and public forum. Unless, of course, you are willing to experience feedback and varied responses. If you feel compelled to stir up your social network, try posing a question such as “What does everyone think about the new health care initiative?” Your neutral headline will be less controversial and this will keep you within the boundaries of electronic etiquette.

, Events like getting a new house, a marriage proposal, a college acceptance, a job promotion, the birth of a child, etc. are fine to share with the cyber community. However, it’s advisable to let those closest to you know more personally so they don’t find out the same way as someone you haven’t spoken to in three years.

, It’s fine to promote an accomplishment like getting an article published or a product you support, but keep sponsorships to a minimum. Self-endorsement can come across as self-indulgent.

Perhaps your partner is freaking out about specific details surrounding your big day; maybe he/she is having doubts about marriage, period.No matter the problem: confront it with honesty and empathy. You must acknowledge these feelings in order to move forward.;
, Only address the issue when both of you have privacy, no obligations, and at least an hour of free time. Provide a safe place for your fiancé to talk about his or her fears. When the time feels right, invite your fiance to confide in you.


It might take some time to get to the root of the issue. Your fiancé may not yet know how to put these feelings into words. He or she may need a safe space to explore these feelings with you.
The time will not always feel right. If the wedding is drawing near, you can't always wait for a good moment. Better to bring it up at the wrong time than to let the wedding happen without ever resolving the problem.

, It is not always easy to hear that someone you love is unsure about getting married, or even unsure whether you are the right person for them. You may have to work hard to uproot your partner's true emotions: he or she may not yet have confronted these feelings, and may not be able to express the origin of the tension. Be patient and kind. It is essential to the future of your relationship that you get to the root of this.If your fiancé is nervous because of he or she is unsure in your relationship, think about whether it makes sense to back off from the wedding and re-focus on the relationship.Consider talking to a third party to seek out the source of the anxiety. This person could be a trusted counselor from your community or place of worship; it could also be a professional relationship counselor.

, Don't just write off your fiancé's feelings – try to truly understand them. Search for common ground. There is a good chance that you yourself are at least a little nervous about the big day! Indeed, it is natural to be nervous before a wedding.You do not need to give in to your fears, but they may help you better understand why your fiancé is so nervous.


Even if you are sure in your emotional commitment to your partner, you might be anxious about various details: guests, band, venue, everything going smoothly.
You might even have your own doubts about when and whether to have the wedding. Consider whether this is something that you truly want.

, Notice which words and situations make him or her act especially nervous, and try to mitigate those things. Pick up on both verbal and non-verbal cues. He/she may be biting nails, picking up nervous tics, or freaking out about things that never seemed to be an issue before. Look for any new ways that anxiety might be manifesting., Meet your fiancé’s concerns with understanding and patience. You may be angry that he or she is nervous, and you may feel insecure about the situation. This is completely normal. Resist the urge, however, to tell your partner to “snap out of it.” This is the person with whom you plan to spend the rest of your life – so be open and understanding with regard to any of your finance’s concerns.


You may not understand why someone would get nervous about whether the wedding theme colors match or whether Aunt Janet is going to get loaded. However, this doesn't mean that you should wave away your partner's worries.

, Remember that while your fiancé's fears may impact your own life, they are not your fears. They do not need to reflect upon you, and they are not necessarily your fault. People get nervous for many reasons, and the prospect of such a huge life decision is enough to make anyone feel a bit anxious. Your fiancé may well still love you and want to be with you, even if he or she is wary about the wedding itself.


Don't ignore the problem, but do find ways to clear your head. Get out of the house for a long walk outdoors. Watch an exciting new movie, or attend an interesting lecture, or go out drinking with your friends. Meditate.Remind yourself that there is only so much that you can control. You cannot force your fiancé's fears away, but you can rise to meet the problem with grace. If your partner is unstable in your relationship, then you will need to be a stable force – both for yourself and for the relationship.

, Don’t try to talk your partner out of his or her doubts, especially if he/she is pushing you to cancel or reschedule the wedding. Be patient and caring, and do not push. Putting undue pressure onto your partner might make the situation even worse!It can be a huge mistake to talk your fiancé out of postponing or canceling a wedding. Remember: if he/she wants to back out now, there is a reason for it. This might come up again in a week, in a year, or even ten years down the road.

, Think of this as an early test for your prospective marriage. How you handle it will matter now, for the foreseeable future, and beyond. Do not expect to easily change your fiancé's feelings – certainly not without a deep mutual understanding of their true causes, nor without deep self-reflection. If you naturally tend to alternate between a concern for your feelings and your fiancé's, then you are off to a good start. If you are mostly concerned with the impact of your fiancé's feelings on your own, this does not bode well for the prospects of your marriage.

, Look for a wedding planner/coordinator to relieve some of the burden that planning a wedding can bring. Contrary to popular belief, wedding planners are not reserved for only the rich and famous. Some consultants are reasonably priced, and they may be well worth this price if their work prevents your fiancé from having a mental breakdown. Bear in mind that watching someone else plan the wedding might make some fiancés feel even more anxious!Some venues actually include wedding coordination in the booking price. Ask your venue if this is an option, or consider finding another venue where it is an option.
Consider getting more involved in planning the wedding and reception. If your honey is simply overwhelmed with the details, but you’ve done nothing, it may be time to step up your game. Offer to take over some of the “to do” items on his/her list.

, Your fiancé may be having trouble dealing with the relationship, or with events that have occurred in the relationship. If this is the case, consider reaching out to a professional for assistance. There are relationship counselors that specialize in handling this sort of intense emotional conflict. A neutral third party might be able to help your partner come to terms with his/her nervousness and help both of you cope with the stress.

, Your fiancé is presumably worrying about the wedding, whether he/she is obsessing over the details or feeling anxious about the whole thing. If you can't talk through the anxiety, consider whether there is a way to change your wedding plans and preserve your relationship. If your partner has opened up to you about why he/she is nervous, then you're already on the same page – so try to work in harmony to find a solution that works for both of you.Practice getting married. Hold a dress rehearsal, and go through the ceremony together before the big day so that you know what to expect. Have your partner try out his/her lines on a trusted friend or family member. Try to make everyone involved feel as comfortable and prepared as possible.Reduce wedding expenses by having the ceremony and reception at home or at another venue that won’t be as expensive. This might help alleviate If you are paying for the wedding yourself, consider asking your parents to chip in or take out a low interest personal loan.

Elope. This is not a parental favorite, but in some cases it might be the only way to reduce your fiancé’s stress. If you decide to go with this plan, consider telling your families before you run away to get married. This way, your parents and a few close loved ones can be present – or at least understand why you are eloping.

, This solution might ease the situation if your fiancé is experiencing anxiety due to external circumstances, such as a sudden illness or a death in the family. Consider rescheduling the wedding so your partner can enjoy the day instead of feeling upset or stressed. You will remember this day for the rest of your lives – so make sure that the timing is right!

, Ultimately, if your fiancé is extremely uncomfortable with the situation, you may have no choice but to postpone or cancel the wedding. In some cases, postponing the wedding may be the best move you can make. Try to get your money back, even if you’ve put a non-refundable down payment on the venue or event.


If you lose money on the cancelled wedding, consider the expense of a potential future divorce. Losing a few bucks on a security deposit could save you both years of heartache and attorney’s fees.

You may want your partner to touch you or treat you in a certain way, but you never speak up. However, talking about intimacy--regarding activities in the bedroom and not--is important for the health of your relationship. Pull your partner aside during a time when you won't be distracted. You may talk about:


Whether the two of you are mutually exclusive or simply casually dating
Your sexual and/or romantic relationship histories
Your sexual and reproductive health
What measures you are taking to practice safe sex (if relevant)
What feels good to each of you
Your thoughts, feelings, goals, and dreams
Your sexual desires and fantasies;
, As a person independent of your partner, you will have differences in what you are willing to do and what you are not in an intimate relationship. Recognizing your boundaries comes with knowing what you like and don't like as well as understanding your core values.


Once you have gotten an understanding of what you desire in your relationship, both you https://www.wikihow.com/Special:Articlestats/Communicate-for-Better-Intimacyand your partner will need to share your personal boundaries. Boundaries are not meant to separate you from your partner. Rather, they are necessary for you to keep your own individuality intact.
You can set boundaries by saying something like ""I have learned from past relationships what is most important to me. I expect for you to _______. I will also do my best to respect your boundaries."" Your personal boundaries may include:Giving your partner adequate space
Not getting jealous of your other relationships (e.g. friends, family, etc.)
Having separate hobbies and interest in addition to shared interests as a couple
Not engaging in sexual activities that you are not comfortable with
Living life according to your values
Not letting your partner dictate who you see, talk to, or spend time with
Making your own decisions, and not letting your partner make them for you



, All relationships, and all people, are works in progress. It's significant to do regular wellness checks of your intimacy with your partner to identify and resolve problems before they grow. Regularly schedule in some time to talk with your partner about your intimacy. This is not something that can be discussed in one conversation, but should be addressed on a consistent basis throughout the partnership., As long as your personal boundaries and limitations (as well as your partner's) are firmly in place, you should find excitement in taking your intimate relationship to new heights. This suggestion is not strictly for sex. Yes, it can be fulfilling to change things up in the bedroom, but there are many other ways to boost intimacy in your relationship by doing something new. Breaking out of a routine can actually keep your relationship healthy and alive.Trying new things can translate to taking a class together, pushing yourselves physically, learning a new language as a couple, or even just traveling to a new place.

, Before you even approach a conversation with your significant other, get it out of your head that either of you needs to leave the encounter victoriously. Your goal should not be to “win” as in a battle. Remember that the two of you are on the same side.A big part of being on the same side is recognizing your own drive to have the conversation. Are you driven to prove a point even if you hurt your partner or are you really trying to solve issues in a sincere manner?
Go into any conversation as a partner and not a negotiator. In negotiation, you are looking out for yourself first and trying to get the most out of the situation. This is not the case when you share a goal with the partner.

, Minimize blame by owning your feelings and using “I” statements. ”I” statements focus on your feelings in regards to very specific behaviors from your partner, it does not involve blaming your partner or saying that the behavior is wrong. It is about sharing your feelings and giving your partner guidance as to how to resolve the behavior that is bothering you.An example of an “I” statement might be: “I feel anxious when you come home hours after you usually come home from work without calling to tell me you are going to be late. I worry you are hurt. I will request that you try to be on time or call if you can’t be on time.”

, The way you speak can be just as important as what you are saying. When communicating with someone you care about, you want to convey compassion in your tone. Beyond your tone, also be mindful of non-verbal cues that may send a mixed message. You do not want to show signs that you are not open to talking.Example of cues that may send the wrong message would be standing with your arms folded so you appear closed off, shouting or even a nervous laugh that may be interpreted as not being sincere.

, Use active listening to hear the message without judgment. Active listening means you commit to listening and rephrasing what your partner is saying to confirm understanding instead of listening to prepare a rebuttal. Model active listening and ask your partner to also use it.Be open to hear intimate details from your partner that you may not feel great about. If he or she is truly honest there may be areas of concern that need to be expressed.

, A big part of compromise is playing fair and not using bargaining chips that are not appropriate. For instance, withholding affection to punish your partner is not fair.Enter into the talk without hostility and without fear of losing because you will both ""win"" part of what you want. Compromising isn’t about surrendering. It is about meeting somewhere in the middle with a solution that does not ask either of you to compromise something you see as being a non-negotiable.
Within the discussion, define what issues are non-negotiable for you. Also, be careful to define the areas that you are more flexible to bend a bit.

, It’s disarming for many people to share their inner thoughts, dreams and desires. However, if you want to increase the intimacy factor in your relationship, this is mandatory.Own your dreams and leave them open for your partner to become a part of them if they are shared. If they are not shared dreams, explore how your partner can be supportive.
There is no right or wrong way to share your desires as long as they are communicated respectfully. Be open to share them in a very honest way and to also hear the same from your partner.

, Make regular communication a part of your life together. Share hurt feelings when they occur instead of bottling them up to explode later. Taking the time to share these feelings when they come up often allows your partner to clear up a misunderstanding or an honest mistake.There will be times that you feel hurt that your partner simply did not see the situation in the same way. If you point out the issue in the moment, you may be able to clear up those hurt feelings and move on more quickly.

, It’s a leap of faith to trust someone else with the most intimate parts of your life, but this is one of the greater joys of sharing life with your partner. Make sure your partner gets the best of you and he or she isn’t feeling like you tell your secrets to someone else. It can be devastating, for example, for a spouse to hear from a neighbor that you have talked about hurt feelings over drinks with friends. You should always be the person sharing that information directly with your partner.Part of trusting is also being trustworthy. Hold what your spouse tells you as being sacred and keep some things between the two of you.

, This goes far beyond sex and includes everything from holding hands while having a hard discussion to enjoying time cuddling. Touch or the lack of should not be used as a weapon. Maintain the personal contact without your relationship. Make time to stay connected. Touch is one of the most basic ways humans communicate. Know that both you and your partner have this need—although perhaps not to the same extent—and see to it that you make touch a regular part of showing affection.

, Don’t take everything as a personal attack. Taking things too personal will close your thoughts from hearing genuine concern or areas of possible improvement from your partner. Maintain an open mind when hearing constructive criticism from your partner.Set time with your partner outside of an argument or heated moment to talk about possible growth. This will help to avoid things being said out of anger. You will also not be in a defensive mode and probably more open to really listen.

, Remember you are on the same side. If you communicate effectively, this isn’t a battle you can lose. Pride can keep you from admitting you were hurt or felt left out. Take a chance and be open about your feelings even if it shows a perceived weakness.

Ask for forgiveness when needed and be open to giving it as well. Admit you have made mistakes as everyone does. For example, you might say “I was very judgmental about your decision to help a friend. I let my personal feelings get in the way. I’m sorry for not being receptive.”

, Accepting your fears and areas that you feel insecure about goes a long way towards dealing with them in a timely manner. If you have insecurities that are lurking beneath the surface, they may emerge during tense discussions and get in the way of true compromise or resolutions.Set out to change your mindset and not be judgmental of yourself in the process. Trust that your partner is genuinely concerned about you and worthy of offering help.
When you share your fears with your partner, listen and be open to the suggestions you get in return. Remember you are worthy of both the love and support your partner has offered to you., Focus on the things you can control and let go of the things that are not under your control. Identify what causes you stress and find ways to address your internal concerns. Share your stressors with your partner..


Find ways to incorporate daily stress-relievers so that you can fend off stress and prevent it from driving a distance between you and your partner.

, This includes the way you carry yourself, dress and even your hygiene. Making sure you put in the effort to get up every day and dress in clothes that make you feel good is a small step towards improving your self-image. Commit to putting effort into yourself.Self-image also includes setting aside time to do things that help you stay in good physical shape as well, like going to the gym or doing yoga. When you feel good about your body, those insecurities are not misdirected onto your partner.
Maintain your physical health and regular checkups with your primary doctor to make sure you are staying healthy. If you feel counseling would be beneficial, connect with a mental health provider as well.

Think about how your relationship has progressed.,
Look at how the person treats their friends and family.,
Determine if the person follows through on their commitments.,
Check that the person sets boundaries with others.,
Note if the person has cheated before.",How to Choose a Loyal Partner," You should consider the individual traits of your partner or a person who may be a partner to you in the future. One of the key traits you should look for is reliability and honesty. Ask yourself, “Does this person appear reliable and honest?” and “How does this person demonstrate they are reliable and honest?”For example, you may notice that the person shows up when they say they are going to and does not flake out at the last minute on plans you have together.
You may also notice that the person does not cheat on tests or exams, even though they might get away with it. This is an indication that they have a strong moral compass and will not simply take the easy route if it means less work for them.;
, A loyal partner will honor your individual traits and skills. You should note if the person shows clear support for your interests and goals. Having a partner who is supportive also shows that they are interested in you as a person and care about your future.For example, you may notice that the person always shows up to your games or matches, or makes every effort to be there. Maybe the person takes on extra duties at home so you have time to study for an exam or time to spend on an important project for work.
You may also note that the person tells you directly, “I support you and think what you are doing is great,” or, “I believe in you and your abilities. I want to support you in every way I can.”

, Emotional maturity is a key trait in a relationship, as it indicates that the person is comfortable in their own skin and willing to be there for you emotionally. Being emotionally mature is a good indicator of loyalty and a good sign that your relationship is healthy.For example, an emotionally mature person will be a good listener and put their needs aside to focus on your needs. They will also be comfortable talking about their feelings, wants, and needs with you and be willing to ask for what they want.
An emotionally mature person will also be able to make their own decisions and choices without the influence of others. This is a good trait to have as it shows that they can be accountable for their own choices and be responsible with their decisions.

, Take some time to think about what loyalty looks like to you; look at the obvious things as well as more subtle situations. Does loyalty mean not cheating (emotionally/ physically/both)? Not talking about private matters with others? Showing up to company events? Collaborating on financial decisions prior to purchases? Checking in before committing to plans? What exactly are you expecting from a partner when you use the term ""loyal""? You need to have a clear idea of what these behaviors are in order to look for them in others and have a conversation about them.

, Instead assuming your definition of loyalty matches your partner's, have a discussion about which behaviors indicate loyalty to you. For instance, your partner showing up to your soccer match may be a demonstration of loyalty in your eyes. But maybe your partner doesn't mind if you don't go to their events, so they don't realize how important it is to you that they go to your events. Take the time to express which behaviors are important and which meet your needs for a relationship, and allow your partner to do the same.

, When trying to determine if you have chosen a loyal partner, you should consider how you handle conflict in your relationship. Are you both able to talk about any issues or problems you may be having? Can you speak openly about how you feel with your partner? Having good communication skills and listening skills are important aspects of a fulfilling, loyal relationship.You may also think about how your partner handles conflict between you. Do they get upset and shut down? Are they able to talk to you about their feelings and concerns? Note how they react in difficult or challenging situations and whether you feel they react in a healthy, honest way.

, You should also take a moment to consider if you can place your complete trust in that person and if they can do the same with you. Ask yourself, “Can I trust in this person completely?” If the answer is “no” or “maybe,” you should consider why you are hesitant to trust your partner. You may write down why you cannot answer “yes” to the question and consider if the reasons for “no” are not fixable or able to addressed with your partner.For example, you may write down that you cannot trust your partner because they are not honest with you about their feelings. You may then consider talking with your partner about being more open and honest with their feelings. Communicating with them about your concerns may help you learn how to trust them in the future.

, You should also look at the big picture and consider your relationship as a whole. Think about where your relationship started and where it is at now. Does it feel like you and your partner have grown and matured together? Does your relationship feel stronger now than it did in the past? If your relationship is healthy, your sense of loyalty for your partner should expand over time and you should feel you can trust them after so much time together.If you feel your relationship has not developed as much as you hoped it would in terms of trust and loyalty, you may decide to talk to your partner about how you are feeling. You should consider what you can both do to prioritize your relationship and develop a stronger sense of loyalty.

, You can tell a lot about a person’s loyalty based on how they treat those they love and those closest to them. Consider if your partner is loyal and honest with their family and their friends or if they are flaky and unreliable. A loyal person will treat those closest to them with respect, admiration, and consideration. It may be a red flag if your partner is not as supportive or considerate of those closest to them as they could be.For example, you should consider if the person treats their friends with loyalty and consideration. Do they try to support their friends in their endeavors? Do they try to spend time with their friends and follow through on their commitments to their friends?
You should also consider how your partner treats their family. Though they may not be close to their family, they may still go out of their way to help a family member in need or try to support a family member who is suffering or having a hard time.

, You should also consider if the person is able to commit to things and follow through on their word. This is an important indicator of loyal and reliable behavior. You want a partner who is not flaky or unable to commit to anything, as it could be a sign they have a hard time being loyal to those around them.For example, you may notice that the person is good at texting people back and responding to messages from friends who are in need. They may also make plans with friends or coworkers and then make sure they always show up and put in an effort.
You may also note that the person is able to commit to short-term plans and long-term plans with you. Perhaps you make dinner plans for next week and the person makes sure they can make it. You may also plan a vacation in a few months and note that the person makes sure they are able to go with you before they commit.

, You should pay attention to how the person interacts with others and ensure they are good at setting boundaries. Having boundaries is an important part of being loyal, as you want a partner who is able to be friendly but not too flirty with others. If the person tends to get too close to friends or coworkers and is not good at saying ""no,"" this may be a red flag.Your partner should be aware of when they are stepping over the line and possibly breaking your trust by spending too much time with someone else or by devoting too much emotion to another person. If you express concern about their relationship with someone else, they should listen to your concerns and try to show you that you have nothing to worry about.
For example, you should note if your partner is able to have relationships with the opposite sex, or the sex they are attracted to, without ending up getting too flirty or too close. This could be someone they work with or a close friend. They should be able to maintain friendly, platonic relationships with others and also devote enough time to your relationship.

, You should also consider if your partner has cheated in the past with other partners. A person who has a history of cheating may have difficulty with commitment and monogamy. You should think about if you are concerned about your partner's loyalty because of their track record with other partners and view this as a red flag.If you have some concerns about your partner's loyalty, you should speak to them about trust and commitment. Your partner should try to assure you that they can be loyal to you and show you that they can be loyal. You may also ask them to show you that they can be trusted and will not cheat on you like they did with their other partners in the past.

Always be respectful and openly ask her how she came about her decision.


If you know her well enough, understand that progesterone levels can have calming effects and usually rise a week after ovulation. Testosterone and estrogen levels are higher during ovulation and can cause a woman to have more energy and her mood to be on the sassier side.When progesterone is withdrawn from the body, women can easily be irritated. Similarly, her mood can be negatively affected 12-24 hours before her period starts.;
, Studies have shown that women are able to read nonverbal cues, such as facial expression and tone of voice, better than men.Be genuine in the emotions you’re trying to convey and you will have a better chance in changing her mind. You may not realize it but your body language may give off any ulterior motives you may have.

, Using intimidation, either physical or verbal, is wrong and abusive. If any thoughts of this nature creep into your mind, remove yourself from the situation and consult a professional!


While you are allowed to get angry, research has shown that women will act to nullify the threat that you’re presenting through manipulation.Just because you get the response you’re looking for, doesn’t mean that she is being sincere. Anger and aggression should be avoided.

, Studies have shown that women are more sensitive to stress and anxiety. If she is already stressed over another aspect in her life, it may not be the best time to add another source of stress with your appeal to change her mind. Understand how she responds to anxiety.

, A negative response may sometimes be better than no response because women will at least know that you’re engaged and invested emotionally. Women are sensitive to interpersonal cues so blank expressions or being stonewalled can escalate an already negative situation., The rules and expectations that govern how you communicate with her should be different. If you want to change her mind and get her to view you romantically, do not continue to abide by friendship dynamics., Is a romantic relationship what you actually want? Could you stand losing her friendship? Do not be friends with a female in hopes that you can change her mind about you. This is unfair to her as friendships should be based on trust and respect.

, The best way to change her mind about you as more than a friend is to be direct. There is no sense in trying to manipulate her or trying to wait her out. If she declines your romantic overtures and wishes to stay friends, respectfully decline.Your emotions may be too raw after you have been rejected to maintain a friendship. A friendship is based on mutual support and respect. Ask yourself if you can truly give that to her after you have clearly expressed that you see her as more than a friend. Can you still be friends with her if she is dating someone else?

, Help her change her opinion about you by learning more about her. Respectfully approach her friends and family and tell them that you’d like to learn more about her. Be open and honest with your intentions and they will better understand how to help you.


Do not present yourself as someone who you are not. This will certainly make things worse if she finds out that you have manipulated those close to her to get your way.

Open communication is the easiest way to get her to change her opinion about you., Are you listening to respond or are you truly hearing what she is saying?

Identify the behavior.,
Determine if the person is open to changing that behavior.,
Tell the person that the behavior bothers you.",How to Change Someone Else's Behavior1," Pinpoint the exact behavior that you want to change about the person. If you want the person to just “be less annoying” or “text me more often,” you will not get the results you want. Pinpoint the exact behavior you want to change and mark exactly how you want it to change.


For example, rather than saying that you want your friend to “be less annoying,” plan to say that you want your friend to “stop interrupting conversations she’s not a part of.”
Or, instead of wanting your partner to “text you more often,” you could want your partner to “text you good morning and goodnight every day.”;
, Ultimately, you cannot force anyone to change. You can only change things about yourself. This idea applies both to you and to the person you’re trying to change. See if the person wants to change and believes that he has the capacity to change.Don’t actively ask the person if he is open to change; instead, try to figure out if there’s a possibility that the person wants to change.


In some situations, it might be appropriate to ask that person’s friends and loved ones what they know about this behavior and what the person has done to change it. If the person has tried to quit smoking several times before, he might be open to trying again with a different approach. If the person has tried, he at least at one point believed he was open to change.
You can also pay attention to what the person says about the topic and life in general. If the person says fixed statements like “I’ll be fat forever,” or, “I guess I’m just not a smart person,” the person may not think that he can change.
If the person does want to change or is at least open to the possibility of change, you might be able to help him change his behavior.
However, if the person does not want to change, you might not be able to do anything about the problem at this point.

, The person may not realize the extent to which her behavior upsets you. Choose a time to talk when you are calm, have enough time to have a long conversation, and have thought about what you want to say. Do not raise your voice or yell at the person.


Make your feelings about the behavior very clear to the person. For example, say: “When you are late, I feel like I am not a priority to you, and that hurts my feelings.”
Give specific examples. “When you were late meeting me last week, you made us both late to the Bon Jovi concert and we missed the first song. I was really mad about that because I love Bon Jovi and those tickets were expensive.”
Ask for what you do want instead. For example, say: “Next time you’re going to be late, could you please call me and let me know?”
Once you've made your wishes clear, back off and do not belabor the point. Nagging her if she already knows what's wrong is unlikely to have a positive outcome.

Know what you can control.,
Accept that you cannot change some things.,
Decide if you can accept the person if this behavior does not change.",How to Change Someone Else's Behavior2," You can change certain things about yourself, such as what you say, how you say it, and how you act. When you try to change someone else, you are changing something about yourself in an attempt to incite change in that person.

, Sometimes, despite your best efforts, someone will not change. Again, it is important to note that you cannot force anyone to change if the person doesn't want to. You can say things to try to affect change within that person, but you are an agent of change, not the change itself. No matter how many times you tell your friend to tie his shoelaces, he does not have to tie his shoelaces., Get comfortable with the possibility that the person may never change, because it's quite possible that he will not. How would it feel to simply live with the behavior? Is it possible you could change your own behavior and attitude to accommodate the person? Or are there ways to work around it? Ask yourself if you can accept the person as he is. If you cannot accept the behavior, then you may need to end the relationship.


If you can live with this behavior, try to avoid situations in which it might arise. For example, if you hate when your friend sings in the car, avoid long road trips or listen to music that he doesn't know.
Consider whether there are any ways to work around the behavior. Would it work to simply tell the person a time to meet you that is a half-hour earlier than necessary? Is there something that could be purchased that would solve the problem, for example, if your complaint is that the person will not clean the litter box like he promised, can you buy a self-cleaning one? While these don't address larger problems (such as the person not following through with his promises), but they may help you accept the person as he is.
If you cannot live with this behavior, you may need to cut off contact with this person. If your boyfriend’s drug problems are out of control, for instance, and you think that living with him will be extremely detrimental to your own health, you should consider breaking up with him and cutting off contact. It can be painful, but, if the behavior is greatly impeding your life, you owe it to yourself to consider your own health and happiness.

It could wake her up or worse, give her a concussion. Nothing is worse than for your kind gesture to go wrong and end her up in the ER.



,


If you haven't already done so, turn back the covers.

Gently place her in bed.
Take her shoes and/or socks off.
Carefully remove jewelry that could cause discomfort or make noise if she rolls in her sleep.
If you want to risk waking her (and if you're on that level of the relationship), dress her in her favorite pair of pajamas.

This should show her that you pay attention to the little things, which she should appreciate.



,



Don't pull it over her face, just up to her neck should suffice.
Give her a little kiss, then say sweet dreams or just a goodnight.

, Is it something to do with the relationship? Is it a family problem? Is he stressed out from school or work? Figure out what's bothering him so you choose the right approach and solution.

, Sometimes just a friendly smile can brighten his day. Don't be offended if he says something like ""why are you so happy?"" that just means you need to care for him even more. Also hugs can comfort.

, Sometimes he will just need to work things out on his own. Walk away for a while but make sure he knows you're there for him and will talk if he wants.

Meet new people.,
Respect diversity.,
Focus on relationship quality.,
Build trust.,
Treat others with kindness.",How to Build Healthy Interpersonal Relationships1," Humans are social creatures by nature, even introverts. For this reason, you may need to take opportunities to interact with others if you want to build healthy relationships with others.


Find reasons to put yourself in contact with other people. The more times you do this, the more likely that you will interact with others, and the more likely those interactions will be meaningful.Go out. Go to a coffee shop, Take a trip. Attend a concert or play.
Find meet-ups. Find groups in your community that share your values and interests and go to events they host. Meetup.com is a great resource for this, but there are others you can find through a brief online search.
Be available. Make yourself say ""yes"" to invitations from acquaintances, coworkers, family, and friends. This can be as simple as lunch on a Friday, to camping on the weekend, to attending a child's dance recital. It doesn't matter what you've been invited to. Provided it doesn't interfere with necessary weekly responsibilities, just say ""yes."";
, When we respect diversity, we respect the right of others to be different from ourselves, opening the door to safer, more meaningful and fruitful interactions.Ways to respect diversity are:


Learn about another culture or religion by attention a service at a worship center.
Volunteer in your community to help individuals with disabilities or special needs.
Travel to other countries and practice local customs when possible and respectful to do so.
Watch documentaries that introduce you to different cultures and parts of the world., High-quality personal relationships are defined by closeness, respect, shared values and support. Studies have shown that quality personal relationships not only help our mental health but also contribute to our physical well-being.

Spend quality time together engaging in meaningful activities.For example, go on a walk, visit a museum, or just sit and have a conversation.

, Trust is an essential component of a healthy relationship — it is difficult to make a deeper connection if you don't feel safe with the other person. Demonstrate your trustworthiness by admitting when you are wrong and apologizing sincerely, being reliable, and communicating openly.

You should look for people with these same attributes.

If you can't be accountable for your actions and try to blame your mistakes on others, it will be hard for people to trust you. Admit your mistakes and apologize sincerely.
Be reliable by following through with your promises. This can be as simple as showing up to hang out with your friend when you said you would or completing a work project by the agreed-upon deadline.Show other people that when you say you'll do something, they can trust that you will do it.
Say what you mean and do what you say.Don't tell someone you will keep a secret and then share it with someone else. Your behaviors and words should match up.
Remember that this is a gradual process — you need to earn a person's trust, especially if they have been burned in the past., This isn't simply doing sweet things for others, like giving gifts, but how you interact with others day to day. Treating others with genuine kindness and respect is an integral part of building a healthy connection. Trusting someone and deepening your relationship requires vulnerability, and it will be difficult for anyone to be vulnerable with you if they think you may mock them or treat them badly. Kindness, on the other hand, makes people feel valued and cared for.One instance in which can be difficult to show kindness is during conflict. Instead of blaming, yelling, calling the person names or exploiting their insecurities, choose instead to express why you are hurt and angry."

Give the person information about the behavior that will encourage her to change it.,
Increase the person’s awareness of the negative behavior.,
Give positive feedback.,
Reward good behavior.,
Make good behaviors easier than bad behaviors.,
Offer a support network to the person.",How to Change Someone Else's Behavior3," Even if the person knows that you do not like her behavior, your own distaste for the behavior might not be enough to make her want to change it. To attempt to change her mind about changing the behavior, try giving her information about the habit that makes it seem undesirable or worth changing.


For example, you could try saying, “Joanie, I don’t know if you know this, but smoking can be really harmful and lead to lung cancer. My uncle was a lifelong smoker went through chemotherapy for lung cancer last year, and it was really hard for my family to see him through that painful time in his life.”
If you have been suffering in silence, or trying to drop subtle hints, these few steps may solve the problem entirely. Often, information alone is not enough to change a behavior; however, information combined with your opinion as a trusted acquaintance, friend, or family member might be enough to convince a person to attempt to change.
Once you've made your wishes clear, back off and do not belabor the point. Nagging the person if she already knows what's wrong is unlikely to have a positive outcome.

, The person might not even realize that he is doing this behavior and therefore might be open to changing it. For example, it might drive you crazy when your friend chews with his mouth open, but if he's done this his entire life, he might not notice that he’s doing it. Remind the person gently what he is doing and how he could stop. Be polite.For example, you could say, “Ed, Could you please chew with your mouth closed? The chewing noise bothers me.”
Be nice, especially if the person is unaware. You should not say, “Ed, you’re chewing like a cow. Cut it out!”
This strategy will only work if the person is doing the behavior essentially by accident. If you want your mom to stop smoking and you make her aware that she’s smoking every time that she smokes, your strategy will probably be ineffective.

, Positive feedback is better at the beginning of a person’s process of change because it encourages the person to feel more committed to her goal. It also improves your relationship with that person.For example, if you are trying to get your friend to come to the gym with you more frequently, you should, in the beginning of the process, say something along the lines of, “I know you would be great at this spin class, because you were great at kickboxing last week. I would have more fun if you came with me. Let’s go on Tuesday!”

, If the person you’re trying to change does the behavior you want him to do (or stops the behavior you dislike), reward him! If your husband doesn’t smoke for a week, take him to do something he loves, like bowling or golf.Be an encouraging force, rather than a negative force, in the person’s life when he does something right.


Praise good behavior using lavish, enthusiastic praise in whatever form the person understands best. Physical affection if appropriate, kind words, gifts, doing things for the person, etc. Connect the good behavior to you being thrilled with him and his life being better as a result.

, Changing behavior is not about conquering temptations. If your friend is trying to lose weight, do not take her out for ice cream on Friday night. If you’re trying to get your wife to be on time, be sure to give her an ample amount of time to get from her work to date night.For example, if your best friend is a recovering alcoholic, do not have her birthday party at a bar or a dance club, where there is likely to be a huge amount of temptation to drink. Instead, bring her somewhere where there is less temptation, such as pottery painting or bowling.

, The effectiveness of this technique depends on the behavior you want to change. For something like quitting smoking, losing weight, or dealing with addiction, these groups can help the person stay motivated and engaged socially in achieving his goals.Even for smaller behavioral changes, such as helping your brother spend less money, recruit his close friends and your family members to help with the goal in little ways. If they are aware of the goal of the behavior change, they will support him.
If the person whose behavior you want to change has a drug or alcohol problem, he also might find it helpful to go to a support group, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, where other people in the group are going through the same thing.

Check in with your partner regularly.,

Expand your conversations to keep them from getting boring.,
Plan your next visit.",How to Build Trust in Long Distance Relationships," You need to be confident in your knowledge of and love for your partner in order to build a relationship that you can both believe in. Learn how to understand your partner, how to interpret what she says and pick out her emotional states. You should be able to tell when something's bothering her, and know what makes her feel better.

Ask each other questions. Ask about what your partner likes and dislikes, what she wants to do in the next year or five years, where she's been, who her friends are -- anything can spark a story and get a great conversation going. Turn this into a game by keeping track of how many questions you ask, and try to reach 1000 first.



 


Play games to get to know each other. To play Two Truths and a Lie, tell your partner two true things and one false thing about yourself, and have her guess which is the lie. Or make a quiz about yourself and send it to her. Have her do the same, and compete to get the most answers right.






Use multiple methods of communication. Talking on the phone is great for certain kinds of conversations. Email encourages more thoughtful discussions of weightier topics, while texting is great for a quick, light-hearted chat. Use more than one method of communication to get to know all sides of your partner.





;
, Discuss topics like what you want to get out of the relationship and where you see it going. Commit to the trust and communication that sustain a long-distance relationship. Understand the difficulties you will face and talk about them with your partner, but at the end of the day, if the relationship is going to work, you both need to fully dedicate yourselves to it, without hesitation.

, Encourage your partner to trust you by always proving yourself worthy of her trust. Follow through on your promises, even the small ones like calling her at a specific time or responding to a message. If you ever find that you can't follow through on a promise, have a very good reason why, explain this to her, and ask for -- don't demand -- her forgiveness.

, It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Make sure you talk often so that you can participate in her life, and you can feel her presence in yours. Regular communication is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.

, Honest and open communication is just as important as talking often. If something is worrying you, your partner should be the first to know. If she's feeling upset or frustrated, she should be comfortable opening up to you. If you are consistently open with your partner, she will learn to trust what you say and will feel more comfortable in the relationship. Be completely honest with your partner and trust that she will with you.

, This will allow you to better understand your partner's daily life, and being friendly with the people in her life can help both of you feel more involved with each other. Her friends will also appreciate the chance to get to know the person taking up so much of her time and energy. This increased involvement with your partner will help you build trust in your relationship.

, Although you may want to spend every moment of every day talking with her, recognize that she needs time and space to live her own life. Don't pressure her to give you more of her time and energy than she's comfortable with. Trust that she will come to you when she needs to, and allow her the space to be her own person within your relationship.


Finding the right balance between personal space and regular communication is perhaps the hardest part of a long-term relationship -- and the balance is different for every couple. Experiment and check in with each other regularly to see what works and what doesn't. Work together to find a balance that lets you both be as happy and as healthy as possible.

, Discuss how you both feel about how your relationship is going. Talk about whether you feel happy, comfortable, and confident in the relationship, and what each of you could do to make it even better. If one of you feels dissatisfied for any reason, discuss the problem and work together to figure out a solution that you're both comfortable with. Recommit to your partner and the relationship, taking into account whatever changes, if any, you've discussed.


Regular check-ins give you a way to make changes to the relationship or even end with mutual understanding and without unnecessary pain, it if and when that becomes necessary. Though it may seem tedious, pessimistic, or even silly, long-distance relationships are a lot of work and this is a good way to make sure it's still working for both of you.

, Your partner will likely do or say something that might confuse or alarm you. She might not return a call, or she might make a snide or offensive comment when talking to you. Don't jump to conclusions about her intentions when this happens -- assuming that she's hiding something or deliberately antagonizing you is a great way to insult her and damage your relationship. Instead, assume that there's a perfectly valid, reasonable explanation for whatever she did, and ask to her about it the next time you talk. Always assuming good intentions will foster trust and good feeling, and is crucial in sustaining a long-distance relationship.

, This cannot be stressed enough. A long-distance relationship, even more so than any other relationship, is predicated on mutual trust, and accusing your partner of cheating, or even of wanting to cheat, destroys that trust on both sides of the relationship. Never assume that your partner has been unfaithful, and never confront him or her about it. If you are open with each other and committed to your relationship, she will confess any infidelity to you, and then you can deal with it in a healthy and positive way. If you accuse him or her, you introduce suspicion into both sides of the relationship, ultimately and irreparably damaging it.

, As with any relationship, it's inevitable that you will at some point get annoyed or angry at each other. When this happens, address the conflict calmly. Discuss your disagreement. Make an effort to understand her side, and explain to him or her how you feel. Work together to come up with a solution, and make sure you're both happy with the resolution. Regard disagreements as an opportunity to build up your relationship, rather than something that could tear it apart.

, Understand that a long-distance relationship is difficult for both of you and requires a lot of work and effort, when there are many other things you could be doing with that time and energy. If your partner is worth the sacrifice, you should be happy to make it. But don't let the relationship consume your life. You need time to devote to work, school, family, and your social life apart from your relationship. If it feels like you aren't able to give enough time to your other friends and activities, it may be time to work with your partner to reevaluate your relationship.

, If the only thing you talk about is what you did that day, you're bound to get bored pretty fast, and this can quickly take the heat out of your relationship. Expand your conversations by asking questions, teaching your partner about something new you're learning, discussing books and movies you've enjoyed, or playing a game together.

Go on virtual dates. Watch a movie together online, play a MMORPG or other online game together, or eat the same meal while on the phone together. This can simulate the shared experience that you get from dating in-person, and this will help you build your conversations.






Take an online class together. This will stimulate conversation and challenge yourselves intellectually, which can add new energy to the relationship.






Go back to the beginning of your relationship, where you were just getting to know each other. Ask the same kinds of questions, and focus on learning new things about your partner. There will always be things about her that you don't know, and this can be a great way to renew your interest in the relationship.







, Even if you can't see each other often, always have a place and date set for the next visit. This will give you both something to look forward to. It can guide your relationship and help you move forward together without necessarily entailing definite long-term plans. Make the most out of your visits, even if they are rare, and always be thinking about the next one.

Engage in verbal communication.,
Listen.,
Display non-verbal communication.,
Resolve conflicts in healthy ways.",How to Build Healthy Interpersonal Relationships2," The easiest way to meet people, even briefly, is to start a conversation. Research shows that communication, even when required, actually makes us happier and have a more positive outlook on people generally.Be assertive. Assertiveness is about talking about your thoughts and feelings in appropriate and respectful ways.Be honest. Be transparent with people about who you are. People can sense honesty, and it encourages them to trust you in return. Additionally, beginning a relationship with lies means those lies have to be maintained thence forth, and increases the risk of the lie being exposed, compromising the relationship.Ask open-ended questions. Get people to talk about themselves. Not only does this enable sharing, trust and intimacy, but it helps you guide the conversation toward topics that are comfortable for you., Listening is the first step to building a strong rapport with others.It shows that we value who they are as well as what is being said. Some keys to good listening are:Maintain eye contact: This doesn’t mean staring, but it does mean focusing your attention on the companion as opposed to your phone or a person across the room.
Maintain appropriate body language: Your body language can help reinforce confidence in your companion. Don’t fidget or check your watch. Nod when the other person makes a relevant point.
Don’t interrupt: Let the other person finish before asking “May I ask/add something?” You can, however, show that you are listening by nodding and making affirming noises, like ""Uh-huh,"" or saying something like, ""I see.""
Keep an open-mind: Don’t let fear or bias guide your communication. Demonstrate that you respect the other person, in spite of points on which you do not agree.

, Think carefully about what your non-verbal cues say to others. Non-verbal communication reinforces and accents what we are thinking and feeling.


In order to appear confident in non-verbal communication, try to speak at a normal rate (not too fast or too slow), make frequent eye-contact (but don’t stare, look away sometimes), avoid shaking your legs or fidgeting, and try to keep an open presentation (e.g. no arm crossing)., Conflict, even between like-minded people, is inevitable, and when we are frustrated, it can be easy to say things and act in ways that reflect that frustration and not our values. In order to resolve conflict constructively:Avoid aggressive body language (such as pointing in someone's face, standing too close, rolling your eyes, etc.) or language.
Ask questions and present views fairly.
Refuse to name call or resort to character attacks.
Always remind the other person that you respect his views and the right to have them.

"
"
Empathize.,
Show compassion.,
Give back.",How to Build Healthy Interpersonal Relationships3," Empathy with another person conveys warmth, validation, and caring. It is the foundation of healthy relationships, building upon listening and respect. Empathy requires that we contribute our own similar experiences through conversation and reinforce values that we share with the other person. When someone views you as empathetic, they are more likely to confide, trust, and hold you in esteem, the foundational pillars of a good relationship.

Practice empathy, not sympathy: Sympathy is a feeling a sadness inspired when we hear someone else's pain and focus on our own similar tragedies. Empathy keeps the focus on the other person, attempting to listen to and feel her pain, unique from your own.

, Compassion requires self-analysis to examine the causes of our own pain and inspires unwillingness to inflict that same pain on others. It means supporting the right of others to thrive and be happy, even if we do not always agree with their views. At its base level, compassion is an act of kindness that reassures others that we find them worthy and valuable. Try to enact compassion in your own life by:Offer compassion to those who have mistreated you: Perhaps the hardest act of compassion is to someone we are tempted to believe does not deserve it. The best thing to do is to put yourself in the other person's positions and imagine what events they have gone through that have produced the anger and pain they inflict on others. Allow yourself to feel empathy for that pain, and channel it into kindness and tolerance for that person.
Focus on common ground: People are more alike than different. We all thrive on similar things — love, trust, support, belonging. Just because these desires may manifest outwardly in unique ways does not mean that we are unalike. When you find yourself dwelling on difference, try to shift your focus back to similarities by reminding yourself that, like you, this person is seeking happiness, known suffering, seeks safety, and is still learning about the world.

, Reciprocity is an important component of developing strong connections with others.

Think of ways that you can lift a burden from the shoulders of another, if only for a moment. Showing you are there for someone and really care for them can help deepen your relationship.

Offer acts of kindness. For example, you babysit for free when a neighbor needs a night off from the kids, help a friend move, tutor your little sister in math. Do these things with no expectation of payment or reciprocity — do it simply as a kindness.
Do something nice for others. You could give a gift or words of encouragement.
Show support by lending a helping hand or offering to assist in some way.Share responsibilities in roommate or shared housing situations (such as cleaning and paying bills, etc).

Understand how self-exploration helps your relationships with others.,
Keep a journal.,
Compose a timeline.,
Self-Actualize.",How to Build Healthy Interpersonal Relationships4," While you may want to focus on learning how to have healthy relationships with other people, learning about yourself can actually help you achieve this goal. It is important that you take the time to get to know who you are and what makes you tick, your likes and dislikes, and simply how you experience the world so that you can relate to others in a healthy way.For instance, being aware of things that set you off can keep you from overreacting. Perhaps you felt that your father didn't listen to you when you tried to talk to him, and now you know that you tend to lose your cool when you someone doesn't answer your question right away. If you are aware of this tendency, you can stop yourself before you snap at the person, reminding yourself, ""I'm getting upset because this reminds me of Dad. Susan may be formulating a response, or she simply may not have heard me. There is no need to overreact."" Then you avoid blowing up at Susan and possibly damaging your relationship with her.

, Journaling is a way to let our inner self emerge. It allows us to facilitate dialogue between our ideal self-image and our present self. It can also act as a quiet, centering activity where we confess to page those things we are not ready to speak about. Below are some prompts that can help trigger introspection:Who am I?
What do I love?
What would you tell your older self?

, The purpose of writing a timeline is to take stock of your goals and your progress toward them. This can be helpful, both as a tool of validation for how far you’ve come, and a motivator to keep you striving toward the next milestone. Some things to remember as you are constructing your timeline:


Decide where it will begin and end. It doesn’t have to start with birth.
Make a preliminary list of events that need to be included. This should be based on what you perceive as meaningful and valuable.
Include a title. Come up with something more detailed than, “My life.” The title should both guide how the timeline is read and reflect the values inherent in it’s creation.

, The term “self-actualization” originates with humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow. It describes the process by which we fulfill lower-level needs so that we are then able to fulfill more conceptual needs.. This ideology places strong emphasis on all levels of self-care and embracing ones needs. Those needs are:


Physiological security: food, shelter, warmth, air
Safety: Protection from harm or threat
Belonging: Inclusion in a group, love, the freedom to take what is needed and give unselfishly.
Self-Esteem: Positive self-image
“Being”: the ability to explore abstract creative impulses and fulfill personal meaning.

Pick cat food based on life stage.,
Mix the old with the new food.,
Follow a seven-day transition schedule.,
Use a ten-day transition for older cats.,
Look for signs of difficulty and adjust accordingly.",How to Change Cat Food1," The nutritional needs of your cat will change as they grow and age, so you should change their food when they are making a life transition. If your kitten is becoming a cat or your adult cat is becoming a senior, you should choose a food that is appropriate for their new stage of life.Depending on their health and preferences, you may also want to switch between brands of cat food or between dry and wet varieties of food.;
, Instead of suddenly changing your cat’s food, you should mix their old with their new food. Continue to serve the same size portions but include some new food alongside the old recipe, so that your cat gradually gets used to the new taste. Gradually increase the amount of new food you give your cat., The first rule of transitioning to a new food is to do it slowly. Gradually mix more new food into your cat’s regular, old diet. You could try the following seven-day transition schedule:


From day one to two, give your cat one quarter new food and three quarters old food.
During days three and four, give your cat half new food and half old food.
From day five to six, give your cat three quarters new food and one quarter old food.
On day seven, give your cat a portion of entirely new food.

, Cats older than nine years of age are considered senior.If your cat is senior, you may want to try a longer, ten-day transition schedule:From day one to three, feed your cat a portion consisting of three quarters old food and one quarter new food.
From day four to five, give your cat a portion with fifty percent old food and fifty percent new food. Watch for signs of difficulty such as an upset stomach. If your cat is having trouble, go back to the formula for days one to three for a few days and then continue with the schedule.
From day six to nine, feed your cat a portion containing three quarters old food and one quarter new food.
On day ten, give your cat only the new food.

, During the transition process, look for signs that your cat is having trouble with the new food. If they are experiencing any minor symptoms, you should give them a longer period to adjust to the new food. However, if the symptoms look serious, you should take them to the veterinarian. Look for the following symptoms:Soft stool
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Loss of appetite

Don't feed cats dairy products.,
Don't feed any cat dog food.,
Don't overdo the tuna.,
Don't allow a cat to drink any type of caffeine.,
Don't ever let a cat drink alcohol.,
Don't give a cat any type of sweets, especially sugar free sweets.",How to Avoid Poisoning Your Cat," Cats and cream or milk seem to go hand in hand. We picture a cute cat lapping from a bowl of milk, but in reality, cats cannot properly digest dairy products and it can give them a stomach upset. If you want to give your cat milk then buy milk specially formulated for cats that is free from lactose. Cats will be happy enough just given water to drink though.;
, They may seem to enjoy it, but the balance of nutrients in dog food is completely wrong for the dietary requirements of a cat. A long term dog food diet will lead to malnutrition.

, Cats adore tuna, but you should also be careful with this. A little now and again will be a tasty treat, but if you're feeding your cat tuna as a major part of their diet, they can suffer from malnutrition as although it is delicious, it is lacking in nutrients that your cat needs to stay fit and healthy.

, Caffeine can be lethal to cats so be careful if you leave a cup of tea or coffee where they can get at it. Don't forget there is also caffeine in chocolate. You may feel like you're really treating your cat by offering it a piece of chocolate, but it's very dangerous for them. If you want to give your cat chocolate you can buy commercial chocolate like treats for them, but as cats don't have a sweet tooth, there really is no point.

, They usually won't like the smell of it, but be careful if you have a glass within their reach. Even a teaspoon of a strong spirit can kill a cat. Raisins and grapes can cause kidney failure in cats so these should not be fed as a treat. Also be careful if you have a pot of chives on the windowsill or growing in your garden. Onions and chives are poisonous to cats. A small amount shouldn't do them much harm, but eaten in a large quantity they can have a bad effect.

, Sugar free sweets are also dangerous for cats, the ingredient xylitol is often used as a substitute for sugar in such sweets. Cats are very sensitive to this substance and it can cause liver failure.

Determine how much food your cat needs.,
Select the right food for your cat's age and lifestyle.,
Feed your cat a mix of wet and dry food.,
Limit the treats you give your cat.",How to Avoid Overfeeding Your Cat1," The vet should examine your cat to determine its body shape and energy needs. The vet will decide how much food your cat needs based on its ideal body weight. If your cat is overweight, you can discuss how much weight your cat needs to lose and if you need to reduce meal sizes.If you can't talk with the vet about your cat's weight, you should read the cat food package to determine the correct portion size for your cat based on age and weight.;
, While most commercial cat foods are developed to give balanced nutrition, they're made for different stages of your cat's life. Choose a cat food that says it meets all the health requirements established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and pick one based on your cat's life stage. Examples of ages and activity levels include:Kittenhood
Adulthood (senior cat)
Pregnancy and lactation

, If you'd like to change the commercial cat food you give your pet, ask for recommendations from the vet. They may recommend that you add some wet food to your cat's diet if you're currently only feeding dry food. If you'd like to feed your cat a mix of wet and dry food, avoid just adding the wet food. You'll need to reduce the amount of dry food you offer, so your cat doesn't overeat.Your cat needs about 24 to 35 calories for each pound it weighs, so take this into account when deciding what foods to offer.

, It's important to pay attention to all of the food you're feeding your cat, including treats. Treats are fine to occasionally give to your cat, but they shouldn't make up more than 10 to 15% of your cat's overall diet. To keep your cat a healthy weight, avoid giving these treats:Raw meat
Milk
Food scraps

Return the kitten to her warm bed or box to rest.",How to Feed a Newborn Kitten," Consult with local veterinarians and shelters to find out if there is a nursing mother cat who may be able to take on the kitten. Mother's milk is best for any baby mammal, and prior to attempting to bottle feed a kitten with supplemental formulas, it is recommended to seek out nursing cat that could take the place of the absent or unable mother.Be aware that even if you find a cat able to nurse the young kitten, she may not accept the kitten. Always remain present when the nursing cat interacts with your kitten; there is a risk that a queen might attempt to murder a kitten that she rejects.
If you are lucky enough to find a foster mother, attempt to disguise the smell of the new kitten. Try stroking the foster mother's own kittens and then stroke your own kitten. This will help transfer the smell of the mother's own litter to your newborn kitten. A queen (the cat) is more likely to reject the kitten if it smells totally unfamiliar, so by ""disguising"" your kitten's scent, you're increasing the chance the queen will accept her.;
, A newborn kitten can only digest milk, and more specifically the milk from a female cat. Feeding the wrong sort of milk, such as cow's milk, can have short-term and long-term effects, including diarrhea, dehydration, nutritional deficiencies and long-term health problems due to poor growth. You can purchase kitten milk replacement formula (KMR) at your local pet food store, vet's office, and even online. Reputable brands in the United States include Cimicat and Just Born kitten milk, but you can also consult your local vet for advice on a formula that he or she recommends and that is available where you live.Kitten milk replacement milk comes in a tub or drum and is a dry powder or liquid. You use it in much the same way you use infant formula, in that you follow the directions on the packaging which guides you as to how many scoops to use to how much water.
Be aware that milk sold in cartons as ""cat milk"" is NOT suitable. This is cow's milk with the lactose removed and is designed to make bovine milk accessible to adult cats (to fulfill our need to feed them milk, rather than any physiological need of the cats themselves.) It is not suitable for use in kittens.

, The ideal milk is to use replacement queen's milk. If you do not have any, then use boiled water to feed the kitten and purchase some replacement milk immediately. If the kitten seems very hungry, then you can add one teaspoon of glucose powder to one cup of boiled water. However, you should only do for one feeding. Do not repeat.Another alternative as a stop gap until you can get some replacement milk is to use rice water, meaning the water that you cook rice in. Cook some white rice in water and strain off the liquid. This has a little starch (energy) in it and is non-laxative, and can be a temporary solution.
Giving water in the interim will stop the kitten getting dehydrated, and is a better compromise than feeding something (like cow's milk) which could upset her tummy and make her ill.

, Remember that the younger the kitten, the higher the kitten's metabolism and the more often she needs to be fed (due to her tiny stomach). This means that you, or someone else in your household or a friend or neighbor, needs to be around all day until the kitten is old enough to begin switching over to solids.


A newborn kitten, technically a kitten under two weeks of age, needs feeding attention day and night until she is old enough to begin the process of switching to solids.

, Weaning means to get the kitten off milk and introduce solids slowly. You can do this once the kitten reaches four weeks of age, when your kitten is no longer a newborn. You can tell when your kitten is no longer a newborn and is ready to be weaned and be fed solids when she starts biting at the nipple of the bottle.To wean your kitten from milk, place a small amount of food in her dish. If she doesn't seem ready or willing to eat it, you can add a few tablespoons of milk replacement formula or water to soften the food and encourage her interest. Make sure to always have solid food out so that your kitten can approach it when she feels ready and wants to. Over time, reduce the amount of milk you offer as you increase the amount of solids.
Most kittens can handle a diet of solids by seven weeks of age.
A kitten aged between six to 10 weeks old needs to be fed six to eight meals a day, while a kitten aged 10 weeks to six or seven months needs four meals a day and a kitten up to nine months needs three meals a day. Note that it's not until adulthood that two meals a day for a cat is acceptable.

, To feed your newborn kitten you will need some sort of feeding device. If possible, you should use bottle and teat set specifically designed for use with kittens, such as the Catac bottle and teat set. The bottle itself is very small, and it has an open end at the top so the you can place a thumb over it to control the flow of milk if it is dripping too fast from the teat and overwhelming the kitten. The teat is long and narrow, which is ideal to fit inside the mouth of a newborn kitten. This allows the kitten to suckle, as if from her mother.


If you do not have a feeding set, then the next best option is a syringe, which you can use to drip the milk into the kitten's mouth. However, the kitten cannot suckle from a syringe, so try and buy a feeder at the earliest opportunity.

, It is crucial to keep all your equipment sterile. Simply washing everything is insufficient. Consider using a steam sterilizer (as for a baby's bottles) or immerse the equipment in a dilution of Milton sterilizing fluid in a bowl.You can purchase Milton sterilizing fluid from drug stores, usually find in the baby aisle. Follow the directions on the packaging. If you do opt to sterilize your cat feeding equipment with the Milton fluid, be sure to rinse everything off with boiled water prior to use in order to wash away any residue of the sterilizing solution.

, If using liquid formula, open the can and measure the required amount according to the packaging. If using powder formula, follow the directions on the packaging regarding how many scoops and how much water to use. Always follow the directions closely because too concentrated a milk could cause stomach upset, while too strong a milk lacks nutrition for your kitten.


Always make the milk up fresh for each feed. The milk does not contain preservatives and newborn kittens have weak immune systems, so any bacterial contamination of milk that stands around could be disastrous for the kitten's health.
Do not put the formula in the microwave; this will cause bubbles of very hot or very cold formula to form in the bottle. Instead, put the formula in a container and put that into the hot water.
Make sure the milk is at the correct temperature - neither cold nor hot. Ideally, the milk should be at body temperature, so when you place a few drops of it onto the back of your hand, it feels about the same temperature as your skin. If it is too hot, the milk could burn your kitten's mouth.

, When you are ready to feed the kitten, make sure she is warm. To some degree, a kitten's rate of digestion depends on her temperature. If she is cool, her digestion is sluggish and the milk will sit in her stomach and ferment. Newborns usually snuggle close to mum and tend to run quite hot. The ideal temperature is 96-100 degrees F for the first three weeks of life.Try to keep your kitten at this temperature by using a heat pad underneath a well insulated nest. If you don't have a heat pad, then use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel to prevent direct contact with the hot bottle which could cause burns. Replenish the hot water bottle as often as needed to keep it warm., Sit in a comfortable chair with a towel folded on your lap. Position the kitten similarly to the way he would nurse from his mother, with her head straight, feet down, and stomach resting. When attempting to feed your kitten for the first time, get a drip of milk on the end of the syringe or teat. Hold it very close to the kitten's mouth. Her sense of smell is strong, and she will likely smell the milk and try put her mouth against it.If using a teat, at this point give her a bit of help by wriggling the teat into her open mouth. Nature should then take over and she starts to suck.
If using a syringe, gently press on the plunger to release a drop into her mouth. Let her swallow between drops. Never flood her mouth with milk as she may well breath the milk, get milk in the lungs and develop pneumonia, which is usually fatal in young kittens. Just take your time and go slowly.The kitten's posture is very important. Never feed a kitten on her back like a human baby and always make sure sure the kitten is resting on something when feeding. Make sure that the head is not raised as this could cause aspiration, the inhaling of formula into the lungs, which is serious and can even be fatal., Cimicat and other KMRs come with a guide to how much to feed and how often on the pack. Follow the instructions on the package. Here are some general guidelines about how much to feed your kitten in the first few weeks of her life and how often:.


One to three days: 2.5ml of KMR every two hours
Four to seven days: 5ml of KMR 10 to 12 feeds a day
Six to 10 days: 5 to 7.5ml KMR 10 feeds a day
11 to 14 days: 10 to 12.5ml KMR every three hours
15 to 21 days: 10 ml eight times daily
21 days and beyond: 7.5 to 25 ml, three to four times daily, in addition to introducing solid food

, When learning how and practicing to bottle feed a kitten, keep in mind that overfeeding or feeding improperly can cause problems with respiration. Observe your kitten during feedings to ensure that no milk is coming through the nose or the stomach does not feel distended.


In terms of quantity, if you have a greedy kitten and she keeps sucking even though she's exceeded the recommended amount, look at her tummy. If her belly is tight and distended, then stop feeding. This is a sign that her stomach is full but that she just hasn't realized it yet. Do not overfeed.If your kitten takes less than the recommended amount, don't panic. This may be the kitten's individual preference. If you are worried she hasn't taken enough, rather than push her to take more and risk flooding her lungs, stop, let her rest and try again an hour or so later. , It is important to remain patient and calm while bottle feeding a kitten to ensure that the kitten is at ease. In addition, allow the kitten to take his time while bottle feeding to avoid overeating or problems with digestion.


Encourage and stimulate burping by holding the kitten with his back resting against your body and gently rubbing his stomach. In the queen and kitten relationship, the mother will groom the kitten to help him pass wind and stools. Don't be surprised by either result – it's a good sign!, Immediately after each feed the mother cat licks her kittens' anus and genital areas, to encourage them to urinate and defecate. The mother actually laps up their excretions, which is nature's way of avoiding a soiled nest which could attract predators. Without the mother, however, you need to step in. Use damp cotton wool and wipe it over the anal area in a licking motion. As the kitten relieves herself, wipe it away with the cotton wool. Finish with a clean piece of cotton wool to clean up her bottom, and then you are done until the next feed.This is an important step in feeding your kitten successfully. If you do not mimic the mother's stimulation of her kitten's elimination, your kitten will not empty her bladder and bowels and can become very ill.

, Continue with the regular feeding schedule every day for the coming weeks until weaning onto solids is appropriate. At this time, speak to your vet about an appropriate weaning diet.


Add solid foods such as soft, canned foods and hard foods to the diet when the kitten is around four weeks old. Some kittens will bottle feed for up to eight weeks and this progress should be communicated with a veterinary professional.

Create a quiet, relaxing place to eat.,
Serve canned food at body temperature.,
Serve your cat by hand.",How to Change Cat Food2," Since changing foods can be stressful for cats, you want to make a really relaxing, hospitable dining area. Make sure you feed them in a quiet area, away from noisy parts of your home and other cats., If the new diet includes canned food, you should take it out of the refrigerator and let it adjust to room temperature before serving. You could also put it in the microwave for a few seconds. Mix the canned food so that the whole meal is at a uniform temperature.Serve canned food in a flat dish. It is better to serve canned food in a flat dish, since your cat could get annoyed if there is no space for their whiskers.

, Try putting a bit of the new food in your hand and offering it to your cat. If you have a good relationship with the cat, it can help to hand feed them during the transition process."

Consult your veterinarian about changing cat foods.,
Switch to an adult formula when your cat stops growing.,
Transition to a weight control formula if your cat is obese.,
Change cat food when your cat becomes a senior.,
Change your cat’s food if they have specific health problems.",How to Change Cat Food3," If you are unsure about when to switch from a kitten to an adult formula or otherwise change your cat’s diet, you should talk to your veterinarian. They should be able to tell you when to switch, as well as whether you should expect your cat to gain or lose weight during the transition process., Most cats will stop growing at around one-year old, although some breeds will take a little longer to reach adult size. If your cat has stopped growing, you can switch from kitten to adult food.For instance, the Maine Coon reaches adult size at around 18 months.
During the transition, you should watch their weight and health. If they look under or overweight, adjust their portion sizes accordingly., If your cat is getting overweight, you should transition them to a weight control formula. Consult your veterinarian about an appropriate weight control formula.If your cat is more than twenty-percent above their normal body weight, they are considered obese.Typically, a ten pound cat needs between 180 and 200 calories per day.Fifty five percent of cats in the United States are overweight., If your cat recently became a senior, you should transition them from their adult food to a senior cat food. A senior cat food should have more fiber, fewer calories and more highly digestible protein.If your cat recently turned nine or ten, they are considered senior and can be transitioned to the new food.Factors to consider when choosing a senior food include fat absorption, digestibility, joint and mobility issues, kidney considerations, weight loss and gain.Ingredients to look for in a senior cat food include beet pulp, glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, L-Carnitine, vitamin E and good quality protein., You can get specialized cat foods for health conditions, such as sensitive skin, urinary tract problems, and stomach issues. Ask your veterinarian if there is a cat food that will help with your cat’s specific health problems."

Put the food in a puzzle or cat toy.",How to Avoid Overfeeding Your Cat2," If your cat always has access to food in its dish, it can easily overeat. Instead of allowing your cat to graze, feed your cat at set meal times. If you have an adult cat, feed the cat a few small meals during the day.If you have a kitten, you may need to give it three smaller meals each day.

, If you're feeding your cat several small meals a day or if you're feeding several cats, it may be hard to remember how much food you've already given them during the day. To prevent overfeeding your cat, measure out how much food you want to give your cat for the whole day.Remember that the exact amount of food you measure out will depend on your cat’s needs.

, Place the daily amount of food into a smaller container that you can divide up at meal and snack times. For example, if your cat can have one cup of cat food in a day, but you like to divide it into a few meals and a treat, start by measuring out one cup of food into a container. You could give your cat a little over 1/3 of a cup of the food for each meal and have some leftover for treats.If you have multiple cats, keep separate containers for each cat, since they may have different dietary needs.

, If you're in the habit of pouring food out of the bag into your cat's food bowl, start measuring the food with a cup. This will ensure that you're giving your cat the recommended amount of food. Measure the food into the cup and brush the excess food off of the top, so the cup of food is level, not heaping.

If your cat's food bowl has measurement lines on the side, you should still fill a separate measuring up and pour the food in. It's very easy to overfill the dish when you're pouring into it.

, You should always have fresh water available for your cat. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day will help your cat digest its food and can help it feel fuller. Remember to wash your cat's water dish frequently.If your cat eats dry food, it's even more important to offer lots of dry water. This is because dry cat food doesn't contain very much moisture.

, One of the best ways to keep your cat a healthy weight is to keep your cat active. Instead of setting treats at set times, challenge your cat by putting the treat into a food puzzle or cat toy. Your cat will spend time and energy to get to the food.

This will also slow your cat down when it eats, since the cat will probably only be able to get a few pieces of treat at a time.

Clear, see-through puzzles
Puzzles with numerous openings;
, Place your cat’s favorite dry food and/or treats in the puzzle, and place the puzzle in plain view. In the beginning, it is important for you to keep puzzles at least half full. This will make it easier for your cat to get the food out, and help them stay interested in the puzzles., To help spark your cat’s interest in the puzzle, sprinkle a bit of dry food or treats around it. This will encourage your cat’s curiosity, as well as providing a positive association between the puzzle and yummy food for your cat."

Identify possible causes of a behavioral problem.",How to Stop a Cat from Pulling Its Hair Out," If humans have an allergy, say for instance hay fever, we tend to get sore eyes, a runny nose, and sneeze. Cats, however, react differently. The commonest manifestation of an allergy in cats is itchy skin, which in turns results in excessive grooming and pulling hair out.


In much the same way that some people have a peanut allergy, or a seafood allergy, or get hay fever, a cat may be allergic to one substance and be fine with another.;
, Potentially anything in the environment can be an allergen, if the cat is sensitive to it. Common allergens include house dust mites, grass pollens, tree pollens, and flea bites.If your cat has an allergy to pollen, you may notice their over-grooming becomes worse in the seasons when that pollen is around, such as in the spring for trees, or summer for grasses. There is also a wide overlap in reaction to many pollens and so it might be the cat only gets relief in the winter, when there are very few pollens around to trigger the reaction.
Other substances act as irritants (subtly different from an allergy, but producing the same effect). This might be things like spray deodorants, perfumes, or hairspray that are used near the cat and land on its coat, causing irritation.

, Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult to diagnose the exact allergen which the cat is reacting against. Blood tests or skin prick tests that can be run on dogs, yield almost random (and very unreliable) results in the cat.This means your veterinarian will reach a diagnosis by eliminating other possible causes of skin irritation (such as parasites, food allergy, and behavioral causes) and then seeing if the over-grooming settles with treatment.

, Remove as many possible causes of allergy or irritation as possible. Do not spray aerosols near the cat, stop using scented candles (the odor clings to fur and can trigger grooming to get rid of it), air fresheners, and vacuum daily to decrease house dust mite numbers.


The effectiveness of this approach may be limited if the cat reacts to pollens, in which case drug therapy may be required.

, The vet will first make a judgement call as to whether treatment is necessary or not. The drugs used to decrease itch can have side effects and your vet should make an educated decision about whether the benefits outweigh the risks.


If the cat is pulling its fur out and making the skin inflamed, red, infected or ulcerated, then drug therapy is indicated. If it's a case of a few shorter furred areas, then it probably isn't. The decision to treat or not is one for you to decide in consultation with your vet.
The drugs commonly used are anti-inflammatories. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone are cheap and effective. An average sized cat is usually given a 5 mg tablet once daily with or after food for 5 to 10 days (depending on how itchy he is) and the dose reduced to one tablet every other day for the duration of the pollen season.
Where possible, medication is stopped over the winter. Whilst cats are relatively resistant to the side effects of steroids, when compared to people or dogs, the risk include increased thirst and appetite (leading to weight gain), and an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes). You should discuss your cat's individual risk of side effects with your veterinarian., Antibiotics may be necessary if your cat has pulled the fur out and made the skin sore or infected. In this case the skin may glisten, or appear moist, there may be a sticky discharge or the area smells.


You can help at home by gently bathing the infected area twice a day with a salt water solution and then patting the skin dry. To make up a saltwater solution, boil the kettle, then dissolve one teaspoon of regular table salt into one pint of previously boiled water. Keep this solution in a clean container and soak a clean ball of cotton wool each time., Another common cause of skin irritation, which results in pulling out fur, is food allergy. When the cat eats a food they are allergic to, this triggers a mechanism which makes the skin intensely itchy. These allergies are usually to a particular protein in the diet (like a nut allergy in people).

, The good news about food allergy is that by avoiding the food allergen the cat can be 'cured' and stops being itchy. However, once again, there is no reliable lab test for food allergy. A diagnosis is made by putting the cat onto a low allergy or hypoallergenic diet.


The easiest way to put your cat on a hypoallergenic diet is to speak to your vet about a prescription diet. Diets such as Hills DD, Hills ZD, Hills ZD ultra, or Purina HA are made in such a way that the protein molecules it contains are too small to physically bridge receptors in the gut wall that trigger an allergic reaction.
The alternative is to analyze all the food your cat eats and then find a food that contains NONE of those previous ingredients.
It can take up to 8 weeks for the previous allergen to clear the system and the symptoms subside, so don't expect a quick result. Whilst on the dietary trial, you must feed the hypoallergenic diet exclusively, so that you don't accidentally give a treat containing an allergen.
If the cat does have a food allergy, your choices are either to continue feeding the hypoallergenic diet, or to add in one new food every fortnight, and wait to see if the itching restarts, before declaring that food is OK for your cat.

, A common cause of skin irritation are parasites, especially fleas. When a flea bites it injects saliva into the cat's skin, which acts as a potent allergen. If your cat pulls its hair out, it is a basic requirement to treat the cat monthly against fleas, and use an environmental spray to eliminate flea eggs and larvae in the house.Examples of effective products are fipronil, available without a prescription, and selamectin, which is called Revolution in the US and Stronghold in the UK, and is available with a prescription only.Use a treatment regardless of whether you see evidence of fleas or not. This is because it only takes one flea bite to trigger the reaction, and since the flea doesn't live on the pet, he may be long gone and yet the cat is still itchy.

, When a cat grooms the body releases endorphins, which are a natural form of morphine. This makes the cat feel good and many cats over-groom specifically because they get hooked on the endorphins. This is especially true if the cat feels stressed for some reason because the licking offers a form of stress relief.Try to identify why the cat is stressed. Perhaps there has been an intruder cat in the house, or you've recently got a new pet. Addressing the underlying cause is likely to be the answer.
In addition, you can use Feliway, which is a synthetic version of the feline pheromone (chemical messenger) which makes the cat feel safe and secure. Feliway comes as a spray and a room diffuser, and the later is the best option because it works constantly in the background."

Some of the best kitten milk replacement formulas are Nutri Vet, Hartz, Just Born, Nurturall-C and Pet Lac. These have all the necessary nutrients needed by kittens to thrive. They can be found at a good pet supply store.
You should never give a kitten cow or goat milk as it can give the little one diarrhea.;
, Some people try to make their own formula, but it is best if you stick to the store-bought ones recommended above. Newborn kittens have a delicate digestive system and you risk upsetting it if you make even a slight mistake in mixing the formula.

, Thankfully, there are specially-designed kitten feeding bottles available to buy in pet supply stores. These bottles have a nipple without any holes, so that you can make a small hole according to the individual kitten’s requirement.


You can make a hole by heating a needle and simply puncturing the nipple from the tip.
Since you do not want the kitten to choke, you should only make a small hole which allows one drop to escape at a time, or two at the most.

, If you think feeding the kitten with a bottle might be too difficult for you, you can buy a small syringe designed for feeding kittens. This works well for the first few weeks, when very small kittens won’t be able to take more than a few cc at a time.


Alternatively, a small dropper used to administer medicine to babies can also be used to feed a newborn kitten. You can get these from any pharmacy or a grocery store.
Just make sure that you get more than one so that you have extras in case one doesn't work properly.

, Once you have purchased the feeding bottle, syringe or dropper, the next step is to sterilize it all. You can simply fill half a pan with water and bring it to boil. Turn off the stove, put everything in the pan and cover it with a lid.


This helps to clean the instruments thoroughly, making them completely free of germs. You need to sterilize even the new equipment because it might have germs from being handled by people in the store.
If you want to be extremely careful, you’ll have to sterilize the equipment before every feed. Otherwise, you can just wash it properly after every feeding session and sterilize it once every day.

, Every kitten replacement formula comes with instructions on how much formula you need to mix in how many cubic centimeters or millimeters of water to get the best results. Make sure that you follow these directions exactly, to ensure that the kitten gets the correct amount of nutrition.


The milk should be warmed to about 95 °F (35 °C), or body temperature.
You should always mix the formula just before feeding time. If it has been sitting for more than 3 hours, don’t use it.

, When you feed the kitten, hold it horizontally with the belly facing downwards and the head tilted slightly upwards. Basically, it is the complete opposite position to how you would hold a human baby when feeding him.

, Try feeding the kitten a few drops of milk at a time using a syringe or a dropper. If you are using a feeding bottle, insert the nipple into the kitten’s mouth and gently squeeze it to allow milk to flow.


Make sure that the flow from the bottle slow and steady, as too strong a flow will cause the milk to come out from the kitten's nostrils.
In case this happens, stop feeding immediately and give the kitten a break for a few minutes. Once you resume feeding, try to regulate the flow more carefully.

, Most people do not know how much formula should be given to a newborn kitten and often end up overfeeding. As a general rule, a newborn kitten will nurse for 5 to 10 minutes at a time, never more than that.


During the first week, feed the kitten 32 cc of formula every two hours.There should never be a gap of more than 4 hours between feedings.
Keep increasing the feed gradually so that you reach 80 cc by week three and 100 cc by week four.

, Once you have fed the kitten, you need to help it eliminate gas by burping. Hold the kitten with its belly facing upwards and gently rub his stomach. Continue to do this for 5 to 10 minutes until the kitten burps and then let it go.


You’ll have to repeat this procedure after every feed until the kitten is old enough to play around and get plenty of exercise after feeding, which helps in eliminating gas.

, Once the kitten is four and a half weeks old, you can start weaning by gradually introducing moist food. Between 7 to 8 weeks, kittens are able to eat moistened cat food. At this point you can also start feeding them diluted goat or cow milk instead of formula.

, Kittens tend to get chilly very easily, especially if they have been outdoors for long periods of time. To check if the baby kitten is too cold, touch the paws and see if they are cold from underneath.


If the kitten is cold, it will either reject feeding or will not be able to digest it. Arrange a box with clean blankets and ensure that all of it is completely dry.
You might have to change the sheets often to keep it clean. If the kitten is kept in a clean and warm environment, it will eat more and stay healthy.

, Even though kitten milk formulas are very nutritious, there is no real replacement to mother’s milk. Therefore, a kitten’s best chance for survival is if it stays with the mother until it is at least 8 weeks old.


Before you adopt a kitten, make sure that it is over 8 weeks old — a kitten shouldn't be separated from its mother any earlier than this, if it can be avoided.

, Taking care of a baby kitten can be a huge challenge, even for someone who has done it before. The kitten will need your complete and undivided attention — you will have to be vigilant about monitoring its body temperature, food, and activity levels at all times.

, If you have never taken care of a baby kitten before and are now faced with a situation where you have to feed it, you should seriously consider checking with a shelter to see if they can take the kitten and look after it.


Most animal shelters have good facilities and experienced staff, so the chances of a baby kitten surviving without its mother are much higher.
Some shelters and vet clinics also have foster feline mothers who can feed the kitten as their own until it becomes stronger and healthier.

Puzzles with smaller holes
Puzzles that are opaque
Puzzle that don't roll as easily (like a cube-shaped toy)

, Another way to increase the challenge and keep your cat engaged it to mix other objects—such as ping pong balls, little toy mice, or other cat toys—with the food in the puzzles. This way, your cat might not receive a snack every time they get something out of the toy., You can also make it more challenging for your cat by simply placing the puzzles in new locations! Put puzzles in places your cat needs to work to access, or new and usual places in your house.You might try placing them:

Use an X-acto knife to cut out these shapes.
Return the lid to the box and secure it with tape or glue.
Place dry food and/or treats inside.

, Another DIY food puzzle option is to use a toilet paper or paper towel roll. These puzzles are small and easy to make, so you can place several around your house.Use an X-acto knife to cut holes in the tube a little larger than the food/treats.
Seal the ends of the tube, but either (a) folding the ends in or (b) using packing tape.
Fill the tube with food through the holes you created.

, You can create a DIY cat puzzle very simply using a plastic water bottle. The added benefit to using the water bottle is that it makes a funny sounds that cats seem to enjoy.Use an X-acto knife to cut holes in a plastic water bottle, just larger than the food/treats.
Fill the bottle with food/treats.
Tightly close the lid.

Play with your cat in the snow.,
Encourage your cat to hang out in the outdoor shelter.,
Take your cat for a short winter stroll.,
Check your cat for frostbite.,
Make sure your cat is not hiding in any dangerous areas.,
Be careful when using antifreeze.,
Never leave your cat in your car.,
Don't leave your cat out in the snow for a prolonged period of time.",How to Get a Cat Used to Snow," You can protect your cat from the elements and get her more used to the snow by building her an outdoor shelter for cold weather. You can use a storage bin that is just a bit bigger than your cat to create the shelter or build one out of wood. Make sure the shelter is not too big, as you want your cat to be able to stay warm with her own body heat.You should fill the shelter with stray or loosely stuff a pillowcase with packing peanuts or shredded newspaper and put it in the shelter. This will help your cat burrow and keep warm in the shelter.
You could also paper the inner walls of the shelter with reflective paper or insulation so your cat stays warm in the shelter.
Make sure you clean the shelter regularly and replace any dirty or wet straw. You should also monitor your cat in the shelter and check on her often to make sure she is staying warm.;
, You can also help your cat embrace snow and cold weather by getting her a pair of winter booties for her feet. Protecting her feet during winter is important, as her paws can be hurt by snow, salt, and chemical de-icers on the pavement. You should invest in a pair of well made winter boots for your cat so she can walk around in the snow with ease.You can find winter boots for cats online or at your local pet store. You may ask a sales associate at the pet store to recommend winter boots for your cat, based on your budget and the level of quality you are looking for.

, Getting a heated water bowl for your cat will ensure her water does not freeze up when it is placed outside in the winter. Cats cannot get enough hydration from licking ice and you do not want to put your cat at risk of dehydration while she is frolicking outside in the snow.You can find heated water bowls at your local pet store or online. You can also find solar-heated water bowls which use the heat of the sun to stay warm.

, You can get your cat used to snow by encouraging her to play with you outside during the winter. You may take her favorite batting toy outside and coax her to have a play session with you in the snow. Or you move her favorite scratching pad out into the snow so she can get used to playing in the colder temperatures.


You may try to play with your cat in the snow at least once a day so she gets more comfortable with frolicking in the winter weather. You should reward her with a treat if she goes outdoors willingly. Over time, she may come to embrace the snow and enjoy playing outside with you.

, You may also try getting your cat to hang out in an outdoor cat shelter in your yard so she gets more used to the cold. You may play with her around the shelter or leave catnip for her in the shelter to get her more interested in lounging in the shelter, surrounded by snow.Make sure you check on your cat periodically when she is in the shelter to ensure she appears warm and cozy in there. Do not leave her in the shelter for long periods of time or overnight, as she will be at risk of freezing to death.
You should not leave water dishes or food in the cat shelter as they can spill and make the floor of shelter moist, which could end up cooling the shelter down to dangerously low temperatures for your cat.

, You can also get your cat more used to the snow by taking her on short walks during the winter. You may invest in a cat leash for her and winter boots to protect her paws. You could then try to take her on daily walks around the block on the leash during the winter to get her more accustomed to the weather.Always be careful when walking your cat in the snow, as you do not want her to become injured due to slipping on black ice. Wipe her paws if she gets ice or salt on them as you do not want to put your cat at risk of frostbite.
You may also invest in a small jacket for your cat to keep her warm in the cold, though most cats have fur that is thick enough for cold weather.

, If your cat ends up spending time outside in the snow, you should check her periodically for any signs of frostbite. Look for the signs of frostbite on your cat, including:Any pale or bluish skin on your cat’s ears, nose, tail, and toes
Any red or swollen areas on your cat
The affected area may not become painful until circulation returns to the area so your cat may not be in any obvious pain. But if you suspect your cat has frostbite, you should immerse the area in warm water for 15 to 30 minutes or put a warm moist towel on the area.
Do not rub the area as this will irritate the skin more. If the skin turns dark red, this may indicate severe tissue damage and your cat should be taken to the vet right away.

, If you decide to let your cat roam outside during the winter, you should take precautions to ensure she does not get injured. Cats tend to try to stay warm by holing up in your car engine compartment or close to your car engine.You can prevent your cat from getting injured or killed by banging on the hood of your car a few times before you start it. The noise will usually startle your cat and force her to get out of there.
You should also try to keep tabs on your cat when she is roaming around outside. Try to keep her in your backyard area only or close to her outdoor shelter.
You should get in the habit of checking for her in warm, cozy spots outside, such as the inside of your car, inside your garage, or burrowed in a hidden spot by your house.

, Most antifreeze tastes sweet to cats and they will often ingest is willingly without knowing it is toxic to their health. You should try not to use antifreeze in areas where your cat will be outdoors so she is not at risk of illness.If you do end up using antifreeze for your car, make sure you clean up any puddles of antifreeze in your driveway or your garage. You should seal and store away all antifreeze containers as well so your cat cannot get to them.

, You should avoid leaving your cat in a cold car during winter, as it can act like a freezer for them. When the temperatures dip in the car, your cat could end up developing hypothermia or dying due to exposure to the cold. Make sure your cat is indoors or under your supervision outside during the winter so she does not accidentally freeze to death in the car., Though your cat can handle some playtime and supervised lounging in the snow, she should not be left out in the snow for more than an hour at a time or overnight. Domesticated cats are not equipped with the survival skills to last in the cold and they are at a high risk of hypothermia or death due to exposure to the cold if they are left outside for too long.

Pick a high-quality cat food.,
Choose a food made for senior cats.,
Discuss food options with your veterinarian.",How to Feed a Senior Cat1," As a cat ages, it's important that it gets good quality food that supports its health. A food that in high in animal protein and provides all necessary vitamins and minerals is key. You can assess the quality of a cat food by looking at the ingredient list and making sure that the first few ingredients are all animal tissue or animal byproducts.It's also a good idea to look for a certification stamp from a governing body, such as the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). This means that the food meets minimum nutritional standards.;
, There are special foods that are produced with the the dietary needs of older cats in mind. They have different levels of nutrients than foods made for kittens or adult cats. If you have a senior cat, consider feeding it one of these special diets.Not all foods made for older cats are the same. Some are higher in calories and are made for cats that are not eating enough. Some are lower in calories and are made for cats that are eating too many calories in old age. Some have added vitamins and minerals that should help with age related health issues.
Because of all of the variation in senior foods, it's important to know what your cat's health issues are and to look closely at the packaging of foods you are considering.

, One of the easiest ways to choose a new food for your senior cat is to ask your veterinarian for suggestions. The veterinarian knows your cat and its dietary needs, so they can steer you towards a food that will fulfill those needs.In some cases, your veterinary office will sell food for cats. If this is the case, and your veterinarian suggests the food they are selling, just double check with the veterinarian that your cat actually needs this food and make sure the price is within your budget.

Stick to a feeding routine.,
Do not respond to begging.,
Switch to an automatic feeder.,
Consider a food puzzle.,
Talk to a vet about a special diet.",How to Get a Cat to Stop Meowing1," Cats often meow to beg for food. If you respond to the noise, the cat learns that this is effective. Feed the cat on a strict schedule instead of waiting for a vocal reminder.Most healthy adult cats do fine with one or two meals per day, but may be happier with more frequent, smaller meals.Kittens under six months old need at least three meals a day.This only applies to food, not water. Cats need access to clean drinking water at all times of day and night.;
, This takes patience, since your pet's first response will often be to meow even more. It's important to let this behavior play itself out without acknowledging it, not even in a negative way.Eventually, the cat will learn that meowing no longer works as a way to get your attention.


If it's approaching mealtime and the cat starts to meow, move to another room and shut the door. Come out when the cat stops meowing to fill the food bowl.
Some cats meow in the morning because they associate you getting up with their morning meal. Wait at least ten minutes after getting up to break this association., A feeder that dispenses food at regularly scheduled times may refocus a hungry cat's attention on the machine instead of on you. This also helps the cat learn the mealtime routine., If your cat's behavior doesn't improve after a week or two on a strict meal schedule, consider measuring out the daily requirement of dry food into a ""food puzzle"" instead. These devices let the cat access food at any time without bothering you. Unlike a constantly full cat bowl, however, the food puzzle keeps the cat stimulated and prevents overeating., If your cat still meows at the food bowl often, ask a veterinarian for advice. Fiber supplements are one option that can help your cat feel fuller, but try them only under veterinary supervision.Finding the right type of fiber may take trial and error, and too much of it can cause digestive issues.Other cats respond better to small, high-protein meals.A veterinarian can also examine your cat for possible medical issues that cause excessive hunger.

Do not give your cat onions, garlic, or chives.,
Never give your cat grapes, raisins, or avocados.,
Do not feed your cat uncooked potatoes or tomatoes.,
Never give your cat dairy products.",How to Avoid Feeding Your Cat Harmful People Foods1," Onions, garlic, and chives contain properties that can cause anemia if consumed by your cat. This can also lead to jaundice and damage your cat’s red blood cells. Even a few slices of onions, garlic, or chives can be toxic for cats.This applies to uncooked and cooked onions, garlic, and chives.;
, You may be tempted to give grapes, raisins, or slices of avocado to your cat as healthy treats. Avoid the temptation. These foods can all cause adverse effects in your cat like vomiting, kidney failure, and diarrhea., Uncooked potatoes and tomatoes are from the nightshade family, which can be deadly for cats when eaten raw. Giving your cat uncooked potatoes and unripe tomatoes can cause gastrointestinal distress for your cat.When cooked, however, brown potatoes are safe for cats to eat. Green potatoes should not be given to cats, raw or cooked.
All the green parts of a tomato plant, including the stem and leaves, are unsafe for cats to eat. Red ripe tomatoes are fine, but avoid green unripe ones.

, Though kittens can have cow’s milk, adult cats are often lactose intolerant and cannot digest dairy products properly. Dairy products like cow’s milk, cheese, yogurt, or butter can be harmful to cats.Consuming dairy products can cause diarrhea, upset stomach, and vomiting in cats since cats do not have the enzyme lactose that would break down the milk sugar for them.
You can give your cat lactose-free milk or live culture yogurt, as they do not contain lactose and are safe for cats to eat at any age.

Determine exactly where the cat is if you can't see it right away.,
Lock away any dogs in the area.The goal is to calm the cat down and make it comfortable enough to come out of the tree on its own.,
Try to coax the cat down before trying to physically remove it.,
Use treats or other incentives to coax the cat down.,
Use a laser pointer to lure the cat down.,
Keep an eye on the cat but give it time to come down on its own.,
Decide to take more active measures to get the cat down from the tree.",How to Get a Cat out of a Tree1," What part of the tree is it stuck in and how high up is it? Figuring out exactly where the cat is will help you decide how to help it out of the tree.;
, Dogs will just get over-excited by having the cat up a tree and cause the cat more stress.

, Call up to the cat. If the cat is not yours, try to find its owner and have them call to the cat. A cat is more likely to come to a person that it knows.


Clicker training can be very helpful if your cat repeatedly gets stuck in trees. Using a clicker to reinforce the behavior, you can train your cat to come when you call their name. This kind of training can sometimes override fear and hesitation in the cat.

, If it's your cat, use the treat that they like best. If you don't know the cat, try using a treat that smells strongly, such as tuna.


Leave a bowl of dry food at the base of the tree and then walk away. If the cat doesn't know you, it's best to walk away and let the cat come down for the food.

, If the cat likes to play with the dot from a laser pointer, you may be able to side track it into coming down to chase it. Obtain a laser pointer and aim it at a spot where the cat can see it. Almost all cats will be interested in little light like your pointer


Move the point of light down the tree trunk. Repeat this as many times as needed to gain the cat's attention and interest. With any luck, the cat will follow the dot of light down.

, Try cautiously waiting before proceeding with any of the other methods of getting it down. Cats often come down of their own accord, given time and space. The cat may just need space, quiet, and reassurance that no other animals or people are hanging about to bother it.


Also, if you wait, the cat will become hungry and may try to come down on its own.

, This should only happen after you have waited for the cat to come down on its own for a significant amount of time, about 24 hours. Remember, a cats claws are good for climbing up a tree but they are not as good for climbing down. Your cat may genuinely be stuck and need your help!"
"
Listen for growling or hissing.,
Examine their ears.,
Look for claws.,
Watch for biting.,
Observe their body position.,
Examine their hair.",How to Know if Cats Are Playing or Fighting1," In general, cats that are play fighting will not make much noise. If they do make any noises, you are more likely to hear a meow than a hiss or growl.If you hear an unending succession of growling or hissing, then your cats may be fighting.;
, During a mock fight, cats usually have their ears positioned forward or upright, or only slightly backwards. On the other hand, if you see their ears turned back or positioned back against their head, then it is highly likely that your cats are fighting., Cats that are playing typically have their claws sheathed or retracted most of the time. If they are unsheathed, they will not use them to intentionally hurt the other cat. On the other hand, if you see the cats using their claws to cause damage or hurt the other cat, then it is highly likely that your cats are fighting., During a play session, biting is often minimal and does not cause any harm. However, if you notice one cat biting the other in order to cause harm, then your cats are probably fighting instead of playing.For example, if one of the cats yelps out in pain and hisses or growls, then your cats may be engaged in a fight.

, Cats that are engaged in a mock fight usually have their bodies positioned forward. Alternatively, if you notice the cats leaning back as they swipe at each other, then they may be fighting., Cats that are engaged in a real fight will have their hair standing on end. They do this to make themselves look bigger. Therefore, if you see puffed up hair on your cats’ tail, body or both, then they are more likely to be fighting than playing with each other."

Feed small amounts often.,
Feed the cat more calories.,
Feed the cat in a calm area.,
Encourage the cat to eat.,
Switch to wet food.",How to Feed a Senior Cat2," If your cat is having a hard time finishing its meals, consider giving it smaller meals more often. These small meals will be easier to finish and they will be easier for the cat to digest.If your cat is not eating enough, you may want to consider letting it graze, meaning leaving food out for it all day. This will allow it to eat something whenever it gets the urge.

, A cat that is losing weight needs to be eating more calories every day. This can be accomplished by giving it more food but not all cats will eat more than you are already giving them. If this is the case for your cat, you can switch it on to a food that is more calorie dense, meaning that it contains more nutrients than other food in every bite.Weight loss can be a symptom of a variety of health problems. If your cat is losing weight, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. If the veterinarian doesn't find any specific health problems, they may be able to suggest a calorie-dense food to feed to your cat to get its weight up.

, Some older cats need a calm and safe space to eat their food. If you have a household full of cats and your older cat is not getting enough calories, try feeding it in a separate space away from the other cats. Giving a senior cat this safe space will allow it to have the time to eat what it needs.


This separate feeding may require some extra effort on your part, especially if your cats are used to having open access to food. You may need to place your older cat in a separate room a few times a day.

, Some cats that are underweight need special encouragement to eat. If this is the case for your cat, try making the food smell appetizing. Add the liquid from a tuna can or heat wet food to increase the aroma.If the weight loss is severe, you may want to consider putting your cat on appetite stimulants. Discuss this option with your veterinarian., If your senior cat is having a hard time staying hydrated or if it is not eating enough, consider giving it wet food instead of dry. Wet food can add to your cat's overall water intake and it is more appetizing to most cats than dry food is.


If your cat already eats wet food, then keep giving it to your cat."
"
Feed an overweight cat less food.,
Make the cat expend energy to get to its meals.,
Give foods that can help with health problems.",How to Feed a Senior Cat3," As they age, some cats begin to put on weight because they are eating the same amount of calories but they are doing less physical activity. If this is the case for your cat, cut down on the amount of food you are giving it.


In general, a cat should eat about 50 calories per kilogram of weight every day. This should be adjusted to take your cat's specific health and activity level into consideration.You should gradually cut down the cat's food so that it doesn't notice the change.

, If your cat is in good health but needs to use more energy during the day, consider putting its food in a location where it has to expend some energy to get to it. This could be beyond a baby gate it has to jump over or place the food on a counter so it has to jump up to get it. Food can be a good motivation for some cats to get a little bit of exercise.


This should only be done for cats that are in good health and can still jump easily. If your cat has mobility issues, don't make getting to its food more difficult.

, If your cat has health issues that have limited its mobility or caused weight gain, these should be treated by a veterinarian but you can help with what you feed your cat. There are some cat foods that are made specifically for cats with health issues that impact weight, such as diabetes or colitis. Foods for these conditions tend to have higher rates of dietary fiber and digestible nutrients.Discuss your cat's weight, what you are feeding it, and how much you are feeding it with your veterinarian. They may have some suggestions for how to change your cat's diet to improve its health.

Play with the cat before bed.,
Give the cat something to do at night.,
Set up a cat bed.,
Consider getting a second cat.,
Make sure the cat can find its way around.",How to Get a Cat to Stop Meowing2," If your cat meows at night, it may be lonely or bored. Before bed, try 45 minutes of high-energy exercise such as chasing cat toys, followed by 15 minutes of cuddling or other calming, social activity.If you don't have time to play with your cat, it will be difficult to relieve its boredom. You can still try the tactics below, but it's best to find a family member or pet sitter who can give your cat regular play time.

, An interactive cat toy or food puzzle will help keep the cat occupied. You can also hide treats or toys around the house so the cat can search for them.Don't increase the total amount of food the cat gets in a 24 hour period. Any food the cat eats at night has to come out of its daytime meals.

, If the cat meows at your bedroom door all night but you don't want to share a bed, make sure the cat has the perfect place to sleep. Most cats prefer sleeping on high shelves, in a box or other nook where they can hide but still look out into the room. Add a piece of clothing you've worn recently so the bed smells like you., Many cats are happy on their own, but meowing for attention at night is a sign of loneliness. A second cat is one way to provide night time attention, but it can be difficult to predict whether the two animals will get along. If you do consider adopting a new cat, introduce it to the household slowly, starting in a separate room. This is more likely to work if your current cat has already been socialized with other felines, or if you can adopt a second cat from the same litter., Older cats may have trouble finding their way around due to deteriorating eyesight. If your cat only started to meow at night as it got older, try installing night lights to help it navigate.It's also worth taking the cat to a vet to check for other medical issues.

Check the litter box.,
Help your cat adjust to change.,
Address boredom or loneliness.,
Install a cat door.,
Make sure your cat is not in pain.,
Ask your vet if your cat has been spayed/neutered.,
Treat conditions in older cats.,
If the crying is out of character and excessive, you will want to see your veterinarian as this can be a sign of a larger issue such as overactive thyroid glands.

",How to Get a Cat to Stop Meowing3," Your cat might meow when the litter box is too dirty to use. Scoop out solid waste every day, and replace all the litter once or twice a week as needed.Sticking to a regular maintenance schedule increases your cat's comfort and prevents the meowing habit from getting out of control., Moving to a new residence, changing your work schedule, rearranging the furniture, and adding a new pet to your household are all factors that can make a cat meow. Speed up the adjustment period by sticking to a routine, playing active games with your cat daily, and providing quiet hiding places for your cat to relax., Some cats meow to let you know they miss you, or that they need more affection. Try spending more time petting or playing with the cat to alleviate these feelings.Try to start the play sessions when the cat isn't meowing. Responding to the meows reinforces the behavior.
If you don't have enough time to play with your cat, consider hiring a pet sitter to visit while you're out of the house.

, If your indoor/outdoor cat makes endless requests to be let in and out, install a cat door. Measure your cat's height and width first, then install a cat door of the appropriate size.Former outdoor cats confined indoors will inevitably protest for a while. You could build an outdoor enclosure so the cat has a safer way to spend time outside.

, If your cat is meowing excessively, it's possible that she has hurt herself, or that she is feeling ill. Try a quick physical examination of your cat, or take her in for a check-up at the vet.


Examine your cat's eyes and nose for any discharge.Use one or both hands to gently examine your cat's abdomen, beginning at the spine and moving toward the belly. Look for signs of pain or discomfort as you gently palpate the abdomen.Use one or both hands to gently examine your cat's limbs and paws. Do not overextend your cat's limbs. Gently bend the joints as your cat would do if she were walking and moving. Note any pain or discomfort as you examine her limbs, joints, and paws., Sometimes cats that desire a mate and have not been spayed or neutered will meow excessively during the breeding season, which typically extends from February through September in most places located in the Northern Hemisphere. Talk to your veterinarian about whether your cat is in her breeding season, and whether a spaying/neutering procedure might alleviate the problem., Older cats often develop a louder or more insistent meow. Visit a vet promptly if the cat also develops any of the following symptoms:


Difficulty finding its way around, not using the litterbox, or a disrupted sleeping or eating schedule. These signs could point to feline cognitive dysfunction, or the normal effects of age such as reduced mobility.Any change in appetite or thirst, weight loss, hyperactivity, lethargy, increased urination, or vomiting. These are potential signs of hyperthyroidism or kidney disease, two very common problems.Hearing loss can lead to a lack of ""volume control,"" leading to a louder meow. The cat may fail to respond to noises, act startled when you approach from behind, or scratch its ears more than usual.,"
"
Do not respond to unnecessary meows.,
Avoid negative reinforcement.,
Reward silence with clicker training.,
Increase the length of silence slowly.,
Wean the cat off the reward system.,
Respond to new behavior patterns.",How to Get a Cat to Stop Meowing4," If all of your cat's needs are met and she is meowing just for attention (or for food she doesn't need), do not respond. Your cat may become even louder or more persistent in the short term, but may eventually realize that meowing no longer earns your attention.This takes patience and consistency. If you give in after an hour of meowing, it teaches the cat that it's worth it to meow for an hour., Do not scold or yell at your cat for meowing. This is unlikely to discourage future meowing even if you chase the cat away now. It may even teach your cat to fear you, making it more stressed and worsening its behavior., In addition to ignoring undesirable meows, you'll need to give the cat positive feedback. Communicate which behavior you want to encourage by rewarding the cat as soon as it stops meowing. This reward must be immediate for the cat to figure out what you want. The best way to do this is to use a clicker training tool to make a noise as soon as the cat stops meowing, then immediately give the cat a small treat or other reward.

, Continue to train the cat with clicker training in short sessions (no more than fifteen minutes at a time).Once the cat seems interested in trying out new behaviors to get the reward, gradually raise the bar. Start ""clicking"" and rewarding only after the cat has been silent for three seconds, then four seconds, and so on. If you go through several training sessions a day, the cat may learn to quiet down in less than a week.Once the cat starts to figure it out, you can introduce the ""quiet"" command to communicate what you want. If the cat starts to meow during a training session, say ""quiet"" firmly and turn your head away until it quiets down., Once the excessive meowing is back down to a reasonable level, start replacing some of the treats with head scratches or other non-food rewards. Gradually ramp this up until the cat is back on a normal diet., The cat still needs to get your attention sometimes, and it's up to you to reinforce the right ways to do it. If the cat starts to sit quietly next to you when it wants something, respond to that behavior promptly or the cat may go back to meowing. If it develops new behaviors, such as pawing your leg, it's up to you to decide whether to encourage or discourage this.


Your cat will most likely still meow some of the time. There's nothing wrong with responding to a meow that signals a problem, such as an empty water dish.

Do not feed your cat caffeine or alcohol.,
Do not give your cat chocolate.,
Never give your cat raw bread dough.,
Do not give your cat foods that contain xylitol.,
Avoid giving your cat raw meat, fish, and eggs.,
Do not give your cat macadamia nuts or salty snacks.",How to Avoid Feeding Your Cat Harmful People Foods2," Coffee, soda, caffeinated tea and other sources of caffeine are toxic to cats. Alcohol is also toxic, as three tablespoons of 40 percent liquor can prove deadly to cats. Keep your cat away from cups of coffee or open alcohol, as well as people food that contains alcohol, like penne vodka sauce or tomato red wine sauce., You should also avoid giving your cat chocolate, as it can be harmful to cats even in small amounts. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate are all no-nos for cats.

, Bread dough that is raw and has not been baked is highly toxic to cats. The warm, moist environment of your cat’s stomach can cause the dough to expand, leading to bloating and a condition called “twisted stomach,” which can be painful for cats., Xylitol is an artificial sweetener used in gum, candy, and some toothpastes. This additive can cause seizures and liver failure in cats. Though it may be tempting, do not give your cat gum, candy, or access to your toothpaste., Diets containing raw beef, pork, chicken, fish, and eggs increase the cat's risk of getting parasites and bacterial infections such as salmonella. Avoid feeding your cat raw meats. Raw diets for cats are controversial, and they are not supported by many vets. Some cats may carry salmonella without getting sick themselves. They can, however, pass it onto humans. If the owners are very young, elderly or have weak immune systems, it is especially important not to feed the cat raw foods.
Avoid giving your cat the bones from raw meat, such as chicken bones or fish bones, as they can get caught your cat’s throat and cause choking.
It is not recommended that you put your cat on a raw food diet, as this can put your cat at risk of health issues like salmonella poisoning.

, Macadamia nuts contain an unknown toxin that is bad for cats. It can negatively affect your cat’s nervous system and digestive system. Other types of nuts like walnuts are also considered toxic for cats.People foods high in salt like potato or corn chips are also a no-no for cats. Salty snacks like pretzels, chips, and popcorn can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and seizures in cats.

Prepare apples, bananas, and cantaloupe for your cat.,
Give your cat spinach and pumpkin as a healthy treat.,
Feed your cat cooked eggs.,
Introduce safe people foods slowly to your cat’s diet.",How to Avoid Feeding Your Cat Harmful People Foods3," If you want to give your cat people foods that they will enjoy and can eat safely, start with cooked foods like salmon or chicken. Remove the skin from the chicken before you serve it to your cat to reduce the fat content. Cats are carnivores and require meat in their diet. Cooked chicken is a good protein source for cats. Cooked salmon also provides omega-3 fatty acids for your cat.You can also give your cat other cooked meats like beef or pork. Cooked fish like cod or tilapia are also good for cats.

, These fruits are considered safe for consumption for cats. Apples are a good source of fiber and vitamin C for your cat. Remove the skin before giving apples to your cat. Bananas contain potassium and are easy to digest for cats. Cantaloupe, skin removed, contains nutrients that are beneficial for your cat’s skin and eyes., Spinach is full of vitamins and minerals, making it a healthy treat for cats. Cooked pumpkin is low on calories and high on nutrients. It’s a good option for a special treat for your cat, whether canned or fresh.If your cat is at risk of bladder stones, do not give them spinach.

, Cooked eggs are a good source of protein and vitamin B for cats. Many cat foods already contain cooked eggs and are safe for consumption. Always cook the eggs well before feeding them to your cat., No matter which safe people foods you give your cat, always do so in moderation and slowly. Give your cat a small amount of the people foods to try, along with their regular food. They may experience a bit of gastrointestinal upset when they try new foods, which is to be expected. Give them new people foods slowly over time so they can get used to it and decide if they like it.If your cat has an adverse reaction to certain safe people foods, or doesn’t seem to like them, do not try to force them to eat the people foods.
If you are unsure whether your cat can eat certain people foods, check with your vet first.

If the angle of the item you lay against the tree is more gradual, the cat may be more comfortable climbing down it.Once again, give the cat time to decide to use this new escape route. Make sure the new escape route is really secure against the tree and then walk away.

, Throw a rope over the branch the cat is sitting on and then tie a cat carrier to one of the ends of the rope. Make sure the door or top of the carrier is open and then pull it up to the cat with the rope.


You can also put some favorite food with a strong smell inside the carrier.
Wait for the cat to go inside. Be patient. If, after several hours, the cat does not go into the carrier, then you may need to climb up and put the cat inside of the carrier.
Once the cat goes into the carrier, gently but quickly lower the carrier to the ground.

, This method is only suitable for when you can't quite reach the cat but it's almost close enough to grasp and if you have run out of other options, as it could traumatize the cat and has a greater risk of allowing the cat to fall and injure itself. Tie a towel firmly around the head of a broom. From a secure position, such as from the ground or from a secure position on a sturdy ladder, poke the cat with the broom enough to destabilize it. As the cat wobbles, its instincts will cause it to grab at the towel with its front claws, hooking them into the towel.


Pull steadily before the cat has time to let go, and it will attempt to hold both the tree and the towel with its claws. With luck, the well-hooked front claws will hold the towel more firmly than the rear claws can hold the tree, and your broom will have a cat holding onto it grimly with all claws.
Be ready to support the weight of broom plus a writhing cat.
Quickly slide your hand up the broom. Grab the cat by the scruff before it can climb back into the tree, making sure of course that you maintain your own grip on tree or ladder, or pass the broom and cat to a helper.

, While most fire departments will not come out to rescue a cat, local arborists will sometime do it. He or she will probably charge you a small fee to come out and rescue the cat but it may be worth it if the arborist can get the cat down safely.

Go up the tree to get the cat if all other methods fail.,
Check the ground around the tree before you begin to climb.,
Put on long sleeves and gloves before going up the tree.,
Grab the cat and hold it firmly after you reach it.,
Be gentle yet firm with the cat.,
Place the cat inside something to make it easier to get to the ground.,
Climb down and then check for any injuries to yourself and the cat.",How to Get a Cat out of a Tree3," Only use a sturdy ladder to climb up a tree unless you have extensive experience climbing trees. Have at least one other person with you if you're going to go up after the cat. Your helper can warn you if the cat moves, and call for help if you fall.


If you are determined to actually climb up the tree after a cat, you should always use safety equipment so that you don't get injured and make sure you have someone else with you in case of emergency.

, Make sure that there is nothing that would increase the danger if you happen to fall while climbing.


Also make sure you have a sturdy ladder. The last thing you need is to get injured while trying to help a cat get down from a tree.

, Whether you are rescuing a cat you know well or one you have never met before, the cat will probably be scared and may lash out. Long sleeves and gloves will protect you from the claws and teeth of the cat, but they will also give you a better chance of holding onto an agitated cat once you reach it.

, It's best to hold the cat by it's scruff as it is easier to hold them and it puts them in a trance.

, Don't allow it to escape before you have put it inside the carrier or get a good grasp on it.


Stay calm, if you panic then the cat will react badly and may not allow you to grab it.

, You can, for instance, put it inside a cat carrier and lower it to the ground with a rope.

, The cat may be in shock from its traumatic experience, so make sure it is healthy before letting it go.

Look for reciprocity.,
Observe the pace of the fight.,
Examine their behavior afterwards.",How to Know if Cats Are Playing or Fighting2," During a mock fight, cats will take turns being on top. In other words, both cats should spend an equal amount of time being on the bottom and top.If your cats are chasing each other, then the same rule applies. They should both be chasing each other instead of one cat chasing the other the entire time.

, Cats that are play fighting will stop and start many times. This enables them to take a break and change positions. On the other hand, cats that are fighting move at a fast pace and do not stop until one of them wins., If you are still unsure if your cats are playing or fighting, observe their behavior afterwards. Cats that are fighting will avoid each other afterwards, or at least one will avoid the other.Cats that have been playing will act friendly toward each other and resume their normal behavior afterwards.

"
"
Make a loud noise.,
Create a barrier.,
Do not break up the fight with your hands.,
Prevent future fights.",How to Know if Cats Are Playing or Fighting3," Do this by slamming a door, clapping your hands, yelling, blowing a whistle, or by banging pots or objects together to create a loud noise. Hopefully, the loud noise will distract your cats and break up the fight., Barriers are helpful because they block the cats’ view of each other. Place a cushion, piece of cardboard, or another barrier-like object in between the cats to obstruct their view of each other. Once the cats have ceased fighting, place them in separate rooms so they can calm down.You may need to slowly reintroduce the cats to each other to prevent a future fight.

, If you put your hands in the middle of two fighting cats, you risk getting scratched or bitten. One or both of they cats may lunge toward your face as well.Additionally, one of the cats may see you and re-direct its anger on you. As a result, their behavior toward you may change even after the fight has ended.

, You can do this by making sure your cats do not have to compete for resources. Each cat should have its own litter box, food bowls, bed, perches, and toys in different areas of the house. Additionally, neutering or spaying your cats may help reduce fighting between them.Reward your cats with praise and treats when they interact in a friendly manner.

Protect your skin.,
Give your cat attention when necessary.,
Give treats when necessary.,
Never trap your cat in a room if its not listening.,
Do not disturb your cat when he/she is grooming.",How to Keep Your Cat From Becoming Aggressive," If your cat scratches and bites when they play, Do not encourage them. This will make the cat think it's okay to rough play to anyone. Whenever your cat starts biting and scratching you while playing firmly say ""No."" And then put your cat down on the floor. The cat will eventually learn not to play rough.;
, Even a light tap on the nose will get your cat's fear and anxiety increased. Some cats will take it as a challenge and become more aggressive.

, If your cat is angry or its eye pupils slightly become bigger when you are around it or if you cat flicks its tail, It means it's angry and it's best to stay away.

, Afraid your cat might bite or scratch you? Wear longer clothing. And if your cat starts biting or scratching, Firmly say ""No."" And either walk away or put your cat down on the floor.

Use an old jar or clear container to house your bugs.,
Get a bug catching net.,
Turn off exterior lights.,
Find a friend.,
Hunt for lightning bugs at the edges of ponds or under low-hanging branches.,
Shine your flashlight to mimic lightning bugs.,
Get ready to use your net.,
Put the captured bugs in the jar.,
Let your lightning bugs go.",How to Catch Lightning Bugs," Poke holes in the top of the container for ventilation so your lightning bugs can get air. Place some damp leaves or a moist paper towel in your container to keep the air inside humid. Lightning bugs can breathe easier this way.


Don’t make the ventilation holes too large or your lightning bugs may become trapped while trying to escape. Holes that are about the diameter of pencil lead are ideal.
A piece of breathable fabric or mesh sealed with a rubber band makes a good lid too.;
, If you don't have one already, bug catching nets are usually easy to find at pet supply stores. You can also make one using a wire hanger, a stick, and some netting (old pantyhose or cheesecloth works best).

, If there are bright lights around your home or near the area you plan to hunt for lightning bugs, turn them off or go somewhere a little darker. Artificial light can scare off lightning bugs and make them harder to spot., It’s not easy to catch lightning bugs alone. Have a friend keep your jar at the ready while you hunt for bugs with the net. After you've caught a few, trade places and let your partner have a turn with the net.

, Sometimes you won’t need to go farther than your porch! Just follow their flashing lights.


Lightning bugs are active at dusk and usually stop shining as the night gets darker. For best results, hunt for them in the evening just as the sun is setting.

, You can attract lightning bugs by imitating their light patterns. Use a small flashlight (LED works best) to repeat a lightning bug’s flashing rhythms. Never shine your light directly at the lightning bugs or they’ll get scared and fly away.Use a blue light if you have one. You can also put a piece of blue paper over your flashlight to create a blue glow. Scientists suspect that lightning bugs interpret blue light in a special way. Using blue light doesn’t confuse their flash patterns and makes them easier to attract.

, Once you’re close enough to the lightning bugs, gently sweep your net back and forth in their direction until you’ve caught a few. Be patient, it might take you a little while.


If you're not squeamish about handling bugs, you can catch them with your hands. Be careful not to injure them!

, Gently coax the lightning bugs into the jar and close the lid. It’s OK if you lose a few.

, While lightning bugs can survive and reproduce in captivity, it’s always best to release them within a day after capture. Keeping them overnight and releasing them the next evening is a good way to make sure they’ll continue to light up the night for others.Make sure to release your lightning bugs at night. They’re most active during this time and are more likely to avoid predators.

Spot the fly.,
Consider your surrounding.,
Track the fly.,
Plan your strike.,
Swat the fly.,
Sanitize your environment.",How to Catch a Fly With Your Hands1," Just because you hear a buzzing sound doesn’t mean that it’s a fly roaming around you. Beware of bees and wasps. You shouldn’t kill these bugs because they are important for the environment and can sting you.


Also beware of a horse fly. A horse fly is larger than an average house fly and can bite.;
, Once you’ve identified the fly, take a survey of your environment and the supplies nearby. If you have a counter nearby, you can use it as a hard surface to squash the bug on., If you’re going to catch this fly with your bare hands, you’ll need to be able to follow the bug with your eyes. When flies are indoors they usually try to escape and are tricked by windows. This is where they’ll usually be unless there is rotting food nearby.

, After following the fly’s behaviour and where it is spending its time, prepare to strike. Consider before killing the fly if there is an alternative to ridding the fly from your personal space. Outline the perimeter of the fly with your eyes.


Move slowly to a place you’ll have the leverage to strike., Once you’ve positioned yourself close enough to the fly, it’s time to kill. Make sure both your hands are free. Take a quick jab at the fly. The aim is to wedge the hard surface the fly is resting on with your palm.


Have your other hand ready to go if you miss the fly. This way you can slam the other hand onto the fly in a flash., If you are successful in killing the fly, you need to wash your hands thoroughly. Use antibacterial soap for the most efficient wash. Dispose of the fly in a napkin into the trash. Wash the smudge off the wall as needed.

Buy an appropriate cage for your stick insects.,
Cover the floor with a moisture absorbing substance.,
Provide resting places and decorations.,
Clean the cage regularly.,
Pick the proper food for your stick insect.,
Keep your stick insect in a warm environment.,
Spritz plants regularly to provide water.,
Handle your stick insect with care.,
Take care of stick insect eggs.,
Make sure you care for baby stick insects properly.,
Prevent any factors that could cause poor health.,
Do not be alarmed by deformities accrued during shedding.",How to Take Care of Stick Bugs," To start, you'll need to make sure you have the right cage. Height is important when it comes to a stick insect cage, as stick insects are tall and enjoy climbing.Your cage should be about three times as high as the total length of your stick insect. If your stick insect is still growing, look up about how big your breed of stick insect tends to grow.
You should get a glass cage with a mesh lid. Make sure to get a mesh lid as this provides necessary ventilation for your stick insect.;
, You'll need some substrate, which is the material that coats the bottom of an insect's cage. You should cover the floor with a moisture absorbing substrate. Potting soil, small tissues, or pebbles would work well., Stick insects love to climb and will be unhappy if they can't be active in their cages. Provide a variety of climb-able decorations, as well as resting places. You can look for these kinds of supplies at a local pet store.You can look for plastic sticks, as long as they don't use too many chemicals, at a local pet store. Try to find sticks with a large circumference, so your stick insect can rest on the top of the stick when it finishes climbing.
You can collect branches outside, as well as plants, for your stick insects to climb. You can also purchase plants from the store for your stick insect's cage. Keep in mind plants will definitely be eaten, however. Make sure any plants you provide are pesticide-free, as pesticides can potentially harm stick insects.

, Stick insects will leave droppings in their cage, and will occasionally shed their skin. It's a good idea to periodically remove droppings and skin when the cage looks dirty.You may want to periodically replace your substrate as well, which means you'll have to temporarily transfer your stick insects to another container.

, Stick insects should only be fed plants. The type of plants you should provide depends on your type of stick insect.The majority of stick insects can get by eating bramble leaves. You should be able to find these leaves at a local pet store. You can also purchase them online. If you choose to collect leaves locally, only do so in places where leaves have not been treated chemically. Chemicals and pesticides can be deadly for stick insects.
Indian stick insects have a slightly different diet and may not take well to bramble leaves. Oak, rose, and hawthorn are the primary leaves eaten by Indian stick insects. As with bramble leaves, you can purchase these online or at a pet store. If you plan to collect locally, only do so in an area free of pesticides.
Place leaves in a glass jar for your stick insects. Replace the leaves as the stick insects eat them. If you notice any leaves are getting old or rotten, remove them.

, Stick insects typically live in tropical areas, so it's vital you keep your stick insect's cage warm. Temperature's less than 59 degrees Fahrenheit can be harmful.Generally, the temperature should be around 68 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a normal room temperature. As long as there is no draft, your stick insects should be safe in your home most of the time.
Indian stick insects may need slightly cooler temperatures to thrive. They may be better off at 65 degrees Fahrenheit, so move them to a cooler room if necessary.

, It's a bad idea to have a water bowl in a stick insects cage as they could fall in and drown. Stick insects can usually drink water droplets found on plants. Get a spray bottle and mist the plants in your stick insect's cage each day to assure they get enough water., You may want to play with your stick insect, which can be a fun and safe way to bond with your pet. However, always handle stick insects with care to avoid stressing them out.Stick insects are extremely delicate, so handle them very gently. When taking your stick insect out of its cage, lift it from its body and not its legs. Its legs could break off if you attempt to pick your stick insect up by the legs.
Allow your stick insect to walk on your fingers and into the palm of your hand. When you put your stick insect back in the cage, make sure you do so gently. Go slowly to avoid startling your stick insect. You do not want to accidentally catch one of its legs if it starts squirming.

, If you have more than one stick insect, they may end up breeding. If your stick insect lays eggs, make sure you care for the eggs properly.If you see eggs in your stick insects cage, gently transfer them to a shallow container with a lid. Punch small holes in the lid to allow for air flow. Line the bottom of the lid with newspaper or sand.
You can safely store the eggs at room temperature, but keep in mind not all eggs will survive. Stick insects lay many eggs as a lot of eggs do not end up hatching. Lightly spray the eggs with water once a week.

, Once the stick insects hatch, you can return them to the main cage. Stick insects do not have a larval stage, so they will emerge as full-bodied insects. Make sure you provide plenty of leaves as soon as the eggs hatch. If you want to handle the babies, do so with an object like a pencil or paintbrush. Your hands may be too big to pick up babies safely., With proper care, stick insects are usually fairly healthy. There are several things you can do to assure your stick insects live long, healthy lives.Stick insects sometimes get fungus on their skin. Wash this away with a rag dabbed in water. Fungus can spread to a stick insect's internal organs, causing death.
Spritz the cage regularly so your stick insects have access to water. Wash any leaves you feed your stick insect thoroughly and avoid leaves treated with chemicals and pesticides.

, Occasionally, stick insects will develop deformities during shedding. A stick insect's leg may be bent at an odd angle. While this can look alarming, this does not generally affect a stick insect's health.To help prevent such abnormalities, make sure your cage is high enough. Stick insects often hang upside down when they shed. If a cage is too small, a stick insect may not have adequate room for shedding, causing deformities.

Note that a Billabong Bugs kit is designed differently from other Triops kits.,
Make sure that your chosen container is clean and capable of holding three litres of water.

,
Please make sure that it is free from any soap residue.,
Open the sachet labelled Magic BugDust™ and empty the entire contents into the aquarium.

,
Fill your tank with 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of 'demineralised'(some times referred to as deionized) water.,
Demineralized water and distilled water are produced using different methods.,
Open the sachet labelled Bugditioner and add one level scoop of the bugditioner in the water(scoop is provided with the kit).

,
Attach the thermometer to your container.,
Leave your container under the lamp for at least 12 – 24 hours before disturbing again.,
Feeding - Triops grow incredibly fast, so the amount of food fed to them will vary over the first few days.,
On the morning of day three, feed one pellet of food by holding the pellet under the water and rolling it between thumb and forefinger until it has dissolved into a fine smokey cloud.,
On day four dissolve one pellet of food as per day three.

,
On day five dissolve one pellet of food in the morning and one in the evening.

,
On day six repeat as per day five.

,
On day seven count the remaining number of Triops australiensis hatch-lings that are in the tank and place a food pellet in for each one.,
Remove 1/3 water from the tank.,Place one level scoop of Bugditioner™ into the remaining water

,
Start adding water to the tank gradually.,
As your Bugs grow they might require more food than just one pellet each per day.,
Your Bugs may also enjoy some variety in their diet, so why not try feeding them some of these treats: a frozen pea, a frozen corn kernel, a small cube of carrot (about the size of a pea), a small amount of lettuce…Whatever you choose to give your Bugs, make sure it is washed thoroughly to ensure it is free from any pesticides or other chemicals.",How to Set up a Billabong Bugs Kit," Due to these differences, it is strongly recommended that you read all instructions carefully before you begin setting them up, so as to obtain the best value from the product. When all instructions are followed carefully, hatchlings are guaranteed. Things to note include:

Special microscopic foods, nutrients and sand are premixed with the egg mixture or ""Bug dust"" sachet in order to sustain the hatch-lings during their first few days of life in replace of the 'nutrient bag' commonly employed in other kits.
A specific volume of hatch water is important (3 litres)to prevent pollution when below this volume or starvation when too much water is added.
A specially designed water conditioner is employed that when added during water changes protects the Triops from shock and or injury after a sudden change of temperature and pH etc.
This can be a common disappointment for hobbyists when water changes are carried out without this protection.;
,, Soap or other cleaning products can be harmful to Triops.

,, Triops are very fussy about the type of water they live in. Never use tap water, not even from a rain-water tank. Tap water contains substances that can be poisonous to Triops. This is also why you should only use demineralized water which is available from most major supermarkets (Used for ironing and topping up car batteries).

, There is a higher failure rate with distilled water followed by tap water and then tank water. Some reasons include not enough mineral content and bacteria that although usually harmless to humans can harm baby Triops.

,, Peel the backing strip from your thermometer and fasten to the outside of your container. Make sure that you place the thermometer below the water level so that it can give an accurate reading of the water temperature and not the air temperature above it. Place your container close to the light source so that the water’s surface is around 10 centimeter (3.9 in) from the light bulb. Keep an eye on the temperature for the next few hours. If the temperature becomes higher than 29ºC, move the light a little further away. However, if the temperature is still below 22ºC after a few hours, move the light closer to the water’s surface. If that does not help, try placing the tank in a cooler or warmer part of the house. It is important to maintain the temperature because Triops australiensis may not hatch out or could perish outside of these recommended temperatures(See below for more information on Temperature & Lighting.

, During this time make sure your container is in a place that can’t get knocked over. The lamp must remain on at all times for the temperature to remain constant.

, After your baby triops have hatched DO NOT FEED them for the first 3 days. A specially micronized “Baby” food is premixed in with the Magic BugDust™. Adding extra food to the tank at this time will only encourage harmful bacteria that could multiply rapidly and consume all the oxygen in the water, killing your baby Triops.

, Remember, soap and chemicals are poisonous to Triops so make sure your hands are clean and free of soapy residues, cosmetics, hand creams, hair products, perfumes, dirt, grease etc when feeding your Bugs.

,,,, From now on you no longer need to dissolve the pellets as the Triops will be strong enough to find them and eat them whole.

, To do this, stir the water, ensuring all the detritus on the bottom is floating in the water. To avoid losing one or more of your Triops australiensis during this process, you can use a very clean (but free from soapy residues) tea strainer or fine netted colander to pour the water through every time you do a water change. Alternatively you use a plastic cup to scoop the water out.

,, A good way to do this is to add one cup of demineralised water that is the same temperature as the water in the tank, every ten minutes. This allows the Bugs to acclimatise to the new water.

, As long as the Triops australiensis have consumed all of the pellets in the tank, more pellets to match the number of Bugs can be added. You may find that you are feeding them up to four times a day as they grow to their largest size. But remember make sure that every last pellet has been consumed before adding more food or you will pollute the tank. Also, be aware that underfeeding you Triops could lead to cannibalism – when your Bugs are hungry, they will start to eat each other!

, Also, the same rules apply for special treats – don’t give them any more until the first amount is gone to avoid polluting the water. If your Bugs don’t finish it within a few hours, remove any leftovers from the tank.

Understand that ants/spiders usually try to escape if they are in milk or water.,
Put something in the water to rescue the ant/spider.,
Drain the liquid -slowly!,
Let it crawl a little.,
Introduce an absorbent material like a terrycloth towel and place it near the ant.,
Place the absorbent material next to the ant.,
That's all that can be done.,
A successful scenario is when there is no liquid around the ant and the ant is able to move freely.

,
Place it where you found it (on the table where the cup or bowl was) so that it can find it's way home.

",How to Save an Ant and Other Tiny Critters," If they can't they usually stop moving, which is why the ant/spider may not be dead.;
, This could be a spoon or if it's a closet your toilet brush could do. Just try to get them on to the item.

, Or the ant will flow out with the liquid. Even if you drained it there should still be some residue surrounding the ant but if the ant is alive it should start to move.

, Depending on what kind of ant it is it could either save itself if it's stronger or it could need a helping hand. That's when it gets tricky.

, If the ant climbs on to it that's it and the ant is saved. If the ant isn't doing that then it probably couldn't. In which case move to step 6.

, Slowly (so that the ant has enough time to react ) brush the ant off the spoon and on to the absorbent material.

, If, however, you find that the liquid was not absorbed enough, then the material used is at fault (it could be the texture or its chemical structure.).

You shouldn’t kill bees because they are important to the environment and can potentially sting you.

, Take an inventory of the supplies around you. Sometimes a fly will start to annoy you away from anything useful like a wall or fly swatter. These can be difficult scenarios for successful fly-catching.

, Using two hands is a difficult way to catch a fly, but it is also the most intuitive method. To catch the fly you will use your hands in a clapping motion. The idea is to catch the fly by trapping it between your two hands., Before clapping like a madman, you need to briefly study the fly’s patterns and habits. You won’t be able to fully map out its behavior, but a basic idea might help.


Also, training your eyes to follow its movements will help your coordination in catching the fly.
The fly also might leave your personal space while watching it. This will save its life and prevent you from cleaning up a mess., After you feel confident enough in tracking the fly you can strike it down. Wait for the fly to come close enough to you or your food. Once it is within arm's reach, make a quick move to clap the fly out of its existence.


Holding your hands in an extended position close to the fly will help you move quicker.

, Dispose of the fly and wash your hands thoroughly. Flies can hold harmful bacteria that you don’t want to mess with.

Cup the fly.",How to Catch a Fly With Your Hands3," This technique requires you to catch the fly using one hand and patience. This can be harder for some people, but you only need one hand to get the job done. Using one hand is all about utilizing whatever resources you have nearby.

, Wait for it to land on an open surface free of clutter (such as a table). Beware of bees and wasps. You shouldn’t kill these bugs because they are important for the environment and can sting you.

, Hold your hand about 1 foot (0.3 m) (30 cm) behind the fly and about an inch above the surface. Your palm should be open with your thumb toward the fly. Rotate your hand so that your palm is facing diagonally down and towards the fly., Sweep your hand quickly toward the fly, keeping your palm facing it. As your hand reaches the point above where the fly landed, close your hand quickly. The fly will be startled by the quick motion and will take off directly into your palm! Follow through with your hand for another foot or so., Flies are small and you may have caught the fly without feeling it. Carefully open your hand to see the fly you caught.


If you did not catch a fly on your first attempt, do not get discouraged. Try again, adjusting the speed of your hand. Once you get it right, it will work every time!, Another method worth trying is putting a cupped hand in front of the resting fly, then with a swift forward movement catch the fly as it takes off. This is the Shaolin Monk's technique. It requires patience and doesn’t kill the fly if executed successfully.


After catching the fly, release it out into the wild where it belongs.

Lower your cat's stress.",How to Find Alternatives to De Clawing Your Cat," This can be a simple post or an elaborate cat tree. You should make sure it is at least 3 feet high. Most cats enjoy stretching will scratching. Whichever you choose, make sure to choose a good spot. Place it near something your cat currently likes to scratch.


Try adding some catnip on the post for an extra sensory experience.
Scratching posts are also great for keeping your cat’s nails filed down naturally, which is an effective method of preventing painful scratches.If your cat is very young, get it a scratching post or board right away. Teaching the kitten that it should only scratch in allowed areas is important in order to discourage bad behavior in the future. Try rewarding the cat or kitten for scratching where it is allowed.;
, Your cat may prefer a simple pad to a post. If your cat seems to like scratching carpet, look for a pad that has that as a covering. Corrugated cardboard is another popular material for scratching pads.Scratching pads are generally less expensive than posts. They also take up less space.
Give your cat positive encouragement for using the pad. Try saying, ""Wow, good kitty! Great job!"". Use a upbeat, soothing tone of voice.

, Climbing posts, cat grass, and toys are all great ways to keep your cat entertained and busy. If your cat stays engaged, it’s less likely that your cat will entertain itself with scratching up furniture. Go to your local pet supply store and ask an associate for help picking out some new items.Many cats like balls. Try ones that make noises and ones that light up.
Cat toys are pretty inexpensive, so you can experiment to find ones that your cat enjoys.
Try some toys, such as stuffed mice, that have cat nip in them.

, Sure, cats are pretty independent. But your cat also wants you to provide it with affection and stimulation. You can pet your cat, groom it, and play with it. Sometimes cats will scratch out of boredom. The more you interact, the less likely your cat is to be bored.


If your cat looks like it wants to enjoy a good clawing session, direct it gently to one of your permitted clawing zones and items.

, Your vet can help you glue these safe, effective caps onto your cat’s nails. They last for about six weeks before needing to be replaced, and are available from vets, or some pet shops. Also, a quick internet search will likely yield a great deal of online shops to buy them from. If you feel comfortable applying the caps yourself, you can, or simply see your vet.Make sure to follow the instructions on the package. You don't want to make your cat uncomfortable by putting the caps on incorrectly.

, Add a rug or some other item that can protect the surface of the furniture. For example, cats don't like their paws touching things like double-sided tape, foil, sandpaper, and even plastic runners on your carpet. Identify the things your cat tends to stay away from, and place these items over the ones you don't want your cat to scratch.Try placing these items on your couch when you go to work. You can take them off when you come home and are available to supervise your cat.

, Cats tend to dislike the smell of citrus. Try using a citrus essential oil to keep them off the furniture. Mix a few drops of oil in a spray bottle of water. Shake it up and spray lightly on the areas you want to keep your cat clear of.You can also try wetting a few cotton balls with the mixture and placing them around objects you want your cat to leave alone. The scent of menthol works, as well.
Cats also tend to dislike the scents of vinegar, lavender, and coffee grounds.

, Perhaps consider keeping the lounge room sacrosanct and cat-free. If there are certain rooms your cat seems to scratch up the most, just keep your cat out of these areas. Keep doors closed, and keep the cat contained to certain areas.


Try giving the cat its own special spot, or perch. Maybe there is a certain window the cat likes to look out—provide the cat with a perch or pillow to sit on. If the cat feels happy in one spot in the house, it might be less likely to get bored and explore for new things to destroy., Declawing isn’t as safe and easy as having your cat’s nails trimmed. It is an actual surgical procedure that involves using a scalpel, laser, or strong clipper to remove the bone on the end of each toe.Since declawing isn’t medically necessary for cats, there really aren’t many real reasons or scenarios that make declawing a necessity.
If, for example, the cat is especially prone to scratching and lives with a person dealing with a compromised immune system, then maybe declawing could be an option, to protect the health of the people in the household. Otherwise, cats really do not need to be declawed., Your vet will likely tell you that declawing is an unnecessary and potentially harmful procedure. Like any other major surgery, declawing comes with possible negative side effects and consequences. Recently declawed feet could potentially lead to infection, pain, and trouble walking.Try asking questions such as, ""I would prefer not to declaw. What would you recommend I do to deter scratching?""
Communicate regularly with your vet. If you notice a change in your cat's behavior, make sure to mention it.

, High stress levels can be the underlying cause behind your cat's scratching. If a cat is nervous or frightened, it might scratch as a way to mark its territory and feel more secure. Take care to try to give your cat a calm, happy life.Create a soothing environment. Try to keep your cat from exposure to loud noises.
If there is a major change in the cat's life, such as a move, talk to your vet about how to handle this.
Take your cat for regular check-ups.

Watch for excessive sleeping or lethargic behavior.,
Note any sneezing and coughing.,
Watch to see if other finches avoid one particular bird.,
Monitor unusual scratching.,
Listen for silence.,
Move the finch’s accommodations to a well-lit location.",How to Spot a Sick Finch1," While finches are normally active while awake, your finch may be drooping its head or remaining motionless on the bottom of the cage. The bird's posture may be bent or horizontal instead of vertical. If your bird is sleeping all day while all the other birds are flying around, something could be wrong., Like people, birds will sometimes sneeze or cough when sick. They will often shake or twist their head as they do this. These symptoms are sometimes accompanied by nasal discharge. Also look out for heavy breathing or other signs of respiratory troubles. Your bird may have a cold, or it may be a sign of more serious problems like air sac mites., Healthy house finches tend to avoid sick birds. If you have multiple finches, you may notice that they are avoiding one member of their group. If your finches have abandoned their friend, it is because they are trying to prevent getting sick themselves., Mites, conjunctivitis, and pox can make your bird itch. You may notice that the bird is attempting to scratch themselves with a foot or that they are rubbing up against their bird house, cage, or other objects.Scratching excessively can be a sign of something wrong, and it can cause even more damage to your bird’s skin.


Normal itching will last only a few seconds, and it can be relieved with gentle rubbing. If your bird is sick, he may scratch repeatedly through the day and for several minutes at a time. He may also be scratching himself more vigorously., Finches are very vocal birds, so if they stop singing, something is wrong. They may be trying to conserve energy, or they may suffer from air sac mites, which cause the bird to lose their voice. If you notice that the bird has not been chirping or singing, you may want to observe for other signs of illness., If your bird is sluggish, it may be that there is not enough light for the bird, and your finch has become depressed. Natural lighting is very important for finch health. Either provide the finch with natural light or use full-spectrum lightbulbs (also known as “daylight” or “sunlight” bulbs).If the bird does not improve, the bird may be sick instead of depressed.

"
"
Make sure your home is suitable for a finch.,
Obtain a finch cage.,
Put some perches in the cage.,
Line the bottom of the cage with newspaper.,
Try a swing or another bird toy.,
Don’t include any strings in the cage.",How to Raise Zebra Finches1," Before raising finches, think very carefully about every aspect of what this involves. Having a pet is a big responsibility.


For instance, when you go away from home, you need to arrange care of the birds in your absence. Do you know of someone who is capable of caring for the birds whilst you are away?
If you travel as part of your job and are regularly away, ask yourself if it's fair to leave such sociable birds alone and without your company for long periods of time.
Ensure you have a safe environment for your bird. You need to consider practical matters, such as whether you are a smoker. Also consider if you like to burn scented candles in the house. Finches are very sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. Cigarette smoke in particular is an absolute no-no when you keep birds. The odors from scented candles gets onto the birds’ feathers, which they can find distressing. This results in frantic grooming activity to get rid of the smell.
Consider if you or your family have any health issues. People with suppressed immune systems are at risk for picking up infections easily. These include the very young or old, people on chemotherapy or those with health conditions which suppress the immune system. Some birds carry diseases such as salmonella or chlamydia. Although the birds themselves are not ill, they could pose a possible risk to vulnerable people. ;
, A finch cage is specially made for small birds. It has very small holes between the bars so that the birds can't escape. The bars must be less than 12 mm apart in order to stop the birds escaping.


Canary cages or other larger holed cages are unsuitable for keeping finches.
Visit your local pet store to find the proper cage.
Aim for a cage that is long rather than tall (like a parrot cage), since zebra finches prefer to fly horizontally.

, Perches placed at different heights in the cage will allow the birds to hop from one perch to another.


Have perches of different diameters. The finch will need to use different leg muscles to stand on a smaller perch than on a larger perch.
Don’t have too many perches in the cage. You don’t want your finch to hop so much from perch to perch that it never flies in the cage.Some types of perches include: branches, rope, plastic perches, natural plants, artificial plants, and clothesline perches.

, Use newspaper or used printer paper to line the bottom of the cage. This will catch droppings, spilled food and dropped water. Special cage lining paper is available but not necessary. It is typically expensive.


Sandpaper should not feature in a bird's cage as it damages the bird's feet.
Don’t use corn cobs, walnut shells, kitty litter or cedar shavings. These can be dangerous if the bird ingests them., Experiment with bird toys and decorations to keep your bird occupied. Swings, bells and ladders are good choices.


If you have one finch, try a mirror so the bird thinks it has company. But if you already have 2 or more birds, a male bird might think it’s looking at another male and be threatened., Strings in cages can tangle around a bird, resulting in serious, or even fatal harm. This is the case with all birds, not just zebra finches.

"
Determine that your bird's beak needs a trim.,
Locate an avian vet.,
Ask what tools will be used.,
Watch the procedure.,
Give your bird time to recover.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Feed your bird well.,
Buy your bird chew toys.,
Install a special perch.",How to Trim a Bird's Beak," An average beak of a well cared for bird does not need trimming, as it will wear down naturally from ordinary chewing. If you notice that your bird's beak has changed shape, that the top of the beak is growing far down over the bottom, or that the beak has been broken off on one side, take your bird to the vet for trimming and shaping.


Trimming can cause your bird pain and trauma if done improperly. It should never be done for cosmetic reasons.;
, Not all vets are qualified to trim a bird's beak. Search the Association of Avian Vets directory to find an avian vet near you.Call ahead to ask if the vet has worked with birds of your pet's species before. Bring an old photo of your bird with a healthy beak, or bring a photo of other birds of this species.


Though a good vet will be able to recognize the parts of a beak that do not want to be trimmed, it is helpful for the vet to have an idea of what the beak should look like before the trimming starts.Parrot's lower beaks will be trimmed straight across.
Cockatoos and cockatiels have beaks with pointed ends and scooping middles, so their lower beaks should not be ground straight across.

, Your vet should use a grinding tool to file away the excess beak. If the vet uses a high-speed grinder such as the dremel tool, the friction will generate heat that can hurt your bird and permanently damage her beak tissue. Ask your vet to use a nail file, a fingernail, side-cutting wire cutters, or clippers instead, if possible.If a speculum is to be inserted in your bird's beak, ask that it not be metal. Birds sometimes bite down during beak trims, and metal can damage the beak. A dog chew toy may be used instead, provided it is the right size.
Your bird will not normally need to be anesthetized during this procedure.

, Make sure the vet cleans your bird's beak with disinfectant first. If the vet is using a grinding tool, ask for a fresh head to be put on it. Diseases can be transferred bird to bird from re-used grinding heads.Your vet or vet team will restrain the bird gently with gloved hands.
In some cases, the top half of your bird's beak will be tucked into the lower half to get it out of the way.
The vet should slowly trim the beak until she can see white dots on the surface. Trimming past these will hurt the bird.
The beak should be trimmed until the biting surface is level, or it will become distorted and cause further problems for your bird.

, A trim should not hurt your bird, but will probably be stressful. Take your bird home and place it in a place it is used to. Make calming noises, but don't crowd it with too much cuddling. Leave water and food for it, and keep admirers away for at least a day.


If your bird has somehow been hurt during the procedure, ask your vet how you can help your bird recover. A bird with a bleeding or cracked beak will need to stay at the hospital.
If your bird experienced pain, the beak may remain sore for a few days. Soften foods with water before serving, and offer fruits, vegetables, and sprouted seeds that require less chewing., There is normally a reason for a bird's beak to overgrow. Tell your vet everything your bird eats, what you keep in the cage, and where the bird's cage is situated. Overgrowth can be caused by infections, liver disease, nutritional imbalances, and lack of grooming aids.


Take your doctor's advice. For instance, if the vet says your bird has liver disease, you will need to seriously change your bird's diet if it is to survive.
A bird with liver disease needs to eat a rich in fiber, low in fat diet without too much protein. Seeds should be avoided, or only served sprouted.

, Don't rely on bird seed, which is too fatty and does not require your bird to use her beak. Buy a premium pelleted food, and feed your bird lots of fresh vegetables (such as broccoli, cabbage, garlic, collards, asparagus) and occasional fresh fruit. Feed your bird a few almonds each day to encourage chewing.Learn if your bird is a florivore, omnivore, granivore, frugivore, or nectarivore.Though diet will depend on breed, pelleted food should typically be 65-80% of the diet. Vegetables should make up 15-30%, and the remainder can be seeds and fruits.If your bird is accustomed to seeds, try sprouting the seeds to help your bird transition to vegetables. The fat content will lower, and the texture will be more vegetable-like.Birds that have had too much fat in their diets are at risk for developing liver disease, which can cause beak overgrowth. These birds need vegetables, as well as citrus peel, egg yolks, unprocessed grains, and turmeric to detoxify.

, Buy chew toys for your bird. You can buy build-your-own toys that let you string rope with mineral pieces, wooden blocks, plastic beads, and pieces of real coconut. Put several in the cage at once, and rotate them out so that your bird doesn't get bored. If you notice she chews some more than others, buy more of those.


Buy a lava rock. You can hang a lava rock in your bird's cage, or attach it to the side. These are great for your bird to wear her beak naturally.
Hide food in a chew toy. Buy a shreddable toy that you can hide treats in. Your parrot will trim her beak shredding up the toy.
Check rope toys frequently for fraying. Remove frayed rope, as this can tangle around your bird's toes., Your bird will wear her own nails and beak into good condition if she has a cement, pumice, or mineral perch to sit on. After she eats, she will wipe her beak on the perch, thus sharpening and trimming it. Buy a perch that is designed specifically for your kind of bird. For instance, find a perch that will transmit essential minerals from your bird's part of the world.


Do not replace all your bird's perches with conditioning perches, as they are less comfortable for your bird to sit on for long periods.Avoid sandpaper perches.

Inspect your bird for feather loss.,
Watch your finch for fluffed feathers.,
Feel the stomach for swelling.,
Check your finch’s eyes for redness or swelling.,
Check the finch's vent.,
Inspect your bird's urine and urates for discoloration.,
Examine the bird's feces for color and consistency.",How to Spot a Sick Finch2," The loss of feathers can be a sign that the bird is stressed or sick. Healthy birds have a sleek coat that covers their entire body except for their beak, eyes, and feet.Check your birds' coat for:


Naked or bare patches
Scaly or red skin
Thinning feathers
Baldness on the head
A ruffled appearance

, Observe your finch at a distance to observe if they are fluffing their feathers when they think they are alone. Normally, birds will keep their feathers pulled in against their bodies; this will look like a sleek coat. Healthy finches may fluff their feathers for a few minutes at a time, but a sick finch will keep their feathers fluffed much longer. They may even sleep like this. If the bird knows you are watching, however, they may pull in their feathers as a defense mechanism., Gently press your fingers around the abdomen area. If you can feel a swollen belly or a hard protrusion, take the bird to a vet immediately. Egg binding is a common problem in female finches wherein the egg becomes stuck within the reproductive track and the bird cannot pass it. In addition to the swelling, your bird will be distressed, and this may look like the bird is trying to defecate. Finches can die within a few hours of egg binding., Finches are susceptible to conjunctivitis and avian pox, both of which appear on the bird’s eyes. Don’t touch your finch’s eyes, but observe them closely. Your finch may be ill if you observe:


Red skin around the eyes
Puffy or swollen eyelids
Growths on the eyes
Discharge coming from the eyes., The water vent is where the bird excretes droppings. This will be located between the bird’s tail and thighs. A healthy bird's vent will be clean and dry while a sick bird's will likely show signs of illness, including:


Matted feathers around the vent
Bleeding or swelling
Discharge or wetness, Birds have two types of liquid waste. The clear, watery liquid is urine. The chalky white liquid is called urate. Discolored droppings are symptoms of internal diseases.


Green or yellow urates can be a sign of either malnutrition or liver disease.
Brown urates can be a result of lead poisoning.
Red urine or urates can mean that your bird has internal bleeding, The feces should be the only solid waste coming out of your bird. Feces will be either a rusty brown color, a dark green, or the color of their food. They should also be tube-shaped, although they may come out coiled or broken up. Always keep an eye out for runny droppings or droppings of unusual colors, sizes, and textures, such as:


Black feces
Bright green feces
Undigested food
Foamy droppings
Excessively watery feces"
"
Examine the finch’s skin for signs of scaly skin.,
Listen your finch’s breathing for clicking or wheezing.,
Shine a light on their throat.,
Brush through the feathers to check for red mites.,
Leave a white cloth in the cage to catch mites.,
Flash a light into the cage to check for infestation.",How to Spot a Sick Finch3," Gently brush the feathers around the face to examine the skin. Various types of mites can bury into your finch’s skin to lay their eggs. You may notice your finch has lesions around the face, beak, or eyes. Their skin may be coated with a white powder-like film. Feathers may be thinning in this area.Scaly skin can spread to their legs. You will notice a growth of crusty clumps around the foot. These can grow and accumulate until your bird can no longer walk. These growths are called tassles., If you notice your bird has labored breathing, hold your bird up close to your ear. Listen carefully for any strange noises, including clicking, wheezing, squeaking, or grunting. Such signs may be more apparent after activity such as flight. These may be a sign of air sac mites.Even if only one bird is demonstrating these symptoms, all of your birds could be infected. Air sac mites are highly contagious, and you should treat every bird in the cage.

, Press a small light light to one side of the their throat, and examine the other side. The light will illuminate their windpipe. If you notice tiny, dark granules inside your bird’s throat, it may mean that your bird is infected with air sac mites and needs immediate medical attention.Use a small, directed flashlight beam, such as a pinpoint light. Do not shine it down their beaks, or you may blind them.
If you suspect that your bird has air sac mites, take him to the vet for a tracheal swab. This is the only guaranteed way to prove that mites are in the airway., Red mites can usually be found around the crest of the bird. With your fingers, gently push back the feathers around the head of your canary. If you see tiny red specks milling around in the feathers, it is a good sign that your bird’s cage has been infested., Fold up a white or light colored cloth, and leave it in a corner of the cage overnight. During the night, when mites emerge, they may cling to the cloth. In the morning, you may notice little specks on the cloth. These are most likely mites, and their presence is a sign that the cage has been infested.If your cage is infested, so are your birds. Even if you do not find mites directly on your birds, they are likely feeding on them if they are present in the cage.

, During the day, mites will often hide in the cracks of your aviary. Shine a light in the dark nooks of your bird house, taking care to sweep it through any tiny cracks or holes in the cage. Nesting boxes are a vulnerable location in the cage as well. Remove the shavings or padding on the bottom of the cage, and examine for further signs of mites.


Mites are around 1 mm in size.
They will form clusters of red or black bugs.
You may see tiny dark spots moving in cracks."
"
Look for a healthy bird.,
Watch the birds breathing at rest.,
Listen to the bird singing.,
Decide on male or female birds.,
Get a pair of finches.",How to Raise Zebra Finches2," Go to a pet store or bird specialist. Pick out bright eyed, active, smooth feathered birds that are obviously healthy. Zebra finch breeders tend to have healthier birds than pet stores.One clue to good health is to examine the droppings in the cage. Healthy droppings have white and brown parts, and they are semi-formed. Any droppings that are completely liquid, yellow, or green are abnormal. Avoid buying birds in that cage. , A normal respiratory rate is about one breath every two seconds. Sick birds often breathe very rapidly and their tail bobs up and down with the effort.


They also tend to be fluffed up and sit resting on a perch or at the bottom of the cage. These birds are likely to be sick and are best avoided. , Zebra finches can be quite talkative, singing throughout the day. Make sure the singing is not an irritating sound for you., Male and female birds have different coloration. The males have more elaborate features, including orange patches on their cheeks, stripes on their throats, and white spots along their sides. Male beaks are bright red. Females are plainer in decoration, and are mostly gray. Females have orange beaks.Young birds are mostly gray in coloring, with black beaks. They will achieve their adult coloration when they are about 90 days old.
Pairs of males or pairs of females can form very close bonds, and can be very happy together., Finches are very social birds and can benefit from having a companion in the cage.It is also necessary if you are planning to breed your finches. However, it is recommended to only have one pair per cage, to minimize fighting.


If you may want a small colony of birds, make sure they have enough flight space. They should not be crowded. You will need multiple cages, you can set up an outdoor aviary.

"
"
Provide food for your finch.,
Keep the seed feeder filled.,
Feed your finches some other foods occasionally.,
Provide clean, fresh water daily.,
Provide goodies like cuttle-bones.",How to Raise Zebra Finches3," Finches are vegetarian, and in the wild, their diet consists of grain, vegetation, and seeds. You can purchase bird seed mixes at a pet store. Buy it in small quantities in sealed boxes or containers. This is more likely to keep the freshness and vitamins intact. Avoid buying food from giant hoppers. These expose food to air, and given the large size of the hopper, the food is less than fresh and likely to be depleted in nutrition., A finch will regulate its diet to suit its needs, and therefore, it will not overeat. Ensure that the bird's seed feeder is constantly filled.


The exception, however, are sunflower seeds, which are delicious but also high in fat. A finch knows no self-control around sunflower seeds and could become obese, so save these for a rare treat. , Finches can also eat basic household foods such as vegetables and breadcrumbs. Avoid meats and spicy/sweet foods.


Remove any untouched perishable food daily.

, Give your finches two different areas to drink water. Try an open dish, which is the type that typically comes with the cage. Also use a clear drinker, which is a bottle that attaches to the side of the cage. This type has a spout or mini-dish at the bottom that the birds can drink from.This will train the finches to drink from different types of water sources. This is important in case you give your birds to someone else. If the new owner doesn’t use the same type of water dispenser that you used, the bird may not know how to drink. It can easily become dehydrated in this case.
Change the water every day to ensure that it is clean and fresh.

, Cuttle-bones are taken from cuttlefish and provide minerals like iron and calcium for your bird. Your bird will dig his beak into the soft side of the cuttlebone to get the calcium. This action will also keep his beak in good shape."
"
Allow your finches to fly freely around the room.,
Don’t make sudden movements or noises around your finches.,
Take care if handling your zebra finch.,
Watch out for illness or a change in behavior.",How to Raise Zebra Finches4," Even when they live in a large indoor cage, the birds still need daily exercise in the form of freely flying in a room. Do this once the birds are used to their cage and its location. Be sure to close all windows and doors before letting the birds out of the cage.An alternative is a large outdoor aviary in a sheltered spot, where the birds can fly free. Make sure the birds have boxes and sheltered areas where they can roost and sleep at night. Also, make sure that they are not exposed to direct rain or harsh winds. If you live in a harsh climate, an indoor cage might be the better option. , Most finches are very excitable and do not do well with sudden movements or noises. Zebra finches are pretty hardy in this regard. But you should still treat them with care by providing a calm environment for them.

, Zebra finches are very delicate. Give the bird time to get used to you before you hold it. Then you can gradually build up the amount of time you hold the bird. Always handle with care and handle very lightly.

, If your finch gets injured or sick, place it in a separate cage in a warm room. Call your vet immediately.


Signs of ill health include being withdrawn, being fluffed up, resting more than usual, breathing more rapidly, tail bobbing, loss of voice, weight loss, liquid droppings, and lack of appetite. "

Provide nesting material only if you want your birds to breed.,
Make sure your cage is large enough.,
Provide a nesting area.,
Place the nest box as high as possible.,
Keep the cage in a quiet place.,
Monitor the eggs.,
Remove infertile eggs.,
Watch the chicks develop.,
Separate the chicks from the parents after 6 weeks.,
Identify the chicks with leg bands.",How to Raise Zebra Finches5," Zebra finches are physically mature enough to start breeding from around 3 months of age. But it is advisable to wait until the finches are more mature at 6 months of age before breeding.


If you have the space to keep several birds, its fine to keep more hens than cocks. But if you are using indoor cages, then one pair of finches (one of either sex) in the same cage works best. A happy male zebra finch uses a special song to woo the female, and will ""bounce"" on the perch to impress her.

, The mother finch will lay around 8 eggs. This means that when the eggs hatch, there may be 10 birds all in the same space. If it is cramped, they will be stressed. This can result in poor health or even fatalities. , Provide several clean, new nests so that your zebra finches can choose the one they want to raise their family in.


Zebra finches like an enclosed nest box with a single entrance hole.
Zebra finches prefer wicker nest boxes. These types of nests are not great for disinfecting afterwards, however. If you opt for wicker, consider it as a single-use box. Throw it out after each clutch of eggs and replace it with a new one. Check out your local pet store for suitable nests.
The nest box should contain a substrate that is warm and comfortable. Dried grass (hay) works well. Use caution with man-made substrates made of cotton (such as those sold for hamster bedding). These contain fibers which could get tangled around your birds’ legs or necks.

, Zebra finches want to feel safe while nesting. Consider attaching the nesting box to the side of the cage as near to the top as possible (rather than resting on the floor of the cage).

, Your finch cage should be situated in a quiet place in your house. You don’t want the nesting birds to feel threatened by potential predators, such as the house cat or dog.

, Take inventory of the number of eggs that have been laid without disturbing the nest. The mother will lay a clutch of about 8 eggs, at a rate of about one egg per day.


The female bird starts to incubate the eggs as soon as they are laid, but both birds will take turns in keeping the eggs warm. The eggs will hatch after about 2 weeks.

, If three weeks have passed and the eggs have not hatched, they are infertile. Remove them quickly. Then the mother will lay new fresh eggs.


It is impossible to distinguish new eggs from the infertile ones, so it’s important to keep them separate.
Separate the mating pair between clutches. Make sure to give your birds a rest before the breed again.

, After 21 days, the chicks will leave the nest to explore the rest of the cage. They also start to eat on their own at around 4 weeks of age.


After 6 weeks, they will develop their adult plumage and colors.
Most Zebras are very good parents. They won't need any help from you.

, When their adult colors start to show in the plumage, the chicks should be moved to a separate cage.


Talk to your local bird store about selling the chicks. The pet store may also allow you to trade the birds for seed and supplies.

, If you intend to breed birds regularly, then identify the chicks by using permanent bands on their legs. Use a color-coded system so you can identify who their parents are. This avoids accidental inbreeding of closely related birds in the future.


These bands should be put on the right leg once the bird is around 8 days old.
There are specific bird ringing kits available from specialist avian shops, or you can find them online. "

Conceal the pill in a treat.,
Put the pill in your cat’s mouth and encourage it to swallow.,
Check to make sure the cat’s mouth is empty.",How to Give a Cat Probiotics1," Try hiding the probiotic pill inside of something more tasty that will trick your cat into eating the pill. This will mask the flavor of the pill and make your cat more likely to eat the entire thing.You might consider putting it inside a soft cat treat, or squishing the pill inside a small piece of cooked (boiled or baked) chicken.
The feline probiotic pills are typically the size of a small human vitamin pill, so it should be fairly easy to conceal in a piece of food that your cat can easily ingest.;
, Hold your cat securely on your lap and gently pry open its mouth enough to slide the pill inside. Your cat will try to spit out the pill, so make sure you gently hold the cat’s mouth closed until you can see that the cat has swallowed.Do not do anything to endanger your cat or force it to do anything it is protesting aggressively against. Your cat will not like this, but if the cat starts freaking out, don’t try to continue the process by force.

, Once your cat has swallowed the probiotic pill, check the inside of the cat’s mouth to ensure that the pill has really gone down. Cats are notorious for pretending to swallow unwanted pills and then spitting them out as soon as you release them.Gently pry open your cat’s mouth to check inside for the pill.
You can also monitor the cat for several moments once you release it to ensure that it doesn’t spit out the pill.

Give your cat a probiotic treat.,
Sprinkle probiotic powder on your cat’s food.,
Ask your veterinarian for help.",How to Give a Cat Probiotics2," There are some specialized cat treats that include probiotics. These treats are one of the easier methods of providing probiotics to your cat, as most cats will typically just eat them like any other treat and require no coercing.Most larger pet stores will carry probiotic treats. But if you have trouble finding them, consult your veterinarian for advice.

, If other methods have failed you, try sprinkling probiotic powder on your cat’s food. This is a great way to ensure your cat gets a little probiotic in its system every time it eats some of its food. Make sure you follow the directions for how much to give your cat and don’t exceed the recommended dose.This kind of powder should be available at any pet store, or at your local veterinarian’s office.

, If you have trouble getting your cat to take the probiotics in any of the various forms, you can always enlist the help of your veterinarian. Your vet will be able to use their expertise to coerce your cat into ingesting the probiotics.In a worst case scenario, your vet can hold down the cat and force it to take the probiotics, or even provide them via injection. Either way, it’s better that this comes from your vet instead of you so that the cat will not associate you with the negative experience.

Notice if your cat has regular diarrhea.,
Try probiotics if your cat seems to get sick often.,
Consider probiotics as a preventative measure.",How to Give a Cat Probiotics3," Diarrhea can be a major sign of trouble for a cat’s digestive tract. If your cat has diarrhea, it might be time to check out feline probiotics. This can be an easy way to solve a huge digestive problem for your cat.Recurrent diarrhea can be massively uncomfortable for you cat, so giving it probiotics is a great first step in fixing the issue.
Remember that probiotics can alter the bacterial makeup in your cat’s digestive tract, which can cause an upset tummy and more diarrhea. However, this should only last for a few days while your cat adjust to the probiotics.If giving probiotics to your cat doesn’t seem to work and the diarrhea persists after several weeks of probiotic treatment, consider ending the treatment. Consult your veterinarian for further advice at this point.

, Probiotics boost the immune system’s ability to respond to invading disease cells. If your cat seems to be getting sick often, or feeling lethargic and under the weather regularly, you might want to consider giving the kitty some regular probiotics to help.Bowel/intestine health is strongly connected to the health of the rest of the body. Ensuring that your cat has enough good bacteria in its body will help your kitty fight off infections in other areas as well.

, Probiotics help prevent future digestive issues in cats, which is why they are recommended for daily use by all cats, regardless of age or health condition. You can consider giving your cat (especially an adult cat) daily probiotics as a way to help prevent anything going wrong with your kitty’s digestive system in the future.Kittens typically don’t need probiotics unless they have a preexisting digestive issue. But this can be a good preventative measure for most adult and senior cats.

If you are adopting a kitten from a rescue or shelter, they will usually spay her before she goes home with you, especially since kittens shouldn’t be taken away from their mothers until they are at least 8 weeks old.In addition to your cat being at least 8 weeks old, she should also be at least 2 pounds in weight, before she’s spayed.In order to avoid your cat going into heat, you should get her spayed before she’s 5 months old (unless there are medical reasons why she can’t go for surgery).;
, If a cat is already in heat, or even if she’s pregnant, a spay can still be performed. However, a veterinarian would need to examine the cat and determine how far along she is with her pregnancy before it’s decided if a spay is safe., Cats can be spayed at any age. However, cats who are older than 7 years of age may need to have pre-surgical blood tests completed to determine if sedation (and therefore surgery) is safe., A spay surgery can be quite pricy if you have a low or limited income. However, there are a lot of spay and neuter programs available all over North America that offer low-cost or free surgeries.Speak to your veterinarian about what programs may be available in your area.
Call your local SPCA, Humane Society, cat shelter, or cat rescue to ask if they know of any local programs.
Use the search program on the following website — http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/tips/afford_spay_neuter.html — to find a program based on your zip code or city and state info.

, Whether you decide to take your cat to your veterinarian or a spay/neuter clinic, you’ll have to book the appointment in advance. Some clinics or veterinarians may want to examine your cat before they perform surgery, especially if you cat has never been to that vet/clinic before. In many cases the surgeon will conduct the exam immediately before the spay surgery. If the surgeon finds any issues, the surgery won’t be perform that day. If the surgeon doesn’t find any issues, the surgery will continue as planned.If the surgeon discovers any issues that prevent the surgery from being conducted, they will contact you to discuss. Most of the reasons for denying surgery are relatively minor (e.g. your cat has a fever or hasn’t overcome a previous illness or infection yet) and will simply require waiting a little while before performing the surgery.
Many spay/neuter clinics will require proof of vaccination prior to performing the spay surgery. If the clinic doesn’t have this information already on file, make sure you bring a paper copy with you to the spay appointment.

, A cat’s spay surgery does require your cat to go under anaesthetic. Because of this, you should take your cat’s food away starting the night before her surgery, or, if the surgery is in the afternoon, approximately 3-4 hours before surgery. She can, however, continue to drink water.If you’re getting a kitten spayed, ask the veterinarian if she needs to stop eating before surgery. Depending on her age, she may need to continue eating right up until her surgery.
If you have more than one cat or kitten, you may want to isolate the one being spayed so the other cats can continue to eat.
Anesthetic can cause nausea and vomiting, which can actually kill a sedated cat, so it’s best if your cat’s stomach is empty during surgery.

, If you’re taking a feral or stray cat for a spay surgery, or if your cat normally goes outside on a regular basis, it is best to bring her inside the night before the surgery is to be performed., When taking your cat into the clinic for her surgery, make sure she’s inside a carrier. Depending on her age and experience at a vet’s office, she may be nervous and stressed — having her inside a carrier gives her a safe and comfortable spot to wait for her surgery.You may need to leave the carrier at the clinic while your cat is having her surgery. Or you will be asked to bring it back with you when you come to pick her up.

, Your veterinarian may prescribe a pain medication for your cat after her surgery. If a medication is provided, follow the instructions as to when and how to give them to your cat.Do not, under any circumstances, give your cat human pain medications. Many of these can be toxic to your cat and will do more harm than good.
Most cats receive pain medication during surgery, which can take up to 24 hours to wear off.

, When you bring your cat home immediately after her surgery, she probably won’t be too hungry. You can give her about ⅛ cup of food and a ¼ cup of water right away. If she eats and drinks it, and she’s able to keep it down, you can provide her with more food and water.Do not provide your cat with unlimited food and water immediately after her surgery. Even if she’s hungry, too much food and water may cause stomach upset.
If you cat doesn’t eat or drink the night after her surgery, there’s nothing to be concerned about. Contact your veterinarian if you cat doesn’t start eating again the day after her surgery.

, After your cat has been spayed, she may not feel very good and she will most likely want to crawl into a corner and ignore the world. In order to allow her to do this comfortably, give her a quiet space in your home all to herself.If you have more the one animal, you’ll want to make sure this location is blocked off so the other animals cannot disturb your recovering cat.
Putting her alone in a bathroom or bedroom, with a comfy place to sleep, as well as litter, are two good places to consider.

, When the anesthetic is wearing off, your cat may shake or tremble a little bit — this is perfectly normal and shouldn’t last more than 24 hours. If you cat is still shaking or trembling after 24 hours, contact your veterinarian., A spay surgery shouldn’t have any long-term negative effects on your cat. If you cat shows any of the following symptoms, it can be a sign of a complication which will need to be checked by a veterinarian.If your cat is acting lethargic or is sleeping a lot more than usual.
If your cat cat isn’t eating or drinking very much.
If your cat is suffering from diarrhea or is vomiting a lot.

, For most cats, the surgery doesn’t cause any long-term negative symptoms. In fact, most cats will be back to “normal” within 48 hours of surgery. If your cat isn’t back to “normal” within 2-3 days, contact your veterinarian., Part of your daily routine, after your cat’s been spayed, is to check her incision to make sure it’s healing properly. You’ll want to make sure the incision itself is binding and healing, and that it doesn’t look red or inflamed (and therefore infected) or has any discharge. If the incision isn’t healing, or looks infected, contact your veterinarian.Look at your cat’s incision the day you take her home, this is what a normal, healing incision should look like. You can use this as a basis for watching her incision for the next few weeks. If it never changes, gets red in colour, becomes inflamed, or something starts to leak out, you’ll need to contact your veterinarian.The incision should heal substantially within 7 to 10 days. After this time the incision should be able to hold up against stretching and pulling.Note — incisions heal from side-to-side, not end-to-end, therefore a longer incision doesn’t take longer to heal than a short incision.

, Your vet may recommend that you keep your cat from running and jumping up to 2 weeks after she’s been spayed. An adult cat may not feel like doing this right after surgery anyway, so it may be easy to restrain her. A kitten, however, may be difficult to restrain, but will also likely bounce back from surgery faster.If you do need to keep your cat from running and jumping, she’ll need to be placed somewhere in your home where there aren’t a lot of places to jump up on, and not a lot of room for running. A bathroom or bedroom might work well.
If your cat has a tall scratching post, window seat, or cat condo, you may need to put them away until your cat is fully healed.

, You cat may be tempted to clean and lick the site of her incision, especially if it becomes itchy. An occasional cleaning shouldn’t be a problem, as long as she doesn’t spend a lot of time cleaning the area. If, however, she is constantly licking the area of her incision, you’ll need to put a special collar on her.The formal name of this collar is the Elizabethan collar. The casual name you’ll hear more often is the “cone of shame”!

, In general, cats don’t need to be bathed very often. However, if you do need to give your cat a bath after she’s had surgery, you should wait at least 10 days."

Source your eggs or larvae.,
Provide a home.,
Hatch your eggs.,
Look after your larvae.,
Move your larvae to a larger home.,
Create the ideal conditions for pupation.,
Emerge your moths.",How to Raise Privet Hawk Moths," You can either buy your eggs from online breeders such as 'world wide butterflies'. Or, you can find your own caterpillars in the wild; however this takes a long time and you need to be able to identify the caterpillar in order to provide correct food plant.;
, The best container to use is an old fish tank with fine mesh over the top and a lining of mud about 2 cm high. Make sure your container is tall enough to hold tall living plants, and large enough that overcrowding of caterpillars does not occur. Remember that larvae can grow up to 10cm!


The two most dangerous things for a larvae are parasitic wasps and mold. If the cage is not well ventilated, the caterpillar's frass (faeces) will go moldy. If the cage is not screened with fine netting, parasitic wasps may kill your caterpillars.
If you are serious about breeding butterflies and moths, a specialist screen terrarium is a good investment.

, Get a small tupperware box and line it with a sheet of toilet paper, gently lay your eggs onto this and close the lid. To provide oxygen and moisture, you should open the lid and breathe on the eggs twice daily.


Do not put leaves in the box, as the sealed environment can cause some species of plant to produce gases that can harm the tiny eggs.

, After the eggs have hatched, leave them in the box to eat their eggshells. The eggshells contain nutrients that are essential for them to start eating. Lay some cuttings of privet (or other food plant) in the box and transfer the caterpillars to a new box every two days. To make sure you don't harm the caterpillars, use a fine paintbrush to gently transfer the tiny caterpillars from the box into one with fresh food.

, Once the larvae have grown bigger, they will lay dormant for a few days and shed their skin; this is called ecdysis. Do not mistake this for illness. On the third instar (stage in between ecdysis), use your paintbrush and move the caterpillars to a live potted plant in the large container used before. Every three days you should place another potted plant next to the old one, and the larvae will instinctively move to it.

, Pupation is when the caterpillar creates a chrysalis and undergoes metamorphosis, different species do this in different ways. Instead of spinning a cocoon of forming one on a branch, the Privet Hawk Moth burrows into the ground to make a cocoon. When the caterpillars gain a shade of brown on their backs and lose interest in food, you should transfer them to a deep bin of non-chemical topsoil.


After three weeks dig them up carefully, and place them in a tin. Either store these in the fridge or another cold, frost-free environment such as your garage. In the wild they would stay underground over the winter and hibernate so you put them in a fridge to simulate winter. Do not keep them in a warm place because the warmth will cause premature emergence.

, The following summer you should place the pupae on a sheet of corrugated cardboard in one of the grooves; this will aid with grip. You should spritz the pupae with water to stop them from drying out, but do not saturate them! When your pupae hatch, place them in their cage again so their wings can dry in safety; then release them!

Start young.,
Get the cat used to your world and way of life.,
Approach a cat gently and slowly, always letting it see you.,
Give plenty of tender loving care.,
Recognize that every cat is different.",How to Raise a Loving Cat," If you're getting the kitten from a friend, or even raising the cat yourself, the most important thing is that it grows up socially, and is handled often. Try to see your kitten often before adopting it, if you can. Cats can be quite stubborn, and if they don't grow up around and with humans, they may well be the kind of cat that hides under the couch when you come into the room.;
, Introduce it slowly to your house, your family and your other pets. It takes time to get used to all the new sights, sounds, smells and movements around them when newly introduced to your home.

, Do not come upon a cat from behind; it will be instinctively wary and possibly scared. Very gently touch the cat's paws, ears, and tail, petting the cat with long, soft and kind strokes. Getting the cat used to physical contact reduces the risk of you and other people getting scratches when they pet the cat in the wrong place (such as the stomach or a sore spot).

, No matter if you're bringing up your next family pet or about to adopt out, always give the kittens a good impression of humans! The world could always use another friendly cat and an even kinder human being.


Speak softly and kindly to cats. Cats detect a great deal through listening and watching body language of other creatures, including humans. Cats subjected to angry, yelling humans will react just the same as kids or adults respond to such behavior––with fear, anxiety and a desire to get away. You can use tone of voice to make a cat behave but never overdo it.
Allow the cat to work out how it wishes to sit with you or near you. Not all cats are lap cats, not all cats want to be petted every five minutes and not all cats want to be with you constantly. On the other hand, some cats would love to sit on your lap and prevent you from knitting, typing, reading or whatever else, so you'll just need to learn to go with the flow and find the best ways to accommodate the cat's needs and yours.

, Try not to generalize about what cat behaviors. As with many living beings, each cat comes with its own personality, history and experiences. Some cats are born trusting, others aren't; some cats are stoic, while others aren't, and so forth. Purr-sonality does have its role to play. If you are willing to spend time with your cat, acknowledge and respect the way that it is, the cat will be happier around you and more likely to reciprocate the love you give to it.

Typically, hypertension is related to heart disease, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, or another underlying condition.Tell the vet if your cat takes any other medications or if it's ever been diagnosed with a medical issue. Some medications, such as diuretics, can interfere with its effectiveness or cause blood pressure to become too low.;
, Amlodipine should be used cautiously in pets with liver problems, so tell your cat’s vet if it’s ever been diagnosed with any issues. If you’re not sure about its liver function, ask the vet if they recommend any tests.Amlodipine is often prescribed to cats with kidney disease, but it’s recommended that the kidneys be routinely monitored to rule out adverse side effects. If you’re unable to bring your cat in for follow-up care, ask the vet if they recommend an alternative medication., When a cat’s systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than 200, some vets recommend starting amlodipine treatment at an increased dose.It’s typically given orally and, in 2016, a more palatable, chewable form became available.Ask the vet if they can prescribe a chewable form and if there’s a significant difference in cost between it and a tablet medication.
It’s best to avoid stressing a cat with hypertension, so ask the vet about transdermal or injection dosage forms if you have trouble giving your cat oral medication., Before leaving the vet’s office, make sure you understand how to give your cat its medication. Amlodipine is often given with food, but you should confirm this with your cat’s vet. If they recommend administering it with food, you can place a tablet in a pill pocket treat or give a chewable dosage form with a meal.Ask the vet if you should feed your cat a pill pocket treat along with a full meal.
Wash your hands after giving your cat amlodipine or any other medication., Amlodipine is effective for 24 hours, so it’s most often prescribed to be taken once daily.Do your best to give your cat its medication at the same time each day, such as with breakfast or dinner. You can choose the time of day that’s best for you and your cat, but just be sure to stick to that same time each day., Missing a dose can cause a spike in blood pressure, so try setting a daily alarm and take a dose with you when you and your cat are away from home.If you do miss a dose, don’t try to catch up by double dosing. Instead, give your cat its medicine as soon as you remember or, if its next scheduled dose is soon, administer the drug at that time., Never take your cat off of any medication without first consulting a vet. Even if you see that it’s working, stopping treatment can cause a life-threatening spike in blood pressure.Call the vet if your cat vomits or displays any adverse side effects after taking its medicine. They might recommend stopping treatment and provide an alternative medication.

, The vet will most likely recommend a follow-up visit within a few weeks of the first dose. They’ll take your cat’s blood pressure to make sure the medication is effective and, if necessary, adjust the dose.If your cat has other medical issues, they’ll also test for adverse side effects or verify that secondary treatments are working.

, Amlodipine is safe for most cats, but can sometimes cause side effects related to low pressure. Contact the vet if you notice symptoms such as:Loss of appetite and weight loss
Depression or lethargy
Signs of reduced kidney function, like dark, strong-smelling urine
Sudden fainting

, Call the vet if your cat vomits after its first dose, as this can indicate an allergy or hypersensitivity to the medication. Sudden collapse or severe weakness and lethargy are signs of overdose, and you should immediately contact the vet or your local animal poison control center if you observe these symptoms.If your cat has hypertension related to heart disease, seek emergency care if it has difficulty breathing or moving."

When they are awake, though, they are full of energy. Let them nap, but provide scratching posts, toys, and things to climb for when they wake up.A bored kitten during the day is a hyper kitten at night.


Keep most of the exciting, interactive toys hidden when you're not actively involved. If you leave a toy out on the floor all day, the cat usually loses interest.Do not leave out toys with string, since these can be dangerous when tangled around the kitten.Puzzle games are an excellent way to keep the cat entertained. These challenge the cat to open a container to reach a treat inside.;
, Cats are most active around dusk and dawn, not through the entire night.A daily play session in the late evening, roughly an hour before bed, will help sync this schedule to your own.


You can mimic play fighting with a toy on a string, play fetch with a ping pong ball, or play chase with a laser pointer. Rotate toys to keep it exciting and to provide a mix of stalking, chasing, pouncing, and toying with the ""prey.""Wake the kitten up if necessary. You shouldn’t have to keep this up for too long before your pet learns that evenings are for play and nights are for sleep., It's best to end playtime before the kitten gets bored. First, spend five minutes slowing down the pace of play to calm the kitten down.Find a clear way to signal that playtime is over, for example by letting the kitten catch an extra enticing toy.If your kitten is getting hyperactive near the end of playtime, distract its attention to a less exciting toy.

, Make this a high-protein meal that completes the kitten's food needs for the day.Cats in the wild hunt, then eat, then sleep, so this playtime and food routine mimics this pattern.


If your cat wakes you up in the morning meowing for food, delay the evening meal until just before you get in bed, instead of before you get ready.This way the cat has less time to wait between meals.

, Start your normal bedtime routine with the kitten watching. This teaches your kitten which activities signal bedtime for both of you, and helps establish a routine., Turn out the lights and bring the kitten to its bed. Hopefully the kitten will be tuckered out at this point. If not, calm it down with cuddles or by playing relaxing ""music for cats"" from online playlists. Repeat this routine every day, and the kitten should learn to adapt.


Cats are natural observers and enjoy being up high to observe household activities. A high perch or ""cat condo"" is a great sleeping spot, as long as your kitten is old enough to climb it safely.

, While you might love the idea of snuggling up with your feline friend at bedtime, keep hyperactive kittens out of the bedroom until they've matured or adapted to your schedule.


When the time comes for bed, close the door and do not let your cat in. He may cry or scratch at the door for a bit, but as long as you do not reward the behavior by letting the cat in, he should stop.If your kitten keeps scratching at the door for prolonged periods, try creating a device to deter him from going to the door. Try putting double-sided tape near the door, or vinyl carpet cover with the knobby side pointed upward., Sometimes, kittens disrupt owners' sleep because they miss the warmth of their mothers and siblings. If your cat wants to crawl into bed with you, try warming the cat's blanket in the dryer for twenty minutes before bedtime., Sometimes the most annoying part of a hyper kitten is the noise its toys make. Packing away the toys reinforces that night is time for sleeping instead. If the kitten is still active at night, provide quiet, soft toys instead of hard toys or anything that squeaks or jangles.If you have the space, set up the quiet nighttime toys in a separate area of your home. Choose a location with an appealing distraction, such as a quiet film or radio, or a window with a view of an outdoor light., Paying attention to hyper kittens encourages them to keep up that behavior. If a kitten bugs you to the point that you start playing with it, feeding it, or giving it some type of attention, it will repeat that behavior over and over, because it's trained you to respond! The first few nights will be difficult, but ignoring the kitten is the best way to teach it that you are not available 24/7.While not a quick fix, this type of training is important for a kitten’s future. Your kitten needs to learn early on that it cannot initiate feeding or play at any time of day.

, It may seem counter-intuitive, but if ignoring your kitten doesn't stop it from bugging you, reach out and give it a massive hug. You’ll notice it probably won’t be overly impressed with this excessive love, and that’s a good thing. It teaches the cat that annoying you at night leads to the wrong result, without actually punishing the animal., Cats have a shorter sleep cycle than humans. Even if your kitten goes to bed at the same time as you, it will probably wake up early looking for breakfast or attention. The absolute worst thing you can do is get up and give them that attention. If you do, they’ll have your trained perfectly in no time! Instead, make sure there’s some food left out the night before that they can eat breakfast before you get up.Consider an automatic feeder that dispenses food at specific intervals. If your kitten knows there will be food in its bowl around 7 am, it won’t bug you for breakfast. Instead your kitten will wait by the bowl until the food appears.
If your kitten meows for food in the night, consider setting the automatic feeder for a nighttime meal. Move the mealtime forward by ten minutes a night until your kitten eats in the morning., If your kitten has not already been spayed or neutered, this may be contributing to hyperactivity. Most veterinarians consider this procedure safe for kittens as young as six to eight weeks old, as long as the animal weighs at least two pounds (0.9 kg).The procedure should prevent the following types of behavior (at day or night):Female cats can go into heat when as young as four months old. They tend to make loud, unusual noises, rub against people and objects, and try to get outside.
Un-neutered males are generally more active and noisier than neutered ones. They may also spray furniture or act aggressive.

, Cats can suffer from medical issues that disturb sleep, just like humans. If your kitten shows any of these symptoms, have a vet conduct a full examination:


Meowing for much of the night sometimes means the cat is in pain.
Active behavior for most of the day and night points to insomnia or another disorder. It's common for kittens to sleep 20 hours a day.Sudden hyperactivity in a previously calm cat can be a sign of a thyroid disorder, although this is rare in young cats.A vet can detect this with a blood test and prescribe daily medication., These products are designed to mimic a cat's facial pheromones, the substances cats rub onto objects with their face to mark them as familiar. Unfortunately, there are few high quality studies of the synthetic version. You can try it to see whether your kitten calms down, but there's no guarantee it will work.Homeopathic calming treatments, including ""flower remedies,"" are not based on science.

Consider having your kitten microchipped.",How to Raise a Kitten," Kittens should not leave their mother before 8 weeks of age. Indeed there is some debate about when is the right time, with some people arguing that 12 weeks is the correct age to go to a new home. However, at 12 weeks of age a kitten's ability to accept new experiences is slowing up, which means it can be harder for it to fit into a new home.Most kittens brought up from birth in loving homes and with plenty of food and love, are confident enough to leave their mothers after 8 weeks. This is a good compromise to allow the kitten to be socialized in their new home at the right age.;
, You need to kitten proof your home before the little one arrives. Put away all hazards that the kitten could get into. This includes cleaning supplies, medicines, and small items that you treasure and don't want broken. You should also keep cords, such as computer cords or cords on blinds, out of reach of the kitten.You may want to consider certain areas off limits to the kitten. If that is the case, you need to figure out a way to block off the areas so the kitten can't get in.
Get rid of plants that are poisonous to cats. There are a wide variety of common house plants that can severely injure, or kill, a cat if it eats them. Research your plants to see if they cause a threat to your new family member., You will need to buy a variety of items in order to meet the needs of your new family member. These items include (but are not limited to):A litter box: A kitten's little legs require a low-sided tray so it can hop in without problems. You can always change to a deep-sided litter box once the kitten is older.
Cat litter: Avoid clumping cat litter since kittens like to explore with their mouths and if it swallows clumping cat litter it can form a blockage in its gut.
Food and water bowls: Ceramic or stainless steel are best, as these wash well and the surface doesn't scratch and harbour bacteria like plastic bowls do.
Kitten food: Start by feeding the same food the kitten was weaned onto. Ask whoever has been taking care of the cat for the brand of food and how much they have been giving it.
Hiding places: The kitten will be anxious at first, so provide plenty of hiding places, such as cardboard boxes, where it can feel safe as it gathers its courage.
Blankets or a soft bed: Soft bedding to snuggle into is important for the kitten. Try to bring the blanket or soft bed when you pick up the kitten, so that you can get some familiar smells on it from its mother and original home.
Comb or brush: Groom your kitten from an early age so it doesn't mind being combed as an adult. This is especially important for long-haired cats.

, This should contain its food, water, bedding, hiding places, and litter tray. Leave the kitten in peace to explore for a little while and find that the room is safe.


Spend some time with the kitten in its room and sit on the floor. Let it come to you to explore. Speak gently and quietly, and if she rubs against you gently stroke her back.
As the kitten gets to know where to find food, water, and its tray, and over the coming days as it becomes bolder, you can start leaving the room door open so it can slip out to explore.

, From 3 - 6 months old a kitten's job is to learn to hunt, because in the wild it would live by catching vermin and eating them. It is important to give the kitten an outlet for this behavior in play. Give it plenty of toys to stalk, chase, and pounce on. For example, kittens like small stuffed animal toys that they can carry around like prey.You can purchase cat toys but you don't have to spend money to make toys. A scrunched up ball of paper, a small soft toy tied onto a length of string, empty cotton reels, and ping-pong balls in an empty bathtub all make fantastic toys., Keep its interest in the toys by rotating the toys it has available, rather than leaving them all out all the time. Put some away, so that when it sees them it's like having a new toy all over.

, Have friends come over too meet the kitten. Play music on the stereo, run the vacuum, and let it see running water in the bath.These will help your kitten to understand, and enjoy instead of being afraid of, the variety of things that will happen in its life.

, Engage in play sessions by flicking a ball for it to chase, directing a laser pointer, and playing with a wing-on-a-string. This gives the kitten an outlet for its energy and helps it to bond with you.

, When you bring it home, feed what it is used to eating at her previous home. A sudden change of diet will upset its tummy.


Decide what you want to feed the kitten long term. After 2 - 3 days, when it is settled, you can gradually change its diet. Do this by mixing in increasing quantities of the new food over several days so that the kitten's stomach gets a chance to adjust to the new food.

, This food is balanced to provide the calcium and extra protein that a growing kitten needs. Choose a good quality food that has a named meat, for example ""chicken"" rather than ""meat meal"" or ""chicken meal"", as top ingredient on the label.


Know that cats are obligate carnivores, which means they depend on meat to be healthy. This means that you need to avoid foods that are heavily bulked up with cereals. You can spot this by seeing if cereals or soy products are high on the food label.

, Your kitten needs a growth food during their first six months. After that, their growth slows down.


Kitten foods are calorie dense, so if kitty is putting on too much weight, it is fine to switch to an adult food (less calories) at six months of age.
If your kitty is at a correct weight switch to adult food at one year of age.

, For example, don't give milk or cream. The kitten doesn't need it and it is likely to upset its stomach.

, It will also set a baseline for your kitten's health, as well as identifying any problems that need to be addressed.

, Desexing is important, as it reduces the cat's urge to spray or territory mark. It also reduces the urge to escape and wander in order to find a mate. Your veterinarian will discuss the best age for surgery for your kitten.
Early neutering can be done from 12 weeks of age and should be done by 5 - 6 months at the latest.

, Your first routine visit to the vet should be around 9 weeks of age for its first vaccination. The vet will advise about the disease risks in your area and what vaccinations are advisable.A typical ""core,"" or essential, vaccination is against feline distemper. This is a tough virus that you can walk in on your shoes, so even if kitty is an indoor cat they are still at risk.
Feline leukemia requires close contact with other cats, so if your kitten lives indoors, the risk is much lower and this vaccine may not be necessary.
Depending on which state you live in, rabies vaccination may be compulsory. This is usually given from 12 weeks of age.

, Worming is advisable to get rid of any worms passed from mother to kitten.Worming protocols vary depending on which products are used. The easiest method is to use a product which kills fleas and worms, such as Stronghold (UK) / Revolution (US), which is applied to the skin on the back of the neck once a month.

, A microchip is implanted beneath the skin of the scruff by your veterinarian. This transmits a unique number which is registered with a database that holds your contact details. Should the cat escape and be handed in at a shelter, or should the cat be stolen, the chip provides proof of ownership.

Act quickly if your bird escapes.,
Have a blood feather removed if you cut it.",How to Clip a Small Bird's Wings," If you've never clipped a bird's wings before, this is vital. A veterinarian or veterinary technician should guide you through the process.A bird's first wing clipping should always be conducted by a veterinarian. Take your bird to a local avian vet and have them show you the correct clipping process.
After the initial clipping, you may be able to clip your bird's wings again. However, if you feel uncomfortable or uncertain, have a vet clip your bird's wings. It's not worth the risk of injuring your bird.;
, To trim your bird's feathers, you need to be able to see what you're doing. You also need a quiet room to keep your bird calm. Find a room in your home that's both well-lit and quiet. This is best for your bird's safety and comfort.You should also choose a room that you can close off, without any open windows or doors. You do not want your bird to get out during the clipping process.

, Have all your supplies ready before you begin clipping. The process will be stressful for your bird, and you do not want to prolong it by scrambling for materials. You will need the following:A pair of small and sharp scissors
A thick towel
If possible, find someone else to assist you with the clipping process.

, Birds will resist having their wings clipped. You will need to wrap your bird in the towel to keep it still during the clipping process.You will use the towel like a baseball mitt to grab the bird. Do not put pressure on a bird's chest. Birds do not have diaphragms, so any pressure on the chest could prevent breathing.
If someone else is holding the bird, have that person use one hand to hold the bird's body. The person should use their other hand to gently hold the bird's head between their thumb and forefinger. This will prevent biting.

, It is very important you know which feathers to clip. When clipping a bird's wings, you should only clip the primary flight feathers. Gently spread the bird's wing apart and locate these feathers.Your bird should have two sets of overlapping feathers on its wings. The smaller feathers that overlap the larger feathers should not be cut.
The larger feathers stemming from the smaller feathers are known as the ""primary flight feathers."" You will be trimming the first six primary flight feathers. Make sure you do not trim them so short you cut into the shorter, overlapping feathers.

, When you begin cutting, snip the feather closest to the wing tip. You will be working inward as you trim.Clip the primary flight feathers about a quarter inch below the shorter, overlapping feathers.

, Trim the first six primary flight feathers, moving from the wingtip towards your bird's body. Make sure to trim a quarter inch below the overlapping short feathers. Do not cut into these feathers, as this can harm your bird.Clip only one feather at a time. Clipping a bird's wings takes concentration and precision. If you try to clip all six feathers at once, you could end up going too fast and harming your bird.

, Blood feathers are newly formed feathers. If cut, they will bleed. Blood feathers are waxy and pinkish in appearance, and also have a visible blood vessel running through them. Examine each feather to make sure it is not a blood feather before clipping.Blood feathers need to be protected. If you notice a blood feather, you should also avoid trimming the full grown feather next to it.
If there are a lot of blood feathers present, it is probably too soon to clip your bird's wings. Try putting off clipping for a few days.

, You want your bird to maintain equilibrium. Make sure the number of feathers trimmed on each side is equal. While a bird should not be able to fly, it should still be able to glide and sit on its perch. Trimming the wings unevenly could prevent balance., There is no set rule in terms of how often to clip your bird's wings. Every bird is different. Monitor your bird closely to see when trimming is necessary again. Remember, if a bird flies out of your home, it is at risk for serious accidents.About once a month, check how much growth has occurred.
When the feathers are beginning to get back to their original length, it's time to trim again.

, It is not impossible to clip your bird's wings on your own. However, it can be very difficult. This is especially true if your bird is difficult to handle. For safety purposes, try to have another person present to assist you., In rare cases, a bird can escape during the clipping process. You can prevent this by keeping all doors and windows closed, and working in a closed off room. In the event your bird escapes, act quickly.Immediately put your bird's cage in the yard. Open the cage and put a bowl of food inside.
Put fliers up around town. You should also call local veterinary clinics and animal shelters to report you lost your bird. Include any ID information, like a microchip or a leg band.

, Blood feathers will not stop bleeding on their own. If your bird bleeds continuously, it can die. A blood feathers needs to be removed with pliers and this should be done by a professional to prevent further harm to your bird. You should take your bird to the vet to have this procedure done if you clip into a blood feather."

Avoid areas that are cold or drafty.;
, Many birds will bathe themselves without human help. Place a bath in your bird’s cage or in a place where she roams freely. Allow her to bathe herself or gently put her in the water to encourage her to clean herself.Consider different types of baths such as shower perches, spray bottles, your kitchen sink, or a cage mounted bath bowl. Some birds will even rub themselves against wet branches as a cleaning method.Fill the container with 1-2 inches of water so your bird can walk and preen as she likes.Use lukewarm to room temperature water for your bird’s bath to keep her from chilling.Avoid forcing your bird to bathe.Use soap only in cases where your bird is oily and supervised by you., Depending on how dirty your bird is, you may be able to clean her simply by misting her with water. Water is generally considered the most appropriate feather spray.Gently spray your bird with a light mist of water until she appears clean.


Make sure the spray is a mist or has very light pressure so that you don’t hurt your bird. For example, some birds may enjoy the spray from a sink.Spray her every day or whenever it’s necessary.Avoid misting or spraying water directly in your bird’s face.Buy a commercial bird cleansing spray if you like, though this is generally unnecessary., In most cases, you should not was your bird with soap.However, she may get into oil or some other substance that comes off only with soap. Use a mild soap and gently bathe your bird to clean her.Make sure your bird is stable enough to wash with soap.Fill a container with an inch or two of water. Add a low concentration dishwashing liquid like Dawn, which has been shown to effectively and easily remove oils without irritating birds’ eyes or skin.Rinse your bird thoroughly with a gently mist or spray of water.This is important so that she dries properly and her natural waterproofing process isn’t affected.Talk to your vet if your bird is soiled with something that is difficult to remove, such as gum., Birds cannot fly with wet wings and air drying is an important part of waterproofing her feathers and getting her to fly again.Leave your bird in a warm and sunny room to air dry completely.Avoid using a hair dryer to dry your bird, which can burn her skin.Avoid drying her with a towel. Allowing her feathers to dry and rearrange themselves naturally is part of the waterproofing process.Stroke your bird gently in the direction of her feathers if she allows. This can help her dry.Be aware that your bird’s chest may shiver after her bath. This doesn’t mean she’s cold, but is a natural reaction to generate body heat that helps dry feathers., If your bird is especially dirty or you are unsure about cleaning her, schedule an appointment with her vet or a professional bird groomer. Either can safely and effectively clean your bird so she stays healthy and happy.


Find a vet specifically for your bird at the Association of Avian Veterinarians., Birds can be very messy, but keeping their cages clean is an important part of keeping your bird clean, healthy, and happy.Remove waste and other material such as feathers every day and do a deep cleaning every week or more often if necessary.Make sure your bird’s cage is big enough and comfortable for her by considering the following elements:


It should allow her to easily fly and spread her wings
It should provide enough space for her food and water dishes
It should have plenty of stimulation from toys and perches., You can promote your bird’s health and happiness by tidying up her cage every day.Not only can this help keep you happy and your air fresh, but may also make deeper cleaning easier.


Tidy up when your bird is playing outside of her cage. Remember to give your bird as much out-of-cage time as possible, which can make maintenance easier.Change out her food and refill her bottle with fresh water.Remove any seeds or nuts from the bottom of the cage. You’ll also need to remove any feces or other feathers from the bottom of the cage, too.Place fresh liners of paper or towels on the bottom of the cage if you use it. Throw away the soiled paper.Wipe down any surfaces with a vinegar and water mixture or an enzyme spray you purchase at a pet store., Because birds often produce big messes—from feces, food, and feathers—it’s important to deep clean the cage and its surfaces at least once a week.Clean the cage when your bird is enjoying out-of-cage time.
Remove everything from the cage, including toys and food and water dishes.
Make a paste from baking soda and water or mix ¼ cup borax with 1 cup baking soda. These mixtures can scrub surfaces including perches and cage bars.Wipe down the cage bottom with a mixture of ½ cup borax, ¼ cup white vinegar, and 2 gallons of hot water.Wash food and water dishes with dish soap in the hottest water you can.Trim any frayed ends or splinters from perches and toys.Clean any areas around the cage such as blinds or carpets. You can wipe these down or vacuum them.Replace any liners at the bottom of the cage with fresh material., Cage maintenance can alert you to possible illness in your bird.If you notice any signs of illness in your bird, take her to the vet as soon as possible. Some of the signs of illness in bird visible through cage cleaning include:


Not eating food
Throwing up, including undigested or half-digested food stuck to strange places on the cage
Discolored, undigested, or runny poop
Ragged or plucked feathers at the bottom of the cage
Blood anywhere in the cage.Lack of urine or oddly colored urine."

Call your cat.,
Look for signs of breathing.,
Look at the cat's eyes to see whether they are open.,
Check the femoral artery.,
Feel for rigor mortis.,
Check your cat’s mouth.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Dead1," Say your cat’s name in your usual high-pitched food call. A sleeping cat will often hear you and wake up. After all, what cat will miss a chance for food? If your cat is dead or very sick, it likely will not respond.


This step won’t work if your cat is deaf or hearing impaired. In this case, you can try waving the food near your cat so it can smell it. Otherwise, use the method you typically use to announce that it is time to eat.;
, Is the cat's chest moving up and down? Can you see the cat's stomach move? Hold a mirror up to the cat's nose. If the mirror fogs up, the cat is breathing. If you don’t see any fog on the mirror, this is a good indication that the cat isn’t breathing.

, Cats' eyes open after death, since it requires muscle control to keep them closed.Its pupils will also appear larger than usual if it has died.


Touch the cat’s eyeball gently. Be sure to put on disposable gloves before doing this test. If the cat is alive, it should blink when you touch its eyeball. Also, if the cat is dead, the eyeball will feel soft, rather than firm.
Check whether the pupils are dilated and fixed. If the cat is dead, the pupils will be large and unresponsive to light. Shining a light briefly in the cat’s eye is one way to test brain reactivity. If the pupils react, the cat is unconscious but not dead.

, You can check your cat’s pulse by placing your two fingers on the femoral artery, which is on the inside of the cat’s thigh, near its groin. You can feel for it in the natural divot created by the thigh muscles, right in the middle of the leg along the bone. Put some pressure on that area and wait for 15 seconds. If the cat is alive, you should feel a pulse.Use a watch or clock with a minute hand to count the number of beats you hear for 15 seconds. Then multiply by 4. This will give you the number of beats per minute.
The cat’s normal, healthy pulse should be between 140 and 220 beats per minute.
Check a few times, relocating your two fingers to different areas in the inner thigh. Sometimes it can take a few tries to find the pulse.

, Rigor mortis, or the stiffening of the cat’s body, sets in about three hours after the cat has died. With gloves on, pick up your cat and feel its body. If it is very stiff, this is a good indication that the cat has died., If your cat’s heart has stopped, its tongue and gums will be very pale and not the normal pink color. If you gently press the gums, there will be no capillary refill. This typically means that the cat is dead or will die very soon.

Give supplements to a cat with liver disease.,
Increase your cat's vitamin intake if it has renal failure.,
Supplement your cat's diet if it has arthritis.",How to Give Cats Nutritional Supplements," If you are considering giving your cat nutritional supplements, it is important for you to understand your cat's overall health. This assessment should be done by a veterinarian. Having an overall assessment will allow you to make decisions about what supplements the cat does, and does not, need.


A good time to get a thorough understanding of your cat's overall health is during their annual veterinary exam.;
, If you are considering giving your cat supplements you should discuss it with your veterinarian. The cat's veterinarian should have a good understanding of your cat's health and they should have the veterinary knowledge to explain what certain supplements would, and wouldn't, do to your cat's health.


Your veterinarian will likely caution you to not over do it with supplements. While it is important that your cat gets all the necessary vitamins and minerals it needs to stay healthy, giving it too many vitamins and minerals can hurt its health as well., If your veterinarian does agree that your cat may benefit from taking supplements, you should be sure to buy quality products. These may be available through your veterinary office but you may have to go elsewhere to purchase them.


Many pet stores will stock supplements for pets and you can buy them online. However, if buying supplements somewhere other than your veterinary office, be sure to read all the ingredients so that you are not giving your cat more ingredients than it actually needs.

, As with all medications and supplements, it is important that you follow the directions on the packaging provided or follow your veterinarian's suggestions for dosage. This will help you assure that your cat gets a therapeutic dose of the supplements you want to give it.


Supplements can be given to your cat in a variety of ways. Some supplements are given in pill form but most are given in forms that are easier to give to a cat, such as oils or powders that are put on food. For example, supplementing your cat's diet with fish oil simply requires that you put the oil on the cat's food.There is not much existing data about safe use of supplements in cats. In order to safeguard your cat, discuss supplement dosing with your veterinarian before giving supplements to your cat., There are some nutritional supplements that can be given to cats with heart disease that can improve their health. These include omega-3 fatty acids, which are usually given to cats in the form of fish oil.You can buy fish oil at any natural food store or pharmacy. However, the quality of these products will vary and dosing information for a cat will not be supplied. In this case, you should look at the label to make sure the product is pure and you should discuss dosing with your veterinarian.

, If your cat has liver disease, you should discuss the possible benefits that supplements might provide for its health with your veterinarian. For example, antioxidants might be beneficial because they can help protect liver cells.Some other supplements that might be helpful include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, S-adenosyl-methionine, and milk thistle. Discuss the use of these supplements with your veterinarian before giving them to your cat.

, Renal failure, also known as kidney disease, can cause your cat to lose a large amount of vitamins. This is because excess urination draws water soluble vitamins out of the body. In order to counteract this problem, your veterinarian may suggest supplementing your cat's vitamin intake of vitamins B and C. This can be done with vitamin supplements or by switching the kind of food that it eats.


In most cases, your cat's vitamin intake can be increased most easily by changing the food it eats. Most cat foods that are made specifically for cats with renal failure have increased amounts of vitamin B and C in them., If your cat is aging and has developed arthritis, it is a good idea to discuss the supplements that might help its agility with your veterinarian. In many cases, the veterinarian will suggest supplementing the cat's diet with glucosamine and chondroitin.While these supplements will not get rid of arthritis completely, they can help to improve joint function.

Call the vet.,
Bury your cat.,
Ask the vet to cremate your cat.,
Allow yourself to grieve.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Dead2," Once you’ve determined that your cat has died, take your cat to the vet. The vet can provide comfort by confirming that the cat has died. They also might be able to tell you why the cat has died. If you have other cats, learning the cause of death can help you to prevent the spread of any contagious disease or conditions to them.

, Once you are sure your cat has died, you may choose to bury your cat. Think about where you would like to have the cat be buried. Do you want to keep it in the yard of your home? Or buried in another beautiful place that you love? Once you decide on a place, bring gloves, a shovel, and a container for your cat. Hold a little ceremony in honor of your beloved feline.


You also may want to bring stones or a headstone to mark the spot where you buried the cat.

, Burying the cat may not be practical for everyone. In that case, you can ask your vet to have it cremated for you. You can then place the ashes in an urn or container, or scatter them somewhere outside.

, Coping with the death of your cat can be very painful. Remember that grieving is normal and healthy, and that everyone grieves at their own pace. While grieving, don’t blame yourself for the loss of your cat. Remind yourself that your cat felt loved and had a good life. Lean on others for support when needed, and be aware of any signs of depression.

Do CPR on your cat.,
Take your sick cat to the vet.,
Keep your cat warm.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Dead3," If your cat has stopped breathing and/or its heart has stopped beating, you can perform CPR on your cat. Doing CPR can include giving the cat rescue breaths, chest compressions, and abdominal thrusts.


If CPR is successful and you are able to revive your pet, you must still get them to a vet right away. Whatever caused your cat to stop breathing in the first place may reoccur. Additionally, performing CPR can cause injuries.
While you are performing CPR, it is best to have someone else call the vet for advice or to let them know you’re on your way.
Do not give chest compressions if your cat still has a pulse.

, If at all possible, when you believe your cat is sick or may be dying, take it to your vet immediately. This will prevent you from having to do CPR yourself, and will ensure that your cat gets the best help possible.

, Surround your sick cat or kitten with warm blankets, T-shirts, or towels. It is best to put these warm items in a box or carrier for the cat to lay in, so that it is surrounded by the warmth. If your cat is a kitten, it is very important to regulate its body temperature to keep it alive.


When surrounding the cat with blankets and towels, be sure that you don’t cover its head or wrap it up too tightly.

Wrap your bird in the towel.,
Extend its wing, using your thumb and index finger.,
Locate the stem of the blood feather.,
Pull firmly and quickly!,
Apply light pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Inspect the wing in about a half-hour to make sure it is no longer bleeding.

",How to Pull a Blood Feather," Its back should be against your palm. Hold the bird tightly as you don't want it to be moving around a lot. Hold the bird's head so that it is between your index and your middle finger. If you use the towel right, the bird will bite the towel instead of your fingers.;
, This does take some practice.

, Using pliers, grab the stem of the blood feather as close to the skin as you can get, making a very firm grip.

, Do not be afraid to pull. Pulling slow will cause more pain and may further damage the feather.

, Use cornstarch or a bar of soap to help the wound clot.

Visit the cat over at your neighbors' house before they drop him/her off to stay.,
Ask the owner about feedings, allergies/medications, sensitivities (such as getting along with other animals, etc) and whether or not the kitty is litter-trained.,
Get contact phone numbers for emergency use or questions you may have later: the owner, the vet, and a friend of the owner who has a car in case of emergency (necessary if you yourself do not have a car).

,
Kitty-proof your place before the cat comes over.,
When the cat is over, open his/her kennel and let her come out when he/she is ready to - never reach in as this could result in a nasty scratch.

,
Set up food dishes and water where they are accessible and make sure that the cat sees where you put them.,
Give the cat time to adjust to her new surroundings, so sit back and let him/her explore.,
Expect the cat to be somewhat skittish for the first day, but by the first night, he/she should be playful and willing to at least sit on the couch with you.,
Set up a play time each day and give plenty of cuddles!",How to Watch the Neighbors' Cat," This way, the little critter can become more familiar with you and will be less stressed later on when he/she is in your home.;
, Notice how loud/quiet your neighbor's house is... is your house that quiet? Cats can be very sensitive to unfamiliar noises, and some may choose to hide and not come out. This is an uncomfortable situation for all involved, but not the end of the world. In time, kitty will come out for food and bathroom needs, as well as to explore the house when he/she feels comfortable enough to do so.

,, This is very important. Make sure wires and other dangly-distracting things are secured and away to prevent kitty-shock or some other unfortunate happenings. Look carefully around your place for ""hiding spots"" that would be appealing to a nervous cat. Make sure that it is a space safe for her to hide in - if not (like behind the fridge, in the box-spring of your bed, etc) be sure to block it so she can't get in there.

,, Do the same with the litter box.

, Cats are territorial creatures, so he/she might want to see every inch of your house! For the time being, limit noise by closing street-facing windows and turning off (or turning very low) music.

, If not, no worries, give it time as all cats are different.

, Give the cat as much attention as suits his/her needs - but don't bug him/her (learn to read body language).

Avoid vaccines in the first six to eight weeks of life.,
Begin vaccinating at six to eight weeks.,
Continue to administer vaccines every two to four weeks weeks until your kitten is 16 weeks old.,
Add the Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) vaccine at eight weeks old.,
Administer the rabies vaccine as early as 12 weeks of age.,
Talk to your veterinarian about the other non-core vaccines.",How to Vaccinate a Kitten1," When a kittens are born, and they start feeding from their mother, they ingest a variety of antibodies contained within their mother’s milk. These antibodies, in general, are able to protect the kitten while she grows and develops her own immune system, which will protect her from diseases. When the kitten is around six to eight weeks old, those antibodies tend to decrease within the kitten as she drinks less of her mother’s milk. It’s at this point that she needs help protecting her from infectious diseases with vaccines.One of the reasons it is not recommended to give a kitten a vaccine earlier than six to eight weeks is because those antibodies she’s receiving from her mother may actually interfere with the vaccine and prevent it from being effective.;
, Once a kitten is about six to eight weeks old he will need to start a series of vaccines in order to build-up his lifelong immunities to certain infectious diseases. The core vaccines recommended for kittens at this age include Feline Parvovirus (FPV), Feline Herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), and Feline Calicivirus (FCV).Feline Parvovirus (FPV) may also be referred to as Feline Panleukopenia Virus or Feline Distemper.Feline Herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) may also be referred to as Feline Rhinotracheitis Virus and is often associated with Feline Upper Respiratory Disease Complex.It is recommended that the modified live virus (MLV) version of all vaccines be used as they not only work faster, they last longer.Some veterinarians may be able to offer all three vaccines in one ""combination"" injection so your kitten will only require one needle. This is only possible when the vaccine is designed to be combined. Individual vaccines should never be combined into one injection otherwise.

, In general the three core feline vaccines should be administered to a kitten every two to four weeks between six to eight weeks of age and 16 weeks of age. The actual schedule you use may depend upon advice from your veterinarian, your kitten’s risk of exposure to certain diseases, and your schedule.If you start your kitten’s vaccines at six weeks of age and continue every two weeks, the schedule would be: six weeks, eight weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks, and 16 weeks.
If you start your kitten’s vaccines at six weeks of age and continue every four weeks, the schedule would be: six weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks.
If you start your kitten’s vaccines at eight weeks of age and continue every two weeks, the schedule would be: eight weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks, and 16 weeks.
If you start your kitten’s vaccines at eight weeks of age and continue every four weeks, the schedule would be: eight weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks.

, Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) is considered a non-core vaccine, but is recommended for all kittens. FeLV can first be administered when your kitten is eight weeks old. She will need a second dose of the FeLV vaccine until three to four weeks later.The FeLV vaccine can only be given to kittens who do not have FeLV. In general a kitten should not have FeLV if her mother did not have it. However, if it is unknown whether the mother had FeLV it is recommended that she be tested first.Researchers are currently investigating the association of fibrosarcoma in cats who have received the FeLV vaccine. In a rare number of cases, a cat who has received the vaccine has developed fibrosarcoma in the area around the injection site. It is thought that these fibrosarcomas develop in cats who have been given the “dead"" version of the vaccine (as opposed to the live version of the vaccine). Veterinarians normally inject the FeLV vaccine in a cat’s left rear leg, where no other vaccines are given, in order to allow the owner to recognize a tumor, should it develop.

, The rabies vaccine is considered a core vaccine. Your kitten can receive her first rabies vaccine as early as 12 weeks old., Four additional vaccines are available for cats: Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), Chlamydia fells, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). All of these vaccines are considered non-core and their requirements for your kitten will depend on his individual circumstances.A vaccine for FIV is not normally recommended by veterinarians. However, if a kitten should receive this vaccine, for whatever reason, a careful record should be kept as future tests for FIV will likely be positive.

Chlamydia felis is also known as Chlamydophila. The chlamydophila vaccine is normally only recommended for kittens who will be in multi-cat environments where the disease is already known.
The Bordetella vaccine is normally only recommended for kittens who will be living in large, multi-cat environments or colonies.
The vaccine for FIP is not normally recommended for kitten for any reason.

Point the cat’s nose towards the ceiling.,
Position the bottle of drops.,
Squeeze the bottle.,
Bring the bottle a little closer.",How to Give Your Cat Nose Drops1," If you are right handed, use your left hand and make a ""C"" shape with your thumb and forefinger. Place the thumb under the cat's jaw, and the forefinger on her forehead. The cat's head should now be held in your hand. Grip the head gently and twist your wrist so that the nose is rotated upward to point towards the ceiling., If you are right handed, pick up the bottle of drops in your right hand. You should already have removed the lid in preparation.


If you have not already removed the lid of the bottle, let go of the cat's head, remove the lid and start again.

, Holding the dropper bottle between your finger and thumb, invert the bottle such that the dropper is pointing towards the floor. Give the bottle a gentle squeeze until a drop of liquid appears at the end of the nozzle. Maintain this pressure and position the dropper nipple as close to the cat's nostril as possible.


Once you are happy with the position of the bottle, squeeze the bottle until the required number of drops are dispensed into the cat's nostril.

, The exact distance of the dropper nipple is not crucial, but the closer you are to the nose the more likely it is that the drop will go into the nostril. In an ideal world, you should touch the nipple to the nostril, but some cats will flinch away when they feel the bottle’s touch, which will make you lose the positioning of your bottle.


Try to hold the bottle so that it hovers about two to three millimeters above the entrance to your cat’s nostril so that the drop is most likely to go in.

Look for signs of diseased teeth.",How to Treat Your Cat's Dental Problems1," This doesn’t need to be done with force; simply stand the cat on a table and have the assistant gently place his or her hands on the sides of the cat's shoulders.;
, Check the right and left hand side of the cat's gum, plus the top and bottom row of the cat's teeth. This is an easy way to see the outer surfaces of your cat's teeth. However, to check the tooth surfaces resting against the tongue, you will need to open your cat's mouth.

, If you are right handed, use your left hand's forefinger and thumb to make a ""C"" shape. Invert the ""C"" over your cat's head so that the thumb rests on the left corner of the mouth, and the tip of the forefinger on the right corner. Apply gentle pressure to the lips between so that the cat must slightly open her mouth or risk biting her own lips.


Now hook the forefinger of the right hand onto the point of the lower jaw and press downwards to hinge the mouth open. Now you should be able to see the inner surfaces of the upper and lower teeth.

, Healthy gums are pink just like our own gums (some animals have natural pigment present, in which case the gums may be shaded grey or black). The gums should sit snug up against the tooth crown, with no exposure of the tooth roots.


There should be no angry red line, or bleeding, where the gum joins the tooth.

, A cardinal sign of gum disease is bleeding or inflammation where the gum meets the tooth; this is known as gingivitis and is usually a sign of infection. Gingivitis can create sores, and is often associated with bad breath because bacteria love to colonize the inflamed gum tissue.

, Teeth are made up of a crown (the visible part above the normal gum line) and the root. In a normal mouth, only the crown is visible because the root is embedded in the jawbone and covered by gum. The enamel should be clean (not covered with tartar) and not fractured or chipped. The teeth should be firm in the jaw.

, Diseased teeth may be either coated in tartar, loose, or broken, or they may have holes in the enamel, or tooth root infections. Most commonly cats either have heavy tartar (mineral deposits coating the teeth) which can cause gum recession, or they can have weak enamel that dissolves, leaving holes that penetrate to the nerve (these are called ""feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions"" or FORL).

Keep calm and have help if you think you’ll need it.,
Ensure you have all the proper equipment.,
Mix the vaccine, if required.,
Fill the syringe with the vaccine.,
Restrain your kitten.,
Know where you need to inject the vaccine.,
Inject a vaccine subcutaneously.,
Give an intranasal vaccine.",How to Vaccinate a Kitten2," Depending on the personality of your kitten, and how hyper she is at any given moment, you may need to obtain assistance when giving her an injection. If this is your first time giving an injection, you may want someone else to hold your kitten so you can use both hands to administer the injection.Keeping calm during this procedure will also keep your kitten calm. You want to avoid associating stress with injections so your kitten doesn’t fear them in the future.

, Depending on where you obtain the vaccine, it may not come with a syringe and needle. Make sure you have all the equipment you require before you start any attempt at vaccinating your kitten., Some vaccines need to be mixed right before administration in order to activate the ingredients. Use these steps to mix-up the vaccine for your kitten:Attach the needle to the syringe, with the cap still on the needle.
Remove the cap from the needle and insert the needle into the liquid vaccine vial.
Turn the vial upside down and hold the syringe in a vertical position.
Pull back on the plunger and fill the syringe with all of the liquid.
Insert the needle into the second vial and press the plunger to inject the liquid from the first vial. The second vial normally contains a powder or a freeze-dried substance, as opposed to liquid.
Take the needle out of the second vial and shake the vial thoroughly to mix the contents.
Put the needle back into the second vial and pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe.
Press the plunger to push out any excess air that may have accumulated in the syringe.
Put the cap back on the needle until you’re ready to administer the vaccine to your kitten.

, Before you attempt to restrain your kitten, get ready by filling the syringe with the vaccine. Attach the needle to the syringe (if it isn’t already), take off the needle cap, and insert the needle into the vaccine vial. Pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe with the vaccine. Squirt a little back out to ensure there are no air bubbles left in the syringe, then put the cap back on the needle till you’re ready to proceed., You may find it easier to administer the vaccine while your kitten lies or sits in your lap. Alternatively you can place him on a table at a height that allows you to see and access the injection site properly. Use whatever position works best for your kitten and you.Whichever surface you end up using (your lap or a table) put down a towel or blanket first. This may be especially useful if you use your lap in case your kitten tries to scratch or bite you while you’re administering the vaccine.
If you do not think you can restrain your kitten while administering the vaccine, have another person hold him in whatever position works best. This option will keep both of your hands free for the syringe.

, Each vaccine will come with instructions on where it needs to be injected, and how it needs to be injected. If you are unsure of this information, contact your veterinarian for assistance.Combination vaccines, or the main core vaccines, are normally injected on the outside of your kitten’s right front leg, below the elbow joint.
Any vaccines that contain a vaccine for FeLV must be injected into your kitten’s rear left leg on the outside of her body.
Rabies vaccines (which can normally only be administered by a veterinarian) need to be injected on the outside of your kitten’s right rear leg.

, Cat vaccines need to be injected subcutaneously, which means they’re injected right under the skin. To inject in a subcutaneous location, follow these steps:Locate the area where you will need to place the injection.
Locate a spot with some loose skin. Gently pinch a bit of this skin with your thumb and finger and pull it outwards.
Insert the needle into the tented part of the skin. Keep the needle parallel to the skin’s surface. You do not want to angle the needle downwards because you do not want to accidentally push the needle into a muscle, etc.
Pull back on the plunger and check if any blood comes out. If not, you can proceed. If blood does come out, try another spot.
Press the plunger of the syringe to inject the vaccine under the skin.
Use a clean cloth or paper towel to dab any blood that may come out.

, Some vaccines do not come in an injectable format, but rather in a liquid that needs to be dropped into your kitten’s eyes and nose. You will likely need to mix this type of vaccine before being able to administer it. Once the vaccine is mixed, use these steps to administer the vaccine:Place one drop of the vaccine in the corner of each of your kitten’s eyes.
Squirt an equal amount of the remaining vaccine into each of your kitten’s nostrils.

However, keep in mind that you should always be gentle with your cat; do not shout at her or scold her, even if she does not cooperate.


If you act gently and compassionately, your cat may still be unhappy, but will be less likely to run away from the medication in the future.

, Whether you choose to use an assistant or simply tackle the matter yourself, you will need several items before you can begin. It helps to gather these items before you begin the drop-applying process so that the process can run more smoothly. You will need:


A table: Working at a table will make giving your cat the nose drops much easier. Protect the surface of the table from scratching claws with a thick towel.
Good lighting : The cat's nose is small and you will need good lighting to see where to position the nozzle of the drops.
Nose drops: Read the label and keep store them correctly; many drops need to be stored at 28 °C (82 °F) and away from light. When it is time to administer the drops, have them within hand's reach and remove the lid in anticipation of application.
A large towel: A towel is handy for method one (two people) if you cat tends to strike out and scratch. The towel is essential for method two (one person) because you need it to wrap the cat up.

, You will need an assistant to hold the cat while you administer the drops. This method is generally a little less stressful for your cat, and allows you to have both hands free to administer the drops efficiently. This is generally the preferred method for medicating an aggressive cat.


The disadvantage is that it is not always easy to have two people available at the same time the cat is around to give her her medication.

, Cover the table with a towel to create a non-slip surface. Make sure that you have the drops within hand’s reach from the table, and that the top of the drops has been removed.

, Have your assistant pick up the cat. Bring the cat over to the table, and set her down on the table, but do not have your assistant release her.


If you are right handed, have the assistant place the cat on the table with the cat's head facing your right hand.

, The assistant restrains the cat by standing behind her and placing one hand on each of the cat's arms, just below the elbow (left hand to left arm, right hand to right shoulder). Curl the fingers around the arm so as to maintain a firm grip on the front legs, sufficient to stop the cat from lifting a leg or swiping at you.It also helps to steady the cat if the assistant presses inwards with his forearms so that they lie pressed along the cat's chest and rump. This stops the cat from wriggling side-to-side.
With a particularly wriggly cat, the assistant should lean over the cat and use his chest pressed over the cat's back to stop her from jumping upwards.
Thus confined the cat cannot run forwards (the hands of the arms stop this), wriggle sideways (the forearms act as restraining bars) or up (the assistant's chest stops this) but her head is free and facing outwards.
Note: If the cat is particularly spiteful and determined to lash out, you may need to wrap the cat in a towel (see the next method) and then have the assistant hold the cat.

, This method involves wrapping the cat in a towel so that she is enclosed in a cocoon with her head sticking out. This enables you to then tuck the wrapped cat between your thighs so that you have both hands free to administer the drops.


The wrapping process is described in the following steps.

, The towel should have a longer length and narrower width. Place the cat centrally on the towel, at a right-angle to the length, with her nose touching one edge. Let the cat rest on her belly in a nature crouching position, with her paws underneath.


There should be an equal length of towel on either side of the cat’s body.

, If you are right handed, use your left hand to grip the cat’s scruff. This area of loose skin over the shoulders is where a mother cats holds her kittens to trigger a passive reaction.Although you may feel reticent about gripping your pet firmly, be assured you are not hurting or harming her in any way.

, To make the first fold, grasp the towel edge your right hand so that your hand is about 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm) from the cat. Apply firm tension to the fabric and fold it right-over-left across the cat’s back, and include the hand restraining the cat in the wrap.


You will remove your hand after the next step.

, Gently lift the cat by the scruff, such that her body is raised at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal, with her bottom resting on the floor and her forequarters elevated. Feed the fold of towel lying across her back, under her left front paw. Then lower her paws back to the tabletop so that her body weight anchors this first wrap in place.

, To make the second fold, grasp the towel on the left side of the cat with your left hand still encased. As before, apply firm tension as you cross the fabric left-to-right over the cat’s back. The cat should now be enclosed in a towel cocoon with just her head sticking out.

, Let go of her scruff and wriggle your fingers free of the wrap. If you applied the correct tension to the towel, the cat’s limbs will remain firmly held against her body.

, Lift her front end up off the flat surface so that her body is angled at about 45 degrees to the horizontal. Now use your right hand to grasp the trailing edge of the second wrap, feed it under the cat and pull it firmly so she is tightly swaddled.


Continue to wrap the remaining length of towel around the cat until the free length is used up.

, The cat is now rolled in a towel but, if she is determined, she could wriggle out backwards. The final, or ‘burrito’ fold, involves tucking the final dangling width of the towel under the body. This is as simple as it sounds. Simply lift up her wrapped rear end and tuck the dangling tail of fabric beneath her.


Now when you lower her back end down, her body weight pins the towel beneath her and there is no backwards escape route.

, With the cat wrapped, place her on the table and tuck the cocoon under your arm.

Understand what gingivitis is.,
Talk to your vet about giving your cat antibiotics.,
Give your cat oral hygiene products.",How to Treat Your Cat's Dental Problems2," Gingivitis is often caused by a build of tartar on the teeth, which presses on the gums and inflames them. Tartar is a matrix of minerals, food, and bacteria, and it is the latter which then colonize the gums to set up infection.

, Broad spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavunate penetrate well into the gum tissue and saliva so that they can fight the infection. Amoxicillins are bactericidal (kill bacteria) and act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. A cat weighing less than 6 kg commonly takes 50 mg of potentiated penicillin by mouth twice daily.If the gingivitis is mild (a faint red line along the border between gum and tooth) a five day course is sufficient. If the gingivitis is severe (touching the gum gently provokes bleeding) then a minimum of two weeks is necessary.

, Oral hygiene products help decrease the amount of bacteria in the mouth and are useful as part of a dental care regime, especially for cats prone to gum infections or bad breath. An example of such a product is Hexarinse. The active ingredient is chlorhexidine, a mild anti-septic. The hexarinse is liquid and comes in a bottle.


To use, dip a clean cotton tip into the liquid and wipe the dampened bud over the surface of the enamel and along the gum line. Never dip a used cotton bud back into the hexarinse as it could contaminate the solution.
Hexarinse repels bacteria for 12 hours and should be repeated twice a day.This is also a useful preventative treatment in a healthy mouth, in order to promote best oral hygiene.

Anticipate happy drool.,
Give your cat water or a little food when you administer medicine.,
Avoid excessive travel if your cat gets motion sickness.",How to Stop Your Cat from Drooling1," Cats often drool when they are happy and content, like when they eat catnip. Don’t feed your cat catnip. Also feed your cat on time so it doesn’t drool when it’s happily waiting for food. And put a towel on your lap when you pet your cat, because you can’t prevent this type of happy drool., Cats drool after eating bitter or unpleasant things, like medicine. Also distract your cat with toys or a ball of yarn after you apply topical flea or worming medication to try and prevent it from licking the medication off its fur. Treat your cat with food or water if it does lick any medication off.


Bring your cat to the vet for medication and treatment if you notice your cat has symptoms like twitching, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, not eating, and/or problems with its coordination after it licks topical medication off its fur.

, Nausea can cause drooling in cats. Feed your cat something mild or give it some water to help with an upset stomach. Take your cat to the vet if you note more serious symptoms, like loss of appetite, grinding teeth, or listlessness.Check with the vet to be sure your cat’s nausea is not a sign of problems with the liver, kidneys, or pancreas, which will require immediate treatment.

Find a working cats program.,
Get stray cats from a working cat program.,
Check local bylaws if you are using cats for pest control at work.,
Make the feral cats stay.",How to Use Cats for Pest Control1," Phone your local animal shelter or humane society to find out whether there is a working cat program in your neighborhood. Working cat programs will use a group of feral or stray cats to hunt pests, such as rats and mice. If you get a group of stray cats to live in the place you want to tackle the pest problem, the pests will smell the cats and find another place to live.If you live in Chicago, you should look into the program run by Tree House Humane Society.If you live in New York City, you should look into the New York City Feral Cat Initiative.If you live in Texas, call Barn Cats Incorporated.;
, Ask the working cats program for a group of feral cats to be deployed in your backyard, barn or place of business. Ask how the organization addresses veterinary and animal care. Then, find out the price for a deployment of stray cats.Working cat programs will typically give the stray cats a vaccination and neuter them.Working cat programs may help take care of the feral cats that they deploy in your area.

, If you are getting stray cats to patrol your business, it is important to see whether you are violating any local bylaws, such as food safety laws.In the United States, cats are covered under local rather than state laws.If you are a business owner in New York City, health and state law prevents the use of animals in places where food and beverages are sold.
In New York City, fines for keeping cats for pest control range from $300 to $2,000.

, Since the feral cats live outside or in an enclosed work space, you will need to take measures to ensure they stay. For instance, get the cats used to eating, playing and sleeping in the area. Make sure they have a good shelter to protect themselves from the rain and other types of inclement weather."

Look for signs of tartar buildup.,
Schedule an appointment for dental descaling.,
Debulk tartar.",How to Treat Your Cat's Dental Problems3," If the buildup of tartar is thick enough on the teeth it can physically obstruct the mouth from closing. You may get a clue this is about to happen when your cat spends a lot of time working his jaw up and down when not eating, or if there is a ""clicking"" sound as he opens and closes his mouth.


Tartar also contains bacteria, which means that when it rubs against your cat's gums, it can cause infections.

, This involves an ultrasonic descaler machine using high frequency sound to blitz the tartar off the teeth without scratching or damaging the enamel. This is an atraumatic process (it shouldn't cause pain).


However to gain access to all the tooth surfaces, the cat needs to have a general anesthetic, and hence this procedure needs to take place at a veterinary clinic.

, This process has a greater risk of damaging the enamel, scraping the gums, and generally not getting the teeth particularly clean. However, it does have its place if a localized lump of tartar is causing problems. Debulking refers to cracking off (using dental forceps, which are like blunt pincers) in order to remove a lump of tartar that is rubbing against another tooth or causing a sore on the inside of the cheek.


There is no particular rule for doing this, other than inserting a blunt point between the gum and the tartar and applying sharp pressure parallel to the tooth in the direction away from the gum. It should be noted that few cats enjoy having this done and are likely to show their disapproval by hissing or growling.

"
"
Set up an appointment with your cat’s vet.,
Rock a wobbly tooth.,
Extract a damaged tooth.,
Get antibiotics for a root infection.",How to Treat Your Cat's Dental Problems4," Damaged or wobbly teeth should be treated professionally because proper dental extractions with minimal trauma to the gum and jawbone need to be done under general anesthetic.

, The exception is a tooth that is so wobbly that it can be rocked backwards and forwards, to an angle of at least 90 degrees when tapped with a fingertip. For such a tooth use a finger and thumb to act as a pincer, grasp the wobbly tooth, and give it a twist and pull to remove it. If the tooth does not pluck out easily, leave it alone and seek professional help.

, Damaged teeth include those that are cracked, fractured, part of the crown is missing, or the enamel is eroded. All of these things are painful and the tooth needs extraction.


However, even though the tooth is damaged it is likely to be firmly attached and professional extraction is essential to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering.

, Tooth root infections can be identified as pus oozing between the gum and the tooth, a swelling on the face over the site of the tooth root, or through dental x-rays. Antibiotics are essential (see remarks for gingivitis).


Unfortunately, most infections recur once antibiosis finishes and so extraction of the affected tooth is advisable to prevent relapse.

"
"
Experiment with different textures of food.,
Remove mild tartar.,
Brush your cat’s teeth.",How to Treat Your Cat's Dental Problems5," If your cat has dental pain, then providing a liquid food that the cat can lap up will help to give her the calories she needs until she can be treated at the vet's office. Look for foods that are soft and pate-like, but that also have high amounts of calories. Mash these soft foods up to make them even softer.


Bizarrely, some cats with sore mouths like dry kibble. These cats seem to master hooking the biscuits with their tongue and throwing the kibble to the back of the mouth without chewing. In short, don't be afraid to offer a variety of foods and see what works best for your pet.

, A successful way to removed mild tartar staining from teeth is to feed your cat a product designed to remove staining, such as Hills TD diet, exclusively for one month. These types of food have a tooth descaling action. When your cat eats this kind of food, she has to orient the food in a certain way in her mouth that forces her to chomp down on it, thereby grinding down the tartar with the food.


However, this works best in cats with healthy gums and only light tartar staining. Do NOT use this diet if the gums are sore. The abrasive nature of the food is likely to further damage the gums.

, In an ideal world tooth brushing would be a daily part of your cat's day. In the same way that it removes food debris and bacteria from our own mouths, it also helps to keep your cat's mouth bacteria and debris free.


To brush your cat's teeth, use a soft toothbrush dipped in water, and use a gentle brushing motion just as you would for your own teeth. Start gradually, getting the cat used to the brush against the teeth, and as her acceptance grows, increase the amount of time you spend brushing.

Identify and treat gingivitis.,
Find and remove any foreign objects in the mouth.,
Take care of an abscessed tooth.",How to Stop Your Cat from Drooling2," Check for signs of gingivitis or other gum disease, which can both cause drooling. These include swollen, red, or bleeding gums. Also check if your cat’s gums are receding or pulling away from its teeth. Treat the gingivitis or gum disease to stop drooling.Brush your cat’s teeth regularly.
Take your cat to the vet for a more thorough cleaning.
Consult with your vet about possible tooth extraction.

Look for signs of teething in your kitten. Teething also causes drooling.

, Look for any foreign objects that might be lodged in your cat’s teeth or mouth and cause drooling. Also smell your cat’s breath because a foreign object lodged in the mouth for a long time can cause bad breath. You might also see that your cat is pawing at its mouth as though it’s trying to dislodge something stuck in there.


Try to remove any objects stuck in the teeth or mouth.
Bring your cat to the vet if you cannot remove foreign objects from the mouth.

, Drooling and pawing at the mouth can indicate that your cat has an abscessed tooth. Look for other signs of an abscessed tooth, like loss of appetite, nosebleeds, sneezing, fever, less interest in playing and grooming, loose or discolored teeth. An abscessed tooth can also cause bad breath.Have an abscessed tooth lanced and treated with antibiotics. Sometimes the tooth will need to be removed.

Consult with your vet about oral cancer.",How to Stop Your Cat from Drooling3," Cats often drool as a sign that they have been poisoned. Check for other signs of poisoning, like not eating, twitching or seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, and mouth ulcers. Bring your cat to the vet immediately if you notice any of these symptoms in addition to the drooling.Your vet can treat your cat with activated charcoal, by inducing vomiting, or even pumping your cat’s stomach.

, Note if your cat is eating less and/or losing weight, urinating more often, and/or drinking more in addition to drooling. Also check for bad breath. If you see these symptoms, ask your vet to check your cat for kidney disease.Request help changing your cat to a low protein diet to help with kidney disease prevention and treatment.

, Drooling can be a sign of cat flu. Check to see if the drooling is accompanied by sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, and fever. Also note if your cat is eating less. Treat the cat flu by encouraging your cat to eat and by keeping its eyes and nose clear.Also consult with the vet about other palliative care, which might include IVs to keep your cat hydrated.

, Drooling can be caused by mouth tumors and other cancers. Check with your vet if you notice ulcers in your cat’s mouth or other symptoms of oral cancer, which include swelling in the mouth, bad breath, and weight loss. Also report to your vet if your cat is reluctant to eat or to even close its mouth."

Care for your mousers.",How to Use Cats for Pest Control2," Some cat breeds are better at hunting pests than others. Although the personality and upbringing of the cat should also be taken into consideration, try to buy or adopt a cat breed that is good at hunting. Some of the best breeds for pest control include:American shorthair
Main coon
Siberian
Siamese
Chartreux
Burmese
Manx
Turkish angora
Japanese bobtail
Persian

, Kittens learn pest control from their mothers. By keeping a cat and her kittens, you can train the next generation of mousers and rat catchers.Once the kittens are old enough, you should spay and neuter the entire litter, including the mother. If you do not do this, you may end up having more cats than you bargained for. Either call a Trap-Neuter-Release program or take the cats to a local vet.

, Give your local animal shelter a ring. Ask them if they have any stray or feral cats available for adoption. Typically, these organizations have too many cats to handle. By adopting an indoor/outdoor cat, you can control pests in your home and in outdoor areas surrounding your home, such as chicken coops., Give your indoor/outdoor cats a comfortable place to sleep, as well as food and veterinary care. The cats will reward you by patrolling your house and warding off pesky rodents."

Talk to your cat in a happy tone to put the animal at ease.
Make the teeth cleaning sessions short.
Reward your cat with praise and a treat after brushing the teeth. This is especially important after the initial sessions, when you're just acquainting your cat to the toothbrush and paste.

, Put a dab of toothpaste on your finger and allow the cat to taste it.

, Rub some toothpaste on 1 of the cat's fangs with your finger.

, Allowing the cat to lick toothpaste off the toothbrush. This will make your cat more comfortable with feeling the toothbrush bristles.

,


Raise the cat's top lip.
Position the toothbrush at the gum line at a 45 degree angle.
Use back-and-forth swipes with the brush to clean the cat's teeth. Brush 3 or 4 teeth at once with about 10 back-and-forth swipes. Then proceed to the next group of teeth.
Pay special attention to brushing the base of the teeth, between the teeth, and the upper teeth.
Brush only the outer surfaces of the teeth. The inner surface gets adequately cleaned by the cat's tongue.
Concentrate on brushing just a few teeth at first. Then clean a few more teeth every time. The cat will eventually grow accustomed to getting all the teeth cleaned at every session.

Feed a diet that promotes healthy teeth and gums.",How to Stop Teeth Grinding in Cats," If your cat is grinding its teeth, it most likely means that it is having some dental problems. This could be a loose or broken tooth, gum pain, ulcers, gingivitis, or a problem with its jaw.In response to the pain caused by these issues, a cat will often times grind its teeth.


Your veterinarian will ask you about your cat's symptoms and then give the cat an exam.
The veterinarian may need to do some tests, such as an x-ray or a blood test, to find the cause of the pain if no cause is immediately evident. Some of these tests may require your cat to be anesthetized, which means it will be put under so that the cat is still during the x-rays.Other tests, such as blood tests, do not require this.;
, If your cat's teeth pain is caused by irritated gums or periodontal disease, the first step in treating it is usually a thorough cleaning. This will eliminate all of the bacteria that is fueling the issues and will give your cat a dental fresh start.You may need to go to a veterinary dentist specialist to get this treatment.
Deep cleaning a cat's teeth requires the cat to be anesthetized. As such, it will usually require a separate appointment and will take about an hour.Some groomers, pet stores, and veterinarians offer ""anesthesia free"" teeth cleaning. This is just a surface cleaning, is not thorough, and does not clean under the gum line, where bacteria can really take hold.

, If your veterinarian is able to diagnose the dental problem that is causing your cat to grind its teeth, have it treated as soon as you can. The grinding is sign that your cat is in pain, so correcting its dental problems is the best way to alleviate that pain.If your cat is in severe pain, your veterinarian may give it a pain killer to make it feel better. This is just a temporary solution until the actual problem can be fixed.
In most cases, if there is a problem with one of your cat's teeth, the veterinary dentist will remove it surgically. If the problem is in the cat's jaw alignment, includes a tumor, or includes a bone fracture, that will require a more invasive surgery to treat.

, If all dental issues are ruled out, then teeth grinding may be caused by another illness. While this is rare, it is most often caused by dehydration, digestive problems, abdominal pain, or neurological issues. Your veterinarian will need to assess your cat's overall health and run tests to diagnose the problem.There are many possible causes for teeth grinding in cats. Once dental problems are ruled out, your veterinarian will probably need to start with some general blood tests. These will give the veterinarian a good place to start when looking for a non-dental cause.

, In order to prevent many serious dental infections, have your cat's teeth looked at every year by a veterinarian. This will help to keep your cat's teeth in good condition and will hopefully allow you to catch any issues that are developing before they become serious and painful for the cat.During an annual exam the veterinarian will talk to you about what dental care you are giving the cat, as well as looking at the cats teeth closely.
If the veterinarian decides that your cat needs a deep cleaning or x-rays, then that will be done during a follow up appointment.

, If you are concerned about your cat's dental health, or your cat has a history of dental problems, it is worth your while to brush your cat's teeth daily. This is the single most important thing you can do for your cat's dental health between veterinary dental cleanings.This daily brushing removes excess food, plaque, and bacteria that can promote dental diseases, such as periodontal disease.
You will need to acclimate your cat to teeth brushing. Begin by putting a small amount of cat tooth paste, which is not the same as human toothpaste, on your finger. Let your cat sniff it and lick it if it likes. Gradually transition in to rubbing the toothpaste on your cats teeth. Then, when the cat gets used to your finger in its mouth, then you can transition to a pet toothbrush. This process may take weeks, or months, to complete.

, There are several brands of commercial cat food that have been proven to improve a cats dental health. This is done during chewing the food, which removes plaque and tarter from the teeth.These foods either have a design that cleans the teeth or they have a chemical ingredient that removes tartar. However, be sure to pick a food that is balanced for your cat nutritionally, in addition to fighting dental disease. Ask your veterinarian if you need advice about what specific food to feed your cat.
Additionally, there is an additive for your cat's water that can be prescribed by your vet that will fight plaque and gingivitis. However, this additive can make your cat's water taste strange, so make sure your cat will drink it without fuss."

, Your cat may show few signs of dental pain. However, even if you observe few physical or behavioral signs of dental disease, it is wise to get your senior cat’s teeth checked out. Your veterinarian will be able to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.The first stage of diagnosis is a visual examination.
The second stage of diagnosis involves a periodontal probe to measure gingivitis.
At a minimum, get your cat’s teeth examined once a year.If your cat has been experiencing dental problems, you should get them examined more frequently, perhaps every three or four months., Your cat could be diagnosed with a number of kinds of dental disease, such as mild gingivitis, moderate gingivitis, severe gingivitis, periodontitis or stomatitis. Since treatment options will vary depending on the type and severity of your senior cat’s dental disease, you should ask your veterinarian for a full account of the diagnosis:“How would you describe their dental disease?”

Look in your cat's mouth.,
Give your cat chew toys or treats that will help its oral health.,
Improve oral hygiene by using a cat-friendly mouthwash.,
Brush your cat's teeth.,
Have your cat's teeth cleaned by a veterinarian.,
Start the cat on a dental diet designed to reduce the formation of tartar.",How to Get Rid of Bad Cat Breath1," You want to determine if your cat's oral hygiene is at fault for the bad breath. Place the cat on a table so that you work at a comfortable height. Make sure the lighting is good so that you can see well. Gently lift the cat's upper lip until you can see the teeth. Look inside the mouth.


Healthy teeth should be white and not coated in tartar. Tarter has the appearance of yellow deposits on the surface of the teeth, often near the gum line. The gums should be pink with no angry red line of inflammation where the teeth meets the gums. Clean teeth and pink gums make dental disease less likely. However, dirty teeth and inflamed or bleeding gums are indicative of dental disease.
If you see you cat has dental issues, get it checked by a vet. This is because inflamed gums and bad breath are a sign of bacterial infection and the cat may require medical treatment, such as antibiotics, to settle things down.
It helps to have a friend who can hold the cat by the shoulders, which leaves both of your hands free to lift the cat's lips.;
, Why not help your cat's health while you make it happy? If your cat likes to chew, give it toys that will massage the gums, floss the teeth, and remove tarter buildup while the cat chews.You can also give your cat treats that are designed to help its dental health.

, There are various products available, but Hexarinse is recommended. This contains chlorhexidine in a formulation that helps disinfect the mouth for around 12 hours. It helps kill bacteria and stop them from sticking to teeth, thereby reducing the incidence of bacterial infection causing bad breath.To use Hexarinse, soak a cotton bud in the solution and wipe it over the outer crown surface of the teeth. Do this morning and evening for optimal preventative dental care., It helps to get the cat used to the tooth brush first, by leaving the brush near their food bowl. For the first few attempts just use water on the brush. Once the cat is accepting the brush in their mouth, use toothpastes designed for use in cats. Do not use human toothpaste as the fluoride level can be damaging when the cat swallows the toothpaste.Brush the teeth morning and evening. Use a soft child's toothbrush, a pet toothbrush, or a finger-brush designed for the purpose.

, The gold standard is to have your veterinarian perform a dental descale and polish under general anesthetic. This cleans the teeth, gets rid of deposits harboring bacteria, and encourages healthy gums.Once the pet has recovered from the procedure you can start brushing its teeth to keep the mouth clean.

, If the tartar is only mild and the gums are not sore, consider switching your cat onto a dental diet. Look for foods approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) and have their stamp of approval on the bag.Approved food usually works by giving a brushing action while it's chewed. Fiber inside each kibble lightly sweep over the cat's teeth when it bites down.

Look at their gums.,
Check for bad breath.,
Look for signs that the cat might in be pain.,
Determine if your cat is at increased risk.",How to Diagnose and Treat Gingivitis in Cats1," To check your cat's gums, sit down with the cat. Tip their head back, and part their lips with a finger so that you can see their gums. Typically, gingivitis will cause redness and swelling around the gum line. You may also notice some plaque build-up on their teeth. This will appear as a yellowish discoloration on the tooth itself.The cat may not like having their gums inspected. If they struggle, let them go, and try again later.
While you look at their teeth, you can soothe your cat by petting and talking to them.
If the swelling appears severe, see a vet immediately. Your cat may have a later stage of gingivitis, or it may be periodontitis.;
, Bad breath is usually one of the first signs of gingivitis. Smell your cat’s breath. If it smells foul or bad, it may be a sign that there is something wrong with their teeth, gums, or mouth. Make an appointment with a vet., Gingivitis can cause soreness in the cat’s mouth, but the cat may not show many signs that they are in pain. Watch to see if the cat is frequently pawing at their face. If their gums hurt, they may also be refusing to eat hard foods or dry kibble. These are signs that something might be wrong., All cats can develop gingivitis. That said, there are certain factors that may increase their risk. If these apply to your cat, you may want to visit your vet for more frequent dental cleanings.


Older cats or cats with crowded teeth may develop gingivitis more easily than other cats.
Cats with diabetes, feline leukemia (FeLV), or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may be at higher risk of developing gingivitis.Some purebred cats, such as Abyssinians, Siamese, Maine Coons, Persians, and Somalis, may be at higher risk, although all breeds can get gingivitis."

Check the gums and cheek area for small to medium, round or oblong wounds that may or may not bleed and expose the tissue below.Ulcers can occur in a number of places within the mouth. Use the length of your finger to gently pull up on your cat’s cheek and check the gums, inner cheeks, tongue, and roof of the mouth. Be sure to check the edges of the tongue, and beneath the tongue as well.;
, If you cannot tell for sure whether your cat has an oral ulcer, look for other symptoms including bad breath, swollen gums, excessive drooling, thick stringy saliva, loss of appetite, and difficulty eating. Look carefully around your cat’s mouth and monitor their eating habits to check for other mouth ulcer symptoms.Take regular, careful looks at your cat’s teeth and gum lines. Swelling around a tooth, inflammation of the gums, and bleeding at the gum line may all be indicators of an ulcer or a larger oral health problem.

, Ulcers can be symptoms of larger problems, such as feline calicivirus, an upper respiratory infection common in cats. If you notice mouth ulcers in your cat, take note of other calicivirus symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, inflammation around the eyes, and discharge around the eyes and nose.If you notice symptoms of calicivirus, contact your vet immediately. Let them know what symptoms your cat is experiencing, and when they first started to appear.
Your vet may request you bring your cat in for a visit, or may give you instructions for home treatment. Follow your vet’s instructions carefully.

, If you notice symptoms of ulcers or open wounds in your cat’s mouth, make an appointment for an oral exam with your vet. Your vet can tell you not only whether your cat has ulcers, but also may be able to pinpoint their cause.If your vet notices ulcers, they may ask for permission to perform x-rays and determine whether there is any additional damage to your cat’s jaw.
Let your vet know what symptoms you’ve noticed, including those that aren’t directly related to mouth injuries, swelling, or bleeding. This may help your vet better diagnose underlying medical issues.

, Depending upon what your vet finds during the oral inspection, they may ask permission to run blood or urine tests to determine the cause of the ulcers. Allow your vet to run the tests, as this can help your vet determine the exact cause of your cat’s ulcers and plan better treatment.Urine tests are generally not painful for cats, and blood tests cause only momentary discomfort.
Ulcers can be symptomatic of other, more significant infections, diseases, and health issues with cats, including chronic kidney disease, feline viral rhinopneumonitis (FVR) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).Proper diagnosis is necessary to lead to proper treatment and better health for your cat.

, If your vet diagnoses your cat with mouth ulcers or a mouth ulcer-causing condition, ask specific questions about care for your cat. Inquire, “Will my cat need surgery or other immediate treatment?” and, “What sort of long term care should I expect to provide for my cat?”Treatment of ulcers will depend greatly upon the cause of the ulcers. Follow your vet’s recommendations closely and make appointments with them and with specialists as necessary.
The ulcers themselves will probably be treated symptomatically with a mouth rinse and/or pain medication. The underlying cause for the ulcers will need to be treated as well to prevent more ulcers from forming.

, If you notice discharge, a foul smell, and red and tender areas around the gums, the ulcer may have become infected. Talk to your vet immediately about a prescription for an antimicrobial or antibiotic treatment.Treatment may be given by topical medication or through ingestion. Be sure to check the packaging and follow instructions for administering the drug carefully.

, Regularly brush your cat’s teeth, up to twice a day, to help keep plaque from accumulating and making ulcer-causing conditions worse. Use a soft-bristled or silicone toothbrush and specially formulated toothpaste for cats to gently brush your cat’s teeth on a regular basis.Wet the toothbrush and apply a small amount of toothpaste. Then, gently massage the brush against your cat’s teeth, focusing on the areas where the teeth meet the gums.
Toothbrushes and toothpaste formulated for cats is available at most pet stores, as well as online.

, On top of cleaning your cat’s teeth, try to schedule oral cleanings regularly with your vet. Talk to your vet about the frequency at which your cat should receive dental cleanings, and try to stick to that schedule.Regular cleanings also allow your vet the chance to extract diseased teeth, which can help prevent ulcers from spreading or getting worse.

, If your cat needs professional teeth cleaning, talk to your vet about this and other treatment options that may be less invasive. Ask questions about surgery details including anesthesia and overall cost, which can be $300-1,400.Some questions to ask include:


Is home care and cleaning an option?How much experience do you have with cleanings?What are your anesthetic protocols?
Does the procedure require blood work beforehand?
Will my pet have an IV and fluids during the procedure?
What type of monitoring is there for my cat during the procedure? Does this person have credentials?

, The safest and most comfortable way to clean your cat’s teeth professionally is under anesthesia. You may worry about the risks the procedure may present for your cat. Discuss your fears, what the procedure entails, its risks for your cat, and other concerns with the vet. Some concerns you may want to address include:


Anesthetic risk, including fatalities
Pre-existing conditions
Your cat’s age and tolerability for the procedure
Recovery
CostAdditional procedures such as tooth extraction or X-rays, In some cases, a second veterinary opinion can further inform you on getting your cat’s teeth professionally cleaned. They can assess the initial vet’s diagnosis and may confirm the diagnosis or suggest a different oral treatment. Getting a second opinion can further put your mind at ease about having your cat undergo a cleaning procedure.Recognize that doctors often value a second opinion. You should never feel pressure from any party to commit to a decision for care only with them.

, Approve of blood work, X-rays, and other diagnostic tests before your cat’s procedure. These common tests can tell your vet if your cat is healthy enough for anesthesia and the procedure.X-rays help the doctor better evaluate the teeth and jawbone, which may make cleaning or possible extractions easier.Be aware that diagnostic tests can add extra cost to procedure totals., Ask your vet for directions about preparing your cat for the professional cleaning. Most cats have to fast from 8pm the evening before to reduce the risk of vomiting under anesthesia. They may also require vaccination boosters to increase immunity to infectious diseases after the procedure.Ensure your cat’s stomach is empty by securing food and water. In addition, keep it in overnight so that it doesn’t get any food from hunting or your neighbors.

, Give yourself and your cat extra time in the morning to get ready. Put your cat in its carrier for transport to the vet’s office. Aim to arrive at least 15 minutes early. This can ensure neither you nor your cat is unduly stressed. It also allows time to fill out forms, talk with the vet, and comfort your cat before the teeth cleaning starts.Ask your vet any questions you may have about the procedure and if they will contact you before performing additional procedures. You may also want to know when you can see your cat.

, After the teeth cleaning, your pet will recover in a warm kennel under veterinary observation. Although you may be nervous and want to call, allow the vet to contact you first. This will give them time to review your cat’s health and develop after-care instructions. In some cases, your vet may give you a specific time to call or pick up your cat.Recognize that the vet may call you during the cleaning if there are any abnormalities or additional procedures are necessary., Most cats can go home after they’ve recovered properly from the anesthesia and procedure.At this time, the vet will discuss after-care with you. Ask for a copy of the instructions and any other questions you have about how to care for your cat following its teeth cleaning.Give your cat any antibiotics or pain medications as instructed by the vet.Keep your cat in a warm and quiet environment inside your home for the first 24 hours. Offer them a light meal and plenty of fresh water."

Manage underlying health issues.",How to Prevent Feline Dental Disease," Brushing your cat’s teeth is the best way to prevent dental disease. The mechanical action of brushing removes plaque, which can cause dental disease if left on the teeth. Do not use just any toothbrush and toothpaste, though—select cat-specific products. Human toothpastes are abrasive and have foam that your cat could swallow or inhale.Consider purchasing the toothpaste and toothbrush through your veterinarian.Alternatively, you could find them at your local pet store.
Cat toothpastes usually come in tasty flavors, like poultry or tuna.Cat toothbrushes are very small, an example of which is a finger toothbrush.;
, Although cats can learn to tolerate teeth brushing, they need to acclimate to the process first. Begin by allowing your cat to lick toothpaste off your finger. You can then let her lick the toothpaste off the toothbrush (without putting it in her mouth). Do not rush this process—it may take 1 to 2 months of daily practice before your cat is ready to have her teeth brushed.Reward your cat with verbal praise and a tasty treat when she licks the toothpaste.This will help her start forming a positive association with teeth brushing.
If your cat does not like the toothbrush, you can use a small piece of gauze instead.Throughout the acclimation process, have your cat lie comfortably in your lap in a quiet area.Start the acclimation as early in your cat’s life as possible.

, Your cat will also need to be comfortable with the action of teeth brushing. Put some toothpaste on a finger and rub that finger in a back-and-forth motion along the outside her teeth.Give her verbal praise and a tasty treat if she behaves well when you do this.

, With your cat lying comfortably in your lap, put your non-dominant hand over her head, with your thumb and index finger on either side of her upper jaw. Angle her head upwards and use your thumb and index finger to lift her upper lip slowly. Angle the toothbrush at approximately 45 degrees and use a gentle back-and-forth motion to brush the outside of her teeth. Start with her canines.After cleaning her canines, go to her back teeth and work your way forward to her middle teeth (incisors), spending about 30 seconds per side.To brush her lower teeth, reposition your non-dominant hand to cradle her lower jaw.
It may help to clean her mouth in 4 parts: upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right.
Make sure you brush along the gum line as well.Talk to your cat and give her verbal praise as you brush her teeth. You could even give her a treat afterwards for a job well done.

, The more often you brush your cat’s teeth, the better protected she will be from dental disease. Daily brushing is ideal. If this is not practical for you, brush her teeth at least 2 to 3 days/week.Be aware, though, that plaque remaining on the teeth for more than 3 days cannot be removed by brushing.Infrequent and inconsistent teeth brushing can be painful for your cat., Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic solution that is safe for pets and very effective at preventing plaque buildup. There are several ways you can give your cat chlorhexidine, one of which is to squirt or spray a small amount on the inside of each cheek.You can also add chlorhexidine to your cat’s water.In addition, you could apply chlorhexidine gel directly to your cat’s teeth with a cotton tip applicator or gauze sponge.Chlorhexidine products are available through your veterinarian. Some of the products can be used with or without brushing.Given the different ways you can administer chlorhexidine, discuss with your veterinarian which method would be best for your cat. Your veterinarian can also advise you on how often to use the chlorhexidine.

, Specially formulated dental diets are available that help prevent feline dental disease by preventing tartar accumulation.You can purchase these diets directly through your veterinarian or at your local pet store.Look for a Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal on the label to indicate the products delays plaque and tartar accumulation.Dental diets are usually dry kibble, which may be specifically designed to prevent plaque and tartar buildup. In addition, the diets may have chemical anti-plaque ingredients.Talk with your veterinarian about feeding a dental diet either exclusively or as an addition to your cat’s normal diet.

, In addition to special diets, there are also specially formulated dental chews that can prevent feline dental disease. Purina and Feline Greenies® make dental chews that have the VOHC seal of approval.Be aware, though, that there is not a lot of information available on the effectiveness of dental chews for cats., Table scraps are not only bad for your cat’s overall health, but they can worsen dental disease.Not only can sweet table scraps can lead to more plaque accumulation on your cat’s teeth, but they can also cause cavities., Although daily dental home care is the best defense against feline dental disease, your cat may still end up developing oral health problems that will need veterinary care. Your cat will give you clues that her mouth is bothering her, including discomfort when chewing, reluctance to eat, and bad breath. She may also start preferring canned food over dry food.If you look in her mouth, you may see inflamed gums (‘gingivitis’) and a buildup of yellow or dark-looking material on her teeth.
When you notice signs of dental disease, it is time for your cat to receive professional, veterinary dental care.Be mindful that cats can be very good at hiding signs of discomfort.You may not notice right away that your cat is having oral health problems.

, Your veterinarian can examine your cat’s oral cavity to determine the extent of dental disease. In order to do a safe and thorough evaluation, your veterinarian may want to anesthetize your cat. Or, your veterinarian may be able to easily detect the dental disease during the physical examination., Home dental care is not a substitute for regular veterinary dental cleanings.A veterinary cleaning requires that your cat be anesthetized—a simple scraping of the visible portions of your cat’s teeth while she is awake will not be sufficient.Your veterinarian will use a combination of hand and power instruments to clean above and below the gum line.Once-yearly veterinary dental cleanings are recommended., Diseases such as renal failure and diabetes can make a cat more susceptible to developing dental disease.Your veterinarian can determine if your cat has some underlying medical conditions would make dental disease more likely. The better you can manage those conditions, the better you will be able to prevent dental disease.

Assess whether your cat might have a medical condition that is affecting its breath.,
Watch your cat for signs of ill health.,
Get your cat checked at by a veterinarian.",How to Get Rid of Bad Cat Breath2," Several medical conditions can result in bad breath. For example, diabetes is associated with a sickly sweet breath odor, while kidney disease is linked to an ammonia or bleach-like smell., If your cat has bad breath, monitor it closely for tell-tale signs of a problem. Clues that your cat has a health issue include excessive thirst, poor appetite, increased appetite, weight loss, lethargy, weight loss, weight gain, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulties, an unkempt coat, or changed behavior.

, If you are in the least suspicious that your cat is unwell get it checked by a veterinarian. Key to remedying the bad breath is to correct the underlying health issue.For diabetes it is likely the vet will either put the cat on a prescription diet or prescribe regular insulin injections.
For kidney disease the vet will likely put the cat on a prescription diet and on medication to improve renal function.

Request that the vet does an oral exam.,
Ask your vet if your cat should change their diet.,
Return for dental check-ups.",How to Diagnose and Treat Gingivitis in Cats2," When you visit the vet, let them know that you want them to do an oral dental exam on your cat. They will need to put your cat under general anesthesia so that they can examine the cat’s entire mouth. During this exam, they will look at the cat’s teeth, gums, tongue, and mouth.


Your vet may also do a dental cleaning during this visit. This includes removing any plaque or tartar that has appeared on your cat’s teeth. They will then polish and clean the cat’s teeth.If your cat has gingivitis, your vet will recommend a daily cleaning for you to do at home. Unless your cat has an infection, this will be the primary step that you take to reduce and reverse gingivitis. If your cat’s gingivitis has progressed to periodontitis, surgery or other medical procedures may be necessary.
For a full dental exam to take place, your vet will need to put your cat under anesthesia. The risks for this are minimal, but about 1 in 100,000 cats may experience side effects, such as swelling, a slowed heart rate, vomiting, anaphylactic shock, or death., Your cat’s diet may be able to help prevent or treat gingivitis. Ask your vet if their current diet is acceptable or if they should be put on a special dental diet food.


Some brands of cat food contain anti-plaque ingredients. These may be available at your local pet store.You may be able to find cat treats that help prevent tartar build-up. Ask your vet for recommendations.

, Your cat should have a dental cleaning and exam at least once a year. Even if your cat was not diagnosed with gingivitis, this is an important step towards preventing gingivitis from developing.If your cat has gingivitis, periodontitis, or another dental issue, you may be asked in come in every six months for a check-up."

Find a cat-friendly toothpaste.,
Use a feline toothbrush.,
Introduce the cat to the toothpaste.,
Brush their teeth once a day.,
Use a mouth rinse.,
Mix a cleaning additive into your cat’s water.",How to Diagnose and Treat Gingivitis in Cats3," Cats cannot use the same toothpaste as humans do. You will need to find a cat-friendly toothpaste. Look for ones that have a flavor that might appeal to your cat, such as chicken or fish. These can bought from your local pet store or even from your vet.


Cat toothpastes often contain ingredients like chlorhexidine, hexametaphosphate, or zinc gluconate.Human toothpastes have ingredients, such as detergents and fluoride, that can harm your cat if they swallow it. Fluoride is toxic to cats., There are special feline toothbrushes that are small enough to fit in cat's mouths. These are safer to use on cats than human toothbrushes. They can purchased at a pet store. Do not use a human toothbrush on a cat.


Another option are finger brushes. These slide over your finger so that you can use your finger to clean the cat’s teeth. Some cats may prefer finger brushes. If you are having difficulty using a feline toothbrush with your cat, you might try a finger brush instead., If your cat is not used to having their teeth touched or brushed, you should start introducing them to brushing very slowly. Start by putting a little bit of the toothpaste on your finger, and let them lick it off. After about a week or two, start rubbing a little bit on the cat’s front teeth. Once the cat is used to this, you can start brushing normally.If the cat doesn’t like the toothpaste, try a different flavor.
The cat may resist at first. If they struggle or try to bite you, stop and try again another day.

, Daily brushing is best to maintain good oral hygiene. It will help reverse the symptoms of gingivitis, and it can prevent future problems from developing. Put a little bit of the toothpaste on the brush, and brush the outside surface of the cat’s entire set of teeth.


You may want to move rather quickly, as your cat may not stay still for long. Spend a few seconds moving the brush around each tooth before moving on to the next one., In addition to brushing, mouth rinses can reduce tartar build-up on your cat’s teeth. These usually contain chlorhexidine. Some cats do not like the taste of this while others do not mind it.If the solution is a gel or liquid, you can squeeze it into the cat’s mouth. If it comes in a spray bottle, however, you can just spray it in their mouth.
Be sure to read the instructions to make sure that you are giving the cat the right dose.

, You can add a liquid solution to your cat’s water dish. These may be called “dental water” or “liquid tartar remover.” While the dosage might vary from brand to brand, typically you will add a small amount of the additive to about a quart of water per day. As your cat drinks from their bowl, this will help keep their teeth clean."

Pay attention to signs of oral pain.Stomatitis causes pain and irritation at the back of the mouth.,
Look for signs of weight loss and dehydration.The pain caused by stomatitis often causes cats to shy away from their food.,
Inspect your cat's gums.,
Take risk factors into consideration.,
Take your cat to its veterinarian.,
Tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms.,
Agree to veterinary testing.,
Give your cat medication.,
Consider teeth removal as an option.,
Investigate the newest treatments.",How to Diagnose Feline Stomatitis," If your cat has stomatitis, it may be hesitant to eat its food, when it usually loves chowing down. If your cat is not eating as usual, then you should be suspicious that it may have a health problem that needs to be addressed.


It may also paw at its face, attempting to get at the pain.;
, If your cat has suddenly lost weight or shows signs of dehydration, which includes a loss of elasticity of the skin, sunken eyes, and cold paws, it may be due to a stomatitis infection in the mouth.


Weight loss and dehydration can be signs of a variety of illnesses. Whatever the cause, they are symptoms that needs to be investigated by a veterinarian.

, Cats with stomatitis have red, inflamed gums. It can be hard to see, as this inflammation usually occurs at the back of the mouth. If you are intent on looking, get the help of another person to hold the cat while you open the cat's mouth.


If you notice the other symptoms of stomatitis you may want to leave the mouth inspection to a veterinarian, especially if your cat does not like you to get too close.
In advanced cases of stomatitis, the infection will spread from the infected tooth around the mouth. Ulcers may develop around the mouth and blood may be visible in the cat's saliva.While inspecting your cat's gums, take a moment to assess its breath as well. An infection in your cat's mouth can make your cat's breath very bad. A breath that smells different than usual can be an additional indicator of a stomatitis infection., Cats with certain immune diseases, in particular feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), are more likely to get stomatitis. There is still more research needed to make it clear how the two diseases are connected, but there is a connection in rates of infection nonetheless.


If your cat has FIV then it is a good idea to keep on the look out for stomatitis and other opportunistic infections that are related to your cat's autoimmune disease.

, If you believe that your cat has the symptoms of stomatitis, then contact your veterinary office to get an appointment. Whether or not your cat's illness ends up being stomatitis, a cat that is having issues with eating and weight retention needs to be looked at by a veterinarian.


If you let your cat's symptoms persist, the infection could advance so much that the cat is unable to eat or drink at all due to the pain. This could get so bad that it could threaten the cat's life., Keep a record of your cat's symptoms, including what they are and when you first noticed them. Giving your veterinarian as much information as possible will help the vet to narrow down his or her diagnosis.


Giving your veterinarian a correct accounting of your cat's symptoms is important. Include changes in its physical appearance, its bodily functions, as well as changes in behavior.

, The only way to positively diagnose stomatitis is to do a biopsy of the affected tissue. The veterinarian will collect a small sample of affected tissue and the tissue will be assessed by the veterinarian or in a lab. This testing will allow the veterinarian to confirm if the infection is due to an overreaction of the cat's own immune system.The veterinarian may also test your cat for FIV or FeLV, as stomatitis is often associated with these infections.

, Anti-inflammatory therapies are usually prescribed for cats with stomatitis. These may eliminate the infection or they may simply reduce the symptoms temporarily. The effectiveness depends on the cat and the level of infection that it is suffering from.Medications used include both systemic antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications. Follow your veterinarian's directions for the medication, including how long to give them to your cat.

, If anti-inflammatory and antibiotic therapies don't work for your cat's infection, then the veterinarian may suggest removing some or all of the cat's teeth.This is an extreme treatment and should be undertaken only if all other treatment options have proved unsuccessful.


Removing the cat's teeth should only be done after other treatments are attempted. If your veterinarian suggests doing it before any other treatments, consider getting a second opinion.After your cat's teeth are removed it will need to be cared for at home while it recovers. You will need to give it antibiotics and pain killers for a week or two after surgery.After recovery the cat may need some adjustment to its diet but should be fine otherwise. For instance, if all of your cat's teeth have been removed, it will likely need to eat wet food instead of dry food. Otherwise, it should regain weight and have a better quality of life than it would have with an infected mouth., There is a new therapy for stomatitis that uses the cat's own stem cells to treat the infection. Cats that have had all other types of treatment, including all of their teeth removed, are the only animals that are eligible for this new treatment. You will have to find one of the few veterinary schools and veterinary hospitals that is performing this procedure to have your cat treated.Stem cell therapy requires that your cats own stem cells are harvested and then they are given back to the cat through an IV.
This therapy has been shown to improve the health and quality of life of about seventy percent of study participants. However, the procedure is still in developmental stages.

Consider that the food you are feeding your cat could be causing the problem.,
Smell your cat's breath at various times of day.,
Try changing the cat's diet.",How to Get Rid of Bad Cat Breath3," If you've checked everything else out and your cat seems fine otherwise, then consider what you're feeding them. For example, offensive fishy breath might just be related to fish in the cat's diet.

, You want to figure out if what you are smelling is simply the residue of your cat's last meal. Try smelling your cat's breath right before it eats and then a few minutes after, so that you can compare the smells.

, Try feeding the cat chicken for a few days and see if the bad breath goes away. If its breath improves on the chicken then reintroduce other foods or flavors of food one at a time. If the cat gets bad breath again don't feed it the last food you reintroduced to its diet anymore.


Remember that chicken is not a balanced diet in the long term. You need to reintroduce other foods in order to give your cat the nutrition is needs.

Avoid giving the cat more medicine than prescribed.",How to Give L‐Carnitine to Cats with Fatty Liver1," When your cat is diagnosed with fatty liver disease, your vet may prescribe L-carnitine as a supplemental treatment. The vet will give you a particular dosage, generally between 250-500 mg per day. Make sure to listen to the vet when they explain how to give the medication to the cat.If you have questions, call your vet and have them explain the right way to administer this medicine to your cat.;
, Before you give your cat the first dose of L-carnitine, read the label and all the literature that came with the medication. This information will explain the proper way to administer the medication, warnings, and any side effects., L-carnitine is used often as a supplemental therapy for cats with fatty liver disease. However, not all cats will respond positively to the supplement. Talk to your vet about whether or not L-carnitine is the right choice and what alternatives there are for treatment., Try to set up a routine for your cat where you give it the medicine at the same time every day. This helps you and your cat get into the habit of taking the medicine.If you miss a dose, give the cat the dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time to give it the next dose, just skip the earlier missed dose. Never give the cat two doses to make up for one you missed.

, Your vet will give you a specific prescribed dosage for your cat. Do not increase this dosage for any reason. If the cat somehow spits out part of the medicine, don’t try to make up the difference. Stick with the amount the vet told you to give the cat.Don’t give the cat medicine more times during the day than your vet recommended.

The vet will provide you with a dosage that ranges from 250 to 500 mg per day.Carefully measure the proper dose in the syringe.Shake the medicine. Warm up the medicine by holding it in your hand or placing it in a warm water bath. Don't boil it or microwave it. Place the tip of the clean syringe into the medicine and load the syringe with the correct amount of medication.
If you are unsure how to use the syringe or measure the proper dosage, ask your vet to show you.

, This supplement can cause an upset stomach, so you should give it at the same time as your cat’s meal.Mix the medication into a small amount of canned food. Avoid placing it into a large bowl of food that the cat may not completely eat.After mixing it into a small amount of food, feed it to the cat. Make sure it eats all of the food so it gets all of the medicine.

, If your cat cannot take the medication in its food, you have to give it to the cat manually. Place the cat in your lap. Try letting the cat lick the medicine from the end of the syringe as you push down the plunger.If it won’t do this, gently take your cat by the scruff of the neck to tilt its head back. Place the syringe tip in the mouth behind the canine teeth. Hold the syringe at an angle and squeeze the stopper slowly to squirt the medication into the mouth. Don’t do this too fast because it can cause your cat to be unable to breathe.

, After you have given your cat the medication, rinse out the syringe or eyedropper. Use warm water. Rinse thoroughly so that you get all the medicine out of the stopper before putting it away., You should place this medicine in a cool, dry place so it is at room temperature. Do not place it in a refrigerator or near a source of heat. Keep it out of the reach of children.Don’t place it in the bathroom or near any sinks. The medicine may be compromised if it gets exposed to heat or moisture.

Clean your cat’s teeth regularly.,
Schedule annual teeth cleanings.,
Make regular vet visits with your cat.",How to Deal with Tooth Resorption in Cats1," You should clean your cat’s teeth every week or every other week to prevent gingivitis. Vets aren’t sure what causes teeth resorption, which makes it hard to prevent. Regularly cleaning your cat's teeth might not prevent teeth resorption, but it will make it easier for you to see if there's anything unusual happening with its teeth.If you brush your cat’s teeth, and you notice a shudder in their jaw when you brush a certain area, they might be experiencing teeth resorption, even if you can’t see any other symptoms.;
, Because teeth resorption can occur without outward symptoms, taking your cat to the vet every year for a cleaning can help prevent it. Your vet will check your cat’s teeth more thoroughly than you can at home and will likely order x-rays, which is the best way of diagnosing teeth absorption., The more your vet sees your cat, the more familiar they'll be with your cat's general health. This can help your vet find early symptoms of teeth resorption, even if they don't clean your cat's teeth every time."

Check your cat’s gums in the case of an accident or trauma.,
Be aware that ill health can lead to anemia.,
Look for symptoms.,
Look for symptoms of an underlying condition causing the anemia.,
Understand that some underlying conditions will not have any symptoms.",How to Recognize Anemia in Cats1," They should be a healthy pink color like our own. An anemic animal has pale pink or even white gums. The gums can also be pale because of shock, but in this situation regardless of whether the cause is anemia or shock, get the cat seen by a vet.


Given a recent history of trauma, pale gums are a sign the cat need supportive care such as intravenous fluids.;
, Each red blood cell lives for up to 100 days, and unless the animal experiences rapid blood loss (trauma), it is common for anemia to develop slowly when cells die but aren't replaced. The bone marrow is the factory that makes red blood cells and in older cats, the active bone marrow slowly gets replaced with non-functional scar tissue. Thus the body's ability to make new cells slowly dwindles.


The other side of the coin is the red blood cells, and just like every cell in the body it has a natural lifespan programmed in. It is inevitable that over time these red blood cells are recognized as ""old"" by the spleen and destroyed.

, In the early stages there are few symptoms, and indeed the slow decrease in numbers of red blood cells gives the body time to adapt to less oxygen, which means the signs of anemia are masked for even longer. Only when the anemia is quite severe will that cat start to show signs. These include:


Low energy levels (sleeping more!)
General weakness
Lethargy. This might show itself as the cat who used to greet you, no longer getting up when you come home The hunter who spent all day in the fields may stay home asleep, or the cat who groomed obsessively no longer bothering to take care of his coat - the signs can be very subtle.
Cats with anemia often have a poor appetite, so eating loss and weight loss (although general signs) should be noted.

, It is also likely that the cat has an underlying health issue which is causing the anemia. You are more likely to spot signs of this causative disease, than the anemia. Some of the most common diseases which can cause anemia are:


Kidney Disease: Increased thirst, wetting more often, vomiting, poor appetite.
Cancer, especially of the bowel: Vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the feces, weight loss, poor appetite, increased thirst, low energy levels
Gastric Ulcers: Recent history of NSAID medication (such as metacam), vomiting, vomit sometimes containing blood
External parasites: Presence of lice or fleas in the fur, itchiness. If the cat is otherwise well, killing the parasites removes the cause of the anemia. Provided the bone marrow is functioning and pushing out replacement red blood cells, within 2-3 weeks the cat should be feeling much stronger. Unless the cat was dangerously anemic, in which case he would be weak, listless, and poorly, a vet is unlikely to give a blood transfusion if the initial problem is identified and addressed.

, Unfortunately, problems such as bone marrow disease are largely ""silent"" - that is they don't show signs other than a decreased product of red blood cells.


Also, some conditions such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (where the body's immune system destroys it's own red blood cells in a case of mistaken identity) the deterioration can happen within a few days.
However, very rapid hemolysis (breaking down of red blood cells) can flood the plasma with hemoglobin products which have a yellow tinge. The latter will color the urine bright orange and cause the oral membranes and whites of the eye to be jaundiced (bright yellow).

Prepare your cat for treatment.",How to Deal with Tooth Resorption in Cats2," One of the most obvious signs of teeth resorption in cats is a red area of gingivitis on one or two of your cat’s teeth. This will look like a little red patch on their enamel. If you see this, it’s likely a sign of teeth resorption., Another sign of teeth resorption in cats is a bony bulge over their teeth. This indicates that cells are reabsorbing the tooth’s enamel and can be a sign of progressed teeth resorption., If you notice your cat drooling quite a bit, it might be suffering from teeth resorption. If you notice drooling, look for either of the above signs. Even if you don’t notice other signs of teeth resorption, this is a good indicator your cat might be suffering from it., If you notice your cat doesn’t want to eat, or stops shortly after beginning to eat, they might be reacting to pain in their teeth from teeth resorption. If notice this, check for other signs., If you notice any of the above symptoms in your cat, you should take it to the vet immediately. Only a vet can truly diagnose teeth resorption, because it often involves examination of your cat’s teeth that requires your cat to be placed under anesthesia. It might also require x-rays., Depending on what stage the teeth resorption is in, your cat might need to have the affected tooth or teeth removed. Less advanced stages of teeth resorption can be treated by the vet filing the tooth down. Whatever the treatment, your vet will be able to tell you how to best prepare your cat for the procedure."

Your vet will tell you the best type of food for your cat and how long they should stick to that diet., Some vets may prescribe medication for your cat post-surgery. If your vet does prescribe meds, make sure you carefully follow the directions that come with the medication.

, If your cat needs to have surgery for tooth resorption, try to prevent them from playing too rough in the weeks after their procedure. You can do this by putting away any toys that get them too riled up and playing with them more gently. Avoid letting them chase or jump to catch toys.

, Most cats who experience teeth resorption once are likely to experience it again. Schedule dental cleanings and check-ups for your cat every six months to make sure their teeth are okay."

Have your vet check your pet’s gums.,
Get blood work done for your cat.,
Understand that the vet most likely won’t give your cat iron.,
Talk to your vet about a transfusion.",How to Recognize Anemia in Cats2," The vet will check your pet's gums, and have a high suspicion of anemia if they are pale and there is no recent history of trauma (shock).


However, some caution needs to be exercised because some cats gums appear pale at the vet's because of fear - adrenaline flooding a fearful cat's system causes peripheral blood vessels in the gum to contract and squeeze the blood out of them. This mechanism redirects blood to the muscles for a quick getaway!

, The standard test is to draw blood the jugular vein in the cat's neck, or the cephalic vein on the foreleg. The blood is placed in an EDTA tube (which includes an anticoagulant to stop the blood clotting), then transferred to a capillary tube (a fine bore glass tube) and centrifuged for 3 to 4 minutes. This packs the red blood cells down under gravity, separating them out from the fluid plasma in which they are suspended. This spun down sample is used to calculate the percentage of red blood cells present.


This is done by laying the capillary tube (a fine tube into which the blood was put prior to centrifugation) on a special gauge. The length of red blood cells is divided by the length of the fluid as a whole and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage. This reading is also known as a packed cell volume or PCV. If this figure is below 33% the cat is anemic.
A PCV between 21-33% is considered mild anemia, between 15-20 % is moderate anemia, and below 15 % is severe anemia, Iron deficiency anemia is rare in cats and usually arises because of chronic blood loss in a cat eating a poorly balanced diet. There is rarely anything to be gained by supplementing a cat with iron.

, Severely anemic cats may need a blood transfusion in order to buy time until the underlying cause of the anemia can be diagnosed and treated. Moderately or mildly anemic cats do not need transfusion because if the bone marrow is working, they will generate new red blood cells. Once the source of blood cell loss or destruction is identified and treated, the cat will make more cells than she loses and the anemia gradually improve.The exception is bone marrow problems which usually carry a grave outlook. Most commonly the bone marrow runs out of ""baby"" red blood cells because it's used them all up, and so the cat is unable to make new cells. These cats remain anemic, become progressively weaker, and other than repeated blood transfusions there is little by way of treatment and euthanasia may be the most humane option.

Understand what anemia is.,
Be aware of why anemia happens.,
Understand that diagnosing anemia can be challenging.",How to Recognize Anemia in Cats3," The term anemia refers to a reduced number of circulating red blood cells or a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. The amount of red blood cells if most commonly discussed in percentage terms.


A normal percentage in the cat is around 33 to 50%. In a given volume of blood this tells you that 33-50% of it is occupied by red blood cells.Red blood cells contain haemoglobin, and indeed the hemoglobin plays a vital role in delivering oxygen to the body's tissue. Deprived of oxygen, organs, muscles and tissue cannot function properly, and leads to clinical signs.

, Anemia is a symptom rather than a diagnosis in its own right. There are many conditions that cause anemia, but the reasons can be proudly broken down into groups:


Anemia because of blood loss: This includes hemorrhage, such as after a traffic accident. There are many ways to lose blood including hemorrhage from gastro-intestinal ulcers, inflamed bowels, parasitism (lice or fleas sucking blood)
Anemia because of damage to red blood cells: Also a form of blood loss, this includes red blood cells being destroyed because of autoimmune disease, parasitism (Mycoplasma felis), or damaged passing through a tumor
Anemia due to lack of blood cell production: Most commonly this is bone marrow disease due to cancer or exhaustion of the bone marrow germ cells. It can also include anemia due to iron deficiency leading to lack of hemoglobin synthesis.

, Determining the cause of the anemia can be a complex and involved process that requires blood tests, blood smears, and imaging such as radiographs, ultrasound, or an MRI scan. However, the first step is to recognize that the cat is anemic.

, This could be the arrival of a new pet in her home or turf or the loss of a close companion like a fellow pet or other owner., Try to distinguish between psychological symptoms and a physical illness.If your cat displays symptoms like increased thirst, altered appetite (decreased or increased), changes in bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation), and other physical abnormalities such as vomiting or sneezing, these may all be signs of a physical illness.
It can be difficult to distinguish psychological issues and physical illness in your cat, as there is a big overlap with the quiet behavior of a depressed cat and a cat that is ill. So, if your cat starts behaving oddly in any way, get her checked out by the vet to ensure she is not sick. From this diagnosis, you can consider if your cat is in fact depressed.

, Remember to respect your cat’s independent nature and never force her to socialize or engage with you or other cats, as this will likely make her more upset, rather than cheer her up.Use treats to motivate her to play or move around, but do not use physical force.

So if there has been a major change, such as your absence after working from home for a long period of time, try to establish a new routine to help her adapt.Provide events for the cat to look forward to, such as mealtimes before you go to work and when you return, a grooming session before bedtime, and a play session when you get home from work.

, Grooming helps your cat to bond with you. Not only will your cat feel physically better about herself but she'll feel more secure and reassured.Ideally, have a grooming at a similar time every day to build that sense of routine and security.

, Though your cat may initially not want to get up or play with you, provide her with the opportunity anyway.Introduce a new toy, especially one that triggers natural hunting behavior like a mouse on a string.
Be patient if she does not react right away. Start by putting the toy near her paw and jerking it to encourage hunting behavior. Do this for five minutes, even if your cat doesn't respond. The fact that you are giving her your undivided attention will make an impression on her.
Once she starts to play, this will engage her hypothalamus and send out hormones that are beneficial for counteracting depression. An active cat is a happy cat.

, This will help to remind her of your presence as the item will have your scent on it. This will also hopefully reassure your cat and provide a sense of security for her., While you don’t want to crowd her or persist in pursuing her if she is under the bed or in a hiding spot, you can lie down on the floor beside the bed or near her and talk to her soothingly.You can also try to tempt her to come out from hiding with a treat or irresistible snack that she likes.

, Just like in humans, depression isn’t an easy thing to cure or solve. By being consistent with your attentions and TLC, every day, week after week, your cat should eventually warm up to your actions and respond to your attempts at cheering her up.

, This is a similar pheromone to the hormones that help a cat to feel safe, secure, and content.Though Feliway won't provide a quick fix as it typically takes a couple of weeks to make any visible difference on a cat's behavior, it does work slowly to reassure your cat and reduce her anxiety.

, The cream version is commonly used by veterinarians before handling anxious patients. But the room diffuser is probably most useful for your depressed cat because you can plug the diffuser unit into an electrical socket in the room where your cat spends most of her time. As the cat sleeps, she will breath in the pheromone.


Don't worry, these diffusers are odorless to people and have no effect on humans.

, These food supplement have health benefits that are similar to those found in pharmaceuticals.The nutraceutical Zylkene has been developed to decrease stress in cats. As stress is a major cause of feline depression, decreasing this can help get your cat back on her paws.
Zylkene contains a molecule derived from milk, which acts on the same brain receptors that Diazepam does. It has a similar calming effect to Diazepam but without the potential side effects. This will help to soothe your cat’s anxiety and reduce her fears, both of which are powerful drivers for depression.
The effect of nutraceuticals are not rapid, so it can take up to seven days before you notice any clear differences in your depressed kitty.
Zylkene comes as a capsule. The dose for an average-sized cat is one 75mg capsule once a day.

, There are no scientific studies that back up the benefits of this herbal remedy, but anecdotally some pet owners swear by the effectiveness of valerian extract on depression and stress in a cat.Dorwest Valerian Drops come in a dropper bottle. A quarter of a teaspoon can be added to your cat’s food once or twice daily or dropped onto her bedding.
An alternative is Skullcap and Valerian tablets, also by Dorwest Herbs, with a total daily dose of two tablets.

, This drug belongs to the tricyclic antidepressant group, and there is a licensed veterinary version available, which makes this drug the first and ideal choice for you vet to prescribe. Clomipramine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters by tissue, which prolongs their effects in the circulation.It also reduces urine spraying in cats, which is another symptom of depression.Your vet will prescribe a total dose of 2- 4 mg once a day. The smallest tablet is 5mg so an ideal starting dose is half a tablet a day.

, This drug has a complex mode of action but helps to increase levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, mainly serotonin and norepinephrine, that are associated with feelings of wellbeing. Amitriptyline is a human prescription medication, so needs to be prescribed by your veterinarian.The prescribed dose is 5-10 mg per cat once daily.
The smallest available tablet is 10mg so this is equivalent to taking half or one tablet a day.

, These are both prescription medications designed to treat depression in humans. Both drugs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which help maintain raised levels of the beneficial neurotransmitter serotonin.The prescribed dose of fluoxetine is 2.5-5 mg per cat (a quarter to half of a 8 mg tablet) once a day.
The prescribed dose of paroxetine is also 2.5 - 5 mg per cat (a quarter to half of a 10 mg tablet) once a day.
Keep in mind that it may take two weeks before therapeutic levels are reached in the blood stream.

, The ability cats have to avoid taking medication is legendary. You may succeed either by stealthily hiding the tablet in a cube of chicken or cheese.


If this fails, try popping the pill directly into her mouth and over the back of her tongue. Syringe a teaspoon of water into her mouth afterwards to make sure she has swallowed the pill all the way down.

, Though several of the drugs available for humans can also be prescribed for your cat, frequently the tablets prescribed for people are many times stronger than those used for a cat and you stand a good chance of overdosing your cat.


Giving your medication to your cat also means you be short on your own daily dose.
Always speak to your veterinarian before starting any medication on your cat and if you do decide to use your own medication, let your vet know to reduce the risk of drug interactions that could be harmful to your cat.

Start to think about deworming the kittens.",How to Take Care of Kittens1," Your female cat will chose a place where she feels safe to give birth. By all means, provide a large cardboard box, turn it on its side and line it with warm, dry bedding–but don't be disappointed if she has other ideas. Instinct tells her to find a quiet concealed spot, such as under a bed, behind a sofa, or inside a kitchen cabinet.To learn more about helping your cat give birth, see this article.;
, The first 48 hours is a crucial time for the mother to bond with her kittens, so try not to disturb her. If she gives birth under your bed, leave her there. Moving the newborn kittens will distress the mother and in the worst scenario could cause her to reject them. Once she is firmly bonded, at around four or five days, if you feel it's necessary to move the kittens, do it then., The mother won't want to leave her kittens for long in the first two weeks of their life. Always put food and water within stretching distance of her nest, and if possible, offer a litter tray in the same room so that she can stay within sight and sound of the kittens.


If food is in another room, some mothers chose to starve rather than leave their newborn kittens to find it., She needs the extra calories to make milk for her kittens. Feed her kitten food, which has more calories than adult cat food., Instinct helps the mother to keep the nest clean. The newborn kittens do not urinate or defecate on their own, so the mother has to lick their bottoms before and after feeding to stimulate elimination. This way she keeps the nest clean. Try to disturb the nest as little as possible.


If the bedding becomes soiled, wait until Mom hops out for a toilet break herself to take out the dirty bedding and pop in clean., If the mother cat is present, the kittens should nurse from her immediately after the last kitten is born. Newborn kittens will spend most of their time sleeping, waking up to nurse every two to three hours. If they do not appear to be nursing, or one kitten is being pushed away from the mother cat by its siblings, supplement with bottle feeding as described in Part 2.

, Having your mother cat spayed (removing her womb) after the kittens are done nursing (they should be weaned by about 8 weeks) is highly recommended by veterinarians and humane organizations. This helps prevent the suffering of unwanted kittens, and can also have some health benefits for the spayed cat.Be aware that a cat can potentially fall pregnant again as little as three to four days after giving birth, so keep her indoors to avoid this risk.

, This can happen as early as two weeks if necessary. Consult a veterinarian for proper medication and dosing."

Understand that the vet will use the ultrasound to check for a number of important factors.",How to Recognize Feline Heart Disease," When a heart is balanced between coping and not coping, it tends to make the cat lethargic.


This is because even a slight increase in activity, such as walking or going up stairs, places increased demands on the circulatory system.
If the circulation is inadequate then the cat feels light-headed, dizzy, and weak. Thus the cat learns it's best not to move around much and tends to rest instead.;
, Another early warning sign of heart disease is if the cat breathes more quickly, even at rest. This is known as an increased respiratory rate.


If you are suspicious about your cat breathing quickly, watch him and count the number of breaths taken in one minute. Repeat this several times to be certain that you are getting a true figure. This information is valuable to your vet, because many cats hyperventilate at the clinic which makes it difficult to get an accurate reading.
The normal respiratory rate in the cat is between 20-30 breaths a minute. More than 35-40 breaths a minute at rest is considered high, and over 40 is definitely abnormal.
The cat breathes more quickly because of fluid accumulation in the lungs which makes oxygen exchange across the lung tissue inefficient. In order to get enough oxygen the cat has to take more breaths, to make up for the poor oxygen transfer.

, Another sign of trouble is mouth breathing or panting. It is unusual for a cat to breathe through her mouth (unless she is very stressed, or she has been playing vigorously).


Mouth-breathing is an attempt to pull more oxygen down into the lungs and a sign that oxygen exchange is impaired.

, If the cat is short of air she may adopt the ""air hunger"" position. The cat crouches on her belly with her head and neck extended in a straight line. Her elbows are held away from her chest, in order to let her chest expand as much as possible with each breath.

, Many cats with heart disease have poor appetites. When the cat swallows she has to stop breathing. When her heart is struggling and she is finding it hard to breath, the cat won't take the time out from breathing to swallow.

, Sadly, as feline heart disease progresses the signs and symptoms become more severe. One late-stage symptom of heart disease is fainting. The cat may be prone to fainting episodes when the circulation cannot maintain blood supply to the brain.

, Another sign of advanced heart failure is fluid building up in the belly as a result of fluid changes within blood vessels that allow fluid to leak out into the body cavities.

, Another very serious sign of heart failure is hind limb paralysis.


In the advanced stages of heart failure blood clots develop which commonly lodge at a point where the main artery to the back legs divides in two.
The clot blocks the circulation to the back legs, leaving them paralyzed.

, If you notice any of the above-mentioned symptoms then get your cat checked out by a veterinarian. As part of the examination the vet will listen to the cat's heart with a stethoscope, and based on what she finds, suggest the most appropriate tests.

, To get an overview of how sick the cat is, the veterinarian may ask to watch the cat as she rests in the basket or box.


This is to gauge her breathing whilst she is as relaxed as possible, before the stress of an exam.
The vet counts the respiratory rate, and also assesses how the cat is breathing.

, With a healthy cat it is sometimes difficult to see the chest moving in and out. If the cat is having difficulty breathing (either because of heart or lung issues) the chest moves in an exaggerated in-out movement which is clear to see.


Another hint that points toward abnormal breathing is if the cat's tummy is going in and out with each breath. This is known as ""abdominal breathing"" and is a sign that the cat is struggling to draw air into the lungs.
It's important to note that cats rarely cough as a result of heart disease. This is in contrast to dogs where coughing is a common indication of a cardiac problem. Cats seem to lack airways receptors that trigger a cough as a result fluid in the lungs.

, Your vet will want to know if the cat has previously been diagnosed with a heart murmur.


The presence of a heart murmur in younger life indicates pre-existing cardiac pathology, which has the potential to deteriorate.
However, the absence of a heart murmur in younger life does not mean the pet cannot develop one at a later stage. If a cat with no history of a murmur suddenly develops one and is in respiratory distress, then finding a new murmur could be significant.

, The veterinarian will listen to the cat's heart in order to assess whether a murmur is present or not, how loud the murmur is, and to check the heart rhythm and rate.


Most cats with heart disease will have a heart murmur. The murmur is caused by turbulent blood flow within the chambers of the heart. Pathology within the heart such as thickened valve leaflets or thickened walls causes the turbulence that is heard as a murmur.
While it is true that heart disease in cats is often associated with a murmur, the opposite is not true. For instance, a cat with a murmur does not necessarily have heart failure. Many murmurs are ""innocent"" which means they cause no significant circulatory problems.

, The heart rate is an important guide as to whether the heart is struggling or not. The normal heart rate for the cat is approximately 120-140 beats per minute.


However, there is a certain amount of leeway in this because a stressed cat will have a faster heart rate. In the clinic environment most vets consider up to around 180 beats per minute to be normal. Above 180 is definitely too fast. This is significant because a diseased heart has a reduced stroke volume (the volume of blood it pushes out with each beat is lower than normal).
To compensate and maintain blood pressure the heart beats more quickly, (a higher number of beats multiplied by a lower stroke volume, maintains the circulation).

, An abnormal heart rhythm is a warning signal that the heart is struggling. A healthy heart rhythm falls into one of two patterns.


Firstly, the beat is regular with exactly the same time interval between beats. Secondly, the cat has a ""sinus arrhythmia"". This refers to a normal acceleration and deceleration of the heart beat which is synchronized to the cat's respiratory and expiratory breaths.
An abnormal heart rhythm is erratic. It might consist of a string of normal heart beats followed by erratic pattering. This happens if the heart muscle is damaged and scar tissue interferes with the electrical signals in the heart wall that give instructions about when to contract and relax.

, A cat's gums should be a healthy pink color, just like our own. The veterinarian checks the gum color for indications of circulatory problems.


If the heart is failing and the circulation poor, the gums tend to be pale or even white. However, this sign is not exclusive to heart disease and gums can be pale because of anemia or pain.

, The vet may do something that looks pretty odd, which is to wet the fur on the cat's neck with surgical spirit. She does this in order to see the outline of the jugular veins which contain blood returning to the heart.


These veins run up the neck and if the heart is struggling, blood tends to accumulate downstream of the heart and cause the jugular veins to distend.

, It is likely that additional tests will be needed to confirm a strong suspicion of heart disease, to work out the cause, and gauge the severity of the illness.


The tools most commonly used in the diagnosis of feline heart murmur are a specialized blood test (proBNP), chest radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound.

, This blood test measures the levels of ""cardiac bio markers"" in the blood. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins that are released from distressed heart muscle cells.


The results are allocated to one of three groups: Low indicates heart disease is not causing the cat's clinical signs, normal range means heart disease is less likely at that time, and high which means the cat has significant heart muscle damage.
ProBNP has a place in eliminating the heart as a source of problems (low readings) and also to help monitor treatment in cats with heart disease (high levels should decrease once successful treatment is started).

, The veterinarian takes two views of the cat's chest: one from above and one from the side. This gives a cross reference as to the size and shape of the heart.


Radiographs can be of limited value because one of the common feline heart conditions, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), involves the heart muscle thickening inwardly. Because x-rays only show the heart silhouette, rather than what's going on inside, HCM can be missed with radiography alone.
However, radiographs are useful to look for fluid patterns within the lungs, such as pulmonary edema, which can indicate a failing heart, and also to rule out other conditions such as feline asthma or lung tumors.

, This is the gold standard for identifying and diagnosing heart disease in the cat. A cardiac scan allows the operator to visualize the chamber of the heart, to watch the heart contract, to follow blood flow through the heart, and check the health of the heart valves.


Ultrasound also detects problem such as fluid in the sac around the heart, which can go undetected on x-ray.
Ultrasound also allows the clinician to measure the dimensions of the different heart chambers. In turn this allows her to make calculations which predict if the heart is pumping effectively or struggling.

, These include the following:



Ventricular Wall Thickness: One of the parameters the veterinarian measures is the thickness of the wall of the ventricles. The condition HCM is associated with severe thickening, which fills the space that should fill with blood.

Left Ventricular: Aortic Ratio: Using the ultrasound picture the clinician measures the width of the left ventricle, the main chamber from which blood is pushed round the body. The width of the aorta is also measured and a ratio between the two measurements calculated. The result of this calculation gives a reliable indication of whether the left ventricle is dilated or not. This is significant because in some forms of heart failure the heart muscles become exhausted and baggy, which leads to the pressure of blood within it rising, causing the ventricle to stretch excessively and dilate.

Fractional Shortening: Another useful calculation made during the scan is fractional shortening. Measurements are taken of the width of the ventricle when it is fully relaxed and then fully contracted. This gives a percentage figure which is compared against a table of normal values. Fractional shortening values above or below the normal range indicate a failing heart.

Look for changes to your cat's routine.,
Pay attention if the cat abandons beloved activities.,
Look for difficulty with movement.,
Watch the cat's breathing.,
Pay attention to how the cat reacts when picked up.",How to Tell if a Cat Is in Pain1," Your cat has regular habits that it sticks to every day. This might include what time it gets up, how it greets you when you come home from work, how it asks for food, and how often it goes to the bathroom. Be alert for changes in these habits, especially when they involve the cat becoming more withdrawn.The changes are usually for the worst, such as eating less, not getting up to greet you, hiding away, or toileting outside the litter box.
These changes are not specific for pain, so just because the cat hides away doesn't automatically mean they are in pain, but it does mean something is wrong and you need to look for other signs and clues as to what the problem could be.;
, You should be used to what's normal for your cat, such as which toy it likes to play with and for how long, or which is its favorite sleeping spot and how long it spends there. Changes in favorite activities can be a clear sign that your cat is in pain.For example the cat in pain may find it difficult to rest and so it paces around instead of curling up to sleep. It may repeatedly settle and then get up again. Or perhaps it adopts one posture and then holds it whilst looking stiff and tense. I

, The cat may have difficulty getting up from a sitting or lying position. Once it starts moving be alert for a limp, and look to see which leg the cat is limping on.


Even lack of movement in the ears can signal a problem. The ears would normally move to catch fleeting sounds in the environment. Often a cat in pain has more fixed ears that may well be flattened against its head., This is easily done by fixing on one spot of hairs on its chest and watching them move in and out. A cat usually takes 20-30 breaths a minute, whereas a cat in pain may take rapid shallow breaths. In extreme cases the cat may breath with its mouth open, which is not something cats do normally unless they are extremely hot.

, Does it cry out, wince, or scrabble to get away as if picking it up has hurt it? A change of reaction from what is normal can indicate a problem, especially if other signs are present.

Another good milk replacer is KMR. This is the cat equivalent of infant formula, with the same composition as queen's (mother's) milk. The milk replacer has guidelines as to how much to feed in each meal.


Do not feed cow's milk to the kitten as the lactose is likely to upset the kitten's stomach. If you have no milk replacement and a hungry kitten, offer some cooled boiled water in a dropper or syringe until you can get to the vet clinic or pet store. The water keeps the kitten hydrated and won't upset her tummy., You can purchase this at a vet clinic, a major pet store, or on the Internet. In an emergency use an eyedropper or a small syringe to drip the milk replacement into the kitten's mouth., You do this much as you would a baby: hold the kitten up straight against your shoulder, or place one hand under its belly. Gently pat and rub its back., Before and after each feed, wipe the kitten's bottom with a paper towel or gauze pad soaked in warm water. This stimulates the kitten to go to the toilet, which otherwise she would not do.Hold the kitten over a litter box and use the towel to rub the kitten's genitals and anal region after every meal. Continue to do this until the urination and defecation is over (when nothing else is coming out).


Rub in just one direction–rubbing back and forth is irritating.
Cotton balls or pads are not recommended because they shed., Urine should be pale yellow and odorless, and stools should be yellowish-brown, formed in tiny logs. Dark, pungent urine is a sign of dehydration; green stool may be a sign of over-feeding, while white stool could indicate malabsorption, a serious problem. Call your vet if you have any concerns.


If the kitten does not urinate for 12 hours, take her to the vet's immediately.
Most kittens poop once a day, but individual schedules vary. Take her to the vet's if she hasn't pooped in more than two days., In the first two weeks of life the kitten feeds every two to three hours around the clock. The kitten will tell you she is hungry by crying and wriggling around as if hunting for a nipple. A full kitten often falls asleep while suckling and has a rounded belly. After two weeks, the feeds can be stretched out to to every three to four hours, with a gap of six hours overnight., Neonatal kittens (under two weeks of age) cannot regulate their body temperature and usually keep warm by snuggling up to their mother. You can simulate this situation by keeping them on a heated pad designed for puppies or kittens. Avoid putting them in direct contact with the pad: if the kitten is in direct contact with the heat pad, she might be at risk of either local burns or overheating. However, these pads usually come in a fleece cover so it shouldn't be a problem, except for when you remove the cover for washing, in which case substitute a towel.


As the kitten gets older (over two weeks), she is able to move away from the heat if she gets too hot., If a kitten's body feels cold, you need to warm her up gradually. A kitten is cold if her ears and/or the pads of her feet feel chilly to the touch. Put your finger in her mouth: if it feels cold, the kitten's body temperature is too low, which can be life-threatening. Warm her up slowly by wrapping her in a fleece blanket and holding her next to your body, rubbing her gently with your hands for one to two hours., You can start with this article. Contact a veterinarian for information and suggestions. Your vet can also provide vaccinations against common diseases and deworm the kittens.


Orphaned kittens may be dewormed starting at two weeks, and, depending on their situation, can be vaccinated starting anywhere from two to eight weeks. They may have weaker immune systems because, unlike other kittens, they don't get the antibodies from their mother's milk."

Start to leave out extra kitten food.,
Provide water.,
Put down kitten food for hand-reared kittens.,
Socialize your kittens by introducing them to new things.,
Provide non-clumping litter.,
Keep the cat inside until it has all its shots.,
Give kittens away responsibly.",How to Take Care of Kittens3," If Mom's around, the weaning process (switching from mother's milk to solid food) happens naturally from about four weeks. At this point, Mom gets tired of the kittens chewing on her teats and starts to spend time apart from them. In turn, the hungry kittens investigate food options around them and usually discover Mom's food.


As the kittens start to take mouthfuls of her food, they begin the weaning process., Kittens do not need water until they start weaning, roughly around four weeks old. Any kitten above this age, however, should have constant access to a full water bowl. Change this water whenever it gets dirty (as it tends to if kittens step and/or poop in the bowl)., If you've been bottle-feeding the kittens yourself, the weaning process is similar. It sometimes helps to put some milk-replacer in a saucer and put your finger just beneath the surface to teach the kitten to lap first. Then, it's a matter of mashing up some wet kitten food with the milk-replacer to make a porridge for the kitten to lap. As she gets the hang of that you can thicken up the porridge until she's happily taking most of her calories in solid form., Socialization is crucial during the three-to-nine-week window. From two to three weeks of age, handle the kittens as much as possible every day. Introduce them to different sights and sounds, such as the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, men with beards, children . . . anything you can think of. During this six-week window the kitten is most open to new experiences, and what she encounters now she will accept without question as an adult, making her into a happy, well-adjusted and sociable cat.Use cat toys, balls, string, or other objects to play with them, but don't use objects small enough for them to swallow. (Note that kittens and cats may eat string or yarn if left unsupervised, so only allow this in your interactive play. It's a potential choking hazard.)
Don't teach your kittens that human fingers and hands are toys, or the kitten may continue to bite and scratch them as an adult.

, Choose a spot for the litter box carefully, as once used to it, the kittens will probably continue to use that spot. If litter-training the kittens yourself, simply place the kittens there after each meal, or whenever a kitten starts to crouch and scratch the floor in preparation for pooping. Clean the litter box at least once a day, or the kittens may stop using it.


Choose a box with low sides so it's easy for the kittens to get in and out.Avoid clumping litter, as kittens may eat the clumps, which could potentially harm their digestion., Once your veterinarian allows it, you can let the cat outside to explore. Make sure you keep a close watch on it until you're sure it knows to return home.


Let the kitten outside when it's a bit hungry. Entice it back in by calling its name and showing it food. This will remind your kitten that while outdoors is fun, its final destination will always be your home.

, If selling or giving away the kittens, you should wait until they are at least eight weeks old, but twelve weeks old is preferred. Take them to a vet and start their shots before they leave you. Always follow-up with the new owners to make sure the kitten is getting her shots and is scheduled to be spayed or neutered. Exchange phone numbers with the new owners so you can confirm your kitten is in good hands, or in case the owners want to return her (at least you can help her find another home).

Determine if the cat is acting out of character.,
Take a look at the cat's face and posture.,
Notice changes in vocalization.",How to Tell if a Cat Is in Pain2," A cat that is normally sweet-tempered who becomes irritable may well be in pain. This is a giveaway that there is a problem. The placid cat that suddenly turns aggressive, hisses, and spits rather than let you pet it is probably experiencing pain. Be alert for a friendly cat, that changes character backs away, arches their back, hairs erect, dilated pupils, ears flattened back, hisses and spits. These are all signs of aggression.
Alternatively, you may have a feisty cat who suddenly becomes withdrawn and starts hiding.
Indeed, the cat who stops grooming may be in pain., The signs are subtle but a cat's facial expression can tell you a lot about whether it is stressed or not. This is important because a cat in pain is also a stressed cat, and stress signals can be a vital clue.


Look for a worried or tense expression on the cat. This could include a furrowed brow or a vacant stare. The pupils are likely to be large and dilated, whereas a cat at rest in normal lighting conditions should have slit-shaped pupils.

, Some cats may cry more and vocalize when they are in pain. However, many go the other way and become quiet and withdrawn.


Be aware that purring does not always mean the cat is happy. Purring can comfort the cat and so even a distressed cat may purr to itself in order to feel reassured and a bit better."

Identify where the cat's pain is coming from.,
Make your cat as comfortable as possible.,
Seek professional veterinary treatment for the pain.,
Stop your cat from self harming.",How to Tell if a Cat Is in Pain3," Common causes of pain include dental discomfort, bite wounds, inflamed eyes, sprains, fractures, pancreatitis, cystitis, ear infections, skin infections, bone disease, cancer, and arthritis. Your veterinarian may be able to figure out why your cat is in pain if you can't.


If your cat has had recent surgery, then you will want to be sure it is not in pain while healing. Make sure it is getting the necessary medication to recover without pain.

, Some cats will shy away from affection, almost as though they expect petting to cause them discomfort. However, other cats go the other way and seek extra attention, as if needing reassurance., Ask your vet about a safe but effective pain relief medication. There are a variety of these that can be prescribed to meet your cat's pain management needs.


In addition to pain management, your veterinarian should be treating the underlying cause of the pain. If your vet can't find the source, go to another vet for a second opinion.
Never treat the pain at home with human drugs. Cats metabolize drugs very differently to people and the medication we have in our medicine cabinets can be toxic to cats.

, A cat with a low grade or nagging pain, may try to distract or comfort itself by excessive licking, which results in broken hairs and a moth-eaten look to its coat. Some cats may do themselves actual harm and bite at an area that is painful, as if they perceive their is something attacking their body and they wish to get rid of it.


If this is the case consult with your vet about ways to stop the cat from licking or biting itself. One solution is to put a cone on the cat until the pain is eliminated.
Sometimes the cat will lick the area that is painful, for example a sore joint, other times it will lick an area that is not the source of pain but is just soothing itself. In these cases the cat may lick an easy to get to spot, such as a paw or its belly."

, While your cat is taking Ronidazole, you should protect yourself from contact with its urine and feces. This means that you should wear gloves while cleaning its feces. You should also double bag your cat's waste and used litter.Place the bags of waste directly into your outdoor trashcan.
Continue to wear gloves and double bag waste for three days after your cat finishes its course of medication.

, Those who are pregnant should not handle Ronidazole at all, even with gloves on. It has the risk of being toxic to embryos, so it should be avoided.Instead, find someone else in your family to give the cat its medication, and to clean out the cat's litter box.

, If one of your cats is found to have Trichomoniasis and others in your household are not, then the infected cat should be kept isolated. Trichomoniasis is spread via feces or oral contact, so other cats are likely to be infected if they are continually exposed to the infected cat.If one of your cats is infected, all of your cats should be tested for the parasite. It is important to have all infected cats in a household treated.

Look for patches of hair loss on your cat.,
Identify any scaly patches on your cat's face, paws or ears.,
Watch out for signs of infection in multiple cats.,
Keep an eye out for skin lesions on your own skin.,
See a vet to confirm the presence of ringworm.",How to Recognize and Treat Ringworm in Cats1," The ringworm fungus grows around hair shafts and migrates downward into the hair follicles. This leads to inflammation and causes the hair to shed, leaving a patch of bald, flaky skin behind.


These bald areas are often scaly or crusty, and may be reddened and inflamed. Typically, the areas are itchy and the cat may scratch or lick at them.
Sometimes the areas of hair loss appear moist or sticky caused by a secondary bacterial infection as a result of inflammation or scratching.;
, Classic places for infection are the cat's face, muzzle, ears, and front paws. The fur on the face may have a moth-eaten appearance, with mottled areas of fur loss.


On the paws, infection is often around the nail bed, so individual toes may be bald with scaling skin around the nail.
The distribution of lesions on the paws and face is because cats most commonly catch infection while investigating the environment: sniffing or pawing at things.

, Typically, cats living closely together, such as a litter of kittens in a rescue shelter, infect one another and several animals with itchy bald patches should raise an immediate suspicion of ringworm., Another sign of ringworm is if you – the cat's owner – develop skin lesions. In people these are typically itchy, raised red and inflamed patches of skin that are dry and scaly.


These lesions are often circular and resemble a ring, or a pattern of rings. Sometimes the outer border is bumpy around a scaly center.
Places that come into contact with the cat are most likely to be infected, thus your hands from stroking the cat, or your lap from holding her, are typical for infection.

, If your cat shows signs of ringworm, or you have suspicious lesions on your own skin, get your cat checked by a veterinarian.


Ringworm can mimic a number of conditions such as skin infections, allergic skin disease, and parasitic skin disease, therefore reaching a firm diagnosis involves examining plucked hairs under the microscope to look for fungal hyphae along the hair shaft.
The vet may also check the cat under an ultraviolet light to look for the characteristic apple-green fluorescence given off by some ringworm species. The vet may also do a fungal culture, where the fungus is grown from sample coat brushings from the cat.

Ask the breeder or shelter for a blanket that smells like the kitten's mother and siblings.,
Ask what kind of food the kitten's been eating.,
Provide water.,
Introduce the kitten to your house slowly.,
Give the kitten as much attention as you can.,
Keep the kitten and your possessions safe.,
Plan a vet visit.",How to Take Care of Kittens4," These smells help to give the kitten comfort while she settles into her new home., Provide this for the first few days so that you don't make too many changes at once.When the kitten has settled in, this is your chance to change her food to one of your choosing, though do it gradually: replace a small quantity of her former food with the new food, increasing the amount slowly over the course of a week.If the kitten is eating dry kibble, leave a bowl out all day. If she is eating wet food, give her small meals every six hours.Continue to feed kitten food, not adult cat food, until one year of age., Kittens above four weeks of age need water, so clean water should always be available.


Cats tend to be more interested in water that is not next to their food bowl. Encourage drinking by placing water bowls in different spots through the house.

, Expose the kitten to just one room initially: the whole house will be too overwhelming on the first day. Set up a bed (preferably one that has sides and a roof so the kitten feels safe in a nest), with food and water in one corner of the room, and a litter tray in the opposite corner. Show the kitten where her facilities are, and then leave her to rest. It's been a big day for the little kitten so let her adjust and sleep for a few hours., Spend as much time as possible grooming, playing, fussing and interacting with the kitten. This helps her to grow into a well-socialized, friendly adult., Keep electrical cords and devices out of the kitten's reach to avoid her chewing on them. Child locks may be a wise investment for low cabinets if you have a particularly inquisitive kitten.

, At nine weeks old the kitten can have her first vaccination. This is the ideal time for a vet to examine her, worm her and start vaccinations. The basic kitten vaccine includes protection against cat flu and infectious enteritis. There is also the option to vaccinate against feline leukemia."

Follow the directions for treatment.,
Give your cat its medication.,
Give the medication for as long as prescribed.",How to Give Ronidazole to Cats with Trichomoniasis2," With this medication it is important to follow your veterinarian's instructions precisely. The dosage prescribed should be followed exactly and you should read the label carefully.Discuss the medication with your veterinarian when it is prescribed and feel free to call the veterinary office for clarification if need be. It is important to give your cat the right amount of this medication, as giving it too much can cause severe side effects.

, There are a variety of ways you can get a cat to take medication, even when it needs to be given in pill form. In most cases you will need to restrain the cat, open the cat's mouth, and then get it to swallow its pill.


There are also other techniques, including using a pill shooter, hiding pills in food, and using a pill pocket, which is a treat that is designed to disguise a pill inside of it.

, It is important to give your cat its whole prescription of Ronidazole so that the infection can be totally eliminated. In most cases, your cat will need to take a 14 day course of treatment.Even if your cat appears to be recovered or on the mend, you should continue treatment for as long as prescribed.

Watch for improvements to your cat's condition.,
Manage moderate side effects.,
Contact your veterinarian if your cat has neurological side effects.,
Keep an eye out for relapse.",How to Give Ronidazole to Cats with Trichomoniasis3," If your cat has taken its full course of treatment and its condition has not improved at all, then you should call your veterinarian and request a follow-up appointment. If your cat's condition has improved, even slightly, but has not been totally cleared up, you may just need to wait longer for the medication to do its job.The symptoms of Trichomoniasis tend to get more severe, then improve, and then get more severe again over the course of the illness. This may give the impression that the condition is improving even when it is not.It can take Ronidazole several weeks to fully eradicate a Trichomoniasis infection.

, Ronidazole can cause a variety of side effects in cats. These include drowsiness, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. If your cat has any of these side effects, they will need a little extra care.Make sure that your cat has a comfortable place to rest and has easy access to a litter box. Your should also feed them easy to digest treats if they are hesitant to eat their normal diet. Giving your cat a little extra attention and affection is a good idea too.
If your cat has any of these side effects, you should contact your veterinarian and ask them about possible treatments for the side effects.

, Neurological side effects can include the cat being uncoordinated, having rapid movement of the eyes, having seizures, tilting its head unnaturally, having a slow heart rate, or having unusual rigidity or stiffness of its body. If your cat has any of these problems, you should get it veterinary care immediately., Relapse is common for cases of Trichomoniasis, even if it appears that the infection has been eliminated with Ronidazole. If your cat appears fine after initial treatment, but symptoms appear again some time later, then treatment may need to be repeated.Even with the risk of relapse, it is important not to increase the dosage given to your cat in hopes of killing off the parasite.

"
"
Look for diarrhea.,
Look for signs of illness in young cats.,
Take your cat to be seen by a veterinarian.",How to Give Ronidazole to Cats with Trichomoniasis4," Trichomoniasis is a parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract and causes diarrhea in cats. In many cases, this diarrhea may be uncontrollable, meaning your cat cannot make it to a litter box, or it causes the cat to go to the bathroom more frequently. The diarrhea may also include blood or mucus.If your cat has diarrhea that does not clear up quickly, no matter what the cause is, then it should be seen by a veterinarian. Diarrhea that continues for more than a day or two can be life threatening to a cat.

, While Trichomoniasis can occur in any aged cat, it is more likely to occur in cats that are under a year old. If you have a young cat that has severe diarrhea, you should have it seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible.Diarrhea can be a very serious health problem for very young cats in particular. Even one day of serious diarrhea can threaten a kitten's life.

, If you suspect that your cat has Trichomoniasis, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. Tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms and when they started, and allow your veterinarian to do a thorough examination of your cat. If your veterinarian suspects Trichomoniasis, they will then test your cat's feces to look for the parasite.


Tests that your veterinarian may use for diagnosis may include a saline diluted direct fecal smear, inoculation into a testing pouch, or DNA extraction and testing.Testing your cat's feces will take some time.

Put the cat on antibiotics.,
Give the cat an antifungal medication.,
Implement environmental controls.,
Keep the cat in one room.,
Clip the cat's coat.,
Shampoo the cat.,
Find a suitable shampoo.,
Understand the prognosis.",How to Recognize and Treat Ringworm in Cats2," Griseofulvin is an antibiotic which, rather than killing ringworm, stops it from growing. Griseofulvin acts by disrupting the fungi's cell division and preventing it from multiplying, thus putting it into an inactive state. The cat will need to be on these antibiotics for several weeks.


Griseofulvin is more effective if given with a fat, such as a knob of butter, because this enhances absorption into the blood stream. The suggested dose is 50mg/kg given once a day for up to 70 days (and for at least 2 weeks after the skin lesions have resolved). This is equivalent to a 5 kg cat taking half a 500mg tablet once a day.Griseofulvin should not be given to pregnant cats because it causes deformities in the kittens in the womb. Griseofulvin should not be handled by pregnant women.
As a precaution, it is best to wear disposable gloves if cutting the tablets up. Although griseofulvin is not damaging to healthy people, it is sensible to avoid accidental ingestion.

, Ketoconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent which acts by inhibiting the synthesis of the fungal cell walls, which makes it leaky and causes the cell's contents to leak out.


The recommended dose is 5 to 10mg/kg by mouth, 2 or 3 times daily after food. Thus a 5 kg cat requires 25 to 50mg per dose. A 500mg/ 5ml oral suspension is available, which means an average-sized cat needs between 0.25 to 0.5ml by mouth, 2 or 3 times a day.
Ketoconazole has a broader spectrum of activity than griseofulvin; as well as treating ringworm, it can be used to treat aspergillosis, candidiasis (thrush infection), cryptococcus, and coccidiomycosis infections (these are a variety of fungal or single celled organism that are sensitive to ketoconazole).
As with griseofulvin, treatment is for lengthy period of time, and is often continued until 2 negative fungal cultures taken 3 weeks apart have been obtained., While medical treatment is initiated and ongoing, it is important to decrease the amount of environmental contamination with fungal spores. This helps to ensure that once the cat is cleared of ringworm, she doesn't then re-infect herself, or that the environment does not act as a reservoir of infection for you, the owner.

, Everywhere the cat goes she sheds dander and hair, which are potential sources of ringworm infection. Ideally you should keep the pet confined to one room so as to minimize the spread of infection.


Remove all the soft furnishings except for the cat's bed, since these are more difficult to clean. The cat's bed should be washed by itself, in a washing machine on a hot wash with detergent. (There is minimal risk of further washes being contaminated). Where possible, leave the bed to dry in bright sunshine.
The room should be cleaned and disinfected with a 1:10 dilution of household bleach in water. This means that you add 100ml of bleach to each 900ml of water, to make up a stock cleaning solution. In an ideal world, all hard surfaces in the room would be cleaned with dilute bleach daily to minimize build-up of contamination.
The room should also be vacuumed and the vacuum bag disposed of by incineration.

, The ringworm fungus grows down hair shafts. To give ringworm less chance to colonize the cat's coat, and also ensure that there is less shedding of infected hairs, it is a good idea to clip the cat's coat short.


This is best done with scissors (clippers can damage the skin and encourage fungal colonization) but it requires a co-operative cat. Keep the scissor blades parallel to the surface of the skin and cut at 90 degrees to the hair shafts. Trim away the hair as close to the skin as possible without cutting or nicking the skin.
Wear a disposable plastic apron and gloves while clipping the cat, and throw these away afterwards. Collect the clippings in a plastic bag and dispose of by burning if possible. If this is not possible, double wrap them in another plastic bag and dispose of in the garbage. Throw away any grooming equipment used on the infected cat, or thoroughly disinfect it with dilute bleach.
If the cat objects to being clipped then speak to your veterinary clinic who will be happy to sedate the animal and professionally clip him.

, Washing the cat with an appropriate shampoo can help clean the hair follicles, and reduce the shedding of infected hairs and dander. This should be done for both clipped and unclipped cats.


Twice weekly shampooing for 6-10 weeks is recommended as a back up to antifungal medications. The shampooing is not so much to kill the fungus (although this is a bonus if a medicated shampoo is used) but to decrease environmental contamination.
With this in mind, if a treatment shampoo is not available, any mild shampoo suitable for use on the cat is acceptable as an alternative.

, If you choose to use a treatment shampoo, you should look for one of the following:



Chlorhexidine: A suitable topical treatment is a solution of chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic with antifungal properties. This is diluted in water (an appropriate dilution is 5ml of chlorhexidine to 1 liter of water) and sponged over the cat and allowed to air dry.

Malaseb shampoo: Malaseb shampoo contains 2% chlorhexidine plus 2% miconazole (an antifungal agent). Malaseb is used as a shampoo and so the coat and skin should be thoroughly wet, the shampoo lathered on and left in contact with the skin for 10 minutes, and then rinsed thoroughly.

Enilconazole: Enilconazole is an antifungal agent that is applied externally to the skin and can be used on pregnant cats and young kittens. One part enilconazole is diluted in 50 parts of water to produce a 0.2% solution. This is then sponged over the cat every 3 days.

, Healthy cats can be expected to self-cure in around 2 to 3 months. During this time, however, they are a source of infection for others and so it is best to keep them in isolation.


For those cats that show significant clinical signs (such as patchy hair loss, scaling, and itchiness), clearing that infection is a lengthy and time-consuming process that involves both oral medications and topical treatments.

Remove debris from your cat’s paw.,
Treat torn nails.,
Clean and bandage soft tissue wounds.",How to Treat a Limping Cat1," If you found debris in your cat’s paw, you can remove it by gently wiping the paw with a damp washcloth. Use tweezers to remove debris lodged in the paw, like a splinter. Apply a cat-friendly antiseptic after removing the splinter., A torn nail is painful for your cat. Use a pet nail trimmer to clip the nail at the level of the tear. If the tear is near the base of the nail, you should have a vet remove the torn nail. Once you remove the torn nail, wash the area with soap and warm water. Apply a bandage if the nail is bleeding., A minor cut or laceration on your cat’s leg or paw can cause it to limp. If there is bleeding, apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or sterile gauze for 5-10 minutes. Then gently clean the wound with water or an antiseptic solution and apply a bandage.If the cut is long or deep, or if your cat has a puncture wound, you should take your cat to the vet.

Look for broken bones and fractures.,
Determine if your cat has an infected wound.,
Watch for signs of arthritis.",How to Treat a Limping Cat2," Your cat might be limping because it broke or fractured a bone. If you suspect your cat has broken a bone, take it to the vet immediately. Cats may try to hide their pain, so it is important to recognize signs of broken bones in cats such as:Moaning, growling, howling, or crying if touched
Inability to walk
Refusing to eat or groom itself
Swelling or bruising at the site of injury

, An infected wound can prevent your cat from walking, cause stiffness in its gait, and affect its eating and grooming habits. Gently examine your cat’s legs and paws for lacerations, cuts, scrapes, and bites from other animals. Redness, swelling, or discharge from the wound are signs of infection. Take your cat to the vet if you notice these symptoms., If your limping cat exhibits a decrease in activity, changes in litterbox habits, or a hesitancy to run, jump, or climb stairs, it could be a sign of arthritis. If you notice these signs, you should take your cat to the veterinarian for an examination and long-term treatment plan."

Limit your cat’s activity.",How to Treat a Limping Cat3," If you cannot determine the cause of your cat’s limping, or if your cat appears to have a more serious medical problem, make an appointment with your vet. It is important that you seek medical attention for your cat as soon as possible to prevent additional complications., If debris is not what’s causing your cat to limp, you will need to have a vet do a full evaluation. Ask the vet to physically examine your cat. If the vet cannot determine the cause from the initial examination, they will order additional tests. Some common tests include:X-rays
Biopsies
Blood tests for infectious or immune-related diseases
Collection and testing of joint fluid

, Once your vet determines what is causing your cat to limp, they will give you a list of recommendations for the rehabilitation and recovery of your cat. It is important that you follow these instructions closely to ensure your cat enjoys a speedy recovery. Common treatments include:Medication
Surgery
Limitation of activity
Cage rest

, If your cat has experienced an injury, your vet will suggest you limit the cat’s exercise and activity level. You can do this by keeping your cat in a crate, making sure your cat has access to a litter box with low sides, and giving your cat food and water in low bowls. You should also not let your cat go outdoors while it is healing."

Look for signs of limping.,
Understand the causes of cat limping.,
Gently examine your cat’s legs, paws, and nails.",How to Treat a Limping Cat4," You should watch your cat for signs of limping, which can be associated with underlying medical issues. Some common symptoms of limping include:Difficulty walking
Inability or unwillingness to put weight on a leg
Sitting with a leg off the ground
Stiff gait
Shifting weight from one leg to another
Difficulty jumping
Taking shorter steps with one leg
Overall decrease in activity level
Swelling of the joints

, Cats limp for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it can be as simple as a splinter lodged in a paw, while other times a more serious underlying medical issue is causing the cat to limp. Some common causes of cat limping include:Soft tissue damage
Nail injuries
Foot injuries
Infections
Abscesses
Broken bones
Dislocated bones
Back injuries
Tick, spider, and snake bites
Arthritis

, If your cat has been injured, it can cause limping. Gently check your cat’s paws and legs for injuries and debris. Make sure you also examine its nails to make sure one has not been torn. Do not pull on the affected paw or leg, as this can cause additional damage to the injured limb."

Have your cat undergo acupuncture.,
Discuss the option of electrotherapy.,
Identify any physical difficulties that need treatment.,
Discuss treatment options with a veterinarian.,
Contact a physical therapist.",How to Treat a Cat with Physical Therapy," Take your cat in to see a veterinary physical therapist. The therapist will look at the cat's veterinary history and assess the cat's health. Once they have all of the information, the therapist will decide what, if any, type of physical therapy will help your cat the most.In most cases, you will be referred to a veterinary physical therapist by your primary care veterinarian.;
, One of the most effective and easiest types of physical therapy that can be used on cats are hot or cold treatments. By applying heat or cold to an injury, pain and swelling can be relieved.Your veterinary physical therapist will tell you whether to apply heat or cold to the injury. This is usually dependent on whether there is swelling on the injury. In most cases, cold will be applied to injuries that are swollen.
Typically, heat or cold are applied for only about 20 minutes several times a day.
A hot water bottle can be great for applying either hot or cold to an injury.

, Your physical therapist may suggest specific types of movement that will help your cat to heal and get full range of movement back. If your cat hasn't moved recently, your therapist might suggest passive rehabilitation. With passive rehabilitation, the joints will be manually moved without pressure placed on them.This type of rehabilitation improves the function of your cats joints and it can increase their muscle mass.

, If your cat has had an injury or disability and is having difficulty walking, then your animal physical therapist may suggest active rehabilitation. With active rehabilitation, the therapist will help your cat to regain its ability to move on its own using a variety of exercises that use the cat's own body weight. Exercises that are considered active rehabilitation include:Ball exercises
Balance boards
Treadmills

, While it is common knowledge that most cats do not want any contact with water, hydrotherapy can be used on them to increase their mobility. Hydrotherapy on cats usually entails the cat walking on a treadmill that is submerged a few inches underwater. This allows the cat to begin walking on an injured leg or hip more easily.There is some debate about whether hydrotherapy causes too much stress for cats. If your cat is extremely resistant to getting wet, then it may have a hard time adjusting to this type of therapy.

, Acupuncture can be a great treatment option for cats with mobility issues or for those that are recovering from trauma. Acupuncture invigorates the immune system by stimulating areas of the body that contain lots of vessels and nerves, which can help to speed up recovery and to minimize pain and discomfort.


This process requires very specific knowledge about acupuncture points on animals. Thus, it should only be done by a licensed animal acupuncturist.
You may be able to get a referral to a licensed animal acupuncturist through your veterinarian if they know of one in your area. If not, find a licensed animal acupuncturist by searching the websites of animal acupuncture professional associations, such as the American Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture.

, Talk to your veterinarian about whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation might help your cat. The use of electrotherapy can help with pain management and muscle movement, as the electrical pulses used increase movement by contracting muscles and they also stimulate cell activity that can minimize pain.There are three types of electrical stimulation used on cats. One type, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, is used to manage pain. Another type, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, is useful only for muscle rehabilitation. The last type, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, can help with both pain and muscle rehabilitation.

, There are a wide variety of injuries and disabilities that can be helped with physical therapy. If your cat has an old existing injury or a physical disability that it was born with, consider getting it treatment so that any pain or discomfort it has can be minimized. Some conditions that may be helped with physical therapy include:Surgical recovery
Obesity
Arthritis
Orthopedic conditions (including I-II MPL, early partial CCL rupture, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia)
Non-operable neurological conditions (FCE)
Amputation recovery
Non-healing wounds
Muscle wasting (due to Cushings disease or chemotherapy for example)
Limited movement due to old age

, Your veterinarian may have a variety of suggestions for treatment of an injury or illness. Among these may be physical therapy, as it can help speed recovery and eliminate pain and discomfort.Ask your veterinarian about the specific type of therapy they would suggest and ask any questions you have about your cat's potential for recovery.
In most cases, your regular veterinarian will not be able to do intensive physical therapy on your cat. However, they may be able to suggest some simple things you can do to minimize your cat's discomfort, such as applying ice or heat to an injury. , Your veterinarian should give you a referral to a qualified physical therapist that works on cats. Make an appointment and then bring your cat in for its appointment.


If there is not a veterinary physical therapist in your area, you may need to travel to get your cat this kind of care.
If you have not gotten a referral, do an online search for veterinary physical therapists in your area. Make sure that those that you consider have a veterinary medicine degree from an accredited institution and that they have experience treating cats.

Get a test culture done to identify and use effective antibiotics.,
Treat your cat with broad spectrum antibiotics if a culture is not possible.,
Put your cat on a urinary health diet.,
Beware of stones when acidifying your cat's urine.,
Use glucosamine to stimulate the cat's GAG layer.",How to Treat a Cat's UTI1," The gold standard when treating a UTI with antibiotics is to perform a test culture to analyze antibiotic sensitivity. Antibiotics are a family of drugs that either inhibit the growth of bacteria or kill them, depending on the type of antibiotic.


A test culture tells your vet exactly what bug is present, and which antibiotics are effective against it.
Using targeted antibiosis reduces the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance in bacteria and is the best way to treat an infection.
However, it is not always possible to get a large enough urine sample to culture, or else the cost of culture may be prohibitive.
Another reason a culture may not be possible is if this is the cat's first episode of UTI and needs immediate treatment, since it may take a week to get culture results back.
It is especially important to culture the urine if the cat has recurrent UTIs. In this case, it is likely that the cat either has a mixed infection where only some of the infection is being killed, or the infection is resistant to the antibiotic being used.;
, Broad spectrum antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria.


If a cat has never had a urinary infection before, then it is acceptable to put him on a course of broad spectrum antibiotics that kill a wide range of bacteria commonly found in urine.
Typically, these antibiotics are penicillins, such as amoxicillin, clavulinic acid, cephalosporins, or sulphonamides.
A cat weighting less than 6kg commonly will normally get 50mg of penicillin by mouth twice daily.

, There are prescription urinary health diets available for cats, such as Hills CD, or Purina UR. These diets act in a number of ways to promote your cat's urinary health.


Because they contain a lesser amount of minerals such as phosphate and magnesium, they can reduce the likelihood of crystals forming in your cat's urine.
These diets also manipulate the pH (how acid or alkaline the urine is) of your cat's urine for optimal urinary health.
They usually aim for a mildly acidic urine – pH 6.2-6.4 (which coincidentally is the same pH that a cat's urine has if he lives exclusively off mice).
This environment is hostile to most bacteria, and although it is unlikely that a diet alone will get rid of a UTI, it could help reduce the chances of bacteria surviving in the bladder.

, As a general rule, bacteria do not like acid urine, thus acidifying the urine acts as a natural disinfectant. However, this type of treatment is best done under veterinary supervision.


Although the most common bladder crystals and stones (struvite) grow in alkaline conditions, there are other less common stones (oxalate) that flourish in acid conditions.
Certain breeds, such as Burmese cats, are more likely to grow oxalate stones.
This means you could cure one problem (infection) only to create another one in the form of an oxalate bladder stone.

, The bladder produces a layer of mucus-like material that acts like a bandage to protective the lining from noxious substances in urine.


When a cat has a UTI, this glycosaminoglycan or ""GAG"" layer becomes thinner, exposing the bladder lining to irritation.
Neutraceuticals such as glucosamine, may help to replenish this GAG layer and make the cat more comfortable.
Although research into the benefits of glucosamine is inconclusive, there are several over the counter preparations available, such as ""Feliway Cystease"" that contain glucosamine and tryptophan. Each capsule contains 125mg N-acetylglucosamine and the dose is one capsule twice a day.
If your cat won't take capsules, then an injection containing acetylglucosamine is available through your veterinarian. This treatment is meant to treat arthritis in dogs, and treatment of bladder inflammation is off-label. A typical dose is 0.15 milliliters (0.0051  fl oz) by injection once a week for 4 weeks, followed by a regular monthly injection.

"
Understand age's effect on UTI risk.,
Encourage your cat to drink to flush his bladder.,
Feed your cat cranberry capsules or ascorbic acid to acidify urine.,
Try homeopathic remedies.",How to Treat a Cat's UTI2," As your cat ages, they will have an increasing level of susceptibility to UTI infection. This is due to changes in your cat's urinary tract and liver function.


Young cats under 7 years of age have a low risk of urinary infections. This is because they are excellent at concentrating their urine, and strong urine is a natural disinfectant that inhibits bacterial growth.

If you see signs of blood in a young cat's urine, it is likely that he has a problem not caused by infection, but by crystals or stones that have irritated the bladder lining.
There is a distinct risk that crystals will clump together and form a blockage in the urethra – the tube the cat urinates out of. If this happens, it is an emergency that needs immediate veterinary attention.


Older cats over 7 years of age are at an increased risk of infection. Older cats have a reduced ability to concentrate urine, and as the cat ages he is quite likely to produce dilute urine because of a reduction in kidney function.

This weak urine is not a very potent disinfectant and urinary infections become more likely. Again, it is important to treat these infections before they ascend into the kidney and cause significant damage leading to scar tissue formation.



, Although dilute urine is risk factor for UTI, once your cat has a UTI, regular, steady urination will help him flush his bladder out.


Bacteria produce waste products and chemicals that can irritate the bladder lining, causing inflammation.
Regular hydration can dilute these factors and limit the amount of time they spend in contact with the bladder wall, helping reduce inflammation and soreness.
To increase your cat's water intake, switch him form a dry to a wet food. This automatically increases the amount of fluid he takes in.
Also, provide plenty of wide drinking bowls. Cats seem to prefer drinking from wide containers where their whiskers don't touch the side.
Some cats will drink more if provided with flowing water such as that from a cat drinking fountain.
Other cats dislike the chlorine and chemicals in tap water and are much happier when offered mineral water to drink.

, Either cranberry capsules or ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) can naturally acidify your cat's urine.


The dose of cranberry capsules is 250mg twice a day by mouth, while the dosage for vitamin C is 250mg once a day.
Again, do not be tempted to increase the amounts of these supplements, because there is a risk of reducing the urinary pH too much, and the extreme acidity could irritate the bladder lining.

, There is no substantiated evidence that the following remedies work, but some homeopathic veterinarians recommend infusions of dandelion, parsley, bearberry, or watercress.


To prepare the infusion you add one teaspoon of dried herb to one cup of previously boiled water.
Let it stand for 20 minutes and then strain.
Administer 2 teaspoons twice daily with food for a week. The infusion should be made fresh every 2 days.

Experiment with homeopathic remedies.",How to Treat Bacterial Cystitis in Cats," The signs that a cat has a bladder problem, and possibly bacterial cystitis, include:


Constant squatting to urinate, but only producing small volumes of urine with each attempt.
Blood stains in the cat litter or blood in the urine.
Discomfort when passing urine, often manifested as growling or swishing the tail.
Urinary accidents, such that a well-trained cat starts leaving puddles in inappropriate places.
A strange smell to the urine. Sometimes infected urine loses its recognizable urine smell and becomes ""fishy"" smelling.;
, There are relatively few ways the bladder can respond to problems and so there is a significant overlap in symptoms between bacterial urinary infection and bladder stones, polyps, cancer, and idiopathic cystitis (a neurologically driven form of cystitis).


Therefore, if a cat shows any signs of urinary discomfort it is important to get her checked out by a veterinarian. The vet can then decide what further action is necessary in order to determine the nature of the problem.

, Investigations to confirm a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include:



Urine culture: This can give a definitive answer as to whether infection is present or not.

Urine sediment analysis: A urine sample is centrifuged to concentrate the sediment, which is then examined under a microscope. This helps identify crystals in the urine which could chaff the bladder lining and cause inflammation.

Radiography: This involves taking x-rays of the urinary tract to look for bladder stones and any abnormalities of the bladder shape, size, or position.

Ultrasound: This test is the gold standard test for identifying bladder infections because it is sensitive at detecting bladder stones, and gives a picture of the thickness of the bladder wall, and can provide images of abnormalities such as bladder polyps or cancer.

, Antibiotics belong to a family of drugs which either kill bacteria or inhibit their growth. There are many different types of bacteria and each is sensitive (i.e. their growth is inhibited or the bacteria are killed) by different antibiotics.


When using antibiotics, the gold standard is to culture the urine to find exactly which antibiotic the bacteria are sensitive to.
Targeted use of antibiotics in this way helps decrease the likelihood of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.

, At first presentation of a cat with no previous history of bacterial cystitis, it is acceptable to use a broad spectrum antibiotic and give treatment for 10-14 days.


The urine will usually be cultured seven days into the treatment, and if the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic use, the vet will recommend switching antibiotics at that point.

, The broad spectrum antibiotics used in first presentation cases of bacterial cystitis are typically the potentiated penicillins such as amoxicillin–clavulinc acid, the cephalosporins, or potentiated sulphonamides.


Amoxicillins are bactericidal (kill bacteria) and act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. A cat weighing less than 6 kg commonly takes 50 mg of potentiated penicillin by mouth twice daily.
A course of 10-14 days duration is ideal to ensure all the bacteria are killed off, thus reducing the chance of bacterial resistance developing.
It is particularly helpful to give the evening dose just before bedtime, so that the antibiotic sits in the bladder overnight and has maximum contact with the bacteria.

, If the cat has repeat episodes of cystitis, this is a sign that further investigation is needed.


Tests such as a urine culture, sediment exam, and a bladder ultrasound can rule out underlying weakness that is allowing bacteria to take advantage (such as a bladder stone damaging the bladder wall) and allow the vet to identify the correct antibiotic.
Culture is especially important if the cat has previously received antibiotics. In this case the cat may have a mixed infection where only some bacteria are killed, or the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic used previously.

, If a bacteria is cultured that is resistant to the previous antibiotic, then the choice of antibiotic should be dictated by the results of the culture and by sensitivity testing.


A minimum of a 2 week course should be given, and 7 days into this course, the urine culture should be repeated. If the infection is still present at this point, a further 2 weeks of antibiotics is usually prescribed, with a repeat culture after 7 days.
The aim is to treat with antibiotics for a full 7 days after a negative culture. Sometimes this may equate to a 4-6 week antibiotic course.

, Bacteria produce toxins and waste products that irritate the bladder lining, resulting in inflammation. Encouraging the cat to drink more water helps to dilute these substances and decreases the amount of time they spend in contact with the bladder (because the cat urinates more often) which helps to reduce soreness and inflammation.


Simple things like changing the cat's diet from dry to wet food can help to increase water intake. Cats also prefer to drink from wide containers where their whiskers don't touch the sides.
Some cats particularly like running water so provide a pet drinking fountain. Chlorine and other chemicals in tap water inhibit some animals from drinking so consider switching to mineral water.

, There are several prescription diets available which optimize urinary health. Examples include Purina UR and Hills CD diets. These act by providing the optimum urinary pH (slightly acid, 6.2-6.4) which bacteria hate.


These diets are also low in minerals, such as magnesium and phosphate, which may chaff the bladder and cause soreness.

, If your cat refuses to eat a prescription diet you can help acidify the urine by the addition of neutraceuticals (food supplements with a pharmaceutical like benefit).


Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or cranberry capsules are supplements that have such an action. The dose of vitamin C is 250 mg once a day and cranberry capsules are 250 mg twice a day, by mouth.
Do not exceed the recommended dose because making the urine too acidic also irritates the bladder lining.

, The bladder should protect itself from noxious bacterial toxins by producing a mucus-like bandage across the lining. However, in the course of bacterial cystitis this glycosaminoglycan or ""GAG"" layer gets damaged and less effective.


There is anecdotal evidence that neutraceuticals such as glucosamine help the GAG layer to repair itself and keep the cat more comfortable. Research is inconclusive, but over the counter products, such as ""Feliway Cystease"" is unlikely to do harm.
Cystease contains both tryptophan and glucosamine. Tryptophan helps to decrease stress in anxious cats, and stress is a factor in causing bladder inflammation. The dose is one capsule twice a day and each capsule contains 125mg N-acetyl glucosamine.

, An injection containing acetylglucosamine is available from your veterinarian for cats that won't take oral meds. The treatment, Cartrophen injection, is a licensed arthritis treatment for dogs - its use for cystitis in cats is off-label.


A typical dose is 0.15 ml by injection once a week for 4 weeks, then a monthly injection to maintain optimal bladder health.

, Homeopathy is subject to much debate as to its efficacy. However, if you are a believer, homeopathic veterinarians recommend infusions of parsley, dandelion, watercress, or bearberry.


Prepare the infusion by adding one teaspoon of the dried herb to one cup of previously boiled water. Let it stand for 20 minutes and then strain.
Give the cat 2 teaspoons twice daily with food for a week. The infusion must be made fresh every 2 days.

Understand the causes of cardiomyopathy.",How to Treat Cardiomyopathy in Cats," The early signs are easy to miss, as most cats do not exercise and run around in the same way as dogs do. The earliest clues are usually related to lack of endurance.Notice if your cat is sleeping more than usual. Instead of just a morning and afternoon nap, it is sleeping all day long?
Does your cat avoid activities that it used to enjoy, such as playing with a string or laser pointer? This could be a sign that it is having some health problems.;
, As heart disease becomes more advanced, and the cat enters heart failure, the signs can include rapid shallow breathing, breathing through an open mouth, fainting, or staggering. Breathing through an open mouth is always a warning sign if your cat is doing it when they have not been active recently.If you witness these symptoms you should take your cat in for a vet check.

, In more serious cases, the cat can throw a blood clot, which then lodges in the main artery to the back legs. This causes pain, hind leg weakness, and cold back paws. In response to the pain, your cat may meow or make some other noise that expresses its discomfort.If your cat is experiencing these symptoms, take it to the veterinarian immediately. Call the veterinary clinic on the way there so that they can prepare for your arrival.

, Early symptoms of cardiomyopathy are hard to spot, which is why regular vet checkups are important. The vet may be able to spot changes in your cat's heart sounds and rate, which indicate there is a problem.


For cats over the age of 12 years, a twice yearly check up is advisable to spot problems such as cardiomyopathy as quickly as possible.

, Your vet will perform a physical examination to look for evidence of underlying health problems, such as overactive thyroid glands. They will also listen carefully to the heart, paying attention not just to the heart sounds (whether there is a murmur or not) but the rate and rhythm. A rapid, galloping heart rate is a sign of heart disease. This is a sign that the heart is having to work harder than it should to pump blood throughout the body.

, Allow your veterinarian to do blood tests or ultrasound tests so that he or she can give you a definitive diagnosis. Screening blood tests may be necessary to check for underlying problems, which then need correction. A definitive diagnosis of cardiomyopathy is made on an ultrasound scan of the heart, called an echocardiogram.An ultrasound allows both the thickness of the heart wall to be measured and the contraction strength of the heart to be gauged.

, Any underlying disease that is pushing the cat into heart failure needs to be addressed. This may mean treating overactive thyroid glands to bring the blood thyroid levels back to normal, or using drugs to reduce high blood pressure., The exact drug selected and combination of drugs will be decided by your veterinarian. The decision will be made based on the type of heart disease (DCM or HCM) that your cat has and how severe the problem is. In the case of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), supplementing your cat's diet with taurine can help its heart, provided the heart isn't in full failure. For hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), drugs are used to make it easier to pump blood around the body and to help the heart muscle relax so that it fills as fully as it can. The drugs most commonly used are:Diuretics: These are drugs, such as furosemide, decrease fluid within the body. This helps to get rid of fluid that has accumulated in or around the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. The vet may give this by injection in a sick patient, and, once stabilized, continue the treatment with tablets given at home.
ACE inhibitors: These are drugs, such as benazepril, which increase the size of small blood vessels in the body. This means there is less resistance each time the heart pumps, making it easier for blood to flow around the entire body.
Beta-blockers: Beta-blocker drugs, such as propranolol, help to reduce the rate of a racing heart. This gives it a chance to fill more fully and thus pump more effectively.
Calcium channel blockers: These drugs, such as diltiazem, help the heart muscle to relax in between beats. This makes for better filling and more efficient pumping of the heart.
Aspirin: This should only ever be given under the direction of your vet. Aspirin is toxic to cats but is safe at an ultra-low dosage when given every three days. It is mainly used to prevent blood clots in cats at high risk of them.

, A cat with cardiomyopathy may need frequent veterinary checks to make sure it is recovering well and it may need adjustments to its medication. This treatment may continue indefinitely.Be aware that recovery may not be permanent. Cats that have problems that are caught early, diagnosed, and put on appropriate treatment often go on to lead happy lives for months or years after diagnosis. Cats that are very sick when the disease is caught do less well, but there is a chance of stabilization.

, The heart's main job is to pump blood throughout the body. To do this work, it is made up of four chambers that fill up with blood and then pump it out: the upper chambers are called the right and left atria, and the lower chambers are called the ventricles.The right side of the heart takes in blood from the body that no longer has oxygen in it, as it has been used up by the body. The heart then pumps this deoxygenated blood into the lungs so it can be filled with oxygen once again. The left side then pumps the newly oxygenated blood out into the body, through the arteries.

, The three main types of cardiomyopathy are called hypertrophic, restrictive, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Each type affects the heart slightly differently.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: This is by far the most common form of cardiomyopathy. ""Hypertrophic"" is a term that refers to a thickening of the heart muscle. Thicker walls in the heart means that the chambers that hold blood become smaller, due to the walls taking up more space. With smaller chambers holding less blood, each heartbeat pumps out less blood into the body.
Restricted cardiomyopathy: This condition is caused by a build-up of scar tissue on a chamber of the heart, the ventricle. This restricts the relaxation, filling, and pumping of the heart.
Dilated cardiomyopathy: This is a type of muscle fatigue, where the heart muscles gets tired and becomes baggy and saggy. Think of it as a balloon that's been blown up and let down too many times. The muscular wall loses tone, meaning that it has less powerful contractions and is less efficient at pushing blood around the body.

, There are several reasons why a cat might develop disease of the heart muscle. These include:Genetic predisposition: Certain breeds (especially the Main Coon) get heart disease more often, which is then passed down from parent to kitten when they have babies.
Underlying disease: Conditions such as overactive thyroid glands, acromegaly (too much growth hormone), or high blood pressure place extra strain on the heart and can push it into developing cardiomyopathy.
Dietary deficiency: A lack of taurine, a type of amino acid, in the cat's diet can affect its heart. However, most cats eating high-quality commercial cat food should not have this deficiency. This deficiency causes the heart to lose elasticity, which is known as dilated cardiomyopathy.Spreading Disease: A spreading disease, such as lymphoma (blood cancer), can get in to the heart muscle and cause it to have a hard time functioning correctly.

Help the cat breathe on the way to the vet’s office.,
Notify the vet of your arrival.,
Allow the vet to do emergency life support.,
Let the vet give the cat medication.,
Schedule a follow up appointment with the vet.,
Get an epi-pen for the cat.,
Avoid substances or foods that cause an allergic reaction in the cat.,
Allow the vet to administer all vaccines on the cat.",How to Treat Anaphylaxis in Cats," As soon as you notice the symptoms of anaphylaxis in the cat, bring the cat to the vet’s office right away. You may need to help the cat breathe if it appears to have difficulty breathing properly on its own. You can put your mouth over the cat’s mouth and blow air into its airway during the drive to the vet’s office.If you find it too difficult to blow air into the cat’s mouth, try to get it to the vet as soon as you can. The vet can then address the cat’s breathing issues with the proper equipment.
Keep in mind anaphylaxis usually occurs in cats right after they are given a vaccine at the vet, so in some cases, you will not need to travel to the vet for help with this issue.;
, If possible, call the vet in transit to let them know you are going to be arriving shortly with the cat. The vet can then prepare the necessary equipment to perform emergency medical care on the cat.For example, you may call the vet and say, “My cat is experiencing anaphylaxis and requires immediate medical care. We are on our way to your office right now.”

, The vet will need to make sure the cat’s airway is open and will give the cat oxygen. The oxygen will ensure the cat can breath properly again. This procedure is called emergency life support.The vet will also give the cat intravenous fluids to increase the cat’s blood pressure.
Most cats recover soon after receiving emergency life support.

, The vet will give the cat epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids. These medications will help to reduce swelling and ensure the cat’s heart functions properly.The vet may also give the cat pet-safe antihistamines. The antihistamines will help to reduce the symptoms of anaphylaxis.

, The vet will likely keep the cat in their care until it recovers. Most cats who experience anaphylaxis recover well without any side effects. You should schedule a follow up appointment with the vet within a few weeks so they can check that the cat is recovering with no issues.The vet should also make note that the cat is allergic to certain foods, vaccines, medications, or substances to prevent anaphylaxis from happening again in the future.

, If your cat gets anaphylaxis due to insect bites, ask your vet about a prescription epi-pen for the cat. The epi-pen is a small syringe and needle with one dose of epinephrine. Keep the epi-pen on hand during trips or hikes so you can give it to the cat, if needed.If you do give the cat the epi-pen, make sure you then bring it to the vet for observation.

, If you know the cat is allergic to certain antibiotics or medications, try to avoid giving the cat these substances. If the cat is allergic to certain foods, do not give the cat these foods. This will help to prevent the cat from going into anaphylaxis.You may keep a notebook of all of the substances the cat is allergic to. Share the list with the cat’s vet so they know what to watch out for and avoid when treating the cat.

, Most cats have anaphylaxis right after getting a vaccine because they are allergic to an antibiotic in the vaccine. Having the vet administer all vaccines on the cat will ensure they are on hand if the cat develops anaphylaxis. They can then treat the issue quickly and efficiently."

Understand that obesity is a risk factor for arthritis.,
Manage the amount of calories your cat eats each day.,
Put your cat on a prescription diet.",How to Treat Arthritis in Cats1," Obesity is a risk factor for arthritis, because carrying extra weight places an additional burden on the joints. Ideally the cat should exercise gently, so as to keep the joints in use and as supple as possible.


A managed weight reduction strategy such as a calorie controlled diet, or putting the cat onto a particular food, like the Hills Metabolic diet, is crucial in getting an individual animal to a healthier target weight and protecting her joints.
Overweight cats are more likely to be couch potatoes and don't tend to move around much. This accentuates muscle loss and allows the joints to stiffen up.;
, When it comes to weight loss, remember the phrase ""calories in versus calories out"". For a cat to lose weight she must burn more calories than she takes in.


Since she is overweight you can guarantee that she is taking in too many calories. If she is a fussy eater and not amenable to switching onto a reduced-calorie food, then decrease her daily food allowances.
To do this, weigh out her regular amount of food, and then decrease it by 10%. So if she normally gets 100 grams (3.5 oz) of kibble a day, cut this to 90grams.
Reweigh the cat after 2-4 weeks on the new diet. If she has not lost weight then decrease the food by a further 10%, to 80 grams (2.8 oz), and so forth.

, If the cat is a good eater, then try her on a prescription diet designed to help weight loss. Foods such as Hills RD or Purina OM, are calorie restricted and high fiber.


The fiber fills the cat's stomach and helps her to feel fuller on small quantities. Keep in mind that this diet only works if the amount fed is matched to the target weight of the cat. If the overweight cat ate the prescription diet ad lib, she would not lose weight.
These restrictive foods work by switching on genes that allow for faster metabolism. Weighing the food is not necessary when using these foods, so it is a good option in a multi-cat household where you leave food out for all of your cats to snack on.

Understand what nutraceuticals are.,
Be aware of how glucosamine and chondroitin can help your cat’s arthritis.,
Give your cat glucosamine and chondroitin.",How to Treat Arthritis in Cats2," Nutraceuticals are food supplements that have a drug-like action. Nutraceuticals are usually side-effect free and safer than pharmaceuticals. Another advantage is that they are available without prescription.


Two nutraceuticals relevant to joint health are chondroitin and glucosamine. These two molecules are ""synergistic"", which means they have a greater effect when given together, than either does by itself.

, The theory behind glucosamine and chondroitin is that they provide the building blocks for cartilage repair and also improve the quality of joint fluid.


The aim is to nourish cartilage and optimize its health to protect against further chips and damage. They also work to increase the viscosity (or thickness) of joint fluid which makes for better lubrication.
There is a great deal of debate among veterinary scientists as to whether chondroitin and glucosamine can live up to these claims. However, a lot of animals do seem to benefit, and since the supplement is unlikely to do any harm (and if cost is not a factor) there is nothing to be lost by using this supplement.

, Chondroitin and glucosamine are marketed in palatable veterinary formulations, though human supplements are also suitable for use in the cat.


A typical dose is 500mg of glucosamine and 400mg of chondroitin, daily. For arthritic animals, the nutraceuticals must be taken for life.

Talk to your vet about pentosan polysulfate.,
Do not give your cat human painkillers.,
Get your cat a prescription for meloxicam.,
Do not give meloxicam to a cat who is dehydrated.,
Give your cat Tramadol.",How to Treat Arthritis in Cats3," Pentosan polysulfate can be used in the treatment of early arthritis in cats. This is an injection given at weekly intervals for 3-4 weeks, by your veterinarian.


Pentosan encourages cartilage repair (when the damage is not severe) by binding to the damaged cartilage and stimulating the synthesis of new glycosaminoglycan molecules that are needed for cartilage repair.
Pentosan also inhibits a range of proteolytic enzymes which set up a vicious cycle of inflammation and pain in the damaged joint.
The dose for a 5 kilograms (11 lb) cat is 0.4 milliliters (0.01  fl oz) by subcutaneous injection, once a week for 3-4 weeks, followed by monthly top-up injections., Human painkillers are not safe for use in the cat and are likely to result in toxic liver failure. However, prescription medications are available that are safe for use in cats.


The most common of these is meloxicam. This drug belongs to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory group of drugs (NSAIDS).

, Meloxicam (Metacam) belongs to a family of drugs called NSAIDs (Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs). Meloxicam works by inhibiting an enzyme, COX-2, which triggers prostaglandin release, which in turn limits the inflammation that causes further joint damage.


Meloxicam is a useful drug to reduce the pain associated with arthritis. The safety margins of meloxicam have been closely studied in cats and the drug is licensed for long-term use in cats.
The recommended maintenance dose is 0.05mg/kg of feline meloxicam once daily. Thus a 3kg cat needs 0.3 milliliters (0.01  fl oz) of cat Metacam. It should be noted that meloxicam is formulated in two strengths: For dogs (1.5mg/ml) and for cats (0.5mg/ml).
Dog Metacam is three times more concentrated, and extreme care should be taken when considering its use in the feline as inadvertent overdose may easily occur.

, Meloxicam should only be used in well-hydrated animals. Dehydrated animals may have impaired renal function and the additional decrease in blood supply to the kidney may tip the animal into renal failure.


Likewise, meloxicam must be given with or after food. If the cat is not eating, be sure to line her stomach by syringe feeding a small amount of food. Do not give metacam on a completely empty stomach. The inhibitory effect on the blood supply to the stomach will be exacerbated and can lead to serious gastric ulceration.
Meloxicam should not be given with or after other NSAIDs and is contra-indicated with steroid use. The latter can also cause gastric ulceration and the combined effect of the two medications is likely to cause gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding, with possibly fatal blood loss.

, Sometimes arthritic pain is so severe that meloxicam does not provide sufficient relief. For humane reasons to alleviate suffering, it may be necessary to add in an additional, albeit unlicensed drug.


Tramadol is a drug from the opioid family and provides stronger pain relief. The drawback with tramadol is that the smallest capsule size is 10mg.
This is fine for a 5 kg cat and above (the dose is 2mg/kg) but for cats weighing less than this, a 10mg may make them excessively sleepy, or sedated.

Try acupuncture.,
Relieve your cat’s pain with heat therapy.,
Talk to your vet about stem cell therapy.",How to Treat Arthritis in Cats4," The theory behind acupuncture is that specific regions of the body correspond to the function of a particular joint or organ. Inserting needles into these points is said to improve the function of the corresponding area.


Theories as to how this happen relate to the release of natural morphine-like substances, called endorphins, and stimulation of nerve impulses which inhibit the transmission of pain.
Some cats with arthritis do seem to benefit from weekly acupuncture sessions, and if they tolerate the needles, there are no adverse side effects to this therapy., Heat therapy is a useful tool in relieving the pain associated with arthritis. It involves the application of heat to the sore area, commonly in the form of microwaveable wheat bags.


The theory is that the heat dilates blood vessels which then carry away lactic acid and other metabolites that accumulate around an inflamed joint. The heat also relieves muscle spasms and helps the animal to relax.
A microwaveable wheat bag is ideal for this. Follow the directions on the bag's packaging and heat for the appropriate time. Then speak calmly to the cat, encourage her to lie down, and place the bag over the sore joint for five to ten minutes at a time.
Give the cat a heated mat to sleep on. She will really love the warmth and it helps reduce the chilling on her joints that leads to stiffness.

, An exciting option for the treatment of arthritis is stem cell therapy. This differs from previous generations of therapies in that the principle is to encourage repair of damaged tissue, rather than merely treating the discomfort.


This therapy involves harvesting fat from the cat's body, extracting stem cells from the sample, activating them in a laboratory, and then injecting the activated stem cells into the joints.
Success rates of over 95% of cases showing some form of improvement are hugely exciting.Many animals are so improved a few weeks after treatment that they no longer need to take pain medication.

Seek immediate veterinary care if your cat has been injured.,
Tell your veterinarian about any signs of blood loss from the gut.,
Check your cat for fleas.,
Get your cat checked for other parasites.,
Consider whether kidney disease may be to blame.,
Determine if your cat may have autoimmune disease.",How to Treat Anemia in Cats1," Injury resulting in bleeding is one possible cause of anemia in cats.If your cat has been injured, then take your cat to your veterinarian or to a veterinary emergency clinic right away.


If your cat is bleeding, then apply a pressure bandage or apply pressure with a clean cotton tea towel to the area to stop the bleeding.;
, Anemia may also be caused by blood loss from the digestive tract.Signs of blood loss from the gut include blood-stained vomit or feces, or very dark colored feces. If you are in doubt, then collect a sample to show the vet.


If the cat is on medications, especially NSAID medications (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, Tylenol, Asprin, etc.), then stop the medication and inform your vet. NSAIDs are associated with gut ulceration.
For a bleeding tumor, the vet needs to run diagnostic imaging such as an ultrasound, CT or MRI scan, or radiography in order to identify the tumor and decide on the best treatment option.

, A heavy infestation with fleas or lice can cause anemia because these parasites suck blood. To treat the anemia, you will need to kill the parasites. Doing so will remove the cause of the blood loss and allow your cat to regenerate the missing red blood cells.There are many effective flea control medications available. Be sure to use something that is approved for use on cats and that has been proven to be effective such as fipronil (Frontline, Effipro) or selamectin (Stronghold UK, Revolution US).

, Blood-borne parasites such as Babesia or Haemobartonella may damage red blood cells and cause anemia as well. It is critical to seek veterinary help for these conditions because they require specific medications such a primaquine or quinine and clindamycin for Babesia, and tetracycline antibiotics for Haemobartonella., One common cause of anemia in cats is kidney disease. This is because the kidney produces a hormone called erythropoietin which stimulates the bone marrow to produce new red blood cells. Kidney failure causes the active renal tissue to be replaced with scar tissue and this results in fewer available cells to produce erythropoietin., Autoimmune disease is when the body turns against its own tissues and the immune system attacks them as if they were foreign invaders. This can also cause anemia in cats.


If your veterinarian identifies autoimmune disease as the cause of your cat's problems, then your cat will need immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids. These drugs switch off the immune response, stop the attack, and allow the body to regenerate red blood cells."
"
Talk to your veterinarian about supplements.,
Ask your vet about a blood transfusion.,
Follow your vet’s instructions to treat the cause of your cat’s anemia.",How to Treat Anemia in Cats2," Your veterinarian may recommend iron supplements and B vitamins to help treat your cat. Many cats with kidney failure have poor appetites and may be deficient in these vitamins. However, the benefits of supplements are limited, so supplements would be used along with other treatments for anemia., In cases of severe blood loss, a blood transfusion may be necessary. Transfusion in cats is complex because of numerous major and minor cross-reactions.Because of the complexities and the risk of serious problems if an adverse reaction occurs, your veterinarian may suggest referral to a specialist center for a transfusion.

, Anemia is often the result of another health condition that will require treatment before your cat’s anemia will improve. The treatment may include medications, surgery, or other veterinary interventions.


Make sure that you follow your vet’s instructions and contact your vet if your cat’s condition worsens or does not improve.

Be aware that mild anemia may have no noticeable symptoms.,
Watch for a severe lack of energy.,
Pay attention to your cat’s appetite.,
Check the color of your cat’s gums.,
Take your cat to see a veterinarian for a full exam.",How to Treat Anemia in Cats3," Mild anemia may not become noticeable until it has progressed to a more severe level.That is why it is important to take your cat for an annual checkup with a veterinarian to detect health problems early and treat them before they get worse. If you do not have a veterinarian where you take your cat, find one as soon as possible and take your cat for an initial appointment.

, Although cats are known to be a bit lazy, lethargy is not normal for a cat. If your cat is skipping meals because she is asleep, or you return home from work to find the cat in the same spot you left her, then your cat could be lethargic., A loss of appetite is another potential symptom of anemia in cats. Pay attention to how much your cat is eating. If she is eating less than is normal for her, then this may also indicate that your cat may be anemic., Pale gums indicate that your cat may be anemic.Your cat’s gums should be a rosy pink color, just like our gums. It is preferable to look at your cat’s gums in a room with natural lighting. Artificial lighting can give gums an artificial creamy or yellow tinge.


To look at your cat’s gums, gently lift the upper lip and look at the gums. If your cat has pale gums, then this is a sign that your cat may be anemic.

, If your cat has pale gums and/or other symptoms of anemia, you will need to take your cat to see a veterinarian. The vet will examine your cat and check for problems such as fleas, lice, or other parasites. The vet will also check for unusual organ enlargement or masses within the abdomen that could indicate that your cat has a tumor. The vet will then draw blood to run lab tests.The lab tests will look at the cat's biochemistry and hematology, an examination of the red and white blood cells. These lab tests can tell the vet if the cat is anemic, as well as determine the severity of the problem, tell whether the problem is recent or long-standing, and confirm whether the cat is making new red blood cells or not.

Take the cat to the vet.,
Get a fecal evaluation.,
Have blood and imaging tests done.",How to Treat a Cat with Bloody Diarrhea1," Blood in your cat’s stool may be due to a variety of conditions, so you need to take your cat to the vet as soon as possible. Bloody diarrhea can lead the cat to be dehydrated. Bloody diarrhea may be due to minor problems, like food intolerance, or serious conditions, like cancer.The vet will complete a physical examination and take a complete medical history.;
, The vet will probably do a fecal evaluation first. This takes a sample of the feces to check under a microscope. The vet will look for parasites and bacteria, which can cause blood in the stool. They will also look for the presence of blood., If the vet suspects a more serious condition or finds nothing in the fecal evaluation, they will then perform more tests. Blood tests will check for Feline Leukemia Virus or Feline Immunodeficiency Virus.The vet may do a blood chemistry panel and perform other blood tests to check for certain diseases they suspect. They may check for anemia, liver disease, kidney disease, problems with the pancreas, or thyroid issues.
The vet will do x-rays and other imaging tests if they believe there is a tumor, blockage, or other problem inside the cat’s body.

"
"
Change the cat’s diet.,
Give the cat medication.,
Have the vet perform surgery.",How to Treat a Cat with Bloody Diarrhea2," Food allergies may cause bloody diarrhea. If your vet believes this is the cause, you will be instructed to change the cat’s diet. If the cat has a food allergy, they will be given a food without the ingredient they are allergic to. Some cats may need fiber added to or fat decreased in their diet.Never change a cat’s diet suddenly. Always slowly phase out one food and replace it with the new food.

, If the bloody diarrhea is due to a parasite or bacterial infection, the vet will prescribe medication. Antibiotics are commonly given to cats. If the infection is serious, the antibiotics may have to be given intravenous instead of orally. Dewormers may be given to treat or prevent parasite infections.Anti-inflammatories may be given to help reduce inflammation.
Immunosuppressive drugs may be given to cats with inflammatory bowel disease. Anti-anxiety medication may be given to cats with irritable bowel syndrome.

, If the cat has a blockage from a foreign body, the vet may perform surgery. Surgery may also be the treatment if the cat has cancer and the vet wants to remove the tumor."

Identify blood in the stool.,
Determine if the diarrhea is acute or chronic.,
Identify related symptoms.",How to Treat a Cat with Bloody Diarrhea3," Bloody diarrhea is a symptom that needs immediate vet attention, so it's important to know what to look for. A cat may have blood in their feces from the small or large intestine. Blood originating in one of the parts of the intestine will look different. Blood in diarrhea from the large intestine will be red and look like blood. You may see the blood on the litter and sides of the litter box, too.Blood from the small intestine will be black or brown in color. The blood may look like dark flecks or specks on the feces, or it may look like coffee grounds.
Dark or brown blood may be difficult to identify, so it's important to look for anything that looks abnormal.

, The vet can better diagnose the cause and find a treatment of the bloody diarrhea if they know how suddenly it started. Acute diarrhea means that it started suddenly. Chronic diarrhea is when the cat has diarrhea for several weeks.Intermittent diarrhea is when the cat has diarrhea, but it goes away, but it comes back again. This happens over several weeks.

, Diarrhea may occur with other symptoms. The cat may stop eating and lose weight. They may become dehydrated or become thirstier than usual. The cat may also have fat and mucus in their feces. Some cats with diarrhea will eliminate outside of the litter box because they can’t control it.Cats may also experience flatulence.
Being able to give the vet additional symptoms that occur alongside the bloody diarrhea can help them better diagnose the underlying condition and find the appropriate treatment.

Mention any previous medical conditions the cat may have had as well as any it has right now. Cats who have urinary issues are usually overweight or have a genetic condition that predisposes them to these issues. Let the vet know if the cat has a history of medical issues, as this will help them make the proper diagnosis.For example, you may tell the vet, “The cat is overweight and older in age. It has had urinary issues in the past.”;
, Cats who have blood in their urine usually display other symptoms, such as going to the bathroom outside of their litter box or not going to the bathroom at all. They may also appear agitated, anxious, or on edge. Tell the vet when you started to notice the cat’s symptoms and if they have gotten worse over time.For example, you may say to the vet, “I noticed there was blood in the cat’s urine two days ago” or “The cat started showing symptoms 24 hours ago and they seem to be getting worse.”

, The vet will do a physical exam of your cat. They will also require a blood test and a urinalysis. This will allow the vet to check if the red discoloration in the cat’s urine is actually blood.Depending on your cat’s condition, the vet may also do an X-ray, a CT scan, and an ultrasound on the cat. The CT scan will be done on the cat’s urinary tract to get a detailed picture of what is going on in this area.

, Once the vet has run the necessary tests, they should be able to diagnose the cat’s issue. A cat with blood in its urine could have a number of issues, including:A urinary tract infection
Kidney stones
Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)
A bleeding disorder
Urinary tract cancer

, The vet will prescribe antibiotics to give the cat until the infection clears. The vet will recommend a specific dosage for the cat. You will need to make sure the cat gets enough fluids through access to fresh water and to wet cat food while it takes the antibiotics.The vet may prescribe antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and for Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC).

, If the vet finds kidney stones or tumors in the cat’s urinary tract, they may recommend surgery to remove them. Kidney stones and tumors can be life threatening, so they should be removed as soon as possible. The cat will be under general anesthesia during the surgery.Surgery can be an expensive option. Your vet should outline the costs of the surgery before you agree to go ahead with this treatment.

, If the cat has a more serious medical condition like bladder cancer or a bleeding disorder, the vet should outline several treatment options. Depending on your cat’s specific condition, the vet may recommend removing cancerous tumors in the bladder with surgery. Or they prescribe dietary changes and medication to help treat a bleeding disorder.Each cat will be given a different treatment depending on its medical history and condition. Discuss treatment options in detail with the vet before you decide the best way to address the cat’s condition.

, Dehydration can be dangerous for cats, especially if they are predisposed to urinary tract issues. Make sure the cat has access to fresh water every day in its water bowl. You may also switch the cat to wet cat food instead of dry cat food, as this will allow it to get more liquid and moisture through its food., Cats who are active and get a lot of exercise every day are less likely to develop urinary tract issues. Spend time playing with the cat once a day, including play with a toy where the cat has to run or chase it. You can also set up a climbing area and a scratching post for the cat so it can be active on its own throughout the day., Cats who are overweight or obese are more prone to urinary tract issues. Reduce this risk by making sure the cat maintains a healthy weight for its age and breed. Ask your vet for the ideal weight for the cat and monitor the cat’s weight so it does not become obese.If the cat is overweight or obese, the vet may recommend a special diet to reduce the cat’s weight so it is healthy and less likely to develop urinary tract issues.

Provide plenty of water.",How to Treat a Cat With a Cold1," A cold is caused by a bacterial infection. Look for symptoms which may include sniffing, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, pus-like discharge around the eyes, difficulty breathing, and lethargy which can all point to a cold., Increased humidity will help with your cat's breathing while they're sick. Use a humidifier, if you have one, or confine your cat to a steamy bathroom a few times a day for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Some cats may dislike being confined. Many will cry and/or scratch at the door to get out. If your cat does this for longer than 3-5 minutes, don't force them. That can cause stress exacerbating the illness and prolonging recovery.

, When your cat is sick, you may notice discharge around their eyes, nose and ears. A few times a day, take a damp washcloth and gently wash your cat's face all the while murmuring soothing words.Cats react to the tone in your voice and it may help keep them calm while you do this, unpleasant to them, chore.


Use warm water. Make sure the water you use is not extremely hot or cold as this can shock your cat's system.

, If your cat is sick, it may not want to eat. However, it's important they get the nutrients they need to stay strong during an illness. Cats will often lose their appetite when sick walking away from food they would have happily devoured yesterday. If your cat is not interested in eating, try warming it a little in the microwave for a few minutes. This will create a stronger smell and may entice your cat to eat. You can also try providing your cat with a special, tasty food that it may be more likely to eat., If you have other pets, you may need to separate them. Infections such as these are contagious within the incubation period which can be from between 2-10 days.Your pet is also probably lethargic and will eat slower than normal. Keeping other animals at a distance during feeding time will reduce the chance that they take the sick cat's food before they're finished eating.

, Make sure fresh, clean water is out at all times. A sick cat needs to keep hydrated. Pay attention to the water bowl and refill and /or clean as necessary.

Note the time of year.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Depressed1," If you notice behavioral changes in your cat, make an appointment with your veterinarian. You want to make sure there isn't an underlying medical issue causing your cat's depression that might require specific treatment.


Tell your vet about any changes you've noticed in your cat, such as changes in appetite, sleeping habits, and personality. Your veterinarian will perform a routine physical exam, listening to your cat's heart beat, examining her eyes and ears, and taking her temperature.
If your vet feels it is necessary based on the behavioral changes you've outlined, she might call for blood work, x-rays, or other additional testing. Some test results will be ready within the appointment period while others may take a few days to come back.
If there is no medical issue, your cat may be suffering from feline depression.;
, Feline depression is linked to a variety of causal factors. Consider your current situation and try to figure out if there have been any big changes recently that might have triggered a depressive episode.


Have you moved recently? Changing residencies is one of the biggest causes of feline depression. Many cats have trouble transitioning from apartment to apartment or house to house and may fall into a temporary depression while adjusting to the move.Has there been a death in your household recently? Whether it was a person or a pet, death does affect cats. They do not perceive or understand death the same way humans do, but will notice the absence of a person or animal. This can lead to feelings of depression.Have you recently become more busy? Whether it's due to work, your social life, or a new romantic partner if you've found yourself spending less time with your feline friend this could easily cause feline depression. Cats, especially breeds like the siamese, are social creatures and may become depressed if they feel they're being neglected., Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is not just an affliction of people. Cats can be affected by the time of year and may become depressed during winter months.


Winter months result in shorter days, which means less sunlight. Lack of sun can cause depression in cats, which results in changes to their behavior. If your cat's personality seems to change with the seasons, they may be experiencing seasonal depression.Sunlight affects levels of melatonin and serotonin. This can lead to fatigue, anxiety, and sadness in both humans and cats. Outdoor cats are especially susceptible to depression in the winter as so much of their time is spend outdoors."

Monitor your cat's sleeping habits.,
Listen for an increased amount of vocalization.,
Watch your cat's eating habits.,
Check your cat’s coat.,
Take note of how often your cat is hiding.,
Watch for litter box problems.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Depressed2," Cats are big sleepers. In fact, they sleep on average 16 hours a day. However, if your cat seems to be sleeping more than usual this might be a sign of depression.


As cats sleep so often, it can be hard to gauge how much is too much. However, you should have some idea of when your cat tends to be awake and when she tends to be asleep. Use this as a guide when monitoring her sleeping habits.If you know your cat is always awake to greet you in the morning and suddenly she spends that time snoozing in the pantry, this could be a sign she's depressed. If she's always awake after work and now you find her asleep on the couch, take note of this as well.Watch for general dips in energy. When your cat isn't sleeping, does she seem lethargic? Some cats are naturally lazy, but if your once bouncy and energetic cat suddenly lies in bed all day this could be a sign of depression., Cats make a range of sounds, from hissing to purring to mewing. If you notice your cat seems to be vocalizing more often than usual, this could be related to depression.


Depressed cats might cry, yowl, or hiss in response to mild stimuli or simply vocalize at random points throughout the day. She may be trying to communicate something is wrong.Much like sleeping, how much is unusual varies from cat to cat and you're the best judge of what's normal for your pet. If your cat is normally loud, mewing to announce her presence or ask for attention, you may not need to worry about frequent vocalization. However, if a normally quiet cat suddenly starts keeping you up at night crying she might be trying to communicate unhappiness.
Excessive vocalization frequently results from the death of a close companion, which can either be a pet or a person. Your cat might cry to try and help a missing companion locate her., Depressed cats might over or under eat in response to sadness. Take stock of how much your cat is eating.


Loss of appetite is a major factor in depression in both people and animals. Your cat may be disinterested in food and you might notice they're not eating at feeding times and the dry or wet food you leave out goes untouched. Weight loss might result from such changes in appetite.Conversely, some cats overeat when depressed. While it's rarer, it does happen. If you notice your cat wanting more food, especially if it's to the point she's putting on weight, this may also be a sign of depression., When depressed, cats may cease grooming themselves or groom themselves excessively. This may become noticeable physically.


If your cat's coat is dull or matted, she may not be grooming herself. You might also notice a lack of grooming. If your cat frequently cleans herself in the middle of the living room after dinner, for example, and suddenly stops this could be a sign of depression.Other cats may groom excessively to curb anxiety related to feline depression. You will likely notice your cat licking herself for long periods of time. She may also develop bald spots or rashes due to too much grooming., Cats are social animals, but like the occasional moments to themselves. It's not atypical for a cat to have a favorite hiding spot, like a dresser drawer or closet, but too much hiding can be a sign of depression.


When depressed, your cat may hide in a hard to find place. Rather than simply taking refuge in the closet, for example, she might burrow into a corner where she cannot be seen.Once again, only you can gauge what's normal for your pet. Some cats hide more than others, but if you're used to your cat spending time in the living room during afternoons and she's suddenly nowhere to be seen this might be a sign of depression., Litter box issues are linked to stress, which is a symptom of depression in cats.



Understand the difference between urine marking and urination. Urine marking is a form of marking territory and usually unrelated to feline depression. The urine is usually found on vertical surfaces, tends to produce a pungent odor, and is generally the work of male cats. If your cat is urine marking, this is likely because he feels his territory is threatened and not a result of depression. However, tensions between cats and other pets can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression. Make sure to manage any territorial disputes before they result in mental health issues.
If you're finding urine or feces around the house, this might also be a sign of feline depression. Cats may urinate outside the litter box due to disliking the size, shape, or litter type and may also urinate outside the box if the litter is dirty. If your litter box is clean, and you haven't made any recent changes regarding the box, the urination may be related to depression."

Take your cat to your vet.,
Decide how to give your cat steroids.,
Learn how to give an inhaled steroid.,
Follow prescription instructions.,
Monitor your cat for side effects.,
Wait for improvement.",How to Treat a Cat With Asthma1," When you notice signs of asthma (coughing, wheezing, open-mouthed breathing), take your cat to your vet. They will perform various diagnostic tests, such as chest x-rays, to diagnose the asthma.Once your vet has made the diagnosis, they will discuss the various treatment options with you.


The main feline asthma treatment options are corticosteroids (‘steroids’), which reduce inflammation, and bronchodilators, which open the airways.;
, Steroid treatment for feline asthma is either oral, injectable, or inhaled.Long-acting injectable steroids, which can be administered by your vet, would be good if your cat doesn’t like taking pills.The inhaled steroid, called fluticasone, is a popular treatment choice for feline asthma.


Your vet can help you decide which form of steroid would work best for your cat.
Be aware the dose of an injectable steroid can’t be reduced once the steroid is given—you may have to wait for the effects to wear off.To give a steroid pill, consider hiding it in a pill pocket.Pill pockets are available at your local pet store.

, You will need a metered dose inhaler (MDI), cat-specific spacer (also called a chamber), and face mask. First, acclimate your cat to the spacer and face mask by holding the face mask on your cat’s face for gradually longer periods of time (up to about 20 seconds), then attaching the spacer. Your vet can show you how to give the inhaled steroid:Shake the MDI and attach it to the spacer.
Press down on the MDI to deliver the prescribed dose into the spacer.
Place the unit on your cat’s face and wait for your cat to take about 10 to 15 breaths.

, With whichever form of steroid you give your cat, make sure you follow your vet’s prescription instructions carefully. This will help your cat get the most benefit from this type of treatment.

, Examples of steroid side effects are increased appetite, increased water intake, and increased urination. Inhaled steroids can produce side effects like throat irritation and voice loss. Inhaled steroids usually have fewer side effects than oral or injectable steroids.Cats that are overweight or have certain medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease) may have a higher risk of side effects when taking steroids., Steroids are very effective at reducing the inflammation and mucus buildup seen with feline asthma.If you give your cat inhaled steroids, it may be two weeks before your cat’s asthma start to improve.You may see the effects of oral or injectable steroids sooner.

Consider medication.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Depressed3," Depression in cats can be due to inadequate attention. Make sure you're giving your cat all the love she needs to feel happy and secure.


Cats are social animals, but tend to be more independent. Cats will generally signify when they want attention, and it's best to let them come to you. If your cat approaches you and engages in welcoming behavior, like rubbing against your legs or nuzzling you, she's craving attention. While it's not always possible to drop everything and indulge your cat's needs, you should at least give her a quick pat and stroke her to let her know you appreciate her.
Cats enjoy stimulating activity, so make sure you play with your cat. A good range is 15 or 20 minutes a day. Cats enjoy toys like strings and animal-shaped plush toys you can toss for them to chase. However, never rough house with a cat. Some owners wrestle with their cats using their hands, but this can cause a cat to become timid and engage in aggressive behavior.

, If you've recently taken a busy job, and you believe your cat's depression is a response to this change, try to keep him happy when you are away. There are a variety of ways to make sure your cat is entertained when you are not present.


Leave the curtains open during the day, especially if you live in a rural area. Make sure there's a table, dresser, or other perch your cat is allowed to climb on in front of the window. Cats love watching the outdoors, and having access to sunlight and entertainment while you're gone.Some companies sell DVD's and other electronic media you can play on your television set while you are away. Such movies feature stimuli cats will enjoy, like birds, mice, and other cats. Just be careful, as cats may jump and bat the TV. Make sure your TV is secure and is not likely to fall and break in response to a cat's curiosity.Many toys are designed to be enjoyed while you are gone, such as catnip laced mice and birds. There are also puzzle games, in which a toy or piece of food is placed in a contraption. Your cat must figure out how to open this contraption to get her reward and this can keep her engaged while you are gone. However, be careful. Some toys have warnings on them advising you not leave your cat alone with them. Make sure you pick toys that are safe to leave out while you're away., If your cat's depression is related to seasonal changes, light therapy might help curb winter depression.


Buy a light that simulates UV rays and turn it on for a few hours a day in your cat's presence. Such lights are often sold in greenhouses, as people purchase them to grow plants indoors.Sol Box is a brand of UV light veterinarians recommend as it's made specifically for cats. You can buy it from the online retailer Pawsitive Lighting. It produces bright, white light and manufacturers recommend exposing your cat to it 30 minutes a day during winter months., Your veterinarian can recommend brands of synthetic pheromones designed to encourage feelings of relaxation and happiness in cats.


Feliway spray is one of the most popular synthetic pheromones, and you should be able to get a supply at your veterinarian's office. Use only as the directions instruct and ask your vet if you have any questions or concerns about Feliway spray., Medication is generally considered a last resort to treat feline depression due to possible side effects and the difficulty of getting cats to take medication.


There are four types of medications used to treat depression and other behavioral issues in cats: benzodiazepines (BZs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Most likely, if your cat has depression, your vet will recommend an SSRI or MAOI.Depending on the medication, side effects vary. Some can be quite serious. For example, some MAOIs can cause potentially life threatening reactions if your cat accidentally consumes cheese while on the medication. Make sure you understand all possible side effects before giving your cat any medication. Ask your vet about side effects, and what side effects require immediate medical attention.Cats are notoriously difficult in regards to medication. Most veterinarians only prescribe meds as a last resort. If your vet suggests meds, make sure you know the proper protocol for administration, dosage, and storage. If you're confused or concerned about anything, do not hesitate to contact your vet and ask."

Look out for bacterial infections.,
Watch for symptoms of fungal infections.,
Make sure there isn’t a foreign body in your cat’s nose.",How to Treat a Cat with a Stuffy Nose2," Bacterial infections usually occur because of an underlying condition such as a viral infection, a tumor or polyp in the nasal passage, or a foreign body lodged in your cat’s nose. Nasal discharge resulting from a bacterial infection usually occurs in both nostrils and has a pus-like consistency and appearance.If your cat has yellow, green, or pus-like discharge coming from its nostrils, it may need to be treated with antibiotics.
Ask your vet about antibiotics for bacterial infections.

, Sometimes a fungal infection is the culprit behind your cat’s stuffy nose. Infections causes by the Cryptococcus fungus are the most common. If your cat is suffering from a fungal infection, its face may become asymmetrical and its nasal passages swollen. There will also be nasal discharge that is bloody or resembles pus.Let your vet treat a fungal infection with an antifungal medication.
For example, a Cryptococcus infection is usually treated with fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B., It is not uncommon for foreign objects like seeds, blades or grass, or pebbles to get stuck in a cat’s nasal passages. This can cause a stuffy nose that often occurs alongside pawing at the face and/or excessive sneezing. Discharge will only be from one nostril not both.Let the vet to remove foreign objects from your cat’s nose.
If you suspect your cat’s stuffy nose is caused by a foreign object that has become lodged in its nasal passages, you should not attempt to remove it yourself.

Determine how often to give a bronchodilator.,
Give the bronchodilator as prescribed.,
Wait for an effect.",How to Treat a Cat With Asthma2," Bronchodilators are fast-acting medications that are usually reserved for asthma emergencies. However, they can also be given each day to cats that take daily steroids.Your vet will determine if your cat needs a bronchodilator every day or just on an ‘as needed’ basis.


Long-acting bronchodilators, which last up to 12 hours, can be given daily for cats that need more daily control of their asthma. Emergency bronchodilators last about two to four hours., Like steroids, bronchodilators can be inhaled, injected, or given orally. The inhaled bronchodilator, called albuterol, is very effective for emergency asthma flare-ups. Terbutaline, which is another bronchodilator, can be injected.Terbutaline can also be given orally as a syrup, but can make a cat act a little spacey.An inhaled bronchodilator is given in the same way as an inhaled steroid.
Bronchodilators are usually not prescribed as the only asthma treatment because they don’t reduce airway inflammation., Bronchodilators work quickly to open up the airways. Albuterol can open up a cat’s airways in about 5 to 10 minutes. The longer-acting bronchodilators take about 15 to 30 minutes to have an effect."
"
Give your cat a bronchodilator.,
Take your cat to your vet.,
Hospitalize your cat.",How to Treat a Cat With Asthma3," Because cats can have asthma attacks just like people, you will need to know what to do if your cat has a severe asthma attack. Give your cat albuterol (under the supervision of your vet once a diagnosis has been reached), which is a very effective emergency bronchodilator.A cat having an asthma attack will hunch its body toward the ground and extend its neck forward.However, this is a general sign of respiratory distress, rather than specific to asthma.
Even if you normally give your cat a long-acting bronchodilator, your vet may prescribe the albuterol so you can have it on hand for emergency situations.

, A cat with serious breathing trouble needs immediate veterinary care.Giving your cat the albuterol will open the airways and make your cat’s breathing a little easier. While the albuterol is taking effect, contact your vet or an emergency vet hospital and let them know your cat is having an asthma attack.

, A cat having a serious asthma attack may need to be hospitalized until it is stable and strong enough to go back home.If your cat needs to be hospitalized, your vet will give your cat a bronchodilator and oxygen therapy.They will monitor your cat’s breathing and its overall health.

Pay attention to what triggers an asthma attack.,
Use dust-free litter.,
Replace your home’s air filters.,
Vacuum regularly.,
Do not smoke inside.",How to Treat a Cat With Asthma4," Cats develop asthma when they inhale something from the environment that irritates their airways. It’s probably not practical for you to identify every single substance your cat could be allergic to. However, you can look for a few substances that could trigger your cat’s asthma:Perfume or cologne.
Scented laundry detergent.
Cigarette smoke.
Carpet freshener.
Hairspray.
Dust.

, If you know what allergens trigger your cat’s asthma, you can take steps to reduce your cat’s exposure to those allergens. For example, if dust is a trigger, put dust-free litter in your cat’s litter box.No cat litters are 100% dust-free. However, some brands of litter (Nature’s Miracle, Tidy Cat Pure Nature) contain minimal dust.Cats don’t always like change, so don’t switch litter types too quickly. Incorporate a little bit of the new litter into the old litter, then slowly increase the amount of new litter until that’s the only litter in the litter box.

, Air filters trap particles in the air that could trigger your cat’s asthma. Replacing them regularly, according to the product label instructions, will help lower the amount of asthma-inducing particles in the air in your home., Vacuuming your home will help keep dust and mold spores out of the air.Daily vacuuming could quickly become tedious, so aim to vacuum your home about once a week.

, Cigarette smoke can trigger an asthma attack in a cat.If you smoke, do so outside of your home.

Consider using electrostimulation.",How to Treat a Cat with Acupuncture," During acupuncture treatment it is best for your cat to be very relaxed. This will allow the acupuncturist to complete the treatment easily. Make sure your cat is content by comforting it, giving it treats, and generally doing all that you can to decrease its stress.


Ask if your acupuncturist offers house calls if your cat gets too stressed going to a veterinary office.;
, Make an appointment for your cat's treatment and bring the cat in at its appointed time. Your acupuncturist will first make an assessment of where the acupuncture needles need to be placed and then they will place the needles. Once the acupuncturist believes the needles have been in long enough, they will remove them from your cat.The length of an appointment for acupuncture on your cat will vary depending on how long the acupuncture needles need to be left in place. During the first treatment, the acupuncturist will give your cat a full assessment, which will make the appointment longer.
You may be asked to stay with your cat to keep it calm and reassure it. However, because acupuncture treatments are not painful, many pets are calmed and relaxed by them.
Typically, you will need to bring your cat in for several treatment sessions. For an acute issue, such as treating pain due to an injury, your cat may need 3 to 5 sessions., Acupuncture can be a great complementary treatment for cats that have serious health issues. For example, if your cat has chronic pain, using acupuncture in combination with other types of veterinary medicine, such as medication or physical therapy, can minimize the cat's pain and discomfort by strengthening its immune responses.Because acupuncture does not have any side effects, it can be used with all types of medication without the risk of complications or bad interactions.

, If your cat is having health issues and other types of treatment have not worked, you may want to consider acupuncture as a treatment option. Acupuncture can be very helpful for treating a variety of health problems, including:Chronic pain
Arthritis
Asthma
Allergies
Digestive problems
Kidney problems
Liver problems
Skin problems

, If you are having your cat treated by a veterinarian, discuss the option of acupuncture with them. The veterinarian may be supportive of the idea of acupuncture as a treatment option, especially if other types of treatment have not successfully eliminated or reduced your cat's health problems.Even if your veterinarian does not believe that acupuncture may help your cat, you still have the right to get a second opinion. Not all veterinarians are knowledgeable about acupuncture and the benefits it can provide, so going to one who is to assess whether it might help your cat is a good idea.

, In most places, those that do acupuncture on animals must go through veterinary school, just as other veterinarians do. This means that veterinary acupuncturists are perfectly qualified to assess health problems and suggest treatments for your cat.While veterinary acupuncturists are likely to suggest acupuncture at a treatment option more than other veterinarians, they also have knowledge of other types of veterinary treatments and may suggest those as well.

, Any trained acupuncturist will tell you that there are limits to what acupuncture can do. This is why it is a great when used in combination with other types of treatment. It will not heal broken bones or immediately eliminate a life-threatening infection but it can be a helpful part of the treatment for these problems.However, acupuncture can help with the symptoms or side effects of these conditions. For example, if your cat is in pain from a broken bone, an acupuncturist may be able to help ease that pain.

, Usually, the easiest way to find a licensed and experienced acupuncturist for your cat is to ask for a referral from your veterinarian. Your veterinarian is likely to know the best and most experienced ones in your area.Depending on where you live, there may not be any veterinary acupuncturists near by. If this is the case, your veterinarian will probably not be able to give you a referral.
You do not need a referral from a veterinarian to see a veterinary acupuncturist. It is just usually the easiest way to find a good one in your area.

, If you need to find an acupuncturist without the help of your veterinarian, begin your search online. Go to the websites of professional organizations for pet acupuncturists, such as the website for the American Academy of Veterinary Acupuncture, and look for lists of accredited veterinary acupuncturists.Most professional organizations have lists of members online. This can be helpful for finding a qualified acupuncturist.

, Once you have identified the pet acupuncturists in your area, you should meet with them to pick which one will treat your cat. Discuss their treatment philosophy, their experience and education, and the cost of their treatments so that you can pick the one that best suits your needs. They should be a veterinarian and have completed a certificate in veterinary acupuncture from an accredited program, such as the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, Chi Institute, or Medical Acupuncture for Veterinarians.If you are comfortable with all of their answers, then go ahead with treatment for your cat.
Finding an acupuncturist that has treated issues that are similar to your cat's issues will improve the chance of their treatment working on your cat.

, There are some health therapies that can be used on cats that are closely related to acupuncture. Acupressure is one of them, which is a technique in which pressure is applied to acupuncture points. This is meant to have a similar effect to acupuncture but does not require needles or the patience of having needles in place for long periods of time.


Acupressure can be very helpful for cats that are resistant to acupuncture or for locations on a cat's body that are hard to apply needles to.

, Aquapuncture is similar to acupuncture except that it uses fluid, which contains vitamins or homeopathics, that is injected into acupuncture points instead of acupuncture needles. This is a much newer technique than acupuncture but it may be effective for cats that can't sit still for acupuncture treatment.It may be difficult to find a aquapuncture practitioner in your area. Ask your acupuncturist if they do this type of treatment or if they know someone who does.

, Electrostimulation is a technique in which very small amounts of electricity are introduced into the body through two acupuncture needles. This electricity stimulates muscles, which can be very good for cats that are suffering from nerve damage or injuries to spine, as it can help to reestablish nerve connections.


Talk to your acupuncturist and veterinarian to figure out if this treatment would help your cat."

Look out for clumsiness.,
Watch your cat’s walk.,
Listen to your cat.,
Notice if your cat is clingy.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Blind1," Watch to see how your cat gets around furniture or if it misjudges jumping onto furniture. Also note if your cat bumps into walls or furniture that it previously knew to walk around. Acting clumsy in spaces where it spends a lot of time can be a sign of failing sight or blindness.Another sign to watch for is if your cat is tripping on stairs.
Note if your cat is having problems with other familiar objects, like finding its food and water bowls.;
, Pay attention to your cat’s walk. Note if it is crouching closer to the ground. It may be feeling its way with its nose and whiskers. Other signs to watch are if your cat is walking with its head down or is moving its head up and down to figure out distances.Another sign to look for is if your cat is wandering aimlessly.

, Do you hear your cat vocalizing more? When cats do not see well or are blind, they tend to be noisier to vocalize their distress. You may also notice that your cat is generally acting nervous, fearful, or upset as it adjusts to its lack of sight.You may also see that your cat is more easily startled.

, Look for signs that your cat is less confident than usual. For example, note if your cat clings to you more or spends more time by your side. Also pay attention to if your cat sleeps more or generally moves around less often than usual.

Check out the color of your cat’s eyes.,
Look at your cat’s pupils.,
Pay attention to the eyes’ overall appearance.,
Test your cat’s menace reflex.,
Try dropping a ball of yarn in front of your cat.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Blind2," One of the changes you may see is a change of eye color. Additionally, look for more redness in your cat’s eyes. Alternatively, you might see that your cat’s eyes look milkier, cloudier, or appear more white.Look for excessive redness in the tissues around the eyes. Don’t worry if this is lighter pink, which is normal.
If the lenses of your cat’s eyes are opaque, this might be a sign of cataracts.

, If you suspect your cat is blind or going blind, look at its pupils. Note if the pupils stay the same in both bright and low light. Also check to see if the pupils are different sizes. Both of these are signs of blindness or incipient blindness.


Also note if your cat is squinting or if it’s indifferent to changes in lighting.

, Look for more tearing than usual in the corners of the eyes. Don’t worry about a little tearing, which is normal. Another sign to look out for is if your cat’s eyes are brighter and shinier than normal., Move a fingertip quickly towards your cat’s eye without making contact with the cornea. A sighted cat will flinch or blink when you move your fingertip towards them, but a blind cat will remain unaware of your finger. Don’t get too close to your cat’s whiskers or create a breeze on its whiskers so it can't sense your finger approaching its face., Notice if she watches or follows the descent of the ball. Most sighted cats will watch the ball drop. A blind cat will remain oblivious as the ball passes in front of it. Avoid getting too close to your cat's whiskers so it doesn't sense the ball."

Look for shaved hair on the cat’s abdomen.,
Check for a spaying scar.,
Look for tattoo markings by the incision scar or on the cat’s ear.,
Note if the cat has a ""clipped"" ear.,
Take the cat to the vet to confirm she is spayed.,
Ask the breeder or pet store worker if the cat is splayed.",How to Tell if a Cat Is Spayed1," Try flipping the cat onto her back so you have a clear view of her stomach. If the cat has been recently spayed, the fur on her lower abdomen area will be shorter than the fur on the rest of her body because vets have to shave this fur off before performing the operation.Note, however, that other veterinary procedures can also require patches of the cat's hair to be shaved and this is not a foolproof way to check if the cat has been splayed.;
, Hold the cat so that she's lying on her back with her stomach up. Part the fur in the lower abdomen area as best you can. Once you can see the cat's skin, check around for a scar from the operation. This may be hard to do because the tools used for spaying today typically leave a very thin scar which can fade and may be hard to see after it has healed.Usually, the scar will be a straight, thin line running lengthwise in the center of the abdomen.

, Once a cat is spayed, a veterinarian may give her a small tattoo as an external sign that she has been spayed. Usually, this tattoo is green, drawn in the shape of a thin line, and is located on or near the scar from the incision.The tattoo should be visible when parting the hair of the abdomen, though you may need to look carefully.


You'll also want to check the cat's inner ear for tattoos — this is a common site for important information to be marked on pets. In the US, a letter M means the cat has been micro chipped — almost all other tattoos mean the cat has been spayed., Some veterinarians and animal agencies use a practice called ""ear clipping"" or ""ear tipping"" to show a cat has being spayed. In this case, one of the cat's ears (usually the left) has about a quarter of an inch of the tip removed — just enough to give the ear a ""flat"" tip. This is done while the cat is asleep from the anesthetic and heals quickly.

, Sometimes, a cat may not have any clear physical markings due to spaying. Bring the cat to your veterinarian — a trained professional in the field of animal medicine will almost always be able to tell if your cat is spayed or not, and, if she can't, she'll be able to order medical tests to find out for sure.

, If you are buying the cat from a breeder or from a pet store, the breeder or the pet store worker should be able to tell you if the cat has been spayed. It is more difficult to get information on a cat from a shelter or a stray, so take the cat to the vet to confirm if you are not sure."

Know when to go to the veterinarian.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian.,
Give your cat the prescribed medication.,
Observe whether the cat improves.",How to Stop Your Cat's Diarrhea1," If your cat has diarrhea that lasts more than a few days, if she's also vomiting, or if she also seems lethargic (more tired than usual) she needs veterinary attention. Call your vet and ask if you should bring a sample of the feces with you in case your veterinarian wants to do an analysis of the specimen.;
, Bring a fresh fecal sample that's less than 12 hours old. Small amounts of red blood in the stool may be a minor issue. If the stool appears black and sticky (or “tarry”), it may mean that digested blood is coming from the stomach and that a stomach ulcer may have formed. Your veterinarian will probably do some tests (blood work, fecal analysis for internal parasites, x-rays, ultrasound) and prescribe a medication.


If your veterinarian finds intestinal parasites in your cat’s stool, the appropriate medication will be prescribed. If it's not an intestinal parasite, the veterinarian may prescribe a medication to slow down the diarrhea, such as Metronidazole, Prednisolone or Tylosin.

, Bring your cat into a small room and shut the door. Hold your cat firmly in your left arm (if you're right-handed) and wrap her in a towel like a cocoon if she will let you. Give the medicine using a syringe (or eyedropper) at the side of the cat’s mouth and administer a little at a time.


Make sure the cat is swallowing the medicine and not just letting it drip out. Your veterinarian should include a syringe or eyedropper when they dispense liquid medications. It never hurts to ask for a second one just in case you need a back up.
You may want to give your cat a second syringe with a small amount of room temperature water to swallow: this will help clear the medicine taste from his mouth.

, Be sure to ask your vet how soon you should see improvement. Some chronic conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease, may need medication for months, perhaps for life.If the treatment plan is working for your cat, the diarrhea should improve or be resolved completely.


Signs of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are: weight loss, dehydration, vomiting, and diarrhea. Your veterinarian will need to run tests to determine if your cat has IBD, chronic diarrhea related to intestinal cancer, or regular diarrhea.

Watch for early signs of rabies.,
Inspect your cat for bites or signs of a fight.,
Look for signs of “dumb” or paralytic rabies.,
Be extra cautious if a cat has furious symptoms of rabies.",How to Tell if a Cat Has Rabies1," The early stage of rabies can last from two to ten days. During this time, the cat will seem sick with non-specific symptoms. Early non-specific signs of rabies include:muscle pain
restlessness
irritability
chills
fever
malaise, which is a general feeling of sickness and discomfort
photophobia, which is a fear of bright lights
anorexia, or a disinterest in food
vomiting
diarrhea
cough
inability or unwillingness to swallow;
, If you think your cat might have come in contact with a rabid animal, check to see if he has any bite marks or signs of a fight. The rabies virus can live on the cat’s skin or hair for up to two hours, so wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt and pants before handling the cat. When an infected animal bites another animal, the infected animal’s saliva may transmit rabies to the healthy animal. Once the disease enters the body, it travels via the nerves to the spinal cord and brain.Take your cat to a veterinarian right away if you notice any:


bite marks
scabs
scratches
ruffled fur with dried saliva
abscesses

, The dumb form of rabies the most common form of rabies in cats. A cat suffering from dumb form rabies will seem lethargic, confused, and sick.In this form of rabies, cats are not vicious and rarely attempt to bite. Symptoms of dumb or paralytic rabies include:paralysis (inability to move) of the legs, facial muscles, or other parts of the body
dropping of the lower jaw, leading to a “dumb” look.
excess salivation that creates a foam around the mouth
difficulty swallowing

, Cats with the furious form of rabies are often aggressive, display abnormal behavior, and will foam around the mouth. Most people think of these behaviors when they think of rabies, but the furious form of rabies is less common in cats than the paralytic form. Call animal control to assist you if you think a cat is suffering from the furious form of rabies. A cat with furious form rabies will attack, so do not attempt to capture the cat on your own. Signs of furious form rabies include:profuse salivation that looks like foam around the cat’s mouth
hydrophobia, seeming afraid to go near water or frightened by the sound of water
aggression, such as baring teeth as if ready to bite
restlessness
disinterest in food
biting or attacking
abnormal behavior, such as chewing on its own body

Understand the diagnosis process.,
Understand that a healthy cat with FIV may remain healthy for years.,
Talk to your vet about the chances of recovery your cat has if he is showing symptoms of FIV.",How to Tell if Your Cat Has FIV," FIV is a slow worker - once your cat acquires the infection (usually through fighting), the presence of the virus is not made evident until 2 to 6 months after the initial infection.


At the time of the fight, the cat may have punctures, scratches, and possibly an abscess from bacterial infection, but the FIV will not make him ill at this early stage.;
, It will only be 2 to 6 months after contracting the virus that the cat will begin to show transient symptoms such as fever, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, and appetite loss. These symptoms will pass after a week or two.


This phase coincides with the virus multiplying in the blood stream, which is known as the viraemic phase.
Once this phase subsides, the cat will return to full health and can remain apparently healthy for months, or even years, before the FIV makes him ill again.

, In the secondary phase of infection, illness is caused by the virus gradually attacking the white cells used to fight off infection.


As a result, the cat's immune system is weakened and simple infections may run out of control.
This is known as the secondary phase of FIV. It can be identified by the list of symptoms described below.

, Even in full health, a cat's mouth is full of bacteria. However, without a healthy immune system to hold them in check, the bacteria start to multiply, resulting in an inflamed mouth (stomatitis) and/or sore gums (gingivitis).

, Rhinitis refers to the infection of the nasal passages. The nose acts as a filter for bacteria in the air. When the immune system is weak, it allows opportunistic bacterial invaders to set up infection in the nasal chambers.


Chest infections can also occur during this secondary phase of infection. This occurs as part of a similar process to rhinitis, where inhaled bacteria grow out of control.

, Fungi are all around us in the environment. This is not usually a problem because the immune system polices the skin and stops fungal infections from taking hold.


However, a compromised immune system means conditions like ringworm and fungal infections can more easily get a grip.
Poor skin immunity also allows the normal bacteria on the skin's surface to grow out of control and set up bacterial infections.

, During the secondary phase of FIV infection, the bacterial balance within the cat's gut is not kept in check. This causes bacterial overgrowth which can lead to diarrhea.

, When a cat has been infected with FIV, viruses which don't normally cause a problem may take advantage of their weakened immune system, causing secondary infections, such as cowpox. Cowpox causes inflamed, ulcerated sores on the skin.

, If your cat is ill and the vet suspects FIV, the first test will be an in-house ELISA test. The vet will draw about 1 milliliter (0.03  fl oz) of blood from the cat, then send if off to the lab for testing. The results are usually back within 15 minutes.


If the test is negative but the cat has a history suggestive of FIV exposure, a second test should be run 6 weeks later.
Only if this second test is also negative can the vet definitely say the cat does not have FIV.

, This test is done at an external laboratory and can take up to a week to get the results back. PCR tests detect tiny amounts of viral DNA in the cat's blood. A positive test means the cat has the FIV virus in his blood stream.


Due to the risk of false positives, a positive result from this test should be confirmed via another type of test as a fail-safe. Most vets send the blood sample to a commercial laboratory for a PCR test, which looks for fragments of viral DNA.
If this is positive, then sadly the cat has FIV. If the PCR test is negative, it is possible your cat is fighting off the infection. In this circumstance a repeat ELISA test in 6-weeks' time should come back negative, meaning your cat was exposed to the FIV but his immune system fought it and won.

, Diagnosing FIV is a complex process, but in summary the following combination of test results indicate that a cat is actively infected with FIV and may become ill as a result in the future. Any one of the following indicates active infection:


A single ELISA test positive result, followed by a PCR positive result
Two ELISA positive results, confirmed by a PCR positive result.
A positive PCR result.

, A cat that is well at the time of diagnosis may stay in good health for years and years.


But even if your cat is healthy, it's important to keep in mind that FIV weakens the body's immune system and he will be more vulnerable to straightforward infections developing complications. However, prompt treatment with antibiotics at the first sign of sickness is usually sufficient to prevent this.
More and more FIV positive cats are living into old age, and frequently FIV cats do not die from their infection but from other causes - including old age!

, If your cat was tested because he was ill and is not responding as expected to treatment, then the future is less certain. If he already has complications (such a pneumonia) these secondary infections could easily overwhelm his immune system.


Talk to your vet about his chances of recovery. You cat may have a chance with supportive care (intravenous fluids and antibiotics), but if he has developed serious issues (such a complete depletion of his white cell reserves) then he may already have permanent damage and not be able to win this fight.

Take note if your cat is less easily startled.,
Place your cat in a quiet room away from any distraction in order to test her hearing.,
Watch to see what happens.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Deaf1," If you notice that your cat no longer wakes up and runs away when you vacuum around her, then there is a chance that she may be deaf, particularly if she always used to run away from the vacuum (or other loud gadgets).;
, Make a noise outside of your cat's visual field (so she cannot see you). One option is to bang two pan lids together. Another option is to shake the box of cat treats that your cat loves.The most important part is to stand somewhere your cat cannot see you.
You should also avoid standing in a position where the noise you make (such as banging to pots together) does not cause a breeze to rush over your cat.

, If your cat turns her hear to look towards where the noise came from, or reacts in some other ways (such as becoming startled), then you will know that your cat is not completely deaf.However, you should still take your cat to a vet, as this test cannot tell you if your cat is partially deaf, or if she is deaf in one ear.

Take your cat to the vet as soon as you can because early treatment can be critical in preventing overall blindness or catching a dangerous condition that may have led to the symptoms you’ve observed., Make as few changes as you can to your cat’s environment. This will help it adjust to its lack of sight. Avoid moving food and water dishes and litter boxes so your cat can easily find them.You can also lower the furniture or provide ramps for it to more easily climb onto furniture.
Keep your floors clutter-free to help your cat move around more easily.

, Escort your cat if you take it outdoors and make sure to keep it in an enclosed area. Otherwise, keep your cat inside to protect it. Keep windows and doors closed to keep it indoors. Similarly, board up any pet doors.

, Microchip your cat in case it leaves home. Also make sure your cat has a collar and tags. Add a tag that notes your cat is blind or has limited sight., Try not to make loud noises or startle your cat. Do your best to stay calm around it and to keep it calm. Also warn family members, especially children, and visitors not to make loud noises or do anything that can scare your cat.

This period of heat can last as long as three weeks, though visible symptoms usually don't last this long.A cat in heat will often act very affectionate, rubbing herself against people and inanimate objects and rolling around in a playful frenzy.

, A cat in heat will often show sexual affection by getting into a ""presenting"" stance, or a crouching body position — her rear will be elevated, her tail will be raised or placed at one side, and her head will be held low to the ground. This is especially common in the presence of male cats.When a female cat goes into the crouching position, she will likely also tread or paddle with her back feet. She will lift each back foot quickly, like she is walking in place. This is thought to attract males during heat because this causes the female cat’s genitals to jiggle up and down as she walks.

, A cat in heat will let out loud, yowling meows and other bleating noises. These vocalizations will typically start just after the onset of heat and grow in intensity over time. At their worst, these calls may be very frequent and may even sound pained or distressed, though the cat is not in any real danger.Other, less-common calls may range from quieter, inquiring mews to agitated screeches.

, An indoor cat who goes into heat may suddenly adopt the habits of an outdoor cat. Cats in heat will often want to get outside so they can find a mate and may resort to behaviors like pawing and scratching at the door, making noises at the door, or even trying to dart outside as soon as the door is open.Keep a close eye on the cat whenever you enter or leave the house. If your cat escapes from the house, she may come home pregnant as she is not spayed.

, A cat who is not spayed will use her urine to let potential mates know when she is in heat. Urine marking is a common reproductive trait in female cats and can be prevented by getting the cat spayed. The cat may urine mark indoors or outdoors, especially in the presence of male cats., Female cats who are not spayed may also have vaginal discharge that is clear and watery or tinged with blood during heat. You may notice this discharge after the cat has been in heat for awhile. She will likely get into the “presenting” stance and tread before she starts to release the discharge."

Consider any changes to the cat's food.,
Consider if your cat has food allergies.,
Gradually introduce a new diet.,
Use Metamucil.,
Add probiotics to your cat’s diet.,
Offer plenty of water.",How to Stop Your Cat's Diarrhea2," If the diarrhea happened within a day or so of changing cat foods or introducing a new food, it could be the new diet. Go back to the old food that was not causing problems and the stool may go back to normal. When the stool is firmed up, try changing the diet very gradually, a little new food at a time.

, If you suspect your cat is allergic to her food, try changing her diet. Food sensitivities (allergies) do occur in cats and may cause diarrhea. So, when changing the diet, make sure the new food has very different ingredients than the old food, otherwise, there may not be much difference to the cat at all.


Your veterinarian can also discuss with you trying a high fiber diet for your cat. This may include the use of a prescription diet available only through veterinary channels, and not found on the pet store shelves. Royal Canin, Hill’s Prescription Diets and Purina pet food companies have a veterinary-only subset of diets created for special medical conditions.

, For some pets, you might slowly introduce a new food. A good ratio might be 90 percent current food and 10 percent new food. Gradually increase the amount until you reach all new food in about 10 days. Let your kitty tell you how fast you can switch to the new diet.


Other cats may prefer adding 10% new food and remaining at that ratio for 3-5 days before adding in 10% more. There is no hard and fast rule and it is not a race.

, Adding half a teaspoon of unflavored Metamucil into your cat's food once or twice a day for 5-7 days may help firm things up. Canned plain pumpkin may do the same thing. Both Metamucil and canned pumpkin are high in fiber.

, Probiotics add good intestinal “bugs” back into the gastrointestinal system to help rebalance a system that is out of sorts with the diarrhea.An easy and tasty option is FortiFlora for cats, an over the counter (OTC) Purina product.

, Water loss can be significant with ongoing diarrhea and your pet can get dehydrated. To detect dehydration, gently pinch the normally loose skin at the back of the neck. When a cat is normally hydrated, the skin snaps right back down. If the pinched skin smooths out slowly, or remains tented, the cat is dehydrated. If the cat appears to be dehydrated, take her to the vet right away.

Call animal control if you spot a cat that seems infected.,
Take your cat to see a veterinarian.,
Request a rabies booster shot for your cat.,
Be aware that euthanasia may be necessary.",How to Tell if a Cat Has Rabies2," Do not attempt to capture a rabid cat on your own. If you see signs that a cat might be infected, it is best to call animal control. This way the cat can be taken to a veterinarian without putting you at risk for a bite.


You should also contact animal control if your own cat is behaving in a strange or aggressive manner., If your cat has been bit by a cat or some other animal, place him in a carrier and bring him to a veterinarian as soon as possible.The veterinarian will ask you questions about possible rabies exposure (recent smell of skunk in your yard, exposure to raccoons, any bats in the area) and examine your cat.


Keep in mind that there is no live animal test to determine whether or not an animal has rabies. The brain has to be removed from the body. To make a rabies diagnosis, small sections of the brain will be examined under a microscope to look for the presence of Negri bodies., If your cat has been previously vaccinated against rabies, he will have a booster shot of the vaccine as soon as possible after he is bit. This will help his immune system fight off the virus. He will also have to be observed for signs of rabies for 45 days. This can often be done at home as long as your cat will be confined and will not have any contact with any animals or humans outside of the household., If a cat has not been vaccinated against rabies and is bitten by a confirmed rabid animal, euthanasia is often recommended.This is because rabies is a serious threat to human health and there is a high chance that the cat will become rabid.


If the owner refuses to euthanize the cat, then it will need to be quarantined and observed for six months. This quarantine must take place at a veterinary clinic at the owner’s cost.
If the cat does not succumb to rabies during this time, then he will be allowed to come home. He will just need to have a rabies vaccine one month prior to release.

"
"
Make sure that your cat is up to date on vaccinations.,
Keep your cat inside.,
Discourage wild animals from coming into your yard.",How to Tell if a Cat Has Rabies3," Getting your cat vaccinated against rabies is the best, most cost effective way to prevent this disease. In many countries, rabies vaccinations are required by law.


Set up a regular vaccination schedule with your veterinarian to keep your cat’s rabies vaccine up-to-date. Some vaccines need to be administered yearly, every two years, or every three years., Another way to protect your cat from rabies is to keep him from away from wild animals. Keeping your cat in the house is ideal because your cat will not be exposed to neighborhood cats, raccoons, or other animals that might be carrying rabies.


If your cat is accustomed to going outside, then only allow him outside under your close watch. Don’t let your cat go near any unfamiliar animals., Wild animals are common carriers of rabies. If your yard is not appealing to wild animals, then there will be less of a chance of your cat coming into contact with rabid animals. Some things that you can do to keep wild animals out of your yard include:placing tight lids on all of your garbage cans
making sure there are no hiding spots for skunks or raccoons, such as under your deck or house
putting in a fence to keep wandering animals out of your yard
keeping trees and shrubs pruned

Understand the BAER test.,
Be aware that your cat will have electrodes placed on her head.,
Talk to your vet about whether or not your cat will need to be sedated.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Deaf2," The BAER (Brainstem auditory evoked response) test monitors electrical activity in the brain that is caused by auditory stimulation (such as hearing pans banging together). This test helps a vet to see if your cat’s brain has actually registered a sound, and if one or both ears are involved.If your vet does not have BAER test equipment, ask about auditory centers that may be able to help you.

, Three small electrodes will be attached to your cat’s head. The machine will then produce a series of clicking sounds that are generated at a range of frequencies.


The electrodes will help to monitor your cat’s brain’s responses to the clicks.

, Good natured cats can usually go through with a short test while fully conscious. This short test only checks to see if your cat is fully deaf or not.A full hearing test that gives detailed answers as to the severity of the deafness, and whether or not both ears are affected, generally takes 20 to 30 minutes. Cats usually need to be sedated for this longer test.

"
"
Consider alternative ways of living to keep your deaf cat safe.,
Give your cat a playmate who is not deaf.,
Learn to communicate with your cat by using hand signals.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Deaf3," You may wish to consider keeping her as an indoor cat, to protect her from the hazard of traffic that she cannot hear.


An alternative is to build a secure outdoor run so she has some access to fresh air, but won’t have access to any streets.

, Some cat owners have had good experiences using a normal, ""hearing"" cat as a playmate for the deaf cat.The body language of the hearing cat provides visual clues to the deaf cat that something has just happened.


For instance, the hearing cat is aware ‘Mom has just opened the fridge door to get dinner out’ and rushes into the kitchen. The deaf cat, seeing his companion go, follows out of interest. This can work surprisingly well when one cat learns to take the lead. However, this depends on the two cats getting along, which cannot be guaranteed!

, Develop your own visual code for your cat, such as beckoning as a cue for your cat to come to you (reward her compliance with a treat) or by pointing to a certain spot to get her to go there and away from trouble. Reward positive behavior with a treat and she will quickly learn to obey.


You can also stamp on the floor to create vibrations.

"
"
Be aware that white-coated cats are more likely to become deaf.,
Consider the percentages.,
Understand that age can also play a factor.",How to Tell if Your Cat Is Deaf4," In particular, this applies to white-coated cats (this means cats that are entirely white) whose eyes are either both blue, both orange, or one of each color. Their deafness is linked to a fault in the ""W""- white coat pigment gene.

, It is thought that 25% of these cats are totally deaf, 50% are deaf in just one ear, and 25% have normal hearing.Breeds that commonly have the W-gene include:


White Oriental Shorthair, White Persian, White Exotic Shorthair, White Manx, White British Shorthair, White Devon Rex, White American Shorthair, White Cornish Rex, White American Wirehair, Foreign White, White Turkish Angora, European White, and White Scottish Fold.

, Just like humans, cats often experience at least a small amount of deafness as they get older.

Purchase a comfort bag.,
Place the comfort bag’s neck opening over your cat’s head.,
Fasten the neck opening.,
Zip up the long zipper.,
Try an alternative method of putting your cat in the comfort bag.,
Trim your cat’s nails.,
Give your cat eye drops.,
Clean and medicate your cat’s ears.,
Administer oral medication to your cat.,
Stay with your cat when she is in the bag.,
Remain cautious when your cat is in the comfort bag.,
Adjust the tightness of the comfort bag as needed.",How to Use a Cat Comfort Bag," Comfort bags are designed to hold a cat comfortably and allow you to safely access different parts of her body, depending on what you need to do (e.g., trim her nails, put medication in her eyes or ears). They are typically made of thick canvas or nylon,and have various openings to access the different body parts.Cat comfort bags are available online and at your local pet store.
In general, there is a neck opening that can be loosened and tightened and a long zipper that runs down the middle of the bag.
Although all cat comfort bags generally work in the same way, there may be specific design variations. Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure how to decide which one would be best for your cat.;
, Putting your cat in a comfort bag can be challenging,so do not be surprised if your cat is not exactly a willing participant in the process. The first thing you will need to do is get the bag over her head. With your cat sitting on a table or other flat and sturdy surface, loosen the neck opening of the bag and slip her head through the opening.


The rest of the bag should be hanging loosely down her back.
Make sure the long zipper is unzipped before putting your cat’s head through the neck opening.

, The specifics on fastening the neck opening may vary from one bag design to the other, but the general idea is to tighten the opening so your cat cannot wiggle one of her legs through it. Do not tighten it too much, though! Your cat may have trouble breathing if you make the neck opening too tight.Test the tightness of the neck opening by putting one finger into the opening. That one finger should fit easily, but snugly, through the opening.Adjust the opening accordingly if it is too tight or too loose.

, With your cat’s head secured, either flip her on her back or lift her up (without flipping her on back) to zip up the long zipper that runs the length of the bag.You may have to try both ways, depending on how resistant your cat is to being put in the bag. Gently maneuver her legs and tail into the bag, which may be a little tricky if your cat is particularly squirmy.


The zipper should be running down her belly.When you zip up the bag, be careful not to get any of her fur caught in the zipper., If draping the bag over your cat’s neck isn’t working, you can try putting the rest of her body in the bag first. Put the bag on the table with the long zipper open, and put your cat in the middle of the bag.Gently tuck her legs and tail into the bag, pull up the sides of the bag around her, and zip her up with the long zipper running the length of her back.Once again, be careful not to get her fur caught in the zipper.
With her body snugly in the bag, drape the neck opening over her neck and tighten., With your cat snugly in the bag, you will probably have an easier time trimming her nails. Depending on the design of the bag, you may have to unzip a small zipper to open a small access hole through which you will pull one of your cat’s legs.Touch and massage your cat’s claws to relax her before you start trimming her nails.There are different options for nail clippers, including human nail clippers, and pet-specific ‘guillotine’ or ‘scissor’ style clippers.Use whichever type you are comfortable with.
Take your cat’s paw in one hand and gently squeeze with your thumb and finger on the joint just behind the nail to extend the nail.
Trim just the tip of the nail. This will prevent you from accidentally cutting the quick, which would be very painful for your cat and cause the nail to bleed.If the nail starts to bleed, dab the tip of it in some cornstarch or styptic powder (available at your local pharmacy)., Cats do not like things going in their eyes,so having your cat safely restrained in the comfort bag will make the process go a little more smoothly. Hold her in your lap, with your non-dominant arm draped across her body, to make her feel more comfortable.Cup your cat’s head in your non-dominant hand, with your thumb and other fingers under her lower jaw.Tilt her head upward. Pull the bottom of the eyelid down with the thumb of your non-dominant hand.Administer the prescribed number of drops into her eye,making sure not to touch her eye with the applicator tip.Give your cat a treat after you give her the eye drops., To handle your cat’s ears, hold her in lap as you would if you were giving her eye drops. Wrap your non-dominant hand around the side of your cat’s head, opposite of the ear you want to work on. Use the thumb of that hand to hold down the ear. To clean the ear, use the ear cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian.Squeeze some drops onto the inside of the earflap, as well as down into the ear canal. Your cat may start shaking her head, creating a mess as the solution flies out of her ear.Gently massage the base of your cat’s ear with your thumb and index finger to ensure the solution reaches down into her ear.Use a cotton ball to gently swab the inside of her ear to remove any debris or discharge.To medicate her ears, use the same method as you did to clean her ears.Make you give the medication after her ears are clean.

, Having your cat in a comfort bag will make it a little easier to give your cat a pill, but be aware that she could still try to bite you. To give her a pill, position her such that her body is facing away from you. Place your non-dominant hand on top of her head, with your thumb and fingers facing down on either side of her to keep her head still. Tilt her head upward.With your dominant hand, hold the pill between your thumb and index finger and use your middle finger to pull down on her lower jaw and open her mouth.Once you have her mouth open, quickly place the pill as far back on the center of her tongue as you can manage without getting bitten. Hold her mouth closed and rub on her throat to get her to swallow the pill.Don’t be surprised if she spits the pill back out. You can keep trying if your cat isn’t biting you.

, You may be safely out of harm’s way—mostly—with your cat in the bag, but that does not mean you should leave her to her own devices. For example, if you fastened the neck opening too tightly and your cat begins to struggle, she could make it very difficult for herself to breathe. Plus, if she’s clever enough, she may be able to figure out a way to poke a leg through an opening.


It is very important that you not leave your cat unattended when she is in the comfort bag., Keep in mind that you are not 100% safe from bites and scratches when your cat is in the comfort bag. She could still bite you if you are giving her oral medication, and she may even try to take a swipe at you if you have one of her legs out. Even when restrained, your cat will still have her self-preservation instinct, and will try to do anything she can to protect herself.Letting your guard could result in you getting scratched or bitten.

, Comfort bags are extremely useful, but only when they are used properly. If the bag is too tight, your cat could start panicking. A bag that is too loose would not restrain your cat enough.If you are using the comfort bag for the first time, pay close attention to how well your cat is restrained and make adjustments accordingly.


Your cat may not like being in the bag, but she may tolerate it more if she’s comfortable when she is inside of it.

Position your cat.,
Move the fur out of the way, if necessary.,
Check for the testicles.,
Measure the length between the anus and penis.,
Look for it in writing.,
Check his ear.,
Look at his lower body fur.,
Notice if his urine smells particularly bad.,
Ask your veterinarian.",How to Tell If a Cat Is Neutered," To check your cat yourself, you need to have access to his buttocks area in order to examine his genital region. You should position your cat with his rear end toward you. Once he is positioned, you need to pull his tail straight up so you can see his genital region. You may need to get someone to help you if you think your cat will squirm around while you do this.


You can stroke your cat's back and talk to him to make him put up his tail on his own. This way, you won't have to hold it and he will be more relaxed.You might also want to put on a pair of latex gloves since you are going to be feeling around your cat's genitals. Make sure they are thin enough that you can still feel through them.;
, If your cat is fluffy, you may need to move excess fur out of the way to see the genital region. Move the fur out of the way to look underneath at the genital region. Once you spread the fur between his legs, you should see his penis and anus.


Make sure you are careful and don't push too hard. You don't want to hurt your cat.
If your cat is short haired, you may not need this step because this area will be obvious without having to move any fur around.
If you cat is calm or docile, you may be able to do this with him lying on his back. If you try this, grab the scruff of his neck and turn him over. This will keep him in place and help protect your hands and arms in case he lashes out at you with his claws., When your cat gets neutered, he has his testicles removed. Because of this, you can feel this area to see if your cat has been neutered. Look for his testicle sac, which is located below the tail and anus and above the penis. There should be a small bag there. Pick it up and gently feel what's inside. If there are hard balls inside, your cat still has his testicles and he is not neutered. If the sac is soft, he most likely has been neutered recently. This is usually accompanied by a shaved scrotum as well.


If there is no sac to be held, he may have been neutered more than a month ago and the sac has gone flat.
If you find one testicle, your cat has not been neutered.
This is not a 100% guarantee that your cat has been neutered. If you cat is young, he also may not have dropped his testicles yet. He also may suffer from cryptorchidism, a condition where neither of the testicles have dropped., There is another way you can check to see if your cat has been neutered. Pull up his tail. Measure the spacing between his anus and his penis. If the area is more than 1 inch wide, then your cat has likely been neutered.


If your cat is young, the spacing needs to be a little over 1/2 an inch., When you're buying or adopting a cat or kitten, ask if he comes with any paperwork. There may be a certificate or letter from a vet to prove that the cat has been neutered.


Also don't be afraid to ask. If you are buying the cat from a pet store or adoption agency that doesn't give you any paperwork, ask them if they know if your new cat has been neutered. It is not an indelicate question and makes you more responsible as an owner., If there is no information available when you adopt your cat, or if you found a stray cat, you can check his inner ear for tattoos. Check for tattoos or clipped ears. These signs usually mean the cat has been neutered.


There is one tattoo that doesn't mean he has been neutered. If you see a letter M, that means the cat has been micro-chipped., When you pick up the cat, look at the fur around his lower body. If it is shaved or if it looks shorter than the rest of his fur, he may have been neutered. Vets have to shave off the fur in that area before performing the neutering operation, so it can be an indication.


This is not a foolproof method, so you should try another method in addition to this one., Intact tom cats produce a particularly pungent and offensive smelling urine. If your cat produces very smelly urine, then he may be intact or just recently neutered., If you have tried all other methods and are still not sure, you should ask your veterinarian if the cat has been neutered. She will be able to tell you because she can look for things on your cat that you might not be aware of.


Let them know when you go in what your concern is. If you find out that your cat isn't neutered, you should make an appointment to get it done as soon as possible."

Look for other symptoms.,
Visit the vet.,
Expect an eye examination.,
Ask about blood tests and other tests.",How to Treat a Cat for Eye Inflammation1," If you've noticed eye inflammation, you should look for additional symptoms your cat may be having. For instance, your cat may have discharge around the eyes. The cat may also squint, rub its eye, or have more tears than normal.Other symptoms may include sensitivity to light, a change to the shape or size of the pupil, or color changes in the eye.It's important to note other symptoms because that will help the vet narrow down the specific cause, making it easier to treat the problem.;
, If you notice your cat has eye inflammation, your first step should be to take the cat to the vet. The vet will be able to narrow down the cause and help you decide on a treatment., While examining your cat, the vet will need to perform an eye examination. Often, that will include a dye test, where the vet puts a dye in your cat's eye. Then the vet can better see into the eye, making it easier to diagnose the problem., Blood tests may be needed to help diagnose any underlying conditions. While a cause cannot always be found, a blood test can at least help narrow down the possibilities. Your cat may need other tests as well, such as a urine test."
"
Use anti-inflammatories.,
Discuss if the vet needs to remove a foreign object.,
Give your cat antibiotic eye drops.",How to Treat a Cat for Eye Inflammation2," The first step for treatment is anti-inflammatories. These can be applied topically or given as a pill. Your vet may also inject some into or near the eye to help treat the condition., In some cases, the cause of the inflammation is something your cat got in its eye. The cat will likely need to be sedated before the vet removes the object., Often, antibiotic eye drops will be needed to help treat the problem, particularly if the vet removed a foreign object or if they eye has been scratched at all. The eye drops will help reduce the chance of infection."
"
Ask about antiviral treatments.,
Give your cat antibiotics.,
Discuss if anti-fungals are appropriate.,
Treat allergies.,
Understand surgery may be necessary.",How to Treat a Cat for Eye Inflammation3," Often, the underlying cause will be a viral infection. If that's the case, the cat will need to be given antivirals to treat that condition. However, not all viral infections can be treated directly through medication.Typical viral infections include herpes and calici. Herpes is usually treated with L-lysine (an amino acid supplement), famcyclovir (an antiviral), trifluridine (antiviral eye drops), and/or betadine (antiviral eye drops). These medications will not completely eradicate the disease, but they will help lessen its effects and the possibility of recurrence.
With the calici virus, treatment will be focused on the symptoms, including pain medications and antibiotics to prevent other infections.

, Your vet will often recommend antibiotics, particularly if the inflammation is caused by an injury or an underlying bacterial infection (cold). Antibiotics are also given to help ward off other infections.Mycoplasma, bordatella, and chlamydia can all be treated with antibiotics.

, At times, anti-fungals may be necessary to treat the underlying problem. For instance, if the cat has a fungal infection on its eyelids, the vet may prescribe an anti-fungal cream to help treat the issue., Allergies can be a cause of eye inflammation, and therefore, treating the allergies can help. Your vet may recommend an antihistamine to diminish the cat's reactions to allergens. Steroids can also be useful on occasion.Ask the vet about an omega-3 fatty acid supplement, which may help your cat's allergies.
You can also take steps to minimize allergens by limiting your cat's exposure to the outdoors, as well as changing up the cat's food to find one your cat doesn't react to.

, In some cases of inflammation, such as uveitis, your cat may need surgery. Generally, your cat will need surgery if it has a more serious underlying condition, such as cancer, in which case the eye may need to be removed.Another condition where your cat will need surgery is if the lens moves out of place. The vet will need to put it back."

Look for signs of dehydration by checking to see if your cat’s skin “tents”.,
Encourage your cat to drink if she can keep some fluids down.,
Give your cat an electrolyte replacement solution.,
Consider hydrating your cat with a syringe.,
Seek medical care if your cat vomits every time she drinks water.",How to Treat Vomiting Accompanied by Diarrhea in a Cat1," When an animal is dehydrated, her skin loses its elasticity. You can check to see if your cat is dehydrated by lifting the scruff off of her shoulders with your finger and thumb. If:


The skin flops back into position immediately, your cat is hydrated.
The skin remains peaked and slowly slides back down out of its tent-like position, your cat is dehydrated.;
, Provide clean fresh drinking water within reach of your cat’s bed.


When they are ill, some cats prefer the taste of mineral water to tap water (because it has less chlorine in it and cats dislike the taste of chlorine), and will sip on mineral water even if they refuse tap water, so consider trying to give your cat different kinds of water.

, These solutions include Diarolyte or Pedialyte, which are made for humans but can be given to cats. These solutions are mixed with water (normally 500 ml, but read the package) and are used to replenish lots electrolytes.


Some cats don’t like the salty taste of these solutions. If this is the case with your cat, switch her back to water.

, If your cat is having a hard time drinking, and you happen to have a sterilized syringe at your house, give your cat water via syringe. Place the nozzle of the syringe behind your cat’s canine teeth. Press the plunger down slowly in order to give your cat time to swallow.


An average sized cat, weighing between three to five kg, requires 180 to 300 ml of water a day to meet maintenance needs. Try giving your cat 5 to 10 ml of water every half an hour., For a cat with gastroenteritis, dehydration is a sign that fluid loss exceeds fluid gain and it is essential to redress this balance. If your cat vomits each time she drinks, or is unable to hold fluid down, then do not delay and seek urgent veterinary attention.


A veterinarian will make a judgment call as to whether intravenous fluids need to be given to your cat based on your cat's demeanor (how alert or lethargic she is), how long she has been vomiting and expelling diarrhea, and the degree of dehydration. Intravenous fluids are given via a catheter which is placed in the vein in your cat's front leg. It can take between 24 and 48 hours to rehydrate your cat.

Place your cat’s paw under cool water.,
Inspect the footpad.,
Apply pressure to the wound.,
Clean the wound.,
Bandage the wound.,
Tape a plastic bag over the paw.,
Change the bandage every day.",How to Treat Torn Footpads in Cats1," The water pressure should be low, not high; high water pressure can increase pain. The water will help clear away dirt and debris from your cat’s paw.If your cat resists you or is prone to scratching, then wrap your cat in a towel with just its head and the injured paw exposed.;
, Inspect your cat’s paw for foreign objects such as pebbles, burrs, and metal or glass shards. If you spot any foreign objects that can be easily removed with tweezers, then remove them with disinfected tweezers.Disinfect the tweezers by swabbing the tip of the tweezers with alcohol.
If the foreign object is deeply lodged in your cat’s footpad, do not remove it with tweezers. Take your cat to the vet and have the vet remove it instead.

, Use a clean cloth or towel to apply gentle pressure to the wound. Hold the towel on the wound for one to two minutes. Minor cuts and scrapes will stop bleeding after a couple of minutes. Deeper cuts may take five to ten minutes to stop bleeding.If the wound keeps bleeding after 10 to 15 minutes, then take your cat to the vet to have the wound checked out.

, Do this once the bleeding has slowed or stopped. Make an antibacterial solution by mixing warm water with a mild antibacterial soap. Fill a syringe with the solution. Squirt the solution onto the scrape until it is clean. Then rinse the paw with warm water.For the first three to five days, you should clean the wound two or three times a day.

, Place a couple of gauze pads on the wound to form a cushion. Secure the gauze with medical tape or a self-sticking product. Starting at the toes, begin to wrap the tape around your cat’s foot. Make sure to wrap all the way up to your cat’s ankle in order to secure the bandage in place.Avoid wrapping the bandage too tight. You should be able to stick two fingers between the bandage and your cat’s leg.
If the cut is very minor, then bandaging may not be necessary.

, You can use a regular Ziploc bag or another clear, plastic bag. Place the bag over the paw and use medical tape to secure it in place.The plastic bag will keep the bandage clean and dry. It will also prevent your cat from picking at the bandage.

, Each time you change the bandage, inspect your cat’s paw for healing and any signs of an infection. If your cat’s paw is swollen, oozing pus, or has a foul odor, then it may be infected, or the bandage may be wrapped too tightly. Take your cat to the vet if you notice any of these signs.If the wound is still bleeding after three days, then take your cat to the vet to have its footpad checked out.

Your vet has likely already diagnosed your cat's IBS through a series of tests and procedures. Usually, IBS is diagnosed through gradually ruling out other causes and taking an extensive survey of your cat's medical history.Treatment for IBS is oftentimes confusing as there's no single cure or approach that works across the board. Usually, treatment involves a combination of medication, dietary adjustments, or lifestyle change. Treatment is sometimes trial and error. Your vet will advise a variety of approaches and if one method fails you'll try another.Listen to your vet closely and ask her any questions you have regarding your cat's treatment. With medications especially, you need to know the proper protocol for administration, dosage, and storage.;
, Usually, the primary route of treatment involves the use of corticosteroids. Your veterinarian will prescribe a particular type of steroid and you'll monitor your cat to see if symptoms improve.


Prednisolone is the most commonly prescribed corticosteroid for cats. It has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce symptoms of IBS.Corticosteroids have a fairly high success rate, alleviating symptoms in approximately 85% of cats.Corticosteroids are usually given orally and for 3 to 4 month intervals. If your cat has flare ups after you discontinue steroid use, your vet might prescribe another round of steroids or she might try other treatment options.Your cat should be monitored closely by veterinary professionals when on steroids. Corticosteroids can lead to immunosuppression and diabetes. However, most cats do well on steroids if they're given in the right dosage and on a proper schedule. Usually, a high dose is used initially and the dosage tapers off over time.Cats can be difficult about taking medications orally, and sometimes vomit up meds. If you're worried about your cat taking pills, you can ask your vet about injecting steroids via syringes instead., Antibiotics are usually prescribed if a combination of dietary changes and corticosteroids is not adequately addressing symptoms.


Antibiotics work because bacteria is sometimes a causal factor in IBS. Metronidazole and azithromycin are the most often prescribed types of antibiotics.Side effects are uncommon, but some cats do vomit in response to the meds. This is usually due to their taste., Usually, immunosuppressive drugs are added to a treatment regimen if corticosteroids and antibiotics fail to yield results.


Immunosuppressive drugs are quite potent but they can alleviate symptoms in some cats. Like other treatment options, they are taken orally.Immunosuppressive drugs are a last ditch treatment option for a reason. They are very strong and can suppress bone marrow in some cats. Your cat will need regular veterinary checkups while on immunosuppressives. If your vet recommends ceasing use, do so immediately., Ask your vet about introducing dietary supplements to your cat's diet. If she thinks this may help, and it won't interfere with other medications, it's a possibility.


As bacteria plays a strong role in IBS, medications that encourage the growth of certain bacterium such as prebiotics and probiotics might result in a reduction of symptoms. Ask your vet where you can find the proper supplements and how to safely administer them to your cat.Other dietary supplements can be found in health stores, and combination pills that mix together a variety of homeopathic cures might be the easiest route for treatment. Just make sure you consult your vet before any changes to your cat's treatment or diet., Food allergy can be one of the contributing factors to IBS in cats. Choosing foods that are hypoallergenic in nature can alleviate symptoms.


Your vet will likely recommend you find a protein and carbohydrate source your cat has not eaten before. Rabbit, venison, or duck-based diets are usually a good staring option as most conventional cat foods do not use these meats.Certain cat food brands, such as Royal Cainn Limited Ingredients Diet, use hypoallergenic products only. You might want to switch to this brand of cat food and see if symptoms improve., Low residue foods are designed to be easy to digest and absorb, lessening bowel issues related to IBS.


Most conventional cat food brands offer a low residue option, but might not be labeled as low residue. Instead, the company might use labels like ""Scientific Formula."" Ask your veterinarian what brands and categories of cat food you should buy if you're trying a low residue diet.Iams provides foods that are specifically labeled low residue and made for cats with intestinal problems. This might be a good route. If a low residue brand is not available in the store, you can order a bag online., Fiber is key in many species, cats included, for regular and smooth bowel movements. Upping your cat's fiber intake could improve some of the diarrhea and stomach discomfort related to IBS.


Many brands of cat food, such as Royal Cainn, are labeled high fiber. They might be difficult to find in department stores, as most owners do not prioritize a cat's fiber instinct, but you can always make the purchase online., Regular physical activity improves colon function and can lessen symptoms of IBS.If you have an outdoor cat, he might get a lot of exercise playing and running outside. Make sure he's going outdoors a few times a week. If weather, such as rain or snow, prohibits him from getting outside make sure you replace his outdoor exercise with indoor exercise that day.
Cats, unlike dogs, are generally not walked. The bulk of physical activity therefore comes in the form of indoor play. You should provide your cat with a variety of toys and throw, pull, or dangle them for him each day to engage his interest. Aim for 15 to 20 minutes of play a day. If your cat is higher energy, and doesn't seem tired out at the end of 20 minutes, play with him until he loses interest.If your cat is good with other animals, you might consider getting another cat. Cats tend to be more physically active when they live in groups as they run and play with one another. However, if your cat has past behavioral issues related to other animals, another pet could cause stress. Stress is linked to IBS flare ups.

, Cats with IBS may experience flare-ups related to stress. Managing stress in your cat's life is important to reduce IBS symptoms.


Make sure your cat has access to a safe, private spot in your home. Cats might want to retreat from noise, especially if you have guests over, and they'll crave hiding spots like closets, cabinets, and kitty condos.Minimize changes to routine, such as feeding and sleeping times. If changes are necessary, ease your cat into transitions. If you move, for example, get your cat used to his carrying crate before you have to transport him in a new location.Always keep your litter box clean. Dirty living conditions bother cats, so excessive urine and fecal matter in a litter box can cause stress. Scoop out clumps of litter on a daily basis and once a week dump the existing litter and replace it with a clean, fresh batch., IBS is not a curable disease. Cats who suffer from IBS will have flare ups their entire lives and you need to understand the longterm prognosis for your cat.


The disease will come and go with time. Your cat may go months or even years without a flare up and then experience symptoms again. As IBS is caused by a multitude of factors, predicting and preventing flare ups is not always possible. However, if you consult your vet right away in the event of symptoms appearing, the disease can be effectively managed over time.Regular veterinary check-ups are important for any cat, but especially one with IBS. Your vet can monitor symptoms over time and adjust treatment as needed. Always take your cat in at the first sign of a flare up."

Do not feed your cat for 24 hours.,
Feed your cat bland food after the 24 hour period is up and she seems to be doing better.,
Space out your cat’s meals.,
Transition your cat back to regular food.",How to Treat Vomiting Accompanied by Diarrhea in a Cat2," Whether your cat is vomiting, has diarrhea, or is experiencing both, try to withhold food for 24 hours. However, you should provide your cat with clean drinking water as described above. Food in the stomach stimulates muscular contractions, which either then causes the stomach to contract and the cat to vomit, or the bowel to spasm and push out diarrhea. Allowing the gut to ""rest"" for 24 hours, gives uncomplicated cases of sickness and diarrhea a chance to settle down.


If the cat is still vomiting after 24 hours, then you should bring her to a vet.

, If your cat has stopped vomiting, but continues to have a small amount of diarrhea, you can begin to feed her small amounts of bland food.


A bland diet is one consisting of white meats such as chicken, turkey, rabbit, cod, or coley. Give your cat meat, rather than a meat-flavored food.
An average cat needs 250 kcal a day; this is equivalent to feeding your cat roughly 250 g of chicken breast a day., In order to allow your cat to digest, your should try to space out your cat’s meals so that she eats four to six small meals a day. This will help her stomach to adjust to the food after her illness.

, After your cat passes normal stool for 24 hours, start a gradual transition back to regular food over the course of two to three days. This transition period allows bacteria in your cat’s gut to readjust to normal food. A typical transition may look like:


Day 1: Feed ¾ bland diet and ¼ regular food.
Day 2: Feed ½ bland diet and ½ regular food.
Day 3: Feed ¼ bland diet and ¾ regular food.
Day 4: Entirely back onto regular food.

Consider giving your cat Famotidine.,
Try giving your cat a probiotic supplement.,
Try Kaolin and Pectin (Kaopectate).,
Get a prescription for Maropitant.,
Talk to your vet about atropine.",How to Treat Vomiting Accompanied by Diarrhea in a Cat3," This medication is sold as Pepcid AC. Famotidine is an H2-antagonist that inhibits acid secretion in the stomach. It helps to soothe gastric ulcers and reduce inflammation when the stomach lining is inflamed. The drug should be used with caution in cats with heart disease because it can slow the heart rate, but this is usually only a problem when given intravenously.


The dose is 0.5 mg/kg once a day, by mouth. A 5 kg cat thus requires 2.5 mg a day., A probiotic designed for cats can speed up recovery from diarrhea. Wait to start the probiotic until your cat has stopped vomiting, then mix the probiotic with the bland food once a day. This helps to repopulate the gut with the correct bacteria that aids in digestion. Repopulating the gut helps feces to firm up more quickly.


An appropriate cat probiotic is Fortiflora, which comes in a sachet. It can be mixed in food and given to your cat once a day for five days.

, Kaolin and pectin absorb toxins produced in the gut, and also line the gut wall to provide a protective barrier. Its effectiveness is questionable, but some animals do seem to benefit, so talk to your vet before giving your cat this over-the-counter medication.

, Maropitant can help to stop your cat from vomiting. The medication can be given by injection and is highly effective at relieving nausea and preventing vomiting because the drug acts on the brain and switches off the vomiting center.

, Another prescription medication is atropine. Atropine is an antispasmodic which causes the bowel to relax, and then as the effects of the atropine wear off, the bowel reverts back to a normal action.


The benefit of giving atropine to cats with diarrhea is controversial. Some veterinarians argue that the toxins are better ""out than in"" and that antispasmodics such as atropine, cause the toxins to be retained in the bowel. The counter argument is that sometimes the bowel becomes sensitive because of diarrhea that it is constantly in spasm.

Ask about treating cataracts or having them removed.",How to Treat Vision Problems in Senior Cats1," Annual vet exams are essential to maintaining the health of your senior cat. Some vision problems are associated with underlying conditions, like high blood pressure or hyperthyroidism, and only proper veterinary care can deal with these conditions.Others, like glaucoma, progress gradually and subtly, making it difficult to spot them when you check your cat’s eyes on your own., You should check your senior cat’s eyes on a weekly or biweekly basis. As a general rule, you should not have a “wait and see” attitude when it comes to cat eye problems. Bringing your cat to the vet at the first sign of vision problems could spare it significant pain and save its vision., The vet will most likely prescribe eye drops to treat infections or relieve the symptoms of glaucoma.It can be a frustrating process, but you’ll have to hold the cat down, open its eyelid, hold the dropper just above the eye (without touching it) to administer the medication, then keep the cat still for several minutes.


Ask the vet to show you firsthand how to give your cat eye drops or if they have any tips.
The vet may prescribe oral medications to treat high blood pressure, kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, and other underlying causes of vision problems. Make sure you administer any medication as directed by the vet., There are medications that can prevent or delay cataract-related blindness. Cataracts can also result from high blood pressure or diabetes, so ask the vet if they recommend treatment for these conditions. If a cataract has completely blocked light from passing through the lens, the vet might recommend surgery.Cataract surgery is usually more common in kittens and in mature cats under age 10. If you’re considering surgery for your senior cat, ask the vet, “Is my cat a qualified candidate for lens replacement? Do the risks and costs make surgery a less desirable option?”
It might be preferable to take steps to make your senior cat more comfortable instead of taking on the risks and expenses associated with surgery.

Getting your vet to diagnose the issue will ensure your cat gets the right treatment. Your vet will do a physical exam of your cat, including looking at their abdominal area. They may also run several tests to determine the cause of your cat’s bladder problems.Your vet may run a urinalysis, where they will test your cat’s urine for bacteria as well as red or white blood cells.
Your vet may also do an x-ray of your cat’s abdominal area to check for bladder stones. They may inject your cat with a special dye so the bladder is easier to see in the x-rays.;
, There are several possible causes of urinary incontinence in cats and your vet will be able to tell you which one your cat is dealing with. You should discuss your cat’s diagnosis with the vet so you understand why they are having issues with their bladder. The possible causes of urinary incontinence include:Feline diabetes: Your cat may have developed diabetes, which can cause them to drink large amounts of water. They may then try to use the litter box but fail to make it in time.
A urinary tract infection (UTI): Your cat may have a UTI, which will cause them to try to urinate but to no avail. If you think your cat as a UTI, get them to your vet right away. If left untreated, the infection can spread to your cat’s bladder, which can lead to scarred bladder or a bacterial bladder infection.
Bladder stones: Some cats are prone to bladder stones, which can cause straining when they try to urinate, constant urination, blood in their urine, and a tender abdominal area.
Old age: Older cats may become senile and forget to urinate in their litter boxes. Senior cats also have weakened muscles, making it more difficult from them to control their bladder.
Obesity: Some cats who are overweight will have difficulty controlling their bladder. You may notice your cat appears overweight, especially if you cannot see their ribs.

, Your vet will outline your cat’s treatment options, based on their diagnosis. Your cat may require medication and diligent home care to ensure they recover. Your vet may also suggest surgical intervention if your cat’s situation is dire.If your cat has diabetes, your vet will prescribe medication and dietary changes.
If your cat has a UTI, your vet will prescribe antibiotics that your cat must take until the UTI goes away.
If your cat has bladder stones, your vet may suggest surgery to remove the bladder stones. You may also need to adjust your cat’s diet.

, You should make sure your cat gets the medication prescribed to them by the vet, such as antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. Follow your vet’s instructions on dosage and make sure your cat consumes the medication.If your vet prescribes medication in pill or capsule form, place the medication in the center of a small ball of canned cat food or a piece of cheese. Try to get your cat to swallow the small ball with the medication whole, as they may not want to eat it if they bite into the medication and it leaves a bad taste in their mouth.
You can also try to place the medication in your cat’s mouth directly, though you should use caution as you do not want to get bit by your cat. To do this, hold your cat’s head from the top with your non-dominant hand, placing your fingers around your cat’s cheekbones. Then, tilt their head back so their jaw falls open.
Use your dominant hand to put the medication far back on your cat’s tongue. Then, shut their mouth and stroke their head or blow in their face to encourage them to swallow the medication.

, Your vet may recommend that you adjust your cat’s diet if they are diagnosed with diabetes or obesity. You should follow your vet’s recommendations and adjust your cat’s diet so they are not at risk of other worsening health issues. A change in diet can also help your cat gain better control of their bladder.You should make sure you cat has access to fresh water on a regular basis, as this will allow your cat to drink the water and flush out their bladder.

, You should also keep your cat’s litter box clean and dry to encourage them to go to bathroom. You may try to clean the litter box more than usual so your cat feels more comfortable urinating in their litter box.If your cat is old and senile, you may place several litter boxes around your home so your cat also more opportunities to go to the bathroom in the litter box. You may also lead your cat to their litter box if they appear to have forgotten where it is located.You may also keep your cat's litter box in a room that has hardwood, tile, or linoleum floors so that if they have an accident on the way to the litter box, it is easier to clean up.

, If your cat does not seem to be able to go to the bathroom in their litter box, your vet may recommend the use of diapers. You may need to put your cat in diapers temporarily until they recover. This will prevent accidents on your furniture or your carpet., You should schedule a follow up appointment with your vet so your cat can be examined again and tested for bladder issues. Your vet may do another urinalysis to determine if the treatment is working.If your cat appears unresponsive to treatment, your vet may run additional tests to try to identify other causes of the urinary incontinence.

, If your cat is diagnosed with obstructions in their bladder, such as bladder stones, your vet may recommend surgery to remove them. The surgery can be invasive and expensive, but it will effectively relieve your cat’s pain and discomfort.The surgery to remove bladder stones is called a cystotomy. It is performed by making an incision through your cat’s belly and removing the stones from your cat’s bladder.
Keep in mind cats who develop bladder stones have a high risk of getting them again. Your vet may recommend medication or changes to your cat’s diet to prevent the bladder stones from coming back.

, If your cat’s urinary incontinence is due to damage to their urinary tract, your vet may suggest surgery to repair your cat’s urinary tract. Though the surgery may be costly, it may be necessary if your cat’s urinary tract is damaged., Your cat may need some tender loving care after their surgery to ensure they recover well. You should limit your cat’s activity so they can heal. Keep your cat indoors, such as in a crate or a small room in your home.You may also avoid giving your cat a bath so the incision area does not get wet. Try to examine the incision area often to ensure it is healing properly.
You may need to get a pet cone so your cat does not try to lick or pick at the incision area.

Make sure you cat can access its food and water.,
Keep a litter box on each of your home’s floors.,
Avoid switching around your furniture.,
Use sound to avoid startling your cat.",How to Treat Vision Problems in Senior Cats2," You should stop letting your indoor/outdoor cat go outside if you notice signs that it’s losing its vision. All cats, especially those with vision and other health problems, are safer indoors. A cat with poor eyesight will have a harder time steering clear of threats like cars and other animals., Cats typically adapt well to vision loss by relying on their hearing, smell, and whiskers to navigate their surroundings. You should make sure it knows where its food and water bowls are located. If necessary, bring it to its food and hold its paw to feel where the bowls are set.Be sure to keep its food and water in one spot. Don’t change the location of your senior cat’s food and water.

, If your senior cat is blind or has poor eyesight, it’s best to keep it on one floor, as stairs can pose an injury risk. If your cat does move around multiple floors, keep a litter box upstairs and downstairs to prevent accidents.Senior cats often develop arthritis, so consider using litter boxes with shorter sides for easier access. Make sure your cat knows where its litter boxes are located and keep them in those locations.

, Other senses, whiskers, and memory will help your blind or vision impaired cat move around your house. However, you should do your best to make sure its environment is consistent. Avoid changing around your furniture or introducing new obstacles to your cat’s surroundings., It's easy to accidentally sneak up on a blind or visually impaired cat, so you should take steps to avoid startling it. When you approach it, call its name so it knows you're coming. Only pick it up if it knows that you're nearby and you are already interacting with it."

Look for dilated pupils and changes in night vision.,
Check for redness, crustiness, and discharges.,
Prevent eye infections by vaccinating your cat.,
Prevent your cat from becoming obese.,
Make sure your cat doesn't become underweight.",How to Treat Vision Problems in Senior Cats3," Observe your cat when it’s walking around your home. Look for aimless wandering, bumping into objects, and trouble finding its food and water bowls.See if it has any trouble following its toys, like a feather on a fishing pole, during playtime.These could indicate gradual blindness or vision loss. Having it examined by a vet will give you an accurate diagnosis. Cats adapt well to vision loss as they age, but you should take steps to make sure it can easily access it food, water, toys, and litter box.

, Look for cloudiness in one or both eyes, with or without enlargement. These signs could indicate that your cat has glaucoma. Glaucoma isn’t one specific disease, but a condition caused by blocked drainage ducts and fluid buildup that puts pressure on the optic nerve.Symptoms usually develop gradually, so they can be hard to spot. If you do notice any enlargement in one or both eyes, you should bring your cat the vet immediately.
Checking your cat’s eyes regularly at home, calling the vet at the first sign of any problems, and getting annual vet exams are the best ways to diagnose and treat glaucoma and other vision problems.
Glaucoma can be painful and cause blindness, but there are medications that can relieve the pain and reduce fluid pressure.

, Point a flashlight indirectly at your cat’s eyes and check for opaque or milky haziness in the irises, or colored parts. Whitish, milky haziness is a sign that a cataract is developing on the lens, blocking light from reaching the retina.A bluish-white haze, rather than milky and opaque, is due to lenticular sclerosis, which is when the lens starts to lose moisture. This is a normal part of aging that typically appears in cats over age 10 and rarely requires treatment.
Cataracts are less common in cats than in dogs or humans, but you should bring your cat to the vet if you spot any abnormalities.

, Notice if your cat’s pupils are always widely dilated and if it seems hesitant to enter a dark room. These could point to retinal atrophy or detachment. These conditions result from degeneration of the retina or of the tissue that holds it in place.Retinal atrophy and detachment are usually associated with high blood pressure, kidney disease, or an overactive thyroid gland. Seeing a vet promptly is vital to treating both the retinal disorder and the underlying condition that causes it., Cats’ eyes are prone to a number of treatable infections, and an older cat’s weaker immune system can make them more vulnerable. Check for signs of infection like redness, crusty buildup, discharges, and swollen third eyelids. Take note if you see your cat repeatedly pawing or scratching at its eyes.Infections like conjunctivitis and keratitis are usually treated with eyedrops. Complications don’t often develop, especially with prompt treatment.
Uveitis, or infection of the middle area of the eye, is more serious and usually leads to gradual blindness. Signs of uveitis include eye enlargement and swollen third eyelids., Eye infections are often associated with germs like feline immunodeficiency virus and feline herpesvirus. Getting your cat vaccinated when it’s young is vital to preventing vision problems and other health issues later in life.Even if you have a mature cat, talk to its vet about getting it vaccinated.

, Feeding your cat a healthy diet can help prevent kidney and heart conditions that can cause or worsen vision problems. If your cat gains weight, consider feeding it twice a day instead of leaving food out. Make sure treats account for less than 10 percent of its daily calories., Losing too much weight can also put stress on the kidneys and other organs. If your senior cat is underweight, you might have to switch its food to a higher calorie variety, like food marked for kittens. Talk to its vet about the healthiest ways to help your cat gain weight."

Use medications to repair toxin damage to the stomach wall.,
Use ACE inhibitors to prolong the life of the kidneys.,
Monitor the cat for bladder infections.,
Prevent hypertension.",How to Treat Kidney Disease in Cats1," When a cat has kidney disease, there are raised levels of urea and phosphate in the blood, which are particularly irritating to the stomach lining and the gums. This may result in ulceration, which can be seen as inflamed, ulcerated tissue on the gums or tongue. It can also produce stomach ulcers.


If the cat is vomiting, and in particular if the cat is vomiting blood, it may be assumed that the cat is suffering from gastric ulcers.
Antepsin, which contains the active ingredient sucralfate, is often prescribed in this situation. The liquid medication binds to exposed mucosa and forms a protective bandage to prevent further erosion, and allows the area to heal.
The dose is 2.5 to 5 ml (half to one teaspoon) given by mouth two or three times a day.;
, Kidney disease leads to a vicious circle whereby there is less functional tissue doing more work, which speeds up the kidney's deterioration. Drugs called ACE inhibitors, such as benazepril (Benefortin), reduce the blood pressure gradient across the kidney, which reduces one of the risk factors for deterioration. They work by dilating the arteries leading into the kidney, so that the local blood pressure falls and is less likely to cause damage.The use of ACE inhibitors increases the survival times of cats with mild to moderate kidney disease. The dose is generally 0.25 to 0.5mg/kg once daily by mouth. This is equivalent to half a 5 mg tablet once daily., Concentrated urine is a natural antiseptic and produces a hostile environment for bacteria. Unfortunately, cats with kidney disease form weak urine that is less hostile to bacteria, therefore bladder infections are much more likely.


There is a distinct risk that bacteria in the bladder may make their way upstream and colonize the kidney, resulting in pyelonephritis. This kidney infection then causes further damage. Many cases are ""subclinical"", which means they are present and sufficient to be a nuisance, but not severe enough to cause obvious symptoms.
It is important that the subclinical infections are detected and treated with antibiotics, before they cause further kidney damage. The easiest way to do this is with routine urine cultures every three months. This gives a definitive answer as to whether an infection is present or not, and what antibiotics would work best at killing that infection.

, A common complication of kidney disease is high blood pressure (hypertension). Undetected and untreated, this can have catastrophic consequences such as stroke, blindness, or sudden death.


Hypertension is detected by measuring a cat’s venous blood pressure in a paw or in the vein under the tail. If the blood pressure is between 160-180mmHg then adding in an ACE inhibitor should be sufficient to protect the cat. However, if the blood pressure is over 180mmHg then a human anti-hypertensive medication, amlodipine, is prescribed. This is a calcium channel blocker and the dose in cats is 0.625 -1.25mg per cat once a day.Until recently only 5mg tablets were available which made accurate dosing almost impossible (about an 1/8th of a small tablet!), however 0.625mg are now available, which means a dose of one tablet daily.

Give your cat a bath twice a week.,
Give your cat a rinse when they come inside.,
Alleviate local irritation with topical treatments.,
Use a natural topical treatment.",How to Treat Seasonal Allergies in Cats2," Wash off the pollen, mold, fungus and dust by giving your cat a bath twice a week. This should help with the itching.Ask your veterinarian for an appropriate shampoo recommendation.Do not use people shampoo on cats.Avoid shampoos with parabens, artificial dyes, sodium laurel sulphate and petrochemicals.Try a hypoallergenic shampoo, hydrocortisone shampoo or colloidal oatmeal shampoo., If your cat has just come inside after a period of playing in high grass or weeds, it is best to rinse them immediately. This will get rid of the pollen and dust on their fur, which will make them itchy for the rest of the day if it is not addressed right away., Topical hydrocortisone creams and salves can be applied directly to your cat’s skin to reduce local irritations. Play with your cat for a while after applying the cream so that they won’t be as tempted to lick it off. These creams tend to be more effective if they are applied to areas where your cat cannot lick them off easily.Monitor your cat to make sure they don’t ingest the cortisone cream.You can purchase low strength creams over the counter.Avoid using cortisone creams on cats with an allergy to cortisone, fungal infections, stomach ulcers, liver or kidney issues., There are some natural remedies for cat skin problems that can be used such as salves with antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties. Ask your veterinarian about natural remedies for cat allergies.Apply bee propolis cream. Bee propolis has anti-viral, antibacterial, and anti-parasitic characteristics, so it may help with skin reactions. Although not specifically recommended for allergies, this treatment is one of the most popular natural remedies for cats.Apply aloe vera gel. Aloe vera gel has soothing properties that may help your cat deal with skin irritations during allergy season.Try spraying the irritated skin with some iced chamomile tea. Make some chamomile tea and then ice it in the fridge. Put it into a spray bottle and then spray the affected area of your cat's skin. This should have a nice soothing effect."

Feed your cat lots of fatty fish.,
Use antihistamines to treat cat allergies.,
Ask your veterinarian about cyclosporine.,
Ask your veterinarian about corticosteroids.,
Ask your doctor about allergy shots.",How to Treat Seasonal Allergies in Cats3," Fatty fish such as salmon and tuna have omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids help cats and dogs manage allergies by reducing the effects of the chemicals that are released during an allergic reaction., H1 antihistamines such as Benadryl, Atarax, Tavist, and Chlor-Trimeton can be used in treating allergies. If used alongside avoidance of allergens and a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids, antihistamines work very well.Antihistamines control allergies in 70% of cats
If given at a proper dose, there shouldn’t be too many side effects. Cats may experience mild sedation., Although more commonly used for dogs, cyclosporine or Atopica has been used off-label for cat allergies. Ask your veterinarian if this is an appropriate treatment.


Side effects include diarrhea and vomiting.

, Steroids can be effective for the relief of inflammation and itching. Your veterinarian will prescribe either injectable or oral steroids. Be aware of possible side effects, especially if the dose is not correct. These side effects may include:


Increased water consumption.
Depression.
Excessive urination.
Weight gain.
Diarrhea.
Depression.

, Hyposensitization therapy or allergy shots are used to desensitize your cat to particular allergens. This is a long term solution and can take two years to take effect."

Give your cat protein restricted food to limit the kidneys’ workload.,
Reduce blood phosphate levels through renal diets.,
Add a phosphate-binder to your cat’s food.,
Check to see if your cat is hydrated.,
Keep your cat hydrated.,
Improve the cat’s appetite using B vitamins.",How to Treat Kidney Disease in Cats2," One of the kidney's jobs is to filter blood and remove the waste products of digestion so they can be excreted through urine. A cat with kidney disease has an impaired ability to do this.


To keep your cat’s kidneys’ from struggling with food, feed your cat a diet which, when digested, is lower in toxins.Diets have been developed which are protein restricted (because protein when broken down produces toxic metabolites) and contain lower levels of minerals such as phosphate (which produces renal scar tissue). Examples of these prescription diets include Hills K/D and Purina NF diet, and are available in pouches, tins, and dry kibble.
For maximum effectiveness, feed your cat only these protein restricted foods.

, High blood phosphate levels cause further harm to the kidney because the phosphate molecule causes damage which results in scar tissue. In addition, high blood levels irritate the stomach lining and cause nausea.


Unfortunately, the majority of cat foods are high in phosphate because it enhances flavor and is used as a preservative.
Prescription renal diets have reduced phosphate levels and so this reduces the work load on the kidney.

, For cats that won't eat renal diets (not all do!) there is the option to add a phosphate-binder to their food. Phosphate binders do what the name suggests.


The binder is added to the food and it seeks out and sticks to phosphate molecules so that they are not absorbed into the blood stream. These are useful tools in reducing blood phosphate levels, and a palatable product is Renalzin.Renalzin comes in a pump-dispenser bottle and has a paste-like consistency. One or two pumps should be added to the food, twice a day. Many cats like the flavor and are happy to eat food that is supplemented with renalzin.

, A cat with kidney disease cannot concentrate urine like a healthy cat. If fluid loss exceeds fluid intake the cat becomes dehydrated and this makes her feel unwell.


You can detect dehydration by using the finger and thumb of one hand to grasp the scruff over the shoulders, and lift the skin vertically away from the backbone.
When you let go, the skin of a well-hydrated animal springs back into place immediately. In a dehydrated animal the skin lacks elasticity and may take a few seconds to fall back into place.

, Simple things like providing a pet water fountain, or placing dog bowls of water around the house, may encourage your cat to drink.


However, if the cat becomes dehydrated it may be necessary to give the cat intravenous fluids and put her on a drip until she recovers enough to be able to drink on her own.
This involves the pet being admitted to the veterinary hospital and a catheter being placed in one of her front legs. A drip line is attached and slow intravenous fluids are given over the course of 2 or 3 days.

, Many cats with kidney disease have a poor appetite. This can be caused by both inflammation in the stomach lining, and a lack of vitamin B.


B vitamins are important for a good appetite. However, they are water soluble and so a thirsty cat that isn't concentrating her urine is effectively washing B vitamins out of her system, which exacerbates a poor appetite.
B vitamins can be replaced by a weekly injection of a multivitamin preparation. Commonly, 0.5 to 1ml is given under the skin, once a week, for as long as the treatment is required."

Understand why kidney disease occurs.,
Recognize the signs of kidney disease.,
Know how kidney disease is diagnosed.",How to Treat Kidney Disease in Cats3," Older cats are likely to suffer from old age degeneration in the kidney, whereby active kidney tissue is subject to ""wear and tear"" and replaced by non-functional scar tissue.


The capacity of the kidney to perform its tasks is thereby reduced. Unfortunately, only once 25% of the functional kidney remains does the problem becomes detectable on blood tests.
Younger cats are less likely to have renal disease. If it does occur, it is usually because of a genetic disorder causing premature aging of the kidney, or because the cat has ingested a toxin (such as ethylene glycol in anti-freeze) which damages kidney tissue.

, General signs include increased thirst, weight loss, and poor appetite. As the condition advances the cat may become dehydrated and vomit.

, Your veterinarian may run urine and blood tests in order to diagnose renal disease, and she may run an ultrasound scan of the kidney to rule out cancer.


Kidney biopsies are infrequently done, unless the scan indicates cancer, because reaching a specific diagnosis is unlikely to alter the treatment needed.

Bring your cat to the vet to verify its condition.,
Ask for an allergy test if cultures are negative.,
Apply eye drops as directed to treat keratitis.,
Discuss using an Elizabethan collar.,
Ask if any immune supplements are necessary.,
Discuss the risks of megestrol acetate with the vet.",How to Treat Keratitis in Cats1," If you notice symptoms of keratitis, you should take your cat to its vet as soon as possible. They’ll give your cat a physical examination and take cultures to identify any bacterial or viral causes.Symptoms of keratitis include:Excessive tearing or discharges from the eye.
White or pink plaque or lesion over the surface of the eye.
Frequent squinting, light sensitivity, and pawing at the eye.;
, If a physical examination doesn’t show signs of injury and cultures are negative, your cat might have an allergy. While less common, allergies can cause keratitis, so talk to the vet about testing your cat.If allergy test returns positive results ask, “Could my cat’s allergies cause keratitis? How can I eliminate the allergen from its environment?” Your vet might recommend medication and, if it goes outside, keeping it indoors.

, Generally, the first steps to treating keratitis include a combination of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, or corticosteroid eye drops. Your vet will suggest a treatment plan appropriate for the suspected cause.Be sure to apply eye drops as directed by the vet. Application will likely be frequent, or somewhere between two to five times a day.

, An Elizabethan collar, or E-collar, fits around an animal’s neck to keep it from touching a recent surgical site or infected area. Your cat will likely want to scratch or paw at the affected eye. However, this will interfere with treatment, so ask its vet for an E-collar., Your cat’s immune response to a bacterial eye infection can cause keratitis lesions and result in scarring. Corticosteroid eye drops help treat this response by suppressing the immune system.If the vet recommends corticosteroid drops, ask them, “Do you recommend that I give my cat any immune supplements during treatment? Should I stop letting my indoor/outdoor cat go outside, keep it away from children, or take any other precautions to prevent other diseases or infections?”

, If eye drops aren’t effective, your vet might recommend an oral medication called megestrol acetate. If so, ask them what precautions you should take to reduce the risk of harmful side effects.Ask the vet, “Should I modify my cat’s diet or take any other precautions to reduce the risk of diabetes or adrenal gland problems?”
In addition, it can be dangerous for women to handle megestrol acetate pills, especially pregnant women or those planning on becoming pregnant.

Get your cat tested for feline herpesvirus.,
Apply antiviral medication as directed by the vet.,
Keep a low-stress environment to reduce recurrence.",How to Treat Keratitis in Cats2," Keratitis related to a feline herpesvirus (FHV) infection can’t be treated with standard antibacterial eye drops. If your cat hasn’t been vaccinated, the vet will test it for FHV.Other than eye infections, signs of FHV infection include respiratory infection, fever, lethargy or depression, and anorexia., To treat herpetic keratitis, the vet will most likely suggest an antiviral treatment. Most antiviral drops need to be applied five times per day.Ask the vet if they recommend a corticosteroid in addition to the antiviral drops. As in bacterial infections, the corticosteroid will help prevent the immune system’s scarring response.

, If your cat tests positive for FHV, reducing stressful situations will help manage the disease. The virus will go into a dormant state, and stress can result in recurrences.Try to keep your cat away from confrontations with other animals.
Avoid leaving it unsupervised with small children, who might play rough or tease the cat.
Give your cat loving attention, but be sure to give it space and don’t force it to endure situations that make it uncomfortable.

Get your cat vaccinated against feline herpesvirus.,
Keep your cat indoors.,
Inspect and clean your cat’s eyes regularly.",How to Treat Keratitis in Cats3," You should vaccinate your cat when it’s young or as soon as you acquire it. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent herpetic keratitis.When you get your cat vaccinated, ask the vet if it’ll need a booster and when you should get it a booster shot.

, Indoor cats are less likely to suffer eye injuries from confrontations with other animals, which will reduce the risk of injury-related keratitis. Keeping your cat indoors will also reduce its exposure to infectious diseases.Further, keratitis can result from intense sunlight, and keeping your cat inside will reduce its direct exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light., Look into your cat’s eyes and ensure they’re free of plaque or lesions, that the area around the iris (or colored part) is white, and that the pupils are even in size. Gently roll back the eyelids to make sure they’re pink and not red or white. Use a damp cotton ball to wipe away any build up from the corner of the eye, and use a fresh cotton ball for the other eye.Persian, Siamese, Himalayan, and Russian blues are especially susceptible to developing keratitis, so take special care to inspect and clean the eyes of these breeds."

Give the cat antibiotics.,
Administer steroids.,
Give the cat cyclosporin.,
Try an oral antiseptic rinse.",How to Treat Feline Stomatitis1," Your cat might need treatment with antibiotics to manage the pain and reduce inflammation. Antibiotics can quickly improve your cat's condition. But you'll need to monitor your cat's mouth. It may need antibiotics every so often to prevent stomatitis from returning.You'll need to work closely with the vet to create an antibiotic schedule for your cat. Your cat will need to take the antibiotics long enough for them to work (6 to 8 weeks). You'll also have to manage the condition once your cat stops taking the antibiotics since stomatitis can flare up again.;
, The vet may prescribe steroids that you give to your cat via the mouth or through injection. The vet will determine the dose and the treatment schedule depending on your cat's particular situation. The steroids should reduce the symptoms your cat is experiencing.To reduce side effects from the steroids, ask the vet about using a low-dose of oral steroids, which are less risky than steroid injections.

, Some cats develop a serious reaction to the inflamed tissue. If your cat doesn't respond to most treatment, the vet may recommend suppressing your cat's immune system so it stops attacking your cat's own body. The vet may recommend an immunosuppressant medication called cyclosporin to be given once or twice a day.Research has shown that 52% of cats treated with cyclosporin saw improvement with their stomatitis symptoms., You'll need to reduce most of the bacteria in your cat's mouth that's causing the inflammation. Ask the vet about chlorhexidine gluconate rinses or gels. The vet may also recommend applying anti-inflammatory medications that can make your cat more comfortable.Your cat might struggle while you try to administer the oral antiseptic rinse, which is why they aren't prescribed as often as other treatments.

Consider tooth removal.,
Get laser surgery.,
Participate in clinical testing.",How to Treat Feline Stomatitis2," If your cat is in a lot of pain, the vet may recommend removing teeth near the inflamed tissue. Tooth extraction will quickly reduce the amount of bacteria in the mouth that's causing the inflammation.60 to 80% of cats with stomatitis symptoms had symptoms stop or reduce in severity after having teeth extracted.

, The vet may recommend doing laser surgery to remove the inflamed and damaged tissue in your cat's mouth. The laser surgery is usually done in stages rather than at once since the procedure can be painful. After the surgery, your cat may struggle to eat.To help your cat eat during the healing stage, your cat may need to have a feeding tube inserted.

, Talk to the vet about possible clinical testing opportunities. New experimental tests often look for participants in stem cell research. For example, your cat may be eligible to have its own stem cells used to treat its stomatitis. Past studies have shown that 70% of cats saw improvement in their stomatitis symptoms.Clinical testing for this stem cell study is recommended for cats who haven't responded to other treatments and who are in pain.

Look for signs of stomatitis.,
Pay attention to your cat's behavior.,
Get your cat's teeth cleaned and x-rayed.,
Rule out other medical conditions.,
Care for your cat at home.",How to Treat Feline Stomatitis3," If your cat has stomatitis, you may notice that it has bad breath and drools more. Your cat may also lose weight or have difficulty eating. You should also look inside your cat's mouth for signs of inflammation which include:Bright red tissue near the back of the mouth
Bleeding in the mouth
Cobblestone appearance of the tissue in the mouth

, In addition to physical signs of stomatitis, your cat's attitude may change since it's in a lot of pain. Your cat might struggle to chew its food (which causes the weight loss). You might also notice your cat doesn't groom itself as often, so its coat might look neglected.Your cat may also seem withdrawn. If so, it will avoid interacting with people (even those it likes) and may even hide.

, You should take your cat for regular teeth cleanings and exams, but certainly take your cat if you notice any signs of stomatitis. The vet will thoroughly clean your cat's teeth above and below the gum line. Your cat's teeth should be x-rayed to check for serious tooth disease or problems that could be causing the inflammation.Ask the vet to teach you how to care for your cat's teeth at home. You'll probably need to buy cat toothpaste and learn how to brush your cat's teeth every day.

, Since there's no diagnostic test for stomatitis, the vet will need to rule out other medical conditions that could be causing the inflammation. The vet will do a blood test to check for feline viral diseases like feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus. The vet will also do a biopsy (take a tissue sample) to rule out:Eosinophilic granuloma complex
Fungal disease
Squamous cell carcinoma

, Once your cat has gotten medical care, you may need to follow special treatment instructions from the vet. If your cat has had teeth removed, it may have a feeding tube. Ask the vet to give you specific instructions on how to feed your cat using the tube. If your cat hasn't had a tooth extraction, it may just need to eat soft food for a while until it's no longer in pain.


If your cat hasn't been grooming itself very much and its coat is looking matted, ensure that you brush it every day to prevent hairballs.

Prevent feline acne.",How to Treat Feline Acne," Typically, these acne lesions are found on a cat's chin. The spots (blackheads or pimples) are small, firm and black. If you stroke him just under the chin, you'll notice that the skin feels gritty.While acne is usually found on the chin, your cat may also have acne lesions above his lip.;
, While the exact cause of feline acne is unknown, there are several things that may trigger acne outbreaks. These include decreased grooming, food accumulating on the chin, and a weakened immune system as a result of age. The acne is usually mild and harmless, but can become sore if bacteria causes infection in the spots.The acne spots are made up of a waxy (sebaceous) material that's trapped in the hair follicles. This causes the follicle to swell and bulge, appearing on the skin's surface.

, If there's infection, the area may look more swollen, which can make the chin more prominent than usual. It might seem like your cat is jutting his chin out. You'll also see blood-stained discharge, which can either be watery or smelly and pus-like, coming from each spot.Infection is caused by the spots bursting or the waxy material in the spot becoming contaminated with bacteria. This requires prompt treatment since it can make your cat's chin sore. Your cat may rub it more, irritating the skin. This irritation will cause further trauma and make the infection worse.

, If your cat has had repeated acne breakouts, the hair follicles can become severely damaged. This will create scar tissue and fur won't grow on the chin anymore. This gives the chin a leather appearance.


If you notice leathery or tough skin anywhere on your cat, have it checked by the veterinarian. Other conditions may cause leather skin and require treatments, such as food allergies or tumors., If the cat has black spots, but is otherwise well, the vet may suggest keeping the area clean with a disinfectant wash. You might be instructed to wash the area with something like dilute chlorhexidine and told to monitor the acne. But, if the area is sore, swollen, or infection is present, the vet may need to run tests to diagnose the condition and check your cat's general health.A weakened immune system could be causing regular and severe lesions. The vet may do blood screening tests to check for anemia in your cat. This will determine the balance of white blood cells and check the condition of the organs.

, The veterinarian may want to see if parasites, like the demodex mite, are colonizing your cat's hair follicles. This can create problems similar to feline acne.To test, the vet will squeeze an unruptured spot and capture the contents on a microscope slide. The slide will be examined to look for any parasites.


If parasites are found, the vet may recommend topical treatments, like medicated shampoos, dips, or sprays.

, The vet may check for the presence of other infections, such as ringworm, which cause skin inflammation and soreness. This is done by rubbing a sterile swab or brush over the skin to collect a sample of fauna from the skin surface. The sample is put into a transport medium, which is then checked for the growth of the fungal organism which causes ringworm.Swabbing will not only tell the vet which bacteria are present, but will help determine which antibiotics will kill the infection.

, A definitive diagnosis of feline acne is made with a biopsy. This involves surgically removing a small wedge of tissue from the affected area. The sample is then sent to a pathologist for examination and diagnosis.This also helps to rule out predisposing factors such as mites (which burrow into the skin and can mimic acne infections), cancer, or a type of immune related inflammation called eosinophilic granuloma complex.

, Not all cases of feline acne need treatment. If your cat has only one or two comedones (black spots) and they do not irritate him, then they can be simply managed at home. You may just gently wash the area and keep it clean after your cat eats.If your cat has a history of spots that become infected, then it is best to get treatment.

, If your cat has spots, but they're not infected, simply clean the spots. To clean with a surgical spirit, moisten a cotton ball with the spirit and wipe the chin twice a day until the spots have disappeared. Or, you can use a topical cleansing agent like chlorhexidine, which comes as a concentrated pink, soapy liquid. Dilute the chlorhexidine in water, with a ratio of around 5ml chlorhexidine to 100 ml of water. Moisten a cotton wool ball with the solution and wipe it over the cat's chin twice a day. Monitor the area and if the lesions worsen, check in with your vet.Chlorhexidine is suitable for use in cats because it is not toxic to them and does not sting. It cleanses the skin of bacteria and makes it less likely that bacteria will colonize the hair follicles.

, To wash the chin, wet it with damp cotton wool and add a drop of benzyl peroxide shampoo to the wool. Rub this on the chin and leave it in to dry for 5 minutes. Rinse the area well using a clean flannel cloth soaked in water. If you want to treat the whole cat, dilute the shampoo, rub it into your cat's wet fur, and rinse well with warm water. Wash the affected area in the morning and evening. If redness or soreness develops, stop the treatment until the skin heals. Then start again, but dilute the shampoo more.


Pet shampoos containing benzyl peroxide are useful to treat feline acne, because the benzyl peroxide penetrates into the follicles. This will deep clean the follicle, destroy the bacteria, and remove excess waxy grease that might contribute to feline acne., Soak a ball of cotton wool in moderately warm salt water. To prepare the water, boil water and stir in a teaspoon of salt. Let this mixture cool to just above body temperature. Once you've soaked the ball in the solution, squeeze out the excess moisture and hold the damp cotton wool against your cat's chin. Try to keep it there for 5 minutes. Repeat this two or three times a day until the spots burst or get smaller.


A hot compress can help reduce the size of the spots or cause them to burst. Either way, this will relieve pressure on the follicles, which would otherwise irritate your cat's skin.

, The vet may prescribe oral antibiotics that you'll need to give your cat to kill bacteria on the surface of the skin. These are given by mouth at the recommended dose until the spots have cleared and then the course is extended for at least another week. Some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for feline acne include:


Cephalexin: This is a first generation antibiotic from the beta-lactam group, which targets and destroys bacteria. Usually, the dose is 30 to 50mg twice a day. So, a typical 5kg cat is given a 50mg dose of Cephalexin twice a day. This is best given with food if the cat has a sensitive stomach and is likely to vomit.Clindamycin: This belongs to the lincosamide group of antibiotics which stop bacteria from reproducing. The dose is usually 5 to 10mg/kg twice a day, or the dose can be combined and given once a day. So, a 5kg cat will take a 25mg capsule twice a day. This antibiotic is more effective if given on an empty stomach.
Clavulanate-potentiated amoxycillin: This antibiotic works by interfering with bacterial metabolism and damaging the bacteria's cell wall. The dose in the cat is 50mg per 5kg, so a 5kg cat is given 50mg dose twice daily, either with or without food.

, While older cats are more likely to get acne (possibly because their arthritis makes it harder to groom and remove food debris from their chins), there are things you can do to make feline acne less likely. If your cat has a history of acne, wipe his chin after he eats and pat the area dry. This can prevent oil buildup and bacterial infection from food that's become trapped in the hair follicles.You should also wash out your cat's food bowls every few days. This prevents bacteria from accumulating, which could contribute to feline acne.

Take your cat to a veterinarian.,
Remove any stuck items from your cat’s throat.,
Treat any infections present.,
Have growths removed.,
Have hyperthyroidism treated.,
Have your cat evaluated for allergies.,
Treat laryngeal paralysis.",How to Treat Hoarseness in Cats1," If your cat is extremely hoarse or has lost its voice completely, you should have it checked out by a veterinarian. A veterinarian will be able to inspect the cat's throat and vocal chords in order to find the cause.

It is likely that your veterinarian will ask you about the cat's symptoms first. Then they will do an examination of the cat.
Your veterinarian may have to do a variety of tests on the cat, including blood tests and imaging tests to look internally at its throat. These tests may require your cat to be put under anesthesia.;
, Your veterinarian may find that your cat has gotten something stuck in its throat, and that’s causing the hoarseness. For instance, it is not uncommon for cats to swallow thread with the needle still attached, and then this gets stuck somewhere. Your veterinarian can treat the problem by carefully removing whatever foreign item is there., If your veterinarian discovers that your cat has some sort of infection, such as those associated with viral upper respiratory infections or obstructive inflammatory laryngeal disease, then they will suggest treatment options. With most cases, medication will be prescribed to eliminate the infection.In the case of obstructive inflammatory laryngeal disease, your veterinarian is likely to prescribe both corticosteriods and antibiotics to control the infection.

, If your veterinarian finds growths or tumors have caused your cat's hoarseness, they will typically suggest surgical removal and treatment with medicine. Discuss your veterinarian's treatment plan and why they are suggesting it.Squamous cell carcinoma and other tumors in the oral or nasal cavity can cause hoarseness in cats. Treatment depends on what type of tumor your cat has and where it is located, but in most cases includes removal followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy., Hyperthyroidism is a problem with the thyroid that results in an overproduction of hormones. It usually occurs when there is a tumor on the thyroid. Hoarseness is a known symptom of hyperthyroidism in cats. In order to eliminate the hoarseness, the hyperthyroidism needs to be treated. This is usually done with either medication, surgery, or radioactive-iodine therapy.Discuss treatment options for your cat with your veterinarian. Depending on the severity of your cat's hyperthyroidism, your veterinarian may suggest one, two, or all three types of treatment.

, Just like people, cats can become allergic to things in the environment, such as pollen and dust mites. This can make their throat sore, which can cause hoarseness. Ask your veterinarian which medications they recommend you give your cat for managing allergies., Laryngeal paralysis is a rare condition in cats, but it can be the cause of hoarseness. When the larynx is paralyzed, the cat is unable to vocalize and breathing can be compromised.In the rare cases of laryngeal paralysis in cats, the cat will likely require surgery to relieve any obstruction and allow it to vocalize.In very rare cases, rabies can cause laryngeal paralysis. Be sure that your cat is tested for rabies if it is diagnosed with this condition and there is any chance that it has been exposed to rabies.This surgery can be very risky for cats, as it has a high rate of pneumonia during recovery.

Let the cat rest its voice.,
Make sure your cat is drinking enough water.,
Give prescribed medications.,
Provide aftercare.",How to Treat Hoarseness in Cats2," Sometimes hoarseness occurs simply because the cat has used its voice too much. For instance, if a cat gets trapped somewhere and repeatedly cries to get help, this can stress the cat's vocal cords and cause it to be hoarse for a day or two. In most cases, the cat's voice will come back on its own with some rest.If your cat has recently had a traumatic incident like this where it used its voice excessively, and it has no other symptoms, then you may want to let the cat try to recover on its own for a few days before seeking veterinary care.

, If a cat is parched and has not been drinking enough water, its voice can be affected. Giving your cat some fresh, cool water and encouraging it to drink may clear up your cat's hoarseness immediately.

Cats should always have access to clean drinking water. Restricting their water can be hazardous to a cat's health, in addition to affecting its voice., If your veterinarian has prescribed medications to treat your cat's condition, you should give them to your cat and follow the directions provided. Give the medication for as long as prescribed and give it to your cat as often as directed.

It can be difficult to give cats medication, especially in pill form. If you are having a hard time getting your cat to take pills, you may need to restrain it.

, Depending on the treatment that your veterinarian provides, you may need to provide aftercare to help your cat recover. If your cat has had surgery, you will need to make sure any incisions stay clean and heal correctly by changing bandages and making sure the cat doesn't mess with its injuries. Getting a cat to leave incisions alone usually requires putting a cone, also known as an Elizabethan collar, on the cat.You will also need to make sure your cat is comfortable, is fed nutritious meals, and is not in pain.

Notice when your cat meows less often.,
Listen for changes in your cat's meow.,
Assess the cat for other symptoms.",How to Treat Hoarseness in Cats3," When interacting with your cat on a regular basis, pay attention to how it meows and how often. It may be that your cat is less vocal than usual and that is how you discover it is hoarse.

Some cats are more vocal than others, so when they stop meowing it is very noticeable.

, When your cat becomes hoarse, it will have a hard time meowing or making other vocalizations. Take the time to listen to your cat closely for meows that sound strange and unusual.

While the sound of a cat's meow can change over its lifetime, the changes associated with aging are very different from those related to disease.

, If your cat has a hoarse voice, you should look for other symptoms of health problems. This will help you assess the seriousness of your cat's condition. If your cat has any of these symptoms, it could signal a serious health problem that needs veterinary care:Weight loss
Digestive problems
Abnormal growths or skin conditions
Lethargy
Trouble breathing
Discharge from the nose or mouth
Sneezing or coughing

Look for changes in appetite and activity level.,
Note travel, medications, or lifestyle changes.,
Look for increased urination, vomiting, or diarrhea.,
Notice if your cat tries to avoid putting pressure on its stomach.,
Check for dental problems.",How to Treat Dramatic Weight Loss in Cats1," Observe your cat at meal times and take note of any changes in its eating habits. Try to see if your cat is losing weight despite a healthy appetite, or if the weight loss is due to not eating. In addition to changes in appetite, look for any changes in activity level that accompany sudden weight loss.Sudden weight loss despite a healthy appetite and overactivity could indicate hyperthyroidism.;
, Try to think of any lifestyle changes that might have occurred around the same time as your cat’s weight loss. For example, stressful situations, like travel or relocation, could impact your cat’s appetite or metabolism. Take note of any new medications that might be related to its dramatic weight loss.If affected by travel or relocation, your cat's appetite might normalize as its stress decreases.
If weight loss could be related to a new medication, ask the vet about switching to an alternative with fewer side effects.

, Check for any other obvious symptoms that accompany the weight loss, including vomiting or diarrhea. Vomiting or diarrhea can indicate a number of underlying conditions, such as thyroid disease, diabetes, allergies, parasites, and infection. Increased urination can be related to diabetes., Observe your cat when it lays down, and notice if it appears to avoid putting pressure on its abdomen. Look for any unusual positions or movements that seem to favor its stomach or indicate pain in the region. Try to notice if picking it up seems to cause pain or discomfort., Look into your cat’s mouth and check for decayed or failing teeth. If your cat has tooth decay and a decreased appetite, it might experience pain when it eats. You’ll likely need to have its tooth or teeth extracted and treat it for dental disease."

Therefore, elevated thyroid hormone levels can cause a wide range of clinical signs,the most common of which are weight loss and increased appetite.Other clinical signs include increased activity/restlessness, excessive thirst, and increased urination.Cats with hyperthyroidism can have also diarrhea, pant more, and shed more often.Your cat’s coat may look matted or greasy if she has hyperthyroidism.Your cat may also be unusually cranky or aggressive.Remember that hyperthyroidism’s clinical signs often resemble those of ""older cat"" diseases, like diabetes and chronic kidney disease.Your veterinarian will be able to be able to perform specific diagnostic tests to confirm hyperthyroidism.;
, If your cat has hyperthyroidism, you will likely be able to feel the enlarged thyroid glands. They are located underneath your cat’s neck, next to his trachea. One or both glands will be enlarged. Both glands are enlarged in about 70% of feline hyperthyroidism cases.Sometimes, the thyroid glands can become so enlarged that they ""sink"" into the chest. In this case, you would not be able to feel them., If you suspect your cat has hyperthyroidism, take her to your veterinarian, who will be able to confirm a hyperthyroidism diagnosis.Testing your cat’s thyroid hormones will likely confirm hyperthyroidism. However, since hyperthyroidism can affect many parts of your cat’s body, your veterinarian will also perform a thorough physical examination of your cat to assess her overall health. For example, if your veterinarian strongly suspects hyperthyroidism, he will take a close listen to your cat’s heart.Cats with hyperthyroidism often have a quick heart rate.Your veterinarian may want to run an ultrasound test to look at your cat’s heart. Hyperthyroidism in cats can cause the heart muscle to become thickened.In addition to the physical examination, your veterinarian will take blood and urine samples to rule out other diseases like diabetes and kidney failure., Your veterinarian will take a blood sample to test your cat’s thyroid hormone levels, namely T4.Most likely, your cat’s T4 levels will be high.


T4 levels will be normal in 2 to 10% of cats with hyperthyroidism. These normal levels could be due normal hormone level fluctuations.Concurrent illness can also lower elevated T4 levels in hyperthyroid cats.If your veterinarian strongly suspects hyperthyroidism, she may want to check your cat’s thyroid hormone levels several times before confirming the diagnosis., There are three ways to treat hyperthyroidism in cats: oral medication, surgical removal of the thyroid glands (""thyroidectomy""), and radioactive iodine therapy.Each of these treatment options has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to understand how each one works before deciding which one would be best for your cat.


For example, oral medication is relatively inexpensive,but could be impractical if your cat doesn’t like getting pills., The best way to determine which treatment options will work best for your cat is to talk with your veterinarian. He will be able to explain each option in each detail and provide a professional opinion as to which one will be most effective for your cat.


Oral therapy works by decreasing the production and release of thyroid hormones into the body. It is not curative, but can effectively control hyperthyroidism.Oral therapy is lifelong.A thyroidectomy is a straightforward procedure. It is also not curative, but can provide relief from hyperthyroidism symptoms. Although surgery can be expensive, it can actually end up costing less than lifelong oral therapy.Disadvantages of surgery include the risk of anesthesia in older cats and the rare possibility of damaging nearby healthy tissue, such as the parathyroid glands.Radioactive iodine therapy is quickly becoming the therapy of choice for feline hyperthyroidism. The iodine is injected through one of your cat’s veins. It then concentrates in the thyroid gland where it destroys only the hyper-functioning tissue. It is curative and usually requires only one treatment.Radioactive iodine therapy is expensive and requires hospitalization of at least several days. It is usually performed at a specialty veterinary hospital., There is a lot to consider when deciding how to treat your cat. For example, if your cat hates being pilled, then oral therapy is probably not a good choice. If she is too sick for surgery, then you should consider oral therapy or radioactive iodine therapy.


Your veterinarian will also consider the health of your cat’s heart and kidneys when developing a treatment plan. In fact, whether or not a cat has kidney failure often plays a role in how to treat hyperthyroidism.Think about your finances when deciding between treatment options. If you are concerned that you will not be able to afford treatment, talk with your veterinarian to see if there is a treatment option that will be affordable and effective.

, If your veterinarian has determined that oral therapy is the best way to treat your cat’s hyperthyroidism, then you will need to give your cat a medication called methimazole. It usually needs to be given twice daily.Depending on your work schedule, it may be easiest to give one pill in the morning, and one in the evening.


Thyroid hormone levels return to normal within several weeks of therapy.However, your cat will need to take methimazole for the rest of his life to keep the levels in a normal range. Your veterinarian will need to check your cat’s thyroid hormones levels regularly for as long as your cat is on oral therapy.About 10 to 15% of cats experience side effects, such as vomiting and loss of appetite. These side effects may resolve themselves during the course of treatment.Infrequently, cats will suffer from serious side effects, including severe facial itching and liver problems.Take your cat to your veterinarian if he is not tolerating the medication very well.

, Your veterinarian may recommend surgical removal of your cat’s thyroid glands. Fortunately, the thyroid adenomas causing the hyperthyroidism are fully contained within the thyroid gland. Therefore, removing the thyroid gland will also fully remove the adenomas.


Before surgery, your veterinarian may want to put your cat on methimazole for one to two months to bring the thyroid hormone levels down to the normal range.The risk of hypothyroidism is low, since there are thyroid cells in other parts of your cat’s body that will produce thyroid hormones after surgery. Your veterinarian can prescribe medicine if your cat becomes hypothyroid after surgery.Thyroid cells in other parts of the body (""ectopic thyroid"") can sometimes cause a cat to remain hyperthyroid after surgery. If this is the case, your veterinarian may recommend either methimazole or radioactive iodine therapy.Your veterinarian will want to check your cat’s thyroid hormone levels once or twice a year after surgery. Even if your cat’s thyroid hormone levels return to normal after surgery, they may increase later., With radioactive iodine therapy, your cat will not need to be anesthetized and will not have any side effects after the procedure. For the procedure, your cat will receive an intravenous injection of radioactive iodine. After the injection, your cat will stay at the veterinary hospital until her radiation levels are within an acceptable range, during which time she will not be able to accept any visitors.The radioactive iodine will travel only to the thyroid gland (and any ectopic thyroid tissue), and will not harm any other organs in your cat’s body.Thyroid hormone levels typically return to normal within one to weeks following the procedure.Radioactive iodine therapy is curative in about 95% of feline hyperthyroid cases.Your veterinarian may recommend a repeat treatment if your cat’s thyroid hormone levels do not return to normal.

, Although your cat will not have any side effects following radioactive therapy, you will need take a few extra precautions with him in the first two weeks after bringing him home. For example, you should use only flushable litter. Also, limit your handling of him to 10 minutes a day.Wash your hands after you handle him or anything else cat-related (e.g., cat litter, food and water bowls).If your cat is indoor/outdoor, keep him indoors for the first two weeks after the procedure.Do not handle your cat during those first two weeks if you are pregnant. Also, young children should not handle him during that time frame., In addition to these other therapies, your veterinarian may recommend feeding your cat a special cat food that is iodine-free. Since iodine is needed to build thyroid hormones, the lack of iodine in your cat’s food would prevent thyroid hormone production in your cat’s body.Such a specialized diet will likely not be available at your local pet store, so you will need to purchase it through your veterinarian.

Work with the vet to come up with a diabetes treatment plan.,
Treat your cat for hyperthyroidism.",How to Treat Dramatic Weight Loss in Cats2," If you observe dramatic weight loss in your cat, you’ll need to have a vet examine it to make an accurate diagnosis. You’ll need to report your cat’s symptoms and when you observed them with as much detail as possible.A patient history is a vital part of diagnosing dramatic weight loss in cats.

, In addition to giving your cat a full physical examination, the vet will do some lab work. Screenings will most likely include a complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry panel, heartworm test, and thyroid hormone test. They might also recommend testing your cat for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia (FeLV), especially if it hasn’t already been vaccinated against these infections.Depending on the results of lab work and physical examination, the vet might also call for imaging techniques, like x-ray or ultrasound.

, If your cat tests positive for a gastrointestinal infection or for parasites, the vet will prescribe an appropriate antibiotic medication. The dosage might be an in-office injection or a pill or liquid to be administered at home. Be sure to give your cat its medication as directed by the vet.To prevent parasites, be sure to clean out your cat’s litter box daily, keep your cat on a flea control regimen, and avoid feeding it raw meat.

, The most common signs of diabetes are weight loss despite a ravenous appetite, increased water consumption, and increased urination. Your cat’s vet will help you create a treatment plan that’s right for its specific condition.Most diabetic cats require insulin injections twice a day. Some cats can be treated with oral medication.
In addition to medications, the vet will likely advise increasing your cat’s fiber and complex carbohydrate intake. If your cat is underweight, they’ll recommend a high-calorie diet until it reaches its ideal body weight.

, Weight loss along with increased appetite, thirst, and urination can also indicate hyperthyroidism. If a thyroid hormone test show that your cat has an overactive thyroid gland, its vet will help you decide between three treatment options:Daily medications can control the disease by regulating the thyroid, but are not an actual cure.
Surgical removal of the thyroid is a relatively straightforward procedure, but not all cats are good candidates for surgery. Ask your cat’s vet if it’s up to the bodily stresses associated with anesthesia, surgery, and recovery.
Radioactive-iodine treatment is becoming the preferred method, but it's only permitted in specially licensed facilities and isn't available in all locations. Your cat’s vet can tell you the location of the nearest treatment center.

Ask the vet about dietary changes.,
Switch to cat food that contains at least 50 percent animal protein.,
Try improving a meal’s flavor with canned tuna or fish oil.,
Add extra calories with high-protein cat treats.",How to Treat Dramatic Weight Loss in Cats3," It’s always best to discuss any dietary changes with a vet. You’ll both need to consider your cat’s age, activity level, allergies, and any existing health conditions. Even if the vet can’t identify any underlying conditions, they will help you create a diet that can increase your cat’s weight in the healthiest way possible., Protein consumption is essential to maintaining proper body weight, especially if your cat is age eight or older. While you should ask the vet about your cat’s specific protein needs, a general rule of thumb is to feed it at least six to eight grams of protein per day.Check the label of your cat’s food. It should consist of at least 50 percent animal protein. You might need to switch to a premium brand that consists of animal protein instead of plant protein.

, If your cat doesn’t have an underlying condition but has a low appetite, it might not like its food. Try adding a bit of canned tuna or fish oil to enhance its flavor. Warming food can also make it more appetizing.Be sure to consult the vet to make sure they approve of any flavor enhancers.

, Treats can be an effective means of adding calories to your cat’s diet. Go for an animal protein based cat treat. While vets recommend limiting treats to 10 to 15 percent of a healthy cat’s daily caloric intake, you should ask your cat’s vet to help you determine the right number of daily treats to offer your underweight cat.

Avoid using raw meat as a treat, since it can carry parasites and infectious diseases."

Encourage your cat to eat.",How to Treat Feline Upper Respiratory Illness," Discharge from the eyes and nose is one of the most common signs of feline URI.The discharge may look clear in the early stages of disease, then become yellow and pus-like as the disease progresses.Your cat’s eyelids may also become red and inflamed.The pus-like discharge would indicate a bacterial infection.
A URI caused by Chlamydia can make your cat’s eyes water.A URI caused by FHV-1 can lead to corneal ulcers.;
, Feline URI can cause sores to develop in and around your cat’s mouth. For example, you may see sores in the roof of her mouth, on her tongue, or on her lips.Your cat may start to drool; this is usually associated with FHV-1.FCV commonly causes oral ulcers., Sneezing is another common sign of feline URI. Sometimes, excitement or physical activity can trigger sneezing.You may see the nasal discharge when your cat sneezes.

, Feline URI can make a cat feel lousy. It can also cause nasal congestion, which would make it hard for your cat to smell and taste the flavor of her food. As a result, your cat may start eating and drinking less than usual.The loss of appetite is usually more severe with FHV-1 than FCV., Feline URI, whether bacterial or viral, often causes a fever.You can take your cat’s temperature rectally or via the ear—whichever your cat is most comfortable with. Keep in mind that digital ear thermometers are difficult to position within the ear and may not provide accurate temperature readings.With FHV-1, fever can reach as high as 105 degrees F (40.5 degrees C). Usually, the body temperature then drops to between normal (100.4 to 102.5 degrees F/37.8 to 39.2 degrees C) and 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C).If you do not feel comfortable taking your cat’s temperature, your vet will do so.

, When your cat is showing the telltale signs of a URI, take her to your vet. Often, a diagnosis of URI can be made based on the clinical signs. If your vet wants to determine the infectious agent causing the disease, they will perform other diagnostic tests, including an analysis of the discharge from your cat’s eyes, nose, or throat. Your vet may also take a small skin sample (a ‘conjunctival scrape’) from the inside of your cat’s eyelids.Treatment for feline URI is generally the same regardless of the infectious agent, so your vet may decide not to test for viruses or bacteria.If your vet suspects the infection has traveled down into your cat’s lungs and caused pneumonia, they may take a chest x-ray to look at her lungs., Your vet will prescribe either eye drops or eye ointment. If the discharge coming from your cat's eyes suggests a bacterial infection, your vet will prescribe an antibiotic-containing eye medication. If your cat’s eyes have corneal ulcers, then an eye medication contain an antiviral agent would be needed.Apply the eye medication exactly as prescribed.


Since discharge can be irritating, regularly wipe the discharge away from your cat’s eyes with a clean, moist tissue.Remove nasal discharge as well. Be gentle when wiping away the discharge.

, If your vet has identified the specific bacterial agent causing the URI, then they will prescribe an antibiotic to target that bacteria. Sometimes, though, bacterial infections can occur after a viral infection has weakened the immune system; these infections are called secondary bacterial infections. If your cat has a secondary bacterial infection, your vet will prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic that would target a wide range of bacteria.Follow the prescription instructions exactly to kill all of the bacteria and prevent antibiotic resistance.
Your vet may prescribe an oral antibiotic for your cat, rather than antibiotic eye drops., If your cat’s nose or airways are congested, she may benefit from some extra humidity. Turn on the shower in your bathroom, close the door, and let the room become steamy. Then, place your cat in the bathroom for 10 to 15 minutes. Do this several times a day to help relieve her congestion.If you’d like, stay in the bathroom with your cat to provide her with some comfort.
You could also place your cat in a non-steamy room with a humidifier.Speak with your vet about how long to keep your cat in a room with a humidifier.

, Your vet may prescribe a nasal decongestant to relieve your cat’s congestion. Be aware, though, that long-term use of decongestants may actually cause recurrent congestion and make your cat’s symptoms worse.In addition, nasal decongestants for cats haven’t shown much benefit.Humidifying your cat’s environment may be better for your cat than giving her a decongestant.
Medications are also available that can break down extremely thick discharge or reduce the amount of discharge. Your vet can recommend which nasal medications would work best for your cat.

, Your cat’s congestion has likely reduced her sense of smell and appetite. To encourage her to eat, feed her an especially tasty and strongly-scented canned food. If she still isn’t interested in eating, your vet may have to prescribe an appetite stimulant for her.Consider placing a small morsel of food on your finger and allowing your cat to lick the food off your finger. Placing the food on your finger would warm up the food with your body temperature and possibly release some appealing aromas.Force feeding has been suggested to get a cat eating again, but it may not be a good idea—your cat may end up biting you. Talk with your vet before attempting any force feeding techniques (e.g., syringe feeding, placing food in the mouth by hand)."

Have your vet examine your cat’s eyes regularly.",How to Treat Feline Retinal Disease," The retina is made up of structures called photoreceptors—rods and cones—that allow your cat to see light and color. With PRA, the rods and cones start breaking down. Without the rods, your cat would not be able to see very well in dark areas, like a hallway. You may notice your cat avoiding dark areas of your home.Inability to see in the dark is known as night blindness. It is an early sign of PRA and eventually progresses to total blindness.;
, With retinal detachment, vision loss occurs because the retina has separated from the back of the eye. If retinal detachment has caused complete blindness in both of your cat's eyes, she’ll probably bump into walls and furniture as she walks.If she has partial retinal detachment (causing partial blindness), or is blind in only one eye, she may be able to compensate and navigate your home fairly well.Sometimes, retinal detachment causes central vision loss, but not peripheral vision loss. In this case, your cat would see things out of the corners of her eyes, but not what’s in front of her.PRA would also make navigation difficult for your cat.

, With PRA and retinal detachment, your cat’s pupils will be larger than normal. Looking through her pupils, you may be able to see a reflection of light from the backs of her eyes.Her pupils may be larger because they trying to take in more light.


With retinal detachment, the pupils may stay large for a long time, and might be different sizes., When you notice your cat is losing her vision, take her to your vet. In addition to performing a regular physical exam, your vet will do a thorough eye exam using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. They may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist for a more detailed eye exam.Your vet will also perform routine bloodwork and an analysis of your cat’s urine. Since high blood pressure is a common cause of retinal detachment, your vet may also measure your cat’s blood pressure.Provide a detailed history of your cat, including when the vision loss started, any possible trauma or exposure to toxins, and diet.Since the 1980’s, commercial cat diets have been fortified with taurine, an amino acid whose deficiency can cause vision loss in cats.Your vet will want to know if your cat is receiving enough taurine in her diet.

, There are no available treatments for feline PRA. Once the disease process has started, restoring your cat’s vision is unlikely. In addition, medications cannot slow the disease progression.A few treatment options are available for retinal detachment.


If your cat has retinal detachment, starting treatment as soon as possible can prevent further eye damage or permanent blindness.Although retinal disease may not be reversible, cats can manage surprisingly well with vision loss.

, If your cat’s retinal detachment and subsequent blindness are due to high blood pressure, then your vet will need to lower her blood pressure quickly. Lowering her blood pressure could restore her vision. However, if her retinas have been detached more than 1 or 2 days, it is unlikely that her vision will be restored.High blood pressure causes blood vessels to bleed beneath the retina. The excess blood forces the retina to detach from the rest of the eye.Even if your cat does not get her vision back, maintaining normal blood pressure will be important for her overall health.

, For retinal detachment, a few surgical treatments (laser retinopexy, retinal cryopexy) are available to reattach the retina to the back of the eye. These treatments use lasers to create scar tissue on the retina; this scar tissue would act like a seal between the retina and the back of the eye. These surgical methods, unfortunately, are not always successful.If your vet recommends surgical treatment, they would likely refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist.

, Taurine, which is found only in animal-based proteins, is an essential amino acid for cats—their bodies cannot produce enough of it, so they must receive it through food.The Association of American Feed Control Officials recommends canned foods contain 0.2% taurine.Check the nutrition label of your cat’s canned food to see if it contains the recommended percentage of taurine.


Several recommendations exist on the actual amount of taurine a cat should receive, one of which is to feed a cat 75 to 100 mg of taurine per day.If your cat’s current diet does not have enough taurine, talk to your vet about high-quality taurine supplements.
Excess taurine is not a problem in cats; the excess is eliminated through the urine., Over time, your cat has become familiar with the furniture arrangement in your home. Even with vision loss, your cat will be able to manage quite well, as long as you keep the furniture as you had it before she lost her vision.If you rearrange the furniture, she will start bumping into things more often.

, If you have an outdoor cat or indoor/cat, she will need to become an indoor-only cat. Staying indoors will protect her from predators and prevent her from getting injured outside., If your cat has PRA, your vet will want to examine her eyes regularly to monitor the disease progression and detect other eye diseases, such as glaucoma (increased eye pressure), cataracts (cloudy lens), and uveitis (inflammation in the eye).Your vet will recommend a follow-up schedule of veterinary visits.


If your cat had high blood pressure at the time of diagnosis, your vet may want to measure her blood pressure regularly.

Keep an infected cat isolated.",How to Treat Feline Panleukopenia (Distemper)," The incubation period from being in contact with the virus to developing clinical signs is approximately four to five days. The first symptom to develop is a high fever, which can occur so suddenly that the owner suspects their cat has been poisoned.In adult cats that have a strong immune system or are vaccinated, they may contact the virus but keep it in check and not become ill.;
, This is the most obvious sign that your cat may have distemper.The diarrhea and vomiting is serious because it indicates distemper but it can also quickly lead to dehydration and anemia, serious problems on their own.


If your cat vomits on a regular basis, for example due to hairballs, you will have to judge whether the vomiting your cat is doing is out of character or just its normal behavior.

, This illness will impact a cat's behavior, as it is likely to make them feel extremely ill. If your cat is extremely miserable and depressed and loses all interest in food, then you should suspect a serious illness, such as distemper.

, The debilitated cat is at great risk of secondary infections such as pneumonia. A combination of blood loss, dehydration, organ failure, and secondary infections account for the high mortality rate., Those most at risk are the very young, with immature or weak immune systems. Typically a three to five month old kitten that has not been vaccinated is most likely to succumb to serious infection.


It is estimated that around 50 - 90 % of the cats that come into contact with the virus die as a result., The vet should be suspicious of feline distemper based on the symptoms you have witnessed. Reaching a precise diagnosis is not essential since their is no 'cure' for panleukopenia, as it's caused by a virus. It is up to the cat's own immune system to fight the virus, and treatment is based around supporting the cat until the immune system mounts a defense.


However, the vet may want to run tests to rule out other causes of a high fever (such as FIP or bacterial infections) and check for a foreign body or other causes of bowel obstruction, such as an intussusception, which is a problem with the intestine that can cause sickness and diarrhea.

, If your cat is very sick, the vet may need to give it treatment very quickly in order to save its life. This treatment could include:


Intravenous fluids: Aggressive intravenous fluids can help counteract dehydration. Given the extreme nature of the sickness and diarrhea, the cat may also become depleted in vital electrolytes, minerals, and glucose in the blood stream so these are added to the drip fluid as necessary, in order to normalize levels.Plasma or blood transfusions: With severe cases, the cat can lose a dangerous amount of blood and become profoundly anemic and also protein depleted. Finding blood for blood transfusions in the cat can be difficult but where the clinic has the resources to source a blood donor and match blood types, a blood transfusion can be life saving., There are a variety of treatments that may be given to your cat. These are based around supportive care, which works to support your cat's immune system while it fights off the infection. For example, all distemper is a viral infection, but antibiotics are often given because the cat is so debilitated it is vulnerable to life-threatening bacterial infections.Antibiotics are usually given by injection as the gut is compromised by the sickness and diarrhea.

, This type of medication will make your cat more comfortable. They are given to help the cat feel less nauseous and reduce the amount of vomiting.Antiemetics are anti-nausea medications, which include metoclopramide or maropitant.

, Intravenous B vitamins helps promote good bowel health and can aid recovery. Like the other treatments for distemper, they support your cat's immune system in its fight against the infection., For example, cats with distemper may be helped by Interferon. Although it is not licensed for use in cats for this purpose, Virbagen Omega interferon may have a place in the treatment of feline distemper. It is licensed for this use in dogs and helps to strengthen the immune system to fight the infection.

, Nursing care is essential, such as keeping the cat warm on a heat pad, since extremely poorly animals are prone to losing heat and hypothermia.Make sure your cat is as comfortable as possible while it works on recovering.


The cat should be turned regularly, such as every half hour, and the side it is lying on changed. This reduces the risk of blood pooling on one side of the body, which can induce a form of pneumonia.

, If the cat survives the acute phase of the illness, it should be reintroduced to bland food, such as a prescription diet designed for gastroenteritis (Hills ID or Purina EN) or white meat and rice. This is fed little and often until the cat has been producing a formed stool for 3 - 4 days, at which point a slow transition back onto regular food can start., A very high percentage of cats who are infected with distemper, especially kittens, die. This is a very serious infection that requires a very strong immune system to eliminate.It is your job to care for the cat as best you can. This means making it as comfortable and pain free as possible.

, Highly effective vaccines are available that prevent panleukopenia infection. This is the most effective way to prevent your cat from getting this infection. The vaccine can be given from six to eight weeks of age and requires two doses, three to four weeks apart. Thereafter, the cat requires a booster after twelve months, and then vaccination every third year to extend the protection.

, Young kittens do not start their distemper vaccinations until they are around six to eight weeks old.They are born with some antibodies received from their mothers, but this is not a sure bet for keeping the distemper virus at bay. In fact, these natural antibodies can counteract this vaccination, allowing those kittens with early vaccinations to be susceptible to the disease. This is why it is important to keep small kittens away from other cats.


It is best to keep kittens away from other cats, expect for their litter mates and their mother.

, While it is not always evident that a cat has gone to the bathroom in your yard, if you see it you should clean it up. Many cats are outside cats and contact with other cat's feces can pose a health risk.


Because the virus can be spread easily, it's also important to wash your hands before handling young kittens. This is especially important if you have been petting other cats recently., Virus particles are excreted in infected feces, where they contaminate the environment and can remain infectious for years. Unfortunately, an added complication is that recovered cats can carry on excreting virus for six weeks after their recovery, providing yet more sources of infection for other cats.Because of this, it's important to keep a recovering cat isolated from other cats, so that it does not infect them.


If you have multiple cats in your house it is most likely that they are all infected if one is infected. However, it's important to isolate the infected cat completely if by chance your other cats are not infected.

Discuss chemotherapy options with your vet.,
Administer chemotherapy as prescribed.,
Monitor your cat for negative side effects.,
Observe a response to treatment.,
Administer chemotherapy for the rest of your cat’s life.",How to Treat Feline Intestinal Lymphoma1," Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for feline intestinal lymphoma.Chemotherapy drugs work by disrupting cancer cell growth and replication. The common treatment recommendation is multi-agent chemotherapy, in which several chemotherapy drugs are used at the same time.Several chemotherapy combinations are available.


Chemotherapy will help extend your cat’s life and improve its quality of life.To decide which chemotherapy drugs to use, your vet will consider several factors, such as the cancer grade (likelihood of cancer growing and spreading) and whether your cat has other diseases.Prednisone, which is a steroid, is often used in combination with chemotherapy to treat feline intestinal lymphoma. It can help reduce the severity of symptoms, especially in the early stages of the cancer.Chemotherapy drugs used to treat feline intestinal lymphoma include vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.;
, Chemotherapy drugs can either be injected into a vein or given by mouth.If your vet prescribes oral chemotherapy, you can treat your cat at home. Because chemotherapy regimens can be confusing and complicated, make sure your vet clearly explains how often you should give each drug.


Your vet will administer the chemotherapy if it is injectable. You will need to schedule regular appointments for chemotherapy treatments.

, Fortunately, most cats with intestinal lymphoma tolerate chemotherapy very well. Side effects tend to be mild. Examples of side effects are vomiting, diarrhea, and appetite loss. They usually occur a few days after treatment and stop on their own.Chemotherapy can weaken a cat’s immune system, which increases the risk of infections like urinary tract infections.Signs of a urinary tract infection include painful urination and blood in the urine.
If your cat becomes sick while on chemotherapy, call your vet. Your vet can either adjust the drug dosages or increase the amount of time between treatments. If your cat still can’t tolerate the chemotherapy, your vet may have to discontinue therapy., The ideal response to chemotherapy treatment is remission, which is the temporary disappearance of cancer signs. If your cat enters remission, it will feel like it did before it developed lymphoma.Remission for feline intestinal lymphoma commonly lasts one to two years, but the duration can vary depending on the cancer's severity and extent., Oral chemotherapy treatment of feline intestinal lymphoma is lifelong.Lifelong chemotherapy can become expensive, so talk with your vet if you have financial concerns about lifelong treatment.

Decide whether surgery is right for your cat.,
Allow your vet to perform surgery.,
Care for your cat after surgery.,
Begin chemotherapy after surgery.",How to Treat Feline Intestinal Lymphoma2," Surgery is another treatment option for feline intestinal lymphoma. It is recommended when the cancer has blocked part of the intestine or the intestine is perforated (has small holes in it).Surgery is also a good option when there is only one tumor mass.When discussing treatment options with your vet, ask them whether surgery would be a good option.


If intestinal lymphoma has made your cat very sick, your vet may be concerned about it being strong enough to undergo surgery.

, If surgery is a good option for your cat, your vet will surgically remove as much of the tumor as possible. Because lymphoma often spreads to other organs, your vet will likely take biopsies of other digestive organs, such as the liver and pancreas, to determine if the cancer has spread.Your vet will send these samples to a pathologist, who will analyze the samples under a microscope to look for cancerous lymphocytes.


Rather than just removing the tumor, your vet will remove the section of intestine containing the tumor.
Your cat will need some time to recover at your vet’s office. Your vet or a member of their staff will contact you to let you know when you can take your cat home.

, When pick up your cat, you will receive some at-home care instructions. Following these instructions will help your cat start feeling better after surgery. Examples of instructions are below:Monitor your cat for signs of poor recovery, including shivering, pale gums, and bleeding. Call your vet if your cat is not recovering well.
Offer half of your cat’s normal servings of food and water about two hours after bringing your cat home. Keep in mind that, with lymphoma, your cat was likely already eating less.
If your vet prescribed pain medication, follow the prescription instructions carefully when giving the medication to your cat.
Check the incision site each day. If it looks discolored or you see discharge coming from the incision, the incision may be infected. Contact your vet.

, Since lymphoma can affect multiple organs, chemotherapy is often recommended after surgical treatment for feline intestinal lymphoma. However, because chemotherapy can delay wound healing and possibly cause the surgical incision to rupture, your vet will recommend waiting 10‒14 days after surgery before starting chemotherapy."

Have your vet administer intensive supportive care.,
Feed your cat a healthy diet.,
Have your vet administer vitamin B12.,
Control your cat’s nausea and vomiting.",How to Treat Feline Intestinal Lymphoma3," Some cats with intestinal lymphoma are very sick. They may have lost a lot of weight or become anemic (low red blood cell count). If your cat is extremely sick, it will need intensive supportive care before beginning chemotherapy. This care may include fluid therapy (to rehydrate your cat), placement of a feeding tube, or a blood transfusion.A feeding tube would be used only if your cat is not vomiting. This tube could be placed either down your cat’s esophagus or directly into its stomach.Once your cat is a little stronger, it can start receiving chemotherapy.

, If your cat is well enough to eat on its own, feed it a healthy diet at home. This diet should be highly digestible and tasty.If your cat has any specific nutritional needs, your vet will recommend a diet that will meet those needs.


Cats especially like canned foods. Your cat may be able to eat canned food more easily than dry food during treatment.
If your cat doesn’t feel like eating during treatment, your vet may prescribe an appetite stimulant., Cats with intestinal lymphoma tend to have low vitamin B12 levels in their blood. Your vet can give your cat a once-weekly injection of vitamin B12 under the skin to correct this nutrient deficiency. Vitamin B12 injections can help stimulate appetite.Your vet will determine how long your cat will need vitamin B12 injections.

, Sometimes, chemotherapy can cause nausea and vomiting in cats. If your cat has these side effects, your vet can prescribe an anti-nausea or anti-vomiting medication to help your cat feel better."

Keep your cat’s litter tray clean.,
Give each of your cat’s plenty of space.,
Use oocyst-killing disinfectants.,
Use an ammonia based disinfectant.,
Steam clean your home.,
Keep your cat from hunting in areas where the bacteria is known to exist.,
Clean your cat regularly while she is being treated for this condition.",How to Treat Coccidiosis in Cats1," Feces from an infected cat contains coccidian oocysts. If your cat comes into contact with the feces, such as when using the same dirty litter tray, she may become infected when she grooms fur that has oocysts stuck to it. To decrease the risk of exposure to infectious feces the following litter tray hygiene measures should be followed strictly:


Remove feces from the litter tray every day. This reduces the opportunity for cross-cat contamination.
Provide one tray per cat in the household, plus a spare : this makes it more likely each cat will use their ""own"" toilet facility and are thus less likely to be contaminated if another cat has coccidiosis.
Clean litter trays twice a week (minimum) : Be sure to empty all litter trays and either steam-clean them, or use an ammonia based disinfectant to rid them of harmful bacteria.

, Try to avoid crowding your cats together. Pet shops, catteries, and animal shelters need to be especially careful to keep cats in groups of four or less, and, where possible, house them individually. In a domestic setting be sensible about how many cats you own.


For example, three-bedroomed house (with access to the outside) is suitable for no more than five cats.

, Coccidian oocysts are resistant to low temperatures and many disinfectants. They are, however, killed by high temperatures, desiccation (drying-out), and steam.


The following steps are effective ways of cleaning litter trays, play pens, and floors.

, ""OO-cide"" is a disinfectant manufactured by Vetoquinol, which is effective against coccidians. The product is made up of two packs. Pack number one is dissolved in water and applied to the surfaces that need cleaning. Pack number two is dissolved in water and applied after Pack number one.


This causes ammonia to be released, which is the active coccidiocide. Take extreme care when using this product because harmful vapors are released when this product is in use. When cleaning, you will need to wear a respirator and rubber gloves, and avoid spending time in the treated room until the surfaces are dry.
The room will need to be ventilated as well, so open up all windows and doors.

, Steam cleaning is effective at killing oocysts and safer for the operator than OO-cide. Be sure to expose all surfaces to the steam when steam cleaning.


You can hire professional steam cleaners to come into your home and steam clean.

, Cats can become infected by eating infected prey. Thus, preventing cats from hunting prevents infection from this route.


One way to keep your cat from hunting is to keep her inside.

, Oocysts can cling to your cat's coat. Thus, it is possible for a cat that is successfully treated with drugs, to re-infect herself when grooming. To avoid this it is best to bathe your cat in warm water with a mild baby shampoo or shampoo specifically meant for cats.


This should be done on the first and last day of treatment, in order to physically wash away contamination from your cat’s coat.

Understand how phenobarbital helps to prevent seizures.,
Begin by giving your cat 1-2mg/kg of phenobarbital twice per day.,
Use liquid phenobarbital on cats who are difficult to pill.,
Note that phenobarbital may cause cats to seem sedated.,
Realize that phenobarbital may cause your cat to gain weight.,
Be aware of the risks associated with phenobarbital.",How to Treat Epilepsy in Cats1," Phenobarbital is the most commonly prescribed medication to treat seizures in cats.


Phenobarbital is an anticonvulsant which works by raising the motor cortex's threshold for stimulation while simultaneously decreasing neural excitability.
This means that the cat's nerves become less responsive, while her brain requires a greater trigger to set off a seizure.;
, The recommended dosage of phenobarbital is 1-2mg/kg. Thus, an average 5kg cat will require 1.7 milliliters (0.06  fl oz) of a 15mg/ml phenobarbital elixir, twice per day.


If this dosage is ineffective, you may need to give the cat a third dose of the medication each day.
Once swallowed, phenobarbital crosses the stomach lining and is rapidly absorbed into the blood stream.

, Phenobarbital is available in both tablet and liquid form. The liquid form is easier to use on cats who are difficult to pill.


Anyone who has had to pill an unwilling cat in the past knows how difficult it can be, and trying to do it three times per day, over an extended period, can put a serious strain on the pet/owner relationship.
Liquid phenobarbital is also better when small doses of the medication have been prescribed. This is due to the fact that the tablets are very hard and can be difficult to cut up.

, In the first 4 to 5 days of phenobarbital treatment, the cat may appear to be sedated. However, you cat should become more alert and active once her body adjusts to the new medication.

, Like with dogs, phenobarbital stimulates the cat's thirst and appetite, which may cause her to gain weight. This is unavoidable, but you can do your best to maintain your cat's health by feeding her a healthy diet.

, Phenobarbital is metabolized by the liver. Therefore, if the cat's liver function is impaired the phenobarbital cannot be broken down properly, causing it to rise to toxic levels.


In rare cases, phenobarbital causes immune-mediated destruction of blood cells and deactivates the bone marrow, which stops it from producing new cells.
You can do your best to prevent these complications by monitoring your cat's health carefully and bringing her for regular check-ups at the vet's.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Write down the foods you feed your cat.,
Note your cat's current health.,

Give your cat the prescribed dosage.,
Monitor for side effects.,
Take your cat for regular check ups.,
Regulate the light and temperature.,
Store the supplement in a dry place.,
Keep the supplement away from children.",How to Supplement Taurine for Cats," Because there are no direct symptoms of taurine deficiency, you should take your cat for regular vet checkups. The frequency of visits depends on your cat's stage of life and general health.


Kittens should go every three to four weeks until they've had their full round of vaccinations.
Healthy adult cats (age 1 to 7-10, depending on breed) should have a checkup once a year.
Senior cats (over the age of 7-10) need a checkup one every six months.;
, Unlike most mammals, cats don't produce enough taurine to stay healthy. This is why their diets must be taurine-rich. Food formulated for dogs or other mammals doesn't contain the necessary levels of taurine. Cat foods high in grains and other carbohydrates might also be low in taurine. If you give your cat meals that you prepare, they're also likely deficient in taurine., Taurine levels can run low if your cat is in less than perfect health. A recent illness or chronic health condition, such as kidney disease, might deplete your cat's levels of taurine. Let your vet know about any health issues your cat may be experiencing., Taurine for cats usually comes in a powdered form that you can add to their food. Although you can buy it over-the counter, different some brands might not be as high-quality as others. Ask your vet for recommendations.


Let your vet know if your cat is already taking medication or other supplements. Although no drug interactions have been reported, it's always best to err on the side of safety., In most cases, your cat will need the supplement twice a day. Cats in the early stages of taurine deficiency will have to take the supplement for at least three to four months. If the deficiency was caught later, your cat will probably need supplemental taurine for the rest of their life., Taurine is generally safe for all cats. However, some cats might experience an upset stomach. If your cat doesn't seem to tolerate the supplement, notify your vet., Depending on the severity of the deficiency, your vet will schedule follow-up visits. Even after they give your cat a clean bill of health, you might have to return between regular visits as a preventive measure. Follow all instructions to the letter., Make sure the storage location is no warmer than 70 °F (21 °C). Keep the taurine out of direct sunlight. High temperatures and exposure to light can ruin the effectiveness of the supplement., Keep it away from all sources of water and moisture. This includes near sinks and anywhere in the bathroom. Moisture causes the taurine to break down., While taurine is generally safe for humans of all ages, any medicine intended for an animal should be kept out of the reach of children. Store the supplement in a cabinet that children can't reach. Use child-safe locks, if necessary."

Understand that any medication you give your cat will be “off label”.,
Understand the different dosages and their effects on the bacterial infection.,
Consider your cat’s other health problems when getting prescription antibiotics for your cat.",How to Treat Coccidiosis in Cats2," There is no drug licensed for the treatment of coccidiosis in cats. This means that any drug used to treat coccidiosis is ""off label"", or that the drug you are using is not specifically designed for what you are using it for. The most effective, first choice treatment is a prescription for sulfonamide antibiotics.


You will need a prescription for these antibiotics from your cat’s vet. When you meet with him or her, talk about other potential options.;
, The effect of these sulphonamide antibiotics is dose dependent. At higher doses they are coccidiocidal (meaning they kill protozoa) and at lower doses they are a coccidiostat (meaning they stop the protozoa from breeding). Cats are most commonly prescribed a potentiated form of sulphonamide that contains sulfadiazine potentiated (activated) by trimethoprim. You will most likely give the cat this medication for six days.


The dose is generally 15 to 30 mg per kg of weight. You will most likely give your cat a divided dose twice a day for six days. At the lower end of this dose range (15 mg/kg) a 5 kg cat would receive a half a 80 mg Trimacare tablet, twice a day., Sulfonamide drugs are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. In animals with liver or kidney damage, the dose should be towards the lower end of the dose range. This is because the organs have a reduced ability to get rid of the drug and so it tends to accumulate in the blood stream.


Giving a full dose can result in toxicity issues such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A reduced dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily is appropriate."
"
Know what the symptoms of this condition are.,
Understand how coccidiosis is diagnosed.,
Familiarize yourself with the coccidian life cycle.",How to Treat Coccidiosis in Cats3," Those cats most likely to show symptoms of coccidiosis are young kittens, those with weak immune systems, or cats kept in crowded, unhygienic conditions. Coccidia invade the gut and irritate the lining of the bowel.


This causes stomach cramps, loss of appetite, and poor growth in young kittens.
Cats commonly develop diarrhea with mucus, a jelly-like substance, in it and flecks of blood from the inflamed bowel wall. These cats are not usually suddenly ill, in a life-threatening way, but will act like they do not feel well. Without treatment, their general body conditions will decline.

, A diagnosis of coccidiosis can be reached by looking at fecal samples under the microscope. Coccidian eggs, or oocysts, have a typical appearance; they look like oval-shaped eggs and contain either one or two sporoblasts (these divide to produce adult coccidians) which look like round balls.

, Coccidia have both a direct and an indirect life cycle. The direct life cycle means the parasite survives by passing from cat to cat via fecal contamination. The indirect life cycle means the parasite infects an intermediate host such as vermin where it remains dormant. When the mouse is eaten by a cat, the oocysts in the mouse bowel are activated and infect the cat.

Understand how diazepam works to prevent seizure clusters.,
Give diazepam to your cat orally.,
Administer diazepam rectally during a seizure.,
Be aware that in rare cases diazepam can cause hepatic necrosis.The use of diazepam in cats is somewhat controversial because in rare cases it can cause a fatal hepatic necrosis.",How to Treat Epilepsy in Cats2," When treatment with phenobarbital is ineffective or impractical, diazepam can be given to your cat instead. However, instead of being administered on a daily basis to prevent seizures, diazepam is given directly after a seizure in order to decrease the likelihood of a cluster of seizures.Some cats are more prone to seizure clusters than others. A seizure cluster is a group of seizures that occur in rapid succession, one after the other.
Diazepam works by depressing central nervous system activity, dampening the brain waves and making them less reactive. This helps to decrease the chance of further seizures.

, Normally, you can give diazepam to your cat orally. The correct dosage will vary from cat to cat, depending on how your cat reacts to the medication. Your vet will usually prescribe a dosage between 1 and 5mg per day.

, If a cat is in the grip of a seizure then a rectal suppository will be more effective, as diazepam is rapidly absorbed across the rectal mucosa.


Rectal dosing syringes are available in 5mg tube sizes, which is the correct dose for an average sized cat. This will sedate the cat for 6 to 8 hours, making additional seizures less likely.
Administering the suppository is not difficult - it requires the same technique as for taking a cat's temperature.

,


This means that the liver has an idiosyncratic reaction that causes it to go into irreversible shut down. The exact reason for this remains unclear.
However, it's important to be aware that this is a rare occurrence, and the chances of it happening need to be weighed against the ongoing misery (for you and your cat) of further seizures.

"
"
Avoid touching your cat during a seizure.,
Place cushions around your cat to protect her during a seizure.,
Consider keeping an epileptic cat indoors.,
Think about switching your cat to a gluten-free diet.",How to Treat Epilepsy in Cats3," You should avoid touching your cat during a seizure at all costs. Any stimulation such as touch, sound, or even smell, stimulates the brain and can prolong the seizure.


With this in mind close the curtains, turn off the lights, switch off the TV, and get everybody else out of the room.
Never put your hand near or into your cat's mouth while she is seizuring. The cat may bite down and be unable to let go., If the cat is seizing somewhere she could hurt himself, rather than move the cat, place cushions around her for protection. If the cat is in danger of falling and hurting herself, place a thick duvet on the ground to break her fall.

, Cats are independent creatures who love to explore and roam around their territory. However, seizures are unpredictable and can happen at any time, in any place.


If your cat were to have a fit while climbing a tree, she could fall and injure himself. Likewise, a cat that relies on her wits to stay one step ahead of the neighbor's dog, for instance, could get into big trouble if she had a seizure at the wrong time.
With this in mind you should consider keeping your cat indoors. This does not guarantee her safety but at least you are more likely to find her if she has fallen from a height and incapacitated herself.

, There is no scientific evidence that diet plays a role in causing epilepsy in the cat. However, there are anecdotal accounts of cats that stopped having seizures when they were fed a gluten free diet.


Since cats are obligate carnivores it can be argued that they are not equipped to deal with wheat in their diet, and thus more likely to form gluten antibodies which are toxic to the brain.
Therefore, if your cat is otherwise healthy, it would do no harm to put your cat on a complete, balanced diet that is gluten free, low in carbohydrate, and high in protein.

Determine if your cat is healthy aside from her chronic vomiting.,
Adjust your cat’s food.,
Switch your cat to a bland diet to help settle her stomach.,
Give your cat Famotidine.,
Talk to your vet about giving your cat non-prescription gastroprotectants.",How to Treat Chronic Vomiting in Cats1," If your cat is healthy despite vomiting often, it means that there is most likely no underlying medical cause that needs to be treated. Instead, aspects of your cat’s lifestyle might need to be changed. Signs that this may be the case include:


Your cat is not losing weight.
Your cat acts like she normally does, and seems generally healthy.
Your cat only vomits once every two to three days.
Keep in mind that if your cat’s health gets worse, the vomiting gets more frequent, or your cat becomes lethargic or loses weight, you should seek the help of a veterinarian.;
, If the vomiting coincided with a change of diet, put your cat back onto a type of food that she was fine with before the chronic vomiting began. Some cats can have food intolerance, or food allergy, and it is possible that the new food contains a protein your cat is allergic to.When a cat eats a protein that she is sensitive to, the protein molecule bridges a receptor in the bowel wall, which triggers an inflammatory reaction. It is this inflammation that causes the vomiting. When the food that is causing the allergy is taken away, the inflammation should settle in one to two days.

, A cat with chronic vomiting that is fed a rich diet, such as a premium supermarket food, may be sensitive to the humectants and additives, or indeed the rich nature of the food itself. Try changing your cat’s diet to a bland, white meat diet such as chicken breast, turkey, rabbit, cod, or coley.Feed your cat 100% meat, rather than a meat-flavored food. An average-sized cat needs roughly 250 kcal a day; this is equivalent to feeding your cat around 250 grams of chicken breast a day.
An alternative to meat is to feed your cat one of the many prescription diets that are designed to speed up the healing of the bowel. Diets like Hills ID or Purina HA are ideal for a cat recovering from sickness.

, Famotidine is commonly sold as Pepcid AC. If your cat’s mucosal lining in her stomach is damaged, then giving her medications to repair the lining can help to stop the vomiting. When the lining is damaged, the stomach acid can eat away at the exposed stomach wall. Antacid medications such as famotidine decrease stomach acid production and give the lining a chance to repair itself while the inflammation subsides.


This drug should be used with caution in cats with heart disease because it can slow the heart rate. However this is usually only a problem when the medication is given intravenously.
The prescribed dose is generally 0.5 mg/kg once a day by mouth. A 5 kg cat thus requires 2.5 mg; the lowest tablet size is 10 mg, which equates to a quarter of a tablet, once a day.

, Kaolin and Pectin (Kaopectate) are both gastroprotectants that can help to protect the lining of your cat’s bowels. The kaolin and pectin absorb toxins produced in the gut, and also line the gut wall to provide a protective barrier.


However, this medication is not effective in all cats. Consider calling your vet before giving this medication to your cat.

Monitor what your cat eats for a day or two.,
Change your cat’s food.,
Change the size and frequency of the meals.",How to Treat Excessive Flatulence in Cats1," To figure out if the problem is related to the food, you should keep a record of your cat’s food and eating habits for a day or two. This can give you a complete view of their foods so you can figure out what is causing the gas.Make sure not to change anything for a day or two so you can try to get an accurate idea of the causes.;
, A food that is lower in fiber may be more digestible for your cat. Foods high in fiber that can’t be digested may linger in the digestive tract and ferment, which can cause gas. Foods that contain high amounts of wheat, corn, and soybeans can cause gas.Don’t change your cat’s food suddenly. This could cause digestive problems and make the flatulence worse. Instead, start slowly mixing the new food with the old and phase out the old food while giving the cat more new food.
Talk to your vet about a good low fiber food that may help your cat.

, Eating too much may cause gas in your cat. To help fix this problem, feed your cat small portions of food. This can ensure your cat gets food, but not too much, which can sit in the digestive tract and cause gas.If you reduce the portions, feed your cat more often throughout the day so they get the same amount of food.

Understand that overactive thyroid glands can lead to vomiting.,
Help your cat get rid of Helicobacteria.,
Understand that a foreign body in your cat’s stomach can make your cat sick.",How to Treat Chronic Vomiting in Cats2," If your cat is unwell and vomiting, then seek veterinary advice. Vomiting is usually a symptom of a problem rather than a diagnosis in itself. Identifying the cause of the vomiting and treating the underlying problem will help to stop the sickness.


The following steps cover common underlying causes that may cause your cat to develop chronic vomiting.

, If the mucosal barrier lining the stomach is damaged, digestive acids come into contact with the stomach wall and cause an erosion, or ulcer. Certain medications such as steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause side effects which include gastric ulceration that leads to vomiting.Diagnosis: An ulcer may be suspected if the cat has a recent history of taking NSAIDs or other medications; especially if they were given on an empty stomach by accident (food protects the lining of the stomach). Imaging such as ultrasound or endoscopy (putting a fiber optic camera into the stomach) may be required to identify the lesion.
Treatment: Treatment involves stopping the medication that caused the initial problem, and using gastroprotectants and antacid drugs to help your cat’s stomach to heal.

, Liver infection (a condition known as cholangiohepatitis) is commonly associated with vomiting. This is a self-seeded infection where bacteria from the bowel reflux up the bile duct and create an infection in the liver. Cats with cholangiohepatitis vomit, have poor appetites, and may be jaundiced.


Diagnosis: Your veterinarian will run blood tests to look for raised liver enzymes, and a high white cell count. He or she will also scan the liver using an ultrasound, in order to make a diagnosis.
Treatment: The majority of cats respond well to a therapy of antibiotics, anti-sickness injections, and intravenous fluids if the cat is dehydrated.

, A diseased kidney is not efficient at filtering the natural waste products of the digestive process. Instead, these toxins gradually build up in the blood where they cause inflammation and ulceration of the stomach lining, and sometimes the gums.Diagnosis: Kidney disease is usually diagnosed with a blood screen, which measures the levels of toxic metabolites such as urea and creatinine, and the build-up of minerals such a phosphate.
Treatment: Treatment includes putting your cat on a prescription food that is low in toxic metabolites. Another treatment is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) such as benazepril. ACEi work by inhibiting an enzyme cascade that causes blood vessel contraction. This leads to a dilation of the blood vessels supplying the kidney, which mean blood supply to the kidney is increased.

, Phosphate, which is associated with kidney disease, is recognized as a cause of nausea in cats. However, cats can also have an increased phosphate level without having kidney disease if the phosphate levels are lowered early on.Diagnosis: Like with kidney disease, vets can use a blood screen to look for a build-up of phosphate.
Treatment: The use of phosphate binders such a Renalzin, which is added to food and binds to the phosphate content, means less phosphate gets into the bloodstream. Renalzin comes in a pump; a typical dose in one or two pumps, twice a day with food.

, Pancreatitis is a painful condition in which digestive juices leak into the tissue of the pancreas. This causes a lot of local inflammation, pain, and irritation, which can lead to vomiting.


Treatment through diet: Mild cases of pancreatitis can be managed with a bland diet, which requires less digestive juices to process than fatty diets.
Treatment through medication: Very sick cats need hospitalization for supportive care with intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and pain relief. The antiemetic most commonly used is maropitant.

, The thyroid produces thyroxine, which is a hormone that governs metabolic rate. Too much thyroxine acts like a stimulant, a bit like being permanently high on caffeine. It overstimulates the gut and can cause sickness and diarrhea.


Diagnosis: Your veterinarian will diagnose the condition by feeling for enlarged thyroid glands in the neck and running blood tests to check the levels of thyroid hormones in your cat’s bloodstream.
Treatment: Treatment for hyperthyroidism includes giving your cat a medication called thiamazole (Felimazole) that regulates the production of thyroid hormones.

, This is a spiral shaped bacterium which burrows into the stomach lining, causes inflammation, and can make your cat vomit.Treatment: Treatment helicobacteria with a combination of antibiotics. This combination includes either doxycycline with metronidazole, or amoxicillin with metronidazole. You will most likely have to give your cat these antibiotics for 10 to 21 days.

, A hairball or a small toy can sit in your cat’s stomach and rattle around, much like a lone sock inside a tumble dryer. The foreign body either blocks the exit to the stomach, or else it irritates the stomach lining, and makes the cat sick.


Diagnosis: Your vet will diagnose the foreign body through x-rays or ultrasounds after a thoroughly physical examination.
Treatment: Removing foreign bodies generally involves surgery. A laparotomy is generally used to gain access to the stomach.

Feed multiple cats separately.,
Exercise your cat more.,
Make sure your cat only eats cat food.",How to Treat Excessive Flatulence in Cats2," If a cat eats too quickly, this can lead to excess gas in their digestive tract. For some cats, eating around others becomes a competition because they are afraid they may not get enough food. This leads to eating too fast.

To help with this, try to feed your cat in a separate room so that they eat their food more slowly.

, Helping your cat have a more active lifestyle may help reduce flatulence. Exercise can help aid the body digest any food. Just make sure not to let the cat eat right after exercise. This may lead to excess air being swallowed, which can cause gas., Spoiled food or feces may lead to gas and other intestinal problems. Make sure your cat doesn’t have access to garbage from trash cans or neighbors yards. Cover trash cans or limit where your cat roams.Leftover human food may cause digestive problems because of the spices, added ingredients, and heavy fats.
Some cats will eat deer pellets or other animal feces. Help your cat limit this by cleaning out the litter box if they live inside the house.

Vomiting
Diarrhea
Distended abdomen
Abdomen discomfort

, If you believe your cat has excessive flatulence, you should take them to the vet. The vet will do an exam to try to determine the cause of the problem. The vet will ask questions about your cat’s diet and their eating habits, so think about this before you take the cat to the vet.Flatulence may be caused by infections, parasites, inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorptive and digestive disorders, or constipation.
In rare cases, the vet may have perform further tests if they can’t determine the cause of the flatulence.

, Your vet may prescribe a gas relief medication to help your cat. Some herbs may help with flatulence naturally. However, always discuss any medication or herbal remedy with your vet before giving it to your cat.Your vet may prescribe carminative, zinc acetate, yucca schidigera, bismuth subsalicylate, simethicone, or a pancreatic enzyme supplement.

, Parasites and worms may cause digestive problems that lead to flatulence. Giardia may also cause bad diarrhea. To make sure this is not the cause of flatulence in your cat, give them a deworming regularly.Talk to your vet about having your cat tested for worms. You can also get suggestions for a good worm and parasite treatment from them.

Take note of how the animal reacts around his owner.,
Strike up a non-confrontational conversation with the cat owner.,
Understand what constitutes unintentional abuse.,
Be aware of intentional abuse.",How to Spot the Signs of Cat Abuse," Cat hoarders are a type of unintentional abuser, because they keep their cats in overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions. Overcrowding stresses the cats and forces large numbers of cats to live in a space that they would not normally occupy. This leads to bullying and extreme competition for resources, even if food is freely available, because some cats will be more dominant than others and guard the food.


The hoarder's environment is also usually dirty, lacking a clean place for the cats to sleep, eat, and use the toilet.
Hoarders are often reluctant to receive visitors and act secretively, but the cats are usually easy to spot through the window.;
, Every pet cat has a right to shelter from the wind, rain, sun, and cold, as well as adequate food, fresh water, and sanitation. If these basic principles are not met, it is considered abuse, and can be identified with the following signs:


A painfully thin cat may not have enough food to eat.
A fainting or very thirsty cat may not have enough water or shade.
An antisocial or aggressive cat may have been taken away from his mother prematurely.
A cat that is shut in a small space with no ability to play or fulfill her need for movement.
A cat that is deprived of companionship or forced to live in an environment with loud music or constant shouting.
A cat that does not have a litterbox or access to the outdoors while the owner is away.

, The cat may have hair loss, open sores, or an angry red rash.The cat's coat may be excessively matted, or infested with fleas and ticks. This can cause the cat to scratch himself raw, or have lots of black, coal-like dust mixed in with her hairs (""flea dirt"").


Dab the dirt with a damp cotton towel. A orangey-red stain is blood that indicates a flea infestation.
A cat with a tick infestation has lots of grey ""bubbles"" stuck to his skin, which are the engorging ticks.
The cat may have overgrown nails that dig into the pads and cause the pads to bleed, or weep pus from an infection.

, An untreated open wound on a neglected cat is at risk of ""fly strike."" This means that flies may lay their eggs in the skin, which then hatch out into maggots. If this has already happened, you may notice cream colored grubs wriggling in the wound, or a sickly sweet smell from the infected wound.


Depending on how much they have fed, the maggots range in size from approximately a hair's width and half a millimeter (1/5 inches) long, to chunky grubs.

, Repeated pregnancy is also a form of neglect, because letting a female cat produce litter after litter puts a huge drain on the queen's body.


Breeding is especially irresponsible if the kittens then mysteriously disappear, or populate the neighborhood with unwanted cats.

, Young or middle aged cats should be plump or sleek, with well-covered bones.


If you stroke a cat and his backbone bumps against your fingers, or if you can easily count each of his ribs, then the cat in underweight.

, Look for any cats that seem to be regularly injured, cut, or lame. A cat that favors a different leg on different days is especially suspicious, as this is likely caused by repeated injury rather than a chronic medical condition.


If you witness the owner in the act of physically abusing a cat, record the time and details and contact the police.

, Most animals that are being abused give tell-tale signs in their behavior.


Commonly, the cats are described as seeming ""cowed"", hunkering down with dilated eyes, glancing around for an escape route.
Some cats become highly aggressive, and lash out at the slightest provocation, since they regard attack as the best form of defense.

, Never confront the suspected perpetrator but report your suspicions to the authorities. A detailed description or evidence will get your farther than a hunch, so be specific.


These include the local law enforcement authority, animal welfare organization, animal control officer, SPCA, or the local animal shelter.
Collect information such as dates and times that you think the abuse happened, and if possible, document the evidence with photos or videos.

, Make sure to consider the bigger picture before making a judgment call. Sometimes it can be easy to mistake an animal that is sick, but receiving veterinary treatment, for a pet that is being abused.


For instance, an animal that is very thin may have a medical condition that is being managed, not starving from lack of food.

, The cat's behavior around his owner can be a good indicator of its feelings towards the owner.


If the cat runs to greet his owner and rubs around his legs purring that is a good sign.
If the cat flinches and cowers, it is possible he is being abused.
Even this is not conclusive, especially if you witness the cat struggling due to being fed medication or given a bath.

, To determine if there is a possible explanation for a cat in distress, simply approach the owner and ask gently. Ask him whether the cat is all right, and listen attentively to the answer.


Try to keep your tone conversational.
If the owner says the cat is on medical treatment, you can try asking which vet the cat is seeing.
If you are not satisfied by the answer, do not confront the owner, but consider putting the problem in the hands of the authorities.

, Unintentional abuse is just what it sounds like, abuse that occurs due to inadequate care, but is not malevolent. Sadly, even people who consider themselves animal lovers can perpetrate unintentional abuse.


This type of abuse typically involves failing to meet all the animals' basic needs, such as adequate food, clean water, a clean place to rest, and shelter from the elements.
Unintentional abuse is common when people hoard more animals than they can care for, or when they neglect their cats by not providing adequate food while they are on holiday.

, Intentional abuse occurs when the owner knows that the animal is being harmed or injured, but does nothing about it. In the worst case, this can be intentional neglect with cruel intent, intentionally inflicting pain and suffering on the cat.


Besides physical injury, intentional abuse includes not taking a sick cat to the vet or not treating a flea infected cat.

Make sure that your cat is actually swallowing her medication.,
Understand that too short a course of antibiotics can lead to a recurrent infection.,
Get a culture done to figure out what antibiotic your cat needs.,
Complete the antibiotic course.,
Extend the antibiotic course for two weeks if there is still bacteria in your cat’s urine.",How to Stop Recurring Urinary Tract Infections in Cats1," When your cat does not actually swallow her medicine, it is called failure of compliance. This happens if the cat is clever at spitting out the tablets, or if you accidentally forget to give your cat her medication. Either way, the complete course of antibiotics is not given, and those bacteria remaining in your cat's bladder are more likely to be resistant to this antibiotic in the future.


The key to avoiding recurrence due to failure of compliance is to ensure that every single dose of antibiotic is given on time, and swallowed rather than spat out. Some cats are impossible to give pills to. If this is true for your pet, tell your veterinarian who may be able to give a long acting antibiotic injection instead, such as cefalexin (Convenia). This antibiotic provides cover for two weeks after a single injection.;
, Some infections take longer to clear than others. This is usually dependent on the number of bacteria present and whether or not the conditions in the bladder make it easy for them to reproduce. If the course of antibiotics is too short then there is a greater chance that the bacteria in the bladder will repopulate when the treatment ends.


For example, a bacterial infection in dilute urine (that has less natural disinfectant properties) may need a longer course of antibiotics than bacteria in a hostile environment such as concentrated, acidic urine where they are less likely to reproduce.

, The gold standard in antibiotic usage is to take a culture of the cat’s urine to determine the exact antibiotic most likely to kill the bacteria causing the infection.


To get a culture done, head to your vet’s office and tell the vet about your cat’s symptoms and recurrent UTIs.

, Regardless of the type of antibiotic prescribed to your cat, you should get a second culture done before the antibiotic course is over. This second culture will help to determine if the antibiotics are working.If the sample is sterile, then the antibiotic course can be completed and does not need to be extended.

, If the second culture shows that the bacteria are still present, then you will need to extend the antibiotic course for two weeks. When this second course is nearing its end, get another culture done to make sure that the bacteria has been cleared out.

Continual nasal discharge can signal a variety of illnesses that need to be treated by a veterinarian. During the appointment, your veterinarian should ask you about your cat's symptoms, assess your cat's overall health, and give a diagnosis for what is causing your cat's runny nose. Some illnesses that could be causing your cat's runny nose include:Upper respiratory infection
Bacterial infection
Fungal infection
Parasites
Foreign bodies
Oral disease
Inflammatory polyps
Nasal cancer
Allergies;
, Once your veterinarian comes up with a diagnosis, they will suggest treatment options for your cat. This will vary depending on your cat's underlying illness, but with chronic nasal discharge your veterinarian will likely prescribe an antibiotic to eliminate any underlying infections.Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment, including the amount of medication to give your cat, how to administer it, and how long you should give it to them.
If your veterinarian finds that your cat has a rare or serious illness, such as nasal cancer, this may require extensive treatment, such as surgery.

, If your veterinarian suggests that your cat's nasal problems are related to dental issues, you should have those fixed. It may be that your regular veterinarian can do dental procedures on your cat. However, you may need to take your cat to a veterinary dentist if the procedure is complex., Supplements, such as L-lysine, help to support mucous membrane health and stimulate the immune system. This can be very helpful for eliminating some causes of nasal discharge, such as upper respiratory disease. Discuss the option of supplements with your veterinarian and give to your cat as directed.It is important to discuss any supplements you are giving to your cat with your veterinarian, especially if your cat is already on medication. You want to avoid any dangerous medicine interactions that could occur.

, If your cat has nasal discharge, you should be sure to clean the area daily. Use a soft, damp cloth to clean the area around the nose, making sure that the cat's nostrils are not crusty or clogged up.Most cats will resist having their noses wiped. You may have to wrap your cat up in a towel to keep it immobilized while you are cleaning its nose.

, Nasal discharge can be caused, or at least worsened, by dust and foreign particles. To avoid irritating the nasal and throat passages of your cat, you should clean your home regularly, paying particular attention to removing dust and debris from your cat's favorite areas.In addition to cleaning, you can purchase and install an air purifier in your home to keep the air clean.

, As your cat is recuperating from chronic nasal discharge, you should pamper it a little bit. Make sure it is getting lots of rest, getting nutritious meals, and lots of extra love and attention. Making sure that your cat stays warm and gets the extra rest it needs to fight off an infection will go a long way towards speeding its recovery.

This is especially helpful in cases where no cause to the nasal discharge is found. All you can do it make sure that your cat is as comfortable as possible and support its immune system by caring for the cat properly., If your cat has clear versus colored or cloudy nasal discharge it can mean very different things health-wise. In general, clear nasal discharge signals a less serious infection than cloudy or colored nasal discharge does. Although, any type of chronic nasal drip needs to be assessed by a veterinarian, a cat that has brown, green, or blood tinged nasal discharge needs veterinary treatment immediately.Clear nasal discharge is often associated with allergies or other health problems not related to infection.

, Chronic nasal discharge is often accompanied by wheezing or labored breathing in cats. This signals that your cat likely has an infection in its lungs or another part of its upper respiratory tract.If your cat has slight wheezing when it breathes, that is not an emergency in general. However, if your cat is having a hard time breathing or getting full breaths, then that is an emergency and you should take your cat to be seen by a veterinarian immediately.

, Coughing and sneezing are symptoms of illness that often goes along with chronic nasal discharge. If your cat is coughing or sneezing in addition to having a runny nose, it could mean that your cat has an upper respiratory infection or another type of infection in its upper respiratory tract.If your cat sneezes once in awhile, that does not necessarily mean it is connected to some sort of illness. It is repeated and strong sneezes that are often related to upper respiratory tract illnesses.

, If you see that your cat has nasal discharge, you should look for other symptoms that could connected to its illness. Any unusual physical symptoms or behavioral issues could be related to your cat's chronic nasal discharge, so make note of them.You should make note of any symptoms that you witness on your cat so that you can tell your veterinarian about them. Take note of when the symptoms started and if they are better or worse at any particular times.

Keep you cat hydrated.,
Help your cat lose weight.,
Improve the GAG layer.",How to Stop Recurring Urinary Tract Infections in Cats2," The bacteria in your cat’s bladder produces waste products and chemicals that can irritate the lining of your cat's bladder. When the bladder becomes irritated, it can become inflamed and prone to infection. If you give your cat plenty of water, you can help to dilute your cat’s urine, thereby limiting the amount of time the bacteria’s waste material spends in the bladder.


To increase your cat's water intake, switch her from dry food to a wet food diet. This automatically increases the amount of fluid she gets each day. You should also provide your cat with plenty of wide-lipped water bowls.
You can also try giving your cat purified water, rather than tap water. Some cats are very sensitive to the taste of chlorine that can be found in tap water.

, Overweight cats are more likely to get UTIs than their less heavy counterparts. This is because overweight cats tend to move around less and hold in their urine, rather than rousing themselves to go to the litter box. Urine retention can irritate the bladder lining.


Putting your cat on a diet and helping her to get to a normal weight may help to clear up your cat’s recurrent UTIs.

, The bladder produces a layer of mucus-like material that acts like a bandage that protects the bladder’s lining from harmful substances in the urine. When a cat has a UTI, this glycosaminoglycan, or ""GAG"" layer, becomes thinner, exposing the bladder lining to irritation. There is some anecdotal evidence that nutraceuticals such as glucosamine, help to replenish this GAG layer and make the cat more comfortable.Talk to your vet about giving your cat ""Feliway Cystease"". Cystease contains glucosamine and tryptophan; the latter may help to decrease stress in anxious cats, and stress can cause bladder inflammation.
Talk to your vet about pentosan sulphate injection if your cat won’t take pills. If your cat won't take capsules, then an injection containing acetyl glucosamine is available through your veterinarian.

Treat crystals in your cat’s urine.,
Help your cat get rid of bladder stones.,
Manage bladder polyps and bladder cancer.",How to Stop Recurring Urinary Tract Infections in Cats3," The minerals contained in your cat’s food interact with your cat’s body chemistry, and produce crystals that are expelled in your cat’s urine. If your cat’s urine is alkaline, sharp, needle-like crystals can form (these are called struvites) which can cut your cat’s bladder and make it prone to infection.


Eliminating crystals involves manipulating the pH of your cat’s urine, and avoiding foods rich in the minerals that are causing the urine to become alkaline. Prescription urinary health diets such as Hills CD, or Purina UR act in a number of ways to promote optimum urinary health. Part of their action is to reduce the likelihood of crystals forming in the urine by containing less of the minerals that cause these crystals, including phosphate and magnesium., If enough crystals form in your cat’s urine, they can form stones in your cat’s bladder. These stones rattle around inside the bladder and can damage the lining, which can make the bladder more prone to UTIs.


Treatment: Some bladder stones (struvite) are treated by manipulating the pH of the urine, as described in the previous step. However, other stones, like those made of oxalate and urate, or harder to get rid of and may need to be removed surgically.

, Abnormalities in the structure of the bladder such as polyps and cancer, disturb the normal ability of the bladder to heal and protect itself, making it more prone to UTIs.


Treatment: While bladder polyps can be surgically removed, bladder cancer is often inoperable. This is because it develops in a part of the bladder where the ureters drain urine from the kidney into the bladder. Removing the cancerous portion can cause irreparable damage to the ureters. Bladder cancer is best treated with drugs such a Meloxicam. This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has a mild inhibitory effect on the growth of bladder cancers.

You might notice a visible cleft or gap when a kitten opens its mouth, or notice signs such as difficulty suckling, milk bubbles at the nostrils, poor weight gain, and respiratory infection. Bring the cat to a vet for an examination if you suspect or detect a cleft palate.The vet will give you more information about the scope and severity of the cleft.;
, If the cleft is merely a cosmetic issue, you can manage it by feeding your pet blenderized cat food, also called a cat food slurry, or soft wet food. You should also monitor for signs of respiratory distress. However, most minor clefts, or small gaps in the hard palate, require surgery. Extensive clefts that affect both the hard and soft palates are more difficult to treat with surgery.Ask, “How extensive is the cleft? Is corrective surgery an option and, if so, what are the chances of recovery and maintaining a good quality of life?”
Unfortunately, some cases of cleft palate are not treatable, and a vet might recommend euthanasia.

, If your cat is a good candidate for surgery, it’s vital to find a board certified surgeon who has performed successful corrective operations in the past. There’s a limited amount of oral tissue that can be used to correct the gap, so the first attempt will have the best chances of success.Ask the primary vet to recommend a local, board certified veterinary surgeon. You can also use the search tool on the website of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons., Surgery costs vary depending on the scope of the cleft and location. However, you should expect to pay up to three thousand dollars (US). You should also account for follow-up care, including pain medications and antibiotics, which could cost hundreds more.Even after successful correction, the cat will most likely have a higher risk of developing respiratory infections that require antibiotics.
Pet insurers typically don’t cover congenital cleft palates, which they define as preexisting conditions. On the other hand, if your cat is already insured and develops a cleft palate due to a traumatic injury, the insurer will likely cover treatment., Scheduling surgery to correct a congenital cleft palate takes a bit of finesse, but it should occur at three to four months of age. It can’t be performed too early, since the kitten’s teeth and mouth are still growing. However, it should occur as soon as possible, since pneumonia and other cleft-related complications can be life threatening.The board certified veterinary surgeon will help you decide the best time to schedule surgery.
If the cleft is due to a traumatic injury, it should be corrected as soon as possible.

, A kitten with a cleft palate will likely have difficulty nursing normally and will need to be bottle or tube fed. If the kitten has a suckling reflex and bottle feeding is possible, use a specially designed long nipple. This will reduce the amount of milk that passes through the cleft into the nasal cavity.You should feed a kitten every two hours around the clock.
After three to four weeks of bottle feeding, you can wean the kitten onto soft, blended food.

, If the kitten can’t suckle or if the cleft prevents it from eating after being weaned, you’ll need to tube feed it. Lubricate the feeding tube, gently insert it into the kitten’s mouth, and slide it down the esophagus until the indicator mark is lined up with the kitten’s nose. You then use a syringe to inject food into the external end of the tube.The vet can help you acquire a suitable feeding tube and lubricant and show you how to use it.
If you don’t have experience with a stomach feeding tube or aren’t comfortable with it, the vet can place an esophagostomy tube, or E-tube, through a small incision in the neck. You’ll only need to inject food into the tube rather than inserting a tube each time you feed your cat., An overhead dispenser, also called a water bottle, will help limit the amount of water that leaks through the cleft into the nasal passage. While they’re most often associated with rodents, overhead dispensers are also used for kittens and puppies.You can find an overhead water dispenser online or at a pet store.

, Bring your cat to the vet immediately if you suspect it is experiencing respiratory distress. Food and saliva make its way through the cleft into the nasal passage, so the cat is prone to life-threatening respiratory illnesses. If you elect not to have the cleft surgically repaired, you’ll need to monitor it closely for signs of distress for the rest of its life. Signs of distress include:Wheezing or labored breathing
Coughing, or sneezing
Clear or colored nasal discharge
Fever

, The cat won’t be able to eat anything for at least twelve hours prior to the corrective cleft palate surgery. Unless otherwise directed, you should still make sure it has access to water.Ask the board certified veterinary surgeon if there are any other preoperative actions you should take.

, Following surgery, the cat will be hospitalized for one to two days. When you take it home, you might have to give it pain medication, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics. Be sure to administer all medications according to the surgeon’s instructions, and bring your cat to all follow-up appointments., An Elizabethan collar, or E-collar, is the cone that’s placed around a pet’s neck after most surgeries. This will prevent the cat from pawing at the surgical site.If the cat paws at the surgical site, the corrective graft and sutures might fail.

, The cat will need to be fed soft, blenderized food via an E-tube for two to four weeks. When you bring the cat in for a follow-up visit, the surgeon will let you know if the graft was successful. If so, they will likely remove the tube and advise you to feed the cat normally.Avoid hard food and toys for at least one month after surgery.

, There will still be a risk of pneumonia and other respiratory infections, especially while the surgical site heals. Keep an eye out for signs of illness and contact a vet if your cat shows any concerning symptoms.Since oral tissues will be swollen after surgery, snoring or difficult breathing are common, but they should go away on their own. Contact the vet or surgeon if you notice coughing, sneezing, or nasal discharge.

Below are some questions you can ask regarding cytauxzoonosis treatment:


How long will treatment last?
How much will treatment cost?
What are my cat’s chances of recovery?;
, Cytauxzoonosis requires intensive treatment. You will need to hospitalize your cat for at least several days so your vet can administer the different treatments.Be aware that, in addition to the cost of the treatment itself, there will be a hospitalization cost as well.

, Cytauxzoonosis makes cats very weak. Your cat may not be strong enough to eat or drink on its own. If this is the case, your vet will feed your cat through a feeding tube. This feeding tube will go either through your cat’s mouth (‘esophageal’) or through the nose (‘nasoesophageal’).Your vet will feed your cat a liquid gruel that would easily slide down through the feeding tube and into your cat’s stomach.
To rehydrate your cat, your vet will give your cat fluids directly into its bloodstream through its veins (‘intravenous fluids’).IV fluids will rehydrate your cat much more quickly than oral fluids.

, Several medications are available that will kill C. felis. These drugs, which your vet will use in combination, are called azithromycin and atovaquone.Other drugs are available to treat cytauxzoonosis in cats. However, the azithromycin/atovaquone combination has shown better survival rates., Cytauxzoonosis can cause serious blood clotting problems in cats. If your vet detected blood clotting problems in your cat, they will administer a drug called heparin.Heparin works by treating current blood clots and preventing others from forming., Sometimes, cytauxzoonosis can require even more intensive care. For example, if your cat is severely anemic (very low red blood cell count), it will likely need a blood transfusion.In addition, if your cat’s fever remains high despite treatment, your vet will want to give your cat an anti-inflammatory medication to bring the fever down.


If your cat’s breathing troubles are severe, it will need oxygen therapy.Veterinary blood banks are available for animals that need blood transfusions. Your vet may refer to you a blood bank so your cat can receive a transfusion.

, Recovery from cytauxzoonosis is often a slow process. If a cat is fortunate enough to survive, it will take at least several weeks for all disease symptoms to disappear.Your vet will keep you updated on your cat’s progress during its hospitalization.


Be aware that not all cats treated for cytauxzoonosis will survive. As your vet treats your cat, they will be honest with you regarding your cat’s chances for recovery.

, As you can see, cytauxzoonosis is a serious disease that can be very expensive to treat. The best way to prevent your cat from getting the disease is to keep it indoors.Keeping your cat indoors will keep it away from ticks. If you have an outdoor cat (or an indoor cat that frequently goes outside), use the following strategies to transition it to being a strictly indoor cat:Start feeding your cat indoors. Keep your cat inside for increasingly longer periods of time before letting it back out, until you do not let it back out at all.
Give your cat lots of toys to play with, especially toys that encourage chasing and pouncing.
Spend a lot of quality time with your cat.

, If your cat is stubbornly against staying indoors, you will need to protect it from tick bites with a tick preventive.Monthly prescription tick preventatives are available through your vet. These monthly preventatives are applied directly to the skin between a cat’s shoulder blades.


If you have a dog, do not give its tick preventive to your cat. The ingredients in canine tick preventatives are toxic to cats.Tick collars are also available., If your cat wants to be outside, you will need to closely examine its skin every day for ticks. If you see a tick, you will need to carefully remove it.Below are tips for safely removing a tick:


Wear gloves when removing the tick.
Grab the tick with a pair of tweezers or tick-removal tool. Grab it where the head and neck attach and pull straight up to remove it from the skin.
Place the tick in a jar of alcohol to kill it.

, To further prevent your cat from getting infected with C. felis, keep your grass and shrubbery trimmed short. Also remove any debris, such as piles of leaves, that would provide a nice hiding place for ticks."

Massaging your cat lovingly for even a few minutes can be as good as a full half hour of petting, so focusing on the cat will be very beneficial. You can get your attention on the animal by relaxing with a few deep breaths.Get into it—the cat will thank you!;
, You can give yourself some great practice that won't tire out your massage hands just by visualizing the massage you will give. This kind of concentration is known as centering, and it will help keep you from getting sore as you massage your cat.

, The best atmosphere for massaging your cat is one that is calm, quiet, and peaceful. Loud people—such as children—in the room may not be very comforting to your cat, and can detract from the benefits of massage. Thus, you should pick the most peaceful time and place for your cat's massage to have the best impact.

, One great way to relax your cat for massage is to use voice massage. Voice massage is essentially repeating a phrase or song in a soothing voice to prepare your cat for contact. What you actually say or sing is not as important as the tone of your voice, which should be as calm and soothing as possible., Move slowly toward the cat with your had outstretched and allow him or her to smell you. This gives the cat the opportunity to accept your touch rather than you simply going ahead.This shows respect and can help keep the cat calm as well.

, If the cat seems to back away from your hands as you try to ready him or her for massage, do not attempt massage at this time. Do not attempt to massage the cat if he or she nips at your hand when you offer it either—this could mean the cat is in a playful mood or a bad mood, or it could signal a defensive position from the cat. When the cat is waking from a nap or otherwise very relaxed, this would be a good time to massage him or her.Do not attempt to massage a cat who is injured or sick.

, There is no reason to rush to massage your cat. Begin by petting the cat gently as you normally would, then stroke the cat's entire back slowly, counting the seconds it takes to do so. Stroke the cat's back a second time, this time doubling the seconds it took to do so before. The cat may really enjoy the slow speed of this stroke.Repeat this technique six times. Repetition is good for getting your cat to accept the massage, as well as establishing familiarity and relaxing the cat in general., Run your thumb or fingers from the top of the cat's head to the base of its neck gently. Gently massage the back of the neck with your thumb and fingers. Tug very gently on the loose skin on the sides of the cat's neck., Very gently caress the cat's body applying mild pressure around the contours. You should be able to feel various bones as you do so.Do not apply too much pressure, but get your fingertips in each crevice and massage gently.

, Try increasing the speed of your caress on the belly/breast area to see if the cat likes it. Be careful here because some cats are very sensitive to being touched on the underside of their body. If the cat is very relaxed, he or she may not mind, but even if so, this may startle the cat or cause it to get somewhat defensive, so be careful.

, Gently lift up on the cat's chin with your fingertips, and, as the cat lifts its head, begin stroking the chin and neck with your fingers. Move from the throat to the tip of the chin. If the cat looks up, he or she likes this motion. You can also move your fingers in a circular motion underneath the the chin for a different sensation."

Make an appointment with your vet.",How to Remove Debris Stuck in a Cat Paw1," To remove debris from your cat’s paw, you will need a damp washcloth, a towel to wrap your cat in, and a pair of tweezers. If you suspect the debris has punctured your cat’s paw, you will also need a pet-friendly antiseptic.Some pet friendly antiseptics include Betadine (cleanser or solution), Burrow’s Solution, and witch hazel.;
, Gently pick up your cat. Pet your cat to make it feel comfortable. Then carefully wrap your cat in a towel, leaving the paw or paws with the debris outside of the towel. Be careful to not wrap the towel too tightly or it could injure the cat.If your cat does not like being held, you should grab a friend or family member to help you.
Wrapping the cat in a towel will help prevent you from being scratched by the cat.
You can also calm the cat with a treat.

, Using the damp washcloth, gently wipe your cat’s paw or paws. If you are cleaning debris from multiple paws, wipe them one at a time. Gently rub between the pads of your cat’s paws to remove debris like cat litter, gravel, or food. Once you clean a paw, place it back inside the towel.If you are cleaning front and back paws, clean the front paws first. Then gently slide the bottom of the towel up so that you can clean the back paws one at a time.
You can also use your fingers to gently dislodge debris, such as kitty litter, from the cat's paw.
If there is a splinter in the cat's paw, you should avoid this step until after the splinter or other sharp object is removed.
It is also okay to scruff your cat while they are on a surface. However, never pick a cat up by the scruff. To scruff a cat, grab the skin on the back of their neck and hold it firmly.

, Once you have gently cleaned your cat’s paws with a damp washcloth, check to see if there is a splinter or other debris, like glass, lodged in the paw. If you find a splinter or other material lodged in the paw, use the tweezers to gently grasp the splinter. Then slide the splinter out of the cat’s paw at the same angle it entered the skin.Exercise caution when removing the splinter.

, If you remove a splinter or other material lodged in the cat’s paw, you should apply a pet-friendly antiseptic to the area after removing the debris. You should also apply the antiseptic to any scrapes or injuries you locate on the cat’s paws. In general, you should put a few drops on a cotton ball and use the cotton ball to apply the antiseptic.If the debris is stuck on, you may even want to soak the cat’s paw in warm water with a little soap added to it. Try filling a bathtub a few inches with warm water and a little soap and have your cat stand in the water for a few minutes so the paw can soak. You will probably need to hold onto their scruff to keep them there for a few minutes.

, If you find a large splinter, shard of glass, or similar debris lodged in your cat’s paw, you should contact your vet immediately. Large pieces of debris can cause significant puncture wounds that will need to be treated by a veterinary professional. You should also see the vet if you notice blood, pus, or unusual odors in your cat’s paws."

Do not expect a quick fix.",How to Sedate a Cat1," For most sedatives, you'll need a prescription from a veterinarian anyway. Even if you're buying an over-the-counter medication, run it by your vet to make sure he or she approves of it — a poor quality product could be dangerous to your pet's health. All animals that are going to be medically sedated should be examined by a vet before use to make sure they're healthy enough for sedation.


Tell your veterinarian if you plan on flying with a sedated cat. The combination of air pressure, elevation, and excessive stress can cause adverse reactions that can prove potentially fatal.;
, Different medications take different amounts of time to kick in, so you want to know how your particular medication works. Ask your veterinarian how far ahead of time you should administer the medication before the event that will stress out your cat. Some medications may kick in almost immediately, while others may take up to an hour to be effective.


With medications that take time to kick in, the cat's anxiety may override the sedative if you don't allow it to go into effect in a relaxed environment.

, All of the medications discussed here require a vet exam and prescription. Discuss your options with your vet to figure out which one is best for your pet. The vet will use his education, training and experience to recommend the medication with the least side effects and risk for your pet.


Benzodiazepines are a popular sedative that can reduce anxiety almost immediately. Side effects include disorientation, sleeplessness, and increased appetite. They should be used with extreme caution in cats with liver or kidney problems.
SARIs also relieve anxiety rapidly, but can cause slight dizziness and disorientation. They should be used with caution in animals with heart conditions.
Clonidine and gabapentin were developed to treat blood pressure and nerve pain in humans, but have sedative and anti-anxiety effects in animals.
Chlorpheniramine is an allergy and cold medication, while phenobarbital is a narcotic and sedative used to treat epilepsy.

, There are a wide variety of medications available to sedate a cat, most of which must be prescribed by a vet. However, just like with humans, individual cats can have different responses to different medications.What works well on one cat might not work well on another. Plan for medicated sedation as far ahead of time as possible so you can adjust the medication as necessary. Don't expect a ""magic pill"" that will work instantly.

Clean your cat’s feet daily.,
Use a litter mat.,
Trim long paw hair.",How to Remove Debris Stuck in a Cat Paw2," Each day you should gently wipe your cat’s paws with a damp washcloth. As you wipe, keep an eye out for debris that might be stuck in the paw. You should also watch out for debris that is caught in the hair between the paw pads., Litter is a common type of debris that can get stuck in your cat’s paws. One way to minimize the chance of this happening is to use a litter mat. Choose a litter mat that has angled ridges that are engineered to pull litter out of a cat’s paw. Place the litter mat outside of the litter box so that your cat will have to walk across it when they exit the litter box., Some longhaired cats have excessive hair that grows on their paws and between their toes. This can create an environment for unwanted debris. If your cat has long hair sprouting in between its toes, gently trim it with a small pair of rounded scissors."

Talk to your vet about medicine that can help manage stress.",How to Reduce Stress in Cats," Urinary discomfort is a common result of stress in cats. The stress hormones cause the bladder lining to become inflamed, which results in physical symptoms. Keep track of how often your cat visits the tray. Signs of a problem include more frequent urination, discomfort while urinating, and possible blood in the urine.


These signs should never be ignored; always get the cat checked by a vet.This is because bladder inflammation can lead to a blockage, which is a serious, and potentially life-threatening, problem if untreated.;
, Stressed cats tend to over-groom, indeed they can wash so much that they lick bald patches in their coat. Favorite spots to over-groom include the tummy, inner thighs, and front legs. The action of licking releases natural morphine-like substances which help to comfort the cat and make her feel more secure.


Again, get your cat checked by the vet before concluding this is stress-related (allergies and parasites can also cause over-grooming)., Some cats become so distressed that it upsets their stomachs and they develop diarrhea. Regardless of the causes (stress or an infection), get your cat checked by a veterinarian, because medication may be needed to settle the upset stomach., The cat may do this either because she feels too stressed to visit the tray, or in order to spread her scent around the house, which makes her feel more secure.


However, other problems such as arthritis, bladder infections, or stomach upsets can mimic this, so always get your cat's health checked by the vet., Some cats become very clingy to their owner and try to attract their attention by talking., A stressed cat may not be able to settle and may pace restlessly, patrolling her territory on the watch for a perceived threat., A stressed cat may hide away under a bed or in a dark corner. She is literally hiding, hoping to avoid the attention of what is stressing her., Some stressed cats lose their appetite, while others start to eat strange things, like chewing on a towel., Try to pinpoint when the symptoms started and why. This can help you take action to reduce the source of stress, whether it is physical, environmental, or psychological. Your vet will also want to know when you first noticed the symptoms.

, Many stress symptoms can also be symptoms of physical illness. You need to know if you're dealing with a sick cat or a stressed cat (in some cases the former may cause the latter)., Sometimes the cause of physical stress is simple to resolve, such as overgrown claws digging into her pads., Fleas bite the skin and irritate your cat;what's worse, if ingested they can lead to a tapeworm parasite infection. If your cat is scratching frequently and persistently, perform a simple spot check. Buy a fine-tooth comb and run it through her fur around the base of the neck and tail: if you see small, brown shapes about the size of a pin-head, your cat has fleas. Also look for white or black spots between the teeth of the comb: these are flea eggs and dried blood excreted by the fleas, respectively. If you find fleas, you'll need to get rid of them on your cat, and in your home.


To eliminate fleas on your cat, consult your veterinarian for recommendations on a flea-control program that's right for her.
At home, you'll need to take measures that include: rigorous vacuuming of all your cat's favorite places, rugs, and upholstery; washing your cat's bedding weekly; and possibly using a spray, fogger, or powder that is safe (follow product directions carefully and make sure the cat is not in the area if that is specified in the instructions)., Cats have sensitive ears that can be hurt by loud music, loud television, or other sources of noise.


Comfort a cat that's frightened by loud noises outside the house, particularly fireworks or thunderstorms. Take her into an interior room or close the curtains, put the TV or radio on low, and make sure the cat has a ""bolt hole"" where she can hide until the ordeal is over., Some cats who are bonded to their owner will benefit from companionship and reassurance (such as the cat who bolts under the comforter during a thunderstorm: she gets comfort from the owner's scent on the bedsheets). However, a truly terrified cat will be too traumatized to accept comfort and will consider human interference a further threat.


As a rule of thumb, if the cat backs away from you, growls, hisses, or swishes her tail, leave her alone. In fact, look for a way to make her bolt hole more secure, such as putting a towel over the box she is hiding in so that the front is screened and she can't be seen., A lack of safe places can also stress a cat. If she feels exposed because there are no high perches where she can safely watch the comings and goings, or no dark cupboards to hide in, this in itself is a stress. All it takes to correct this is the simple provision of a cardboard box in a quiet corner, or a tall tower or scratching post., Cats are very sensitive to changes to their environment. While some situations are hard to avoid (like moving apartments), try to provide as calm an atmosphere as you can. Arguing and yelling not only stresses you out, but your cat as well.


If you're going through transitions at home, be sure to tune in to your cat and take all the measures you can to make it as smooth as possible for her. Always provide a safe place where she can hide., Cats can't understand the connection between yelling or hitting and something the cat is doing wrong, so trying to discipline a cat this way only makes the cat anxious and afraid.


Instead, use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior in your cat. Every time she does something ""good,"" such as using the scratching post, give her a few treats and praise her verbally. The trick to doing this is that the reward must be immediate: cats have short attention spans, so if the reward comes even a few seconds too late, your cat may not understand what it's for., Provide your cat with as many opportunities as possible to burn energy doing cat-like things such as hunting or playing. This is especially important for indoor cats, who may lack the mental stimulation that outdoor prowling provides. Getting the cat moderately tired out also helps to use up her nervous energy and to vent stress hormones in physical activity rather than over-grooming.Hide treats or dry food around the house and let her hunt for them.
Have at least three 10-minutes sessions of one-on-one play with your cat. Dangle something enticing for it to chase or toss toys across the room. Cats love to chase and pounce.
If you own more than one cat, make sure you play with each cat alone every day in addition to group playtime.
Leave toys out your cat. Acquire a wide variety of toys, but only put a couple within reach of the cat at one time. Every few days pick up the toys you've made available to the cat and put down a couple of new ones.

, Consider locating a bird feeder outside a window for your cat's entertainment, or get an aquarium so your cat can watch the fish swimming.

, If you have more than one cat, they may be vying for food, water, toilet space, and attention. The pressure for resources can leave some cats feeling bullied. To make this less stressful, ensure that each cat has its needs provided for.There should be one litter box per cat, plus one spare, to decrease competition for toilet facilities.Be sure to keep the litter boxes clean, removing solid waste daily and regularly cleaning the box out with mild dish soap or a solution of bleach in water (1:30 ratio).
Place multiple food bowls around the house, so that no one cat can monopolize the food at all times., A stray in your garden, or even your home (they can enter by cat door!) can make your cat feel psychologically threatened.


Discourage visits from a stray by removing any food that might be attracting him.
If your cat goes outside, consider installing a microchip-activated cat flap so the stray cannot come indoors.
If the stressed cat can see the stray in the garden, it may help to block the lower part of the window to obscure that view (the cat equivalent of hiding your head in the sand, but it works)., A nursing queen (female cat) gives off pheromones (chemical messengers) which makes her kittens feel safe and content. A synthetic version of these pheromones has been manufactured and sold as Feliway.


Use the spray Feliway by spritzing bedding, or entrance and exit points so as to amplify ownership by the resident cat.
Alternatively, buy a Feliway diffuser. The diffuser plugs into an electrical socket and gives off a low level of the pheromone into the air (it is not detectable by humans!). Ideally, plug the diffuser into an electrical socket in the room your stressed cat spends the most time. The effect builds up gradually, so don't expect immediate results, but after a couple of weeks the cat should feel safer and more reassured. (Each diffuser lasts for approximately four weeks and refills are available.), Zylkene is a nutraceutical, which is a food supplement that has a pharmaceutical-like action on the body. Because nutraceuticals are not drugs, they are much safer and rarely have side effects. The active ingredient in Zylkene is derived from milk protein and it acts on the same part of the brain as diazepam. This calms the cat and removes some of her anxiety.


Zylkene is available without prescription and comes in 75 mg capsules. The dose for a cat is a 75 mg capsule once a day, given with or after food. It can take a couple of days to take effect, but if there is no noticeable difference after seven days, it is unlikely to help your cat., If your cat is so stressed that she is becoming ill, then your vet might prescribe a medication to help her over this rough patch. Different pharmaceuticals are available; the most commonly used are diazepam, amitriptyline, and fluoxetine.


None of these drugs are licensed for use in the cat because the manufacturer has not paid to put them through efficacy trials. However, there are considerable banks of data about their safe use in cats, which your veterinarian will discuss with you if she considers this the best course of treatment."

Perform a trial run.,
Prepare your cat for sedation.,
Give your cat her medication.Make sure to follow your vet's dosage instructions carefully.,
Make sure the cat swallows the medication.While keeping her body firmly secured, release her mouth from your hands.,
Use alternate delivery methods if needed.Taking oral medication doesn't feel natural to cats, and yours may fight back when you try to sedate her.,
Wait for the sedative to kick in.Different medications and dosages take different lengths of time to take effect.",How to Sedate a Cat2," You should always do a trial run with the medication before you actually need to sedate your cat. This ensures that she responds well to it; otherwise, your pet may have a bad reaction in an already stressful situation. In general, you should give yourself at least a week of wiggle room, so you can revisit your vet and discuss other options if your first choice medication is ineffective.


Wait for a time when both you and your cat are calm and relaxed.
After giving her the medication, observe her for 12 hours to gauge her reaction to it.
The cat should be relaxed and calm, but not woozy or unconscious.If she appears disoriented or panicked, do not use that medication again.

, Make sure you're within the time frame for sedation you discussed with your vet. Give the medication time to kick in before the stressful event. Both you and the cat should be as relaxed as possible.


Wrap the cat in a small blanket, pillowcase, or towel with only her head exposed.
Hold her on the floor straddled between your legs or on your lap, or have someone hold the cat for you.

, These powerful medications can prove harmful if used inaccurately.


Put your thumb on one side of the cat's mouth, and your forefinger on the
Apply gentle pressure until your cat opens her mouth.
With your free hand, press gently down on the lower jaw to further open the mouth.
Pop in the pill or squeeze liquid medication into the inside of the mouth on the side of 1 cheek.

, Lift her face so her nose points upward, and gently rub her throat to encourage her to swallow. You might also blow gently in her face, which make her gulp or swallow. Stay in this position for a few seconds before removing the coverings and releasing the cat.


If you see the cat licking her nose, that’s a sign she’s probably swallowed the medicine.
Give your cat a lot of praise for her good behavior, and comfort her if she's upset about what just happened.

, It may help to wrap your cat snugly in a towel while administering the sedative. When she's swaddled like a baby, she won't be able to struggle as much and get away.


You can buy ""pill guns"" that let you drop the pill toward the back of the cat's mouth, raising the odds of her swallowing it.
Try wrapping the pill in a little bit of cheese or other treat your cat enjoys to sneak it to her.
Ask the veterinarian for liquid medication if you have trouble administering pills.
Ask the vet before trying to mix liquid sedative into the cat's wet food. You want to make sure it won't render the drug ineffective.

, Your veterinarian will let you know how long your specific medication and dosage should take to kick in, and how long it should be effective. In general, though, you're looking for your cat to become groggy and tired, but not disoriented and confused. The cat should be restful, but not lose consciousness suddenly. Some cats fall asleep entirely, while others stay awake, but quiet and calm.


Your cat may be back to normal after just a few hours, or she may seem drowsy for the next couple days.If, after a couple days, she’s still not back to normal, contact your veterinarian.

Use synthetic pheromones in your home.If your cat is anxious, overexcited, or displays unwanted behaviors like scent marking or scratching, synthetic pheromones are a good solution.These chemicals mimic the pheromones that cats naturally produce to communicate with other cats.,
Consider using body wraps.,
Towel wrap her if you don’t have a body wrap.If you haven’t invested in a body wrap and your cat is anxious or fearful, you can mimic the effect using a heavy towel.,
Try using food supplements to combat anxiety.",How to Sedate a Cat3," A few companies have used essential oils or herbal blends to mimic pheromones.Regular use can make cats feel calmer and more secure at home.


Synthetic pheromones can be used as collars, sprays, wipes, or plug-in diffusers.
Popular brands include Feliway, Comfort Zone, and Sergeant’s Pet Care, among others.You can use them all the time to keep your cat happy and calm. You may also introduce them a few weeks before a stressful event to prepare her for it.

, Body wraps have proven to be helpful in relieving anxiety in cats. These products wrap around the cat’s torso, applying gentle pressure on her pressure points. The effect is similar to that of swaddling an infant. Though these products are more well-known for use in dogs, they are just as effective in cats.

, Wrap the cat in the towel so her entire body is covered, except for her face. Make sure the towel is wrapped snugly around her body. This method can be used if you need to give her medication, trim her nails, or do anything that might upset her for a short period of time.


Always make sure to praise the cat after releasing her from the towel.

, The ingredients in these supplements support the cat’s natural chemical balance to improve relaxation. They may come in liquid, chew, or tablet forms. Two examples of supplements include Anxitane and Zylkene.


Anxitane is a green tea amino acid which (according to the manufacturer) works on chemical receptors in the brain to reduce fear and anxiety in cats.
Zylkene is a supplement derived from the milk protein that helps soothe newborns.You can buy these supplements online or at a vet's office.

Know your cat's medical history.",How to Relieve Urinary Tract Infections in Cats1," Monitor your cat’s litter box to check for changes in the color and frequency of your pet’s elimination. Blood in the urine is one of the clearest indications that your cat has a urinary tract infection.If you suspect a problem and want to evaluate your cat’s urine more closely, ask your vet about getting plastic pellets instead of litter; this enables you to extract the urine without the interference of the cat litter and inspect it more closely.
If you collect and inspect the urine, check to see if it’s clear, not cloudy. Additionally, it should be yellow, not dark brownish or red.;
, Often owners believe that if a cat is straining, she is simply constipated, but that is not necessarily the case. This could be the sign of another problem, such as a UTI.If your cat is urinating outside her litter box, it may indicate your cat can no longer control her bladder.Also note how often your cat uses her litter box. Increased urination is a sign of an infection, or another bladder problem., Many owners notice that a cat with urinary tract infection seems ""off.""Often, cats with urinary tract infections will become uncharacteristically unresponsive, tired, or depressed. Other cats with urinary tract infection will be unusually aggressive.Any sudden change in mood should be evaluated by a veterinarian.

, Cats with infections tend to drink more water and lick their genitals frequently. Cats who begin hobbling around without a good reason are often suffering from an infection. However, be aware an infection cannot be diagnosed on symptoms alone. There are a lot of common signs which are shared with other urinary conditions such as crystals, stones, or nerve-related inflammation of the bladder wall. If your cat appears to have become frightened of her litter box, that can also indicate a problem., Your cat's coat should not smell strange and there should not be any recent hair loss. If her abdomen feels inflated or hard, that is a sign she has an infection or another bladder problem.If your cat has skin folds around her vulva, she is more likely to develop an infection.

, Some cats have a history of obstructions, which makes them more susceptible to future problems.Additionally, some conditions make cats more likely to develop urinary tract infections. For example, cats with hyperthyroidism or diabetes are more prone to infections. If your cat recently underwent surgery, she is more likely to develop an infection, especially if the surgeon placed a urinary catheter.Your cat's gender can also impact the likelihood of getting an infection. Male cats are far more likely to get urinary blockages."

In fact, the scooting will get more and more painful until it is treated.Schedule an appointment with your vet as soon as your cat starts scooting.Other than scooting, watch for your cat licking obsessively at its anal area.;
, During the appointment, your vet will perform a physical exam of your cat, paying close attention to its hind end. If the anal glands look and feel normal, your vet will perform other diagnostic tests to determine another cause of the scooting, such as flea allergies, worms, or arthritis.Flea allergies typically affect a cat’s rear end, causing intense itching. This itchiness can lead to scooting.Sometimes, tapeworms (intestinal worms) can cause discomfort in the anal area.Hip arthritis could cause a cat to scoot., Treating the scooting’s underlying cause will stop this behavior.Based upon the results of the physical exam and other tests, your vet will recommend a treatment plan for your cat. Potential treatment options are below:


Anal gland expression
Deworming
Allergy management

, Your cat’s anal glands are located approximately in the 4 and 8 o’clock positions around the anus. The liquid in the glands is thin and extremely smelly. Emptying the anal glands, commonly called ‘expressing’ the glands, is not difficult and can be done at home. However, because expressing the glands can get messy and smelly, most cat owners prefer having their vets perform the task.Expressing the glands can be done while a cat is awake. However, if your cat is in a lot of pain, your vet will need to anesthetize your cat to do the expression.To express the glands, your vet will position a towel or paper towel near the anus to catch the liquid. Wearing gloves, they will slowly squeeze the glands to empty out the liquid.

, If anal glands are impacted for a long time, or fecal bacteria enters the glands, the glands can become infected.Infected anal glands can become very painful for a cat. If your cat's anal glands are infected, expressing them will not be enough. Your vet will sedate your cat and flush the glands (rinse them out). To treat the infection, your vet will prescribe antibiotics.If your vet prescribes an antibiotic, give the full course of antibiotics—do not stop giving them when your cat starts feeling better.
Your vet may also recommend a pain medication to relieve your cat’s pain., If your cat’s anal glands were impacted, expressing them (and flushing, if necessary) will stop the scooting within a few days of treatment.Immediately after treatment, your cat may scoot out of habit. However, after a few days, the scooting should stop completely.

, Expressing the anal glands can be a permanent fix, or just a temporary one. Your cat may start scooting again, indicating a chronic anal gland problem. If your cat has recurrent anal gland problems, your vet may recommend regular flushing of the glands with either sterile water or an antibiotic solution.If the recurrent problem is severe, your vet may suggest surgically removing the glands.Surgically removing anal glands has several complications, including pain, difficulty defecating or incontinence, and infection. Careful surgical technique and post-surgical treatment can help prevent and/or manage these complications., After your cat’s anal glands are expressed, switch your cat to a high-fiber diet. This diet will produce firm feces, which will press against the glands during defecation and force them to empty. You can find high-fiber diets at your local pet store.Talk with your vet if you’re not sure which diet to feed your cat.


To prevent digestive problems, switch your cat to the new diet over at least one week.Mix the new diet with the old one, slowly increasing the amount of new diet.Talk with your vet about adding bran to your cat’s diet to increase fiber intake., If anal gland problems are not the cause of your cat’s scooting, your vet will recommend other specific treatments. For example, if your cat has fleas, your vet will prescribe flea treatment. Some flea treatment products kill adult fleas, and others target different stages of a flea’s development.In addition to treating your cat, you will also need to clean your home. Below are strategies for cleaning your home:


Clean your cat’s bedding frequently.
Vacuum weekly, paying special attention to crevices and places where your cat spends a lot of time. Remove and discard the vacuum’s bag each time you vacuum.

, Cats get tapeworms from ingesting infected fleas. Tapeworms are made up of segments called proglottids. When a cat defecates, these proglottids exit the body and can move around on the anus, causing irritation and scooting. To get rid of the tapeworms, your vet will prescribe a medication called an anthelmintic, which will kill the tapeworms.Preventing fleas is the best way to prevent tapeworms in cats.

, Food allergies can also cause scooting in cats due to skin irritation. Protein sources, such as chicken or beef, are common food allergy causes in cats.If a food allergy is causing your cat’s scooting, your vet will recommend a limited ingredient diet for your cat. This diet will not contain the ‘culprit’ protein source.


Diagnosing a food allergy can be a lengthy process, involving the initial feeding of a limited ingredient diet for several weeks, followed by a re-challenge with the old diet. Re-challenging with the old diet will confirm the allergy and determine which specific ingredient is causing the allergy.If you switch your cat to a limited ingredient diet, you can feed only that diet, without any other treats, flavored medications, or table scraps., If your vet has ruled out other causes of scooting, they will take x-rays of your cat’s hips to check for arthritis. If your cat has arthritis, your vet will prescribe medications to relieve your cat’s pain and help restore joint health.Signs of arthritis on x-rays include bone spurs (outgrowths of bone) and joint swelling."

Take your cat to a veterinarian.,
Have tests ordered.,
Give your cat medication.",How to Relieve Urinary Tract Infections in Cats2," Only a vet can make the best decision for you and your cat. If there is no blockage your veterinarian will most likely suggest sending a sample of urine for culture to see if infection is present, and what antibiotic the bugs are sensitive to. If infection is confirmed then a course of antibiotics will be prescribed.Urinary tract infections should subside after seven days., The vet may order a cystocentesis. This is where a veterinarian will place a needle through your cat's abdomen to remove urine from her bladder. While it does not hurt your cat, many cats dislike being held on her back.Additionally, your vet may order blood tests, urinalysis, and possibly a urine culture to determine the nature of your cat's inflammation.This can help determine which drugs, if any, your vet should prescribe.The veterinarian may also order a X-ray or ultrasound. This is to investigate the cause of the bladder discomfort so that treatment can be targeted at that problem. The clinician needs to rule out issues such as blockages, bladder, stones or bladder polyps, before bumping the diagnosis of bladder infection higher up the list., Medication can only be prescribed by a veterinarian. The vet may choose to give your cat antibiotics to clear up any infection. Your cat will probably need a follow-up urine test seven days after she has finished taking antibiotic.The vet may also give your cat pain medication."

Cut down on your cat's stress.,
Enrich your cat's environment.,
Make sure your cat has access to enough water.,
Change your cat's diet.",How to Relieve Urinary Tract Infections in Cats3," Address any conflict your cat may have with other members of the household, furry or human. This might include providing separate sleeping areas for different members of the household. Make sure you have at least one litter box per cat. Ideally you should have one litter box per cat, plus an extra one.When you feed your cat, do so in a calm location. This, too, lowers your cat's stress., Enriching your cat's habitat can help relieve stress too.Spend more time with your cat. Cats love attention and affection.Give your cat access to windows for entertainment. Add perches where necessary. Set up a bird feeder near a window. Cats love watching birds, even when your cat is inside.Leave out things for your cat to explore. Cats are naturally curious, and need regular stimulation. Cats like scratching posts to stalk and pounce. Cats also like to be up high too., More water encourages your cat to urinate more often.There should be multiple bowls of water around your home. Cat fountains are also a useful way to increase the amount of water your cat gets.Alternatively, you can add unsalted broth or the leftover water from a tuna can to your cat's water. , While there are some downsides to this, since it increases your cat's stress, diet can significantly impact your cat's health. Give your cat more water-heavy food that is low in phosphorous. Cats who eat dry kibble are more likely to develop bladder problems. Strictly speaking, cats who eat dry food have less dilute urine, which is a more hostile environment for bacteria. However, that concentrated urine does favor urine crystals, they can scratch the bladder lining and cause a secondary infection. This usually means switching to canned food.It is not enough to insist that your cat drinks plenty of water. The food itself cannot be too dry. Cat's bodies do not make up for the lack of water in dry food. Most dry food is only, at best, 10 percent water.Changing your cat over to canned food often means changing the litter box more often."

Understand the two types of feline leukemia.,
Be aware of how feline leukemia is spread.,
Take preventative measures.",How to Protect Your Cat from Feline Leukemia," Feline Immuno-Deficiency, or F. I. V., and Feline Leukemia Virus, or F. E. L. V., are dangerous and deadly diseases. They're highly contagious, making identifying these diseases early on very important. Both viruses are spread from cat to cat, and surveys show that up to 15% of sick cats are infected with these viruses. Problem is, even healthy cats may harbor infection and spread the virus to other cats.;
, As they're both very contagious, the feline leukemia virus is one that has high mortality. It's transmitted through direct contact with an infected cat. F. E. L. V. is spread when the saliva or urine of an infected cat comes in contact with another cat. This can happen when cats groom each other, or when they share food or litter boxes.

, There are some simple but important measures you can take to help your pet cats:


Determine whether your cat is F. I. V. or F. E. L. V. positive by asking the vet to do the Snap Test, or doing it yourself. It's available at your local veterinarian, and costs you about forty dollars in the USA. If you're introducing a new cat to your household make sure you test them first, or if you've got an outdoor cat, make sure you test them yearly.
Know the signs of feline leukemia. The signs of F. I. V. and F. E. L. V. are subtle, but very important to recognize. These signs include:

decreased appetite
less frequent grooming; and
an overall decrease in energy.


Test often and avoid exposure to situations where the cat can become positive.

Get a biopsy done.",How to Recognize Skin Cancer in Cats," Skin cancer usually creates an area on the skin that is discolored and raised. When playing with your cat or cuddling up with it, take the time to look over its body for areas of discolored skin. Also look for areas where the cat's fur is out of place, perhaps due to a growth on the skin underneath.If you find an abnormal area, have it looked at by a veterinarian. Cats get lumps on their skin for a variety of reasons, and skin cancer is only one of them. Your veterinarian will be able to assess whether any lumps you find are a problem or not.;
, Because cats are covered in so much fur, its also important to feel your cat's body for signs of skin cancer. Feel for lumps and bumps on the skin in areas that are covered with fur and areas that are less covered.While skin cancer is often related to sun exposure, and thus occurs in areas with less fur, there are some kinds that are not related to sun exposure at all. Happily, cats are less likely than other animals to get skin cancer that is not UV triggered, such as mast cell tumors.

, Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) most commonly affects white noses, eyelids, and ears. This is a direct result of UV exposure to thin-furred skin that lacks pigment. A sun-loving white cat is the most common kind of cat to develop SCC, so you should regularly look for signs of this disease on white cats.Indeed, if the cat has one black ear and one white, the white ear is much more likely to be affected by SCC.

, It is true that some signs related to skin cancer should spark your immediate concern, such as rapid growth, redness, or ulceration. However, there is no guarantee a small, slow-growing lump is harmless or harmful. This is why it is important to have all lumps assessed by a veterinarian.Some aggressive tumors are great mimics, and take on the characteristics of innocent lumps, such as being superficial or slow growing. However, at some point in the future, they may become aggressive.
It is difficult to distinguish a harmless skin lump from a sinister one, just by looking at it with the naked eye. The only way to tell for sure whether or not a lump is harmful is to have the lump removed and a biopsy of it sent to the lab., Skin lumps are less likely to be sinister if they are slow growing, meaning they don’t perceptibly change from one month to the next. Fast-growing lumps are called aggressive tumors. These often have the ability to spread to other parts of your cat's body. These types of lumps grow so quickly that you can often see a change from week to week.When you first find a lump, measure it with a ruler and record the measurement. Repeat the measuring process every week so that you can establish if the lump is changing or not.

, A lump that sits discretely on the surface of the skin, has a definite border, and is not infiltrating the surrounding tissues is more likely to be a wart, cyst, or harmless skin mass than skin cancer. Skin cancer more often is embedded in the skin and the mass of it can be felt under the skin., Black pigment in a pale skinned animal is a warning sign when it comes to skin cancer. Dark pigment is frequently associated with more serious cancers such as malignant melanoma, thus a dark-colored lump must never be ignored., Skin cancer can cause irritation, which means that your cat might scratch or chew on the lump to relieve that irritation. Some of the more serious cancers, such as mast cell cancer, contain histamine granules that can make the lump very itchy., Cancerous lumps tend to look inflamed, which means that the skin looks pinker than the surrounding tissue. When you first find a lump, look at the tissue surrounding it and see if that area is red or inflamed.


In the early stages of squamous cell carcinoma, non-pigmented skin becomes inflamed and looks darker pink than the surrounding skin. The skin will take on a scaly appearance and it can be mistaken for ringworm.Ulceration means that the lump breaks open and becomes a wound. If you notice this, seek medical help for your cat.

, Cancerous lumps often take on irregular shapes. This means that they lack a round shape, as regular lumps are generally round.The lump instead infiltrates deeply into the skin, so that the skin appears “glued” down to the tissue beneath.

, With saquamous cell carcinoma, if your cat continues to lie in the sun, the inflamed areas may take on an angry red color. There is also a chance that the skin will begin to erode; if this happens, ulcers will begin to form.If the cancer affects an ear, the edge of the ear may become irregular in shape, almost as if small bites have been taken out of it.

, Apply sunblock to your cat’s sensitive skin until you can take it to see a vet. You can also keep your cat indoors on sunny days to prevent it from lounging in the sun. Close the shades to further block UV rays.


If possible, get a sunscreen that is made specifically for cats. If there is none available in your area, use a sunscreen designed for children and choose the highest SPF available.
Always check the ingredients and avoid using a lotion that contains octyl salicylate and zinc. This is not good for cats.

, It is unwise to make assumptions about skin lumps on cats. Skin cancer is rare, but when it happens it is often of the more serious sort. With this in mind, if you find a lump on your cat, get it checked by a veterinarian.Call your veterinary office and tell them what you have found. Make an appointment to have your cat seen as soon as possible, so that if there is a problem, you can begin treatment right away.

, A fine needle aspirate (FNA) involves harvesting a small sample of cells from the lump with a hypodermic needle. It allows the veterinarian to inspect the cells for signs of cancerous growth but it does run the risk of missing cancerous cells due to the small size of the sample.This is a non-invasive procedure that is done with the cat fully conscious and most cats tolerate the process well.

, A biopsy involves removing a wedge of tissue from the lump and sending it to be assessed at a lab. If the lump is easily removed, then an excisional biopsy may be performed. This means the vet will surgically remove the lump and will send a portion away for histology at a lab.A histology test determines if the lump is cancerous.

Monitor how much your cat is eating.,
Monitor your cat's weight.,
Check your cat's poo for worms.,
Take your cat to the vet to confirm.",How to Recognize Hyperthyroid Disease in Cats," One of the major symptoms of hyperthyroidism in cats is that they will appear to be starving and start eating a lot more than they usually would.
, Another major symptom of hyperthyroidism in cats is that despite eating more the cats will continue to lose weight quickly., Cats can get worms and this can also cause increased appetite and weight loss which may mimic hyperthyroidism. Cats with hyperthyroidism may sometimes have diarrhea., The vet will check your cat over, tell you if they think there could be an alternative diagnosis and run blood tests. The blood tests will check the T-4 level in the blood and the kidney function."
"
Look for net weight.,
Read the statement of purpose.,
Assess the guaranteed analysis.,
Read the feeding instructions.,
Look for the statement of responsibility.",How to Read Cat Food Labels1," In the U.S., many brands abbreviate this as “NET WT” and list it at the bottom of the front of the bag or can. This is the weight of the contents of the package. For example, a net weight of 3 oz. (85 g) means the package contains three ounces/85 grams of food. This does not include the weight of the paper or metal in the package., Look for the words, “for cats” somewhere in the statement. This informs you that the food contains ingredients that satisfy feline nutritional needs. You should find this statement on the front of the package.


Make sure the statement fits your cat's stage of life. If you have a kitten (under the age of one) or a senior cat (over the age of 12), make sure the statement includes “kittens” or “senior cats.” Apply the same rules for pregnant and nursing cats. These stages have different nutritional requirements than adult cats who are not pregnant or nursing., Under U.S. law, this list must include the minimum and maximum percentages of crude protein (an analysis of nitrogen in plant and animal protein sources), crude fat (the amount of fat calories about to be burned), crude fiber (fiber that doesn't absorb water), and moisture.


For example, if you read “Crude Protein (Min.) 10.0%,” this means that crude protein is at least 10 percent of the net weight. It could contain more. An analysis of “Crude Fiber (Max) 1.5%” means that crude fiber is no more than 1.5 percent of the net weight, although it could contain less.
Some brands might include ash (the final product after food has been completely incinerated). This is a voluntary move on the part of the manufacturer. U.S. law does not require its inclusion in the analysis. Look for this information on the back of the package. It usually appears above the ingredient list., You can find this information on the back of the package, usually under the ingredients and in bold font. These are more like guidelines, as opposed to strict directions. Because each cat is different, ask your vet for specific feeding instructions.For example, the instructions might read, “Feed an average size adult cat 1 can per 2.5 pounds of body weight daily. Feed up to twice this amount for kittens.” If your adult cat weighs 10 pounds, the manufacturer recommends feeding them four cans per day. For a three-pound kitten, the guideline would be about two cans per day.

, You can find this on the back of the label under the list of ingredients. This statement gives the full name of the manufacturer and their contact information. Usually, the contact info will include a mailing address and a toll-free telephone number. It also contains a statement of their obligation to meet nutritional standards established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) or its non-U.S. equivalent."
"
Note the placement of ingredients in the product name.,
Recognize the 95-Percent Rule.,
Grasp the 25-Percent Rule (aka the “Dinner Rule”).,
Decode the ""Dinner Rule"" with more than one ingredient.,
Recognize the 3-Percent Rule (aka the “With Rule”).",How to Read Cat Food Labels2," The AAFCO mandates that product names comply with one of four rules. Each rule governs what cat food must contain in order to legally have certain names. If you live outside the U.S., check the rules established by your national equivalent of the AAFCO., This usually applies to foods with simple names and few ingredients. The ingredient in the product name must be at least 95 percent of the net weight, not counting the ingredient's water content. The water content is capped at 25 percent of the ingredient.


For example, a 6-oz. can of “Tuna Cat Food” can't contain more than 1.5 oz. of water. Its tuna content must come to at least 4.5 oz., Any product name containing a main ingredient that comes to less than 95 percent but at least 25 percent of the net weight must include the word “dinner” somewhere in the name. Its water content can't be more than 15 percent of the main ingredient.


For example, a 6-oz. can of “Tuna Dinner for Cats” shouldn't contain more than 0.9 oz. of water. Its tuna content must weigh between 1.28 oz and 5.1 oz., The total of the named ingredients must equal 25 percent of the net weight. At the same time, each ingredient must be at least 3 percent of the net weight. The manufacturer must list the ingredients in the same order as they appear in the ingredients list.


For example, a 6-oz. can of “Tuna, Chicken, and Shrimp Dinner for Cats” must include at least 0.18 oz each of tuna, chicken, and shrimp. The three ingredients must total at least 1.5 oz. Tuna must be the most common ingredient, followed by chicken and shrimp., If the product name includes “with,” at least 3 percent of its content must be that ingredient. For example, a 6-oz. can of cat food labeled “Turkey with Cheddar” must contain at least 0.18 oz. of Cheddar cheese."
"
Read the first three ingredients.,
Pay attention to the nutrients.,
Read the calorie content.",How to Read Cat Food Labels3," Pet food labels list ingredients by weight in decreasing order. Although cats can have some vegetables, they haven't evolved to tolerate vegetarian or vegan diets.For this reason, you should make sure the first three ingredients are always meat (includes poultry, lamb, and fish) or meat meal.Avoid any foods whose top three ingredients include grains (such as corn or wheat) and/or gluten.Meat is animal flesh, muscle, esophagi, hearts, and lungs. Meal is finely ground dehydrated tissue. Meat weighs more because of its water and fat contents. However, meat meal is higher in minerals and protein.Meat and meat meal are especially crucial for diabetic cats. If you buy food containing gravy or any grains, they should appear toward the end of the ingredient list. No more than 10 percent of your cat's calories should come from carbohydrates., Nutrients are more important than the ingredients. Cats need a variety of nutrients to survive. These include amino acids, vitamins (especially B vitamins), water, and fiber. Make sure the food contains more amino acids and B vitamins than fiber and other carbohydrates. Nutrient requirements change throughout a cat's life. Check with your vet for specific recommendations.The amino acid taurine is one of the most essential nutrients for cats' vision and heart health. They literally need it to stay alive. While taurine doesn't have to be among the first three ingredients, the farther up in the list of ingredients it appears, the better., Cats' daily caloric needs vary depending on their weight or stage of life. Often, calories are listed as kilocalories or “kcal.” This means the same thing as “calories” on human food labels. This information is usually listed on the back of the package below the feeding instructions. In the U.S., manufacturers must include the calories per kilogram of net weight in kilograms followed by a “translation” of the number of calories per can.An example of this information might look like this: “Calorie Content (Calculated) 853 kcal/kg 73 kcal/can.”
The calorie content of the food must be balanced with its nutrient content. However, manufacturers in the U.S. are not required to list a breakdown of percentages of each nutrient per calorie. If you can't find an itemized list, contact the manufacturer for more information."

Keep your cat at a healthy weight.,
Give your cat canned cat food.,
Be sure your cat always has fresh, clean water.,
Provide enough litter boxes for your cat or cats.,
Minimize stress to your cat.",How to Prevent Urinary Tract Infections in Cats1," Obese cats tend to have more problems than normal weight cats. Use the Body Condition Scoring system to determine if your cat is a healthy size. These charts rank your cat on a scale of 1 to 9, to determine if your cat is overweight, underweight, or at the ideal weight. The scale considers:how easy it is to feel the ribs
how obvious the waist and abdominal tuck are
how much excess fat is below the skin
how much muscle mass is present;
, Canned cat food more closely resembles the natural diet (rodents, birds) of cats and has more protein and moisture than dry food. If your cat is hooked on dry food, consider gradually adding small amounts of canned food and see if you can get your cat to transition to all or mostly all canned diet. If canned food just will not go over with your cat, try offering small amounts of cooked beef or chicken in the form of muscle or organ meat to entice them.


Do not supplement a commercial diet with medicines that promote urinary acidity. Too much of a “good thing” will cause an imbalance, leading to new problems. Talk to your vet before giving your cat any urinary medications.

, Water is key to a happy urinary tract. Keeping the urine at the proper pH will help prevent crystal and stone formation in the urine. By feeding a balanced diet with plenty of water, the crystals are flushed out of the bladder. This prevents urinary problems.


Some cats will drink more water if it's flowing, so providing a kitty water fountain may help them consume more water than if it is just in a bowl. If your cat uses a bowl, be sure to clean it regularly.
Have multiple places for your cat to drink. If you have more than one cat, sometimes dominance over certain food and water dishes is an issue.

, The rule is to have 1 more litter box than the number of cats in your home when practical. So if you have 2 cats, you should have 3 litter boxes. If your cat eats canned food, she'll probably be drinking more water and urinating more. You might need to get bigger litter boxes and you may need to clean them more often.Check litter boxes frequently and remove waste as soon as you see it. Wash the litter boxes with soap and water every time you change the litter.

, Some cats are just more nervous and worked up than other, more mellow cats. Anxiety does seem to play a part in urinary issues with cats, so try to keep changes in your cat's routine to a minimum.Try to feed her at the same time everyday. Be aware that a change in the weather or a move to a new home could trigger a problem with a cat's urinary tract.

Keep your cat away from ethylene glycol, or antifreeze.,
Dispose of any spilled antifreeze properly and promptly.,
Make sure your cat does not eat human medication like painkillers and never give them human medication.,
Keep lilies away from your cat.,
Prevent your cat from licking their coat if it has lily pollen on it.,
If you have a Persian cat, get her tested for polycystic kidney disease.,

Give your healthy cat eight years and older a ""senior"" diet.,
Be aware of the role of nephrons in your cat’s kidneys.,
Keep in mind early renal disease will not show up on a blood test.,
Take your cat to the vet if she becomes excessively thirsty or urinates a lot.",How to Prevent Kidney Disease in Cats," Antifreeze has a sweet taste that is strangely attractive to cats. Unfortunately, if they drink antifreeze it causes crystals to form in their kidney, which destroys the nephrons in their kidney.Autumn usually sees a rise in cases of anti-freeze poisoning as drivers will refreeze their vehicle’s antifreeze to prepare for the winter.
Never leave drips or puddles of antifreeze on driveways or the side of road. Store unused antifreeze in secure containers that will not leak if knocked over.;
, Cover the spilled antifreeze with sand to absorb the spill and then transfer the contaminated sand into a plastic bag. Tie off or seal the bag and dispose of it safely in a trash can.


Hose the area with lots of water to remove any lingering traces of antifreeze.
Put old antifreeze into a plastic bottle with a child-proof screw top and disposed of it properly to comply with your local health and safety laws.

, Cats lack some of the enzymes that dogs and humans possess to break down certain medications. Cats are therefore much more sensitive to the effects of many human drugs and rapidly become poisoned if they eat them.They are especially sensitive to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory group of painkillers, such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
Many other drugs are toxic to cats and will cause catastrophic liver failure, rather than kidney damage.
Always keep human medications in sealed containers with child-proof locks and never leave pill pots out in the open, in case someone mistakes them for animal medication. If possible, store them in containers in a lockable cabinet.

, The leaves, petals, and pollen from certain lily species can cause irreversible kidney damage to cats due to an unknown mechanism. The Lilium or Hemerocallis species are the most toxic, commonly found in Asiatic, Tiger, Easter, Day, Japanese Show, Stargazer, Rubrum, Wood, and Western lilies.While many cats do not chew on lily leaves, your cat could brushes against the stamens of the lily and pollen would then be deposited on her coat, which she would groom off and ingest., Do this by putting a buster collar on the cat, or by wrapping the cat in a towel with her head sticking out.


Use a washcloth soaked in water to wipe away any contamination. The mystery toxin from lilies is not absorbed through the skin so the main concern is the cat washing herself - if you prevent this, the chances of toxicity are greatly reduced.

, A high percentage of Persian cats have a life-limiting inherited kidney condition called polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While there is no cure for this condition, it is possible to prevent it being passed onto the next generation by carefully selecting your cat’s breeding stock.This condition is passed from parent to kitten, so if animals that do not have PKD are bred from the condition, it is entirely preventable.

, PKD is caused by a dominant gene, and there is now a genetic test that detect the presence of this gene. Responsible breeders are usually happy to test their breeding stock prior to mating.


If the test comes back negative the cat can be registered on the International Cat PKD Negative scheme.
If you are thinking of purchasing a Persian kitten, ask the breeder if you can see negative PKD certification for both parents. The gene only needs to be present in one parent for the kittens to inherit the gene.

, This can be performed once the prospective parents have reached 12 months of age. Any cysts present which are larger in size will be picked on the ultrasound scan.


Cats with PKD should be neutered., The first test will look at the urine specific gravity in your cat’s urine. Your vet will place a drop of your cat’s urine onto a piece of equipment called a refractometer. When the lens is held up to the light, it gives a reading of how strong or weak the urine is.


A normal specific gravity is 1.035 of above. Urine that is more dilute than this (1.001 to 1.034) is suspicious sign that the cat is drinking more than usually.
Another helpful test is a urine protein creatinine ratio. This test gives a measure of how much protein is leaking through the kidney and is one of the earliest indicators that the kidney is not functioning as efficiently as it should. This is a biochemical test so a sample of your cat’s urine is commonly sent to an outside lab for analysis.

, Cheap food with a high cereal content that contains low quality protein, such as fish meal, offal, or vegetable protein, makes the kidney work harder to filter out the waste products.Another example of a substance that hastens renal scar tissue formation is phosphate. Unfortunately this is a common ingredient in many cheap cat foods.
Your cat’s kidney has a finite amount of nephrons and once these are damaged, they are not replace. Once your cat is seven years and older, the number of nephrons starts to decline and as they wear out they are replaced by scar tissue. Making the kidney work harder accelerates this process.

, When broken down, high quality protein makes less waste products, so this helps with kidney longevity. Giving you cat a diet that puts less strain on their kidneys will prolong their kidney function.


These diets are marketed as ""senior"" diets, and will also have controlled mineral levels. Usually, manufacturers of prescription pet food will limit feeding cats “adult” foods to seven years old and younger, and suggest feeding cats “senior” diets when they are eight years and older.
Manufacturers of prescription diets such as Royal Canin Waltham, Hills, or Purina have food with low levels of phosphate and high quality proteins.

, This will prevent the development of kidney disease as your cat gets older., The kidneys are made up of tissues called nephrons, which filter the blood and remove toxins (the natural waste products of digestion) from your cat’s body by excrete them in their urine.Nephrons also recycle useful materials such as water and certain electrolytes, such as sodium, by sending them back into the blood to circulate.
As a result of disease or natural wear-and-tear the nephrons become damaged and are replaced by non-functional scar tissue. This then reduces the capacity of your cat’s kidneys to filter out toxins in their body.

, Your cat's kidneys have a large reserve capacity or ability to work even under stress, so kidney damage does not show up on blood tests until around 75% of kidney function has been lost or they are only working at 25% of their full capacity.

, In the early stages of renal disease, your cat will compensate for the lowered numbers of functioning nephrons in her kidney by drinking more liquids to flush toxins out of the blood stream, thereby making her have to urinate constantly.

Cook your meat thoroughly.,
Use frozen meat.,

Avoid strays.,
Wear gloves and a face mask to change the litter.,
Keep up with the litter box.,
Put gloves on.,
Avoid untreated water.,
Keep bugs out of your house.",How to Prevent Infection from Toxoplasmosis," One way to contract toxoplasmosis is eating meat that's not fully cooked. Pork, beef, and lamb are the most likely to carry this parasite.Pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are reheating ham or other cooked meats, you should let it reach a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit.Cook beef and lamb to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. If it's ground, cook it to 160 degrees Fahrenheit.Cook chicken to 165 degrees, no matter what type.Allow whole cuts of meat to rest before cutting, as that helps kill the parasite.;
, Frozen meats are less likely to carry toxoplasmosis. Therefore, freezing meat before you eat it can cut down your risk.Freeze meat for a couple of days at least to help kill off pathogens.Your meat needs to be frozen below 0 degrees Fahrenheit for the best effect., Pasteurized milk has been heated to kill off the parasite. Raw milk can carry toxoplasmosis, so you should avoid drinking it.Other raw milk products can also contain toxoplasmosis.Some milk is ultra-pasteurized, meaning it is heated to an even higher temperature and stays fresh longer., Run the fruits and vegetables under water, rubbing them as you do. If you you're using root vegetables or firm produce like melons or cucumbers, make sure to scrub them with a brush.Even if you're peeling your fruits or vegetables, you should still rinse them. When you use a knife to cut into them, you're pushing the parasite into the fruit or veggies.Dry them off with a paper towel or clean dish towel, as that can also remove some bacteria and parasites., When you use your cutting boards for meat, you need to clean them thoroughly when you're done. Scrub with hot, soapy water to help remove this parasite.You should also wash them if you cut unwashed vegetables on them.You can get away with just rinsing if your just cutting vegetables, as long as they were thoroughly washed.

, After handling raw meats, fruits, and vegetables, be sure to take time to wash your hands. If you don't, you can still have the parasite on your hands, which you can transfer to your mouth., If your child has a sandbox, it can be tempting for cats to use the bathroom in it. Even if you scoop out the feces, the sand can still contain the parasite. Therefore, the best solution is to cover it so that animals can't use the bathroom in it., If you feed your cat raw meat, she is more likely to carry toxoplasmosis. Feeding your cat canned food or dry food is the best option to cut down on the possibility of her carrying this parasite.Also, try to keep her from going outside. If she has a chance to kill live prey, she's likely to eat it. In turn, she may carry the parasite from live prey.Additionally, if she's outside, she can pick up the parasite from the soil., Strays are more likely to carry this parasite than indoor cats.While you may want to give a stray a home, it's best to avoid them if you're worried about toxoplasmosis, especially if you're pregnant., If you're pregnant, it's best to have someone else change the litter. If you can't, you should at least wear gloves and a face mask to cut down on the risk.Make sure to scrub your hands under warm, soapy water once you're done., It can take 1 to 5 days for the parasite to become infectious after your cat uses the bathroom. If you keep up with your kitty litter box by scooping or changing it daily, you're less likely to have infectious parasites in the box., When you're working in the garden, be sure to wear garden gloves. Garden soil can be contaminated with toxoplasmosis, so it's a good precaution to take. Also be sure to wash your hands when you come inside., Don't drink water unless it has been treated by the city or you have treated it yourself. Untreated water can carry toxoplasmosis.If you have clean drinking water from your city, you shouldn't have to worry about the parasite in your water.
As cooking and pasteurization kills the parasite, simply boiling water kills the parasite., Insects can spread your cat's feces around the house. Insects like cockroaches and flies are the most likely culprits, as they will be drawn to that area.Put screens on your windows to keep insects out.Have your house exterminated regularly for insects.

Look for allergy information.,
Don't mistake “Grain-Free” for carb-free.,
Look for “organic,” not “natural.” Some cats require organic food due to environmental sensitivities or veterinary recommendations.",How to Read Cat Food Labels4," If your cat suffers from food allergies, it's important to buy food that doesn't contain certain ingredients. Although human food in the U.S. must include allergy information on labels, this isn't the case with pet food. However, if your cat has allergies to certain ingredients such as fish, you'll have to scan the ingredient list on the back.Even if the ingredient your cat is allergic to is not on the label, this doesn’t guarantee the diet was produced in an allergen-free facility or processed on the same equipment.
If your cat has a food allergy, consider a diet specifically formulated for cats with allergies. These diets are specially processed to break down proteins in the food so that they’re too small to cause an allergic reaction. Talk to your veterinarian for a prescription.

, This is especially important if your cat has diabetes. While the claim itself isn't a “lie,” it can be misleading. Grains include corn, rice, and wheat. They don't include carbohydrate-heavy vegetables like potatoes or peas. Carbs are an excellent source of energy for healthy cats, but you should keep them to a minimum.For diabetic cats, they should be avoided whenever possible or appear towards the end of the ingredient list. Even if the front of the label says, “Grain-Free,” check the ingredient list for starchy vegetables.

, Under U.S. law, the word “natural” isn't regulated in human or animal food and is actually quite meaningless. On the other hand, no brand can claim to be “organic” unless it's certified free of chemicals and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or a more stringent state tilth organization."

Watch for symptoms of urinary tract infections in cats.,
Know when to take your cat to the veterinarian.,
Understand the tests your vet may perform.,
Realize your cat may need to be hospitalized.",How to Prevent Urinary Tract Infections in Cats2," Pay attention to your cat and note if you see any of the following:


Straining to urinate
Yowling, or making other sounds, while urinating
Urinating only small amounts of urine at a time, or none at all
Frequent trips to the litter box
Blood in the urine
Urinating outside the litter box
Changes in water consumption, often an increase
Licking the genital area

, Take your cat to the veterinarian immediately if you see blood in your cat's urine or if the cat cannot urinate at all.


Male cats are more likely to become blocked with sediment from crystals or stones in their urethras, usually caused by inflammation.This will ultimately result in a painful shut down of the kidneys and eventual death.Take your cat to the vet as soon as you notice these urine problems.

, When you take your cat to the veterinarian to diagnose the urinary problem, she will do tests to determine the exact problem and how to treat it. These tests may include:


a urinalysis to determine pH concentration and the presence of bacteria or crystals
a urine culture to determine if there is an infection, what kind of bacteria are present, and which antibiotics will kill those bacteria
blood work to determine kidney health
x-rays to look for stones in the bladder and the size and shape of the bladder and kidneys
an ultrasound to look into the bladder for tumors and evaluate the bladder wall (the inside of the kidneys and the ureters)

, Hospitalization may ensure that your cat gets the care and treatment she needs. This might include an intravenous catheter to give the cat fluids, placing a urinary catheter in the urethra to help clear a blockage, or antibiotics to treat a urinary tract infection. Your cat will most likely need to stay in the hospital for a few days.


Male cats that have experienced one episode of complete or partial urinary blockage are likely to have problems again. If this is the case, you really need to follow your veterinarian’s advice and maintain a proper diet, household regimen and regular medical care.

Have water available at all times.,
Make water appealing to your cat.,
Give your cat wet food.,
Feed a cat food designed to prevent stones.",How to Prevent Stones in Cats1," It is important that your cat has easy access to water all of the time. A cat that drinks a lot of water has less concentrated urine, which is less likely to develop crystals and eventually stones.Try putting water dishes in multiple locations in your home, so that your cat can easily get a drink any time it wants one.;
, It is important that your cat's water is appealing, so that it drinks often. Clean your cat's water bowl frequently to avoid bacteria buildup. Also, change the water daily to assure that the water tastes good to your cat.If your cat is hesitant to drink even clean, fresh water, you may need to make it even more appealing. Try getting a pet drinking fountain to entice it to drink more water. The running water in a drinking fountain will often lure even cats that are not normally interested in drinking water.

, If your cat doesn't drink enough water, you can get water into its system by giving it wet food. By giving your cat at least fifty percent wet food, you increase its water intake dramatically and decrease its chances of getting stones.As with all food changes, introduce a new wet food gradually. An abrupt change can be bad for your cat's digestive health.

, If your cat has a history of stones, you should discuss changing its diet with your vet. There are prescription diets that promote acidic urine for cats that have a prior history of stones.Check with your veterinarian for the correct type of food for your cat's specific dietary needs.
Always choose a prescription diet that is wet food over one that is dry food. Your cat will get more water in its diet, and thus decrease its chance of developing crystals, if it eats wet food.

Groom even if your cat has healthy grooming habits.,
Use an appropriate brush.,
Wipe your cat down after brushing.,
Brush often.",How to Prevent Cat Hairballs1," Your cat may be a very fastidious groomer, but this can actually lead to the increased frequency of hairballs.By allowing your cat to handle all of her grooming herself, she ends up collecting all of the loose hair in her coat, which she then swallows and can eventually vomit up in the form of a hairball. By doing some of the grooming yourself, you limit the amount of loose fur your cat can swallow.


This is especially true of long-haired cats, which are at the greatest risk of developing hairballs. The longer fur on these breeds of cats is more likely to knot together in the stomach, leading to increased hairballs.Note that it’s still completely normal for even short-haired cats to get hairballs, so don’t think you can prevent them simply by adopting a shorter-haired cat.;
, A rubber mitt or a brush (such as a Zoom Groom) will grip the loose fur and drag it out of the coat. Be gentle if you use a brush with metal tines since these are more likely to irritate your cat’s skin than a rubber brush. Whichever option you choose, ensure that it will reach the undercoat and not just the top layer of your cat’s coat. You should also brush in the direction of the fur growth rather than against it.If you have a long-haired cat, use a comb to gently remove any tangles before using the brush to avoid pulling on healthy fur and irritating your cat’s skin.You can also sprinkle a tiny bit of talcum powder on a tangle to help remove it.Cats have unique personalities and often take to a specific type of brush. You may have to try a couple of options before your cat finds the brush she likes and with which she’ll sit through a grooming session.

, Brushing can pull up a large amount of loose fur that doesn’t necessarily come off onto the brush. After a good brushing session, you should also wipe your cat’s coat down with a dry, clean cloth that will attract the remaining loose fur., Grooming your cat will be a never-ending battle, so prepare to do it often. If you own a long-haired cat, you should brush daily to reduce the risk of hairballs.For short-haired cats, you should brush at least weekly and more often whenever possible.


Note that you should increase brushing for outdoor cats between spring and fall since they’re likely to shed more during summer months. However, indoor cats can shed constantly all year long."

Know when to withhold food from your cat.,
Do not feed your cat past 10 PM the night before the surgery.,
Consider other cats you may have in your household.,
Make sure all family members know the cat is not to be fed.,
Make sure your cat can’t get outside.,
Prepare the cat carrier the night before.,
Remove your cat’s water supply.,
Line the cat carrier if you have not already done so.,
Consider using Feliway.,
Put your cat into her carrier.,
Pre-plan your route to the vet’s office.,
Talk to your veterinarian about what you should do about your cat’s medication.,
Tell your veterinarian when the last dose was given.,
Withhold your cat’s medications.,
Understand that diabetic cats should receive specialized treatment.,
Make yourself available while your cat is having surgery.",How to Prepare Your Cat for Surgery," If your cat is having either sedation or a general anesthetic then she needs to be starved for at least 12 hours before the surgery.


This is because when asleep under anesthetic the cat loses the ability to swallow.Thus if the sphincter (valve) guarding the entrance to the stomach relaxes under anesthetic, the pet may vomit whilst asleep and breathe in the vomit at the back of her throat.
This is highly likely to cause a serious pneumonia and is entirely avoidable by making sure her stomach is empty prior to the procedure.;
, If the cat is being admitted the following morning, all food must be removed at bedtime (10-11 pm) the night before.


It is fine to let her have access to drinking water overnight, but you should also take this away at breakfast time (7 am) the day of surgery.

, Taking food away sounds simple – you just pick up the bowl and make sure no one else in the family feeds the pet by mistake – but in practice it can be more complicated than this.


For instance, in a multi-cat household your options are to starve all the cats in the house for one night, or to confine the cat going for surgery to one room and give her a litter tray.
If you think the cat will become stressed if she is not allowed free range of the home, consider asking the vet if she can be dropped at the clinic the night before.
She may well settle there just fine, because she is wrong-footed by not being on home territory. It also means she is not traveling on the day of surgery and may be happier for this.

, A hungry cat is a convincing cat when it comes to persuading people to feed her. Also,remember to keep the cat indoors so she can't go and beg from neighbors.

, It is a good idea to lock the cat flap overnight. It is a story familiar to many veterinarians that the cat disappeared out through the flap on the morning of the op.


Make sure all family members know why the flap is locked, so that no-one falls sucker to a mournful cry from a bewildered puss first thing in the morning.
Other factors include whether the cat hunts or not. If she is likely to go and hunt down her own supper then she must be kept indoors overnight so this cannot happen.
In a multi-cat household, again, this may require preventing all the cats from going outside. If this is impossible then speak to the vet clinic and see if it is possible to drop the cat off the night before, to stay in a hospital bed.
Although the one cat may not be best pleased, at least it prevents the rest of the household's cats from becoming stressed.

, Where possible, prepare the cat carrier the night before (or even earlier than this). This allows you to check if it is serviceable and gives you time to make any repairs to broken straps or hinges in time for the morning when it is needed.

, Plan to remove water first thing, about 7 am. Water passes out of the stomach much more quickly than food and does not pose the same risk if removed 2 to 3 hours beforehand.


There is no advantage to taking away water the night before, indeed this is not advisable because the cat may go to surgery slightly dehydrated and this can decrease the blood supply to her kidneys and cause damage.

, Not all cats travel well so prepare for ""accidents"" and line the bottom of the carrier with absorbent material such as a puppy pad or newspaper.


Put bedding or a T-shirt in the carrier for the cat to snuggle up to. It helps if the bedding has a familiar, comforting smell such as a piece of clothing that belongs to you.

, Feliway is a synthetic version of the feline pheromone that makes kittens feel safe and secure. It is available as a room diffuser, or a spray for pet bedding.


When breathed in it gradually reassures the cat and gives her the message that this is a safe place and there is nothing to worry about.
Consider spritzing the bedding with Feliway prior to travel to try to decrease the cat's stress levels.

, Ideally, leave the carrier out for weeks before hand, as an inviting den to sleep in. However, failing this you may need to insert the cat into the box, which can be tricky.


The element of surprise works well. Have the carrier door open in preparation, pick the cat up and swiftly place her into the box and close the door. However, once the cat is forewarned she is more likely to resist.
Some cats object to going in head first, because they perceive they are being forced into a dark place. Try inserting them bottom first. To do this, if you are right-handed, thread your left arm under the cat's belly so her head is near your elbow and her tail near your hand.
Gently grasp both back legs in your left hand, so that she can't splay her legs out, and put her into the box backwards (for a front opening box). This works well for the majority of cats.

, Secure the cat carrier into the car by looping the seat belt through the handle and anchoring it. Know the route you need to take to get to the clinic, and allow extra time for school traffic and the like. Better to arrive early and calm than late and stressed, as the cat will pick up on your anxiety.

, If your cat is on medication, either long-term medication such as pain relief, or short-term such as antibiotics, ask your veterinarian whether the medication should be given or withheld on the morning of the surgery.

, Some medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain killers, e.g. metacam, must not be given on an empty stomach. Thus they should never be given on the morning of surgery because the animal needs to be starved.


However, these drugs are often effective for 24 hours so if the cat had a dose the previous evening, tell the veterinarian.
This is important because pain relief is a big part of modern anesthesia and many clinics routinely give a pain relieving injection as part of the pre-med protocol.
Your clinic is highly likely to be aware your cat is on meds, but it does no harm to reinforce this since an extra dose could have harmful side effects.

, If, for example, the cat is due an antibiotic on the morning of the surgery, alert the clinic that she has not had the tablet. This allows them to give that day's dose by injection, if necessary.

, If your diabetic cat is due for surgery, the clinic should give you clear instructions about what to do about insulin and food on the morning of the procedure.


Water: Leave water down right up until you put the cat in the basket. Diabetic cats need to drink more and if deprived of water quickly become dehydrated. Dehydration puts a greater strain on the kidneys. In fact, once at the clinic many veterinarians will put a diabetic cat on an intravenous drip to keep them stable whilst water is not allowed by mouth.
Food: The same rules about starving apply to diabetic, as well as non-diabetic animals. No food from 10-11 pm the previous night.
Insulin: If your cat is on twice daily insulin injections, the morning dose of insulin is reduced by half. For example, if the regular morning dose is 4 units, you give 2 units, because she has not eaten and her requirement for insulin is reduced.
If you give no insulin at all there is a risk of ketones forming as a result of her blood glucose levels climbing. A half dose is unlikely to reduce her blood glucose to dangerously low levels, and is enough to prevent ketone formation. If in doubt, always speak to your veterinarian about the dose.

, The clinic will ask for a contact phone number. Make sure that you are fully available at all times on that contact number.


The vet may need to speak to you about something simple like if it's okay to implant an ID chip, or it could important information such as a discovery made during surgical investigation.
If the vet cannot reach you, he won't be able to act. If you are not contactable, the vet will not have consent for any procedures not covered on the consent form.
This could mean the cat has to wake up, only to need another anesthetic at a later date for a procedure that could have been sorted out there and then.

Keep your cat's water dish full.,
Give your cat ice.,
Give old or sick cats special care.,
Keep your cat inside.,
Brush your cat.,
Don't leave your cat in a car.",How to Protect Your Cat in Summer1," It is important that your cat stays hydrated during the hot summer months. Change its water every day and make sure that it has access to that water at all times.If your cat is spending a lot of time outside, you should put a fresh bowl of water outside for it, as well as a bowl inside. A cat spending the day outside needs a guaranteed source of water in order to stay hydrated.
If the day is especially hot, put a few ice cubes in your cat's water bowl at the beginning of the day. This will keep the water cooler throughout the day.;
, If your home is especially warm, make a game out of cooling your cat down. Put a few ice cubes on the floor and let your cat play with them. If you have an active cat, it will enjoy the game and get cooled down at the same time.


Different cats will have vastly different reactions to ice. Some will ignore it, some will play with it, some will lick it, and some will probably even lay on it. It's fun to see what your cat will do!
You can also give your cat a cool treat by freezing its favorite wet food in a ice tray or small plastic cup and then giving it to the cat in its food bowl. The cat will need to work a little harder to eat its food but the frozen food will cool the cat down in the process.

, Cats that are old or that are ill will have a harder time regulating their body temperature than cats that are young and healthy. Because of this, you will need to be especially careful about keeping an old or unhealthy cat cool in the summer.


Cats that are overweight may also have a hard time getting rid of excess heat, as their additional weight interferes with the regulation of their body temperature.You should be more concerned about keeping them cool than you would be for a skinny cat.

, It is especially important to keep a cat inside while there is an extreme heat advisory. In extreme temperatures, your cat will have a hard time finding anywhere outside that it cool enough to avoid heatstroke, in addition to having a hard time finding sources of water.Make sure that your cat doesn't have any way of escaping the house.

, While it's not a good idea to shave your cat, as its hair actually helps to regulate its body temperature, removing your cat's excess fur is a good idea.Give your cat a good brush so that its thick undercoat is removed regularly.


Spending the time to brush your cat also allows you to inspect your cat's body for injuries or infections, such as fleas or ticks.

, It is never a good idea to leave any pet in a sealed car, especially on a warm summer day. Temperatures can climb rapidly in the summer and the temperature in a sealed car can grow to a temperature that threatens your cat's life very quickly. If you are traveling in a car with a cat, make sure that the car is cool and that the cat is out of the direct sunlight.

Be a vet to your cat at home.,
Get your cat to feel accustomed to being placed in a carrier.,
Work with the vet to properly prepare the exam room for your cat’s arrival.,
Keep things calm.",How to Prepare Your Cat for a First Time Visit to the Vet," This does not mean that you take up a course in veterinary and becoming a practicing pet care expert! It is simply referring to doing simple and easy regular DIY head to tail check-ups on your cat, to help prepare your cat for being prodded and checked out when it does end up at the veterinary clinic. Look at your cat’s ears, touch your kitty’s neck, legs, tummy, etc., while you’re petting him or her. This will help your cat get accustomed to being handled by another person, such as the vet.


This can also give you an indication of which areas will set off your cat, allowing you to warn the vet. For example: ""Take care when touching Fifi's belly; she tries to bite me when I do that."";
, For many a cat owner, a first time vet visit reveals a common problem––a total lack of willingness to enter the cat carrier. It looks small, cramped and dark, so what is there to like about being forced inside of it? It is important to try to overcome the cat's reticence in relation to the cat carrier; after all, you'll be needing to take your cat to the vet at least annually for the rest of his or her life, so the sooner he or she learns to tolerate the carrier, the better.


Try to create a positive link or some sort of warm feelings between the carrier and your cat. This involves incorporating the carrier into both of your regular activities days before the visit to the vet. Line it with the cat's favorite fluffy blanket and encourage your cat to use it as a nap space. If you sit at a desk at home, or on a couch, place the carrier nearby, to encourage its discovery and use as a napping place. You can also give the cat treats while he or she is inside.
Be aware that no matter how much of a positive impression the cat gains about the carrier, this will be undone when it is used as a form of transportation. You will just have to learn to live with this and reinforce the positives of it each time.
Eventually, you may find it's just easier to back the cat into the carrier than forcing him or her in frontwards. It's not the most elegant solution but when you have a large, strong and uncooperative cat, dignity is the last thing to be preserved! Remember too, health care comes first.

, The exam room should have a soothing and quite ambiance. The vet should reduce the lighting and if there are ceiling fans in the room, they should be turned off, since cats find them very frightening. Having big, fluffy towels or blankets in the area where your kitty will be examined will also help make him or her to feel more comfortable during his or her stay at the vet’s clinic. It is a good idea to bring your own along, just in case; they can also be used to cover the carrier viewpoints should a dog happen to be seated next to you in the waiting room.

, When inside the exam room, try to eliminate any loud or shuddering noises that could startle the cat. Talk to your cat in a soft and soothing voice. If your cat doesn’t like being in the carrier, let him or her out so that he or she can explore the room. If your cat gets on a chair or jumps down onto the floor, don’t worry: the vet will be able to conduct the exam in either of those places. And if the cat prefers to stay in the carrier, the vet will also be able to do some procedures, such as vaccinations, without getting him or her out of the bag.

Provide several clean litter boxes.,
Place litter boxes in safe and quiet areas.,
Avoid stressful changes.",How to Prevent Stones in Cats2," It is important to promote frequent urination for your cat, so that crystals and stones are not allowed to build up. In order to do this, you should provide several litter boxes for your cat to use and make sure they are kept clean. Putting one more litter box out than the number of cats you have will help to ensure that your cat goes whenever it has the urge.Clean litter boxes regularly in order to encourage your cat to use them.

, In order to promote frequent urination, you should place your cat's litter boxes in places that give it a bit of privacy. Placing the litter boxes in noisy or busy areas does not allow for your cat to relax and do its business.


This does not mean that your cat's litter boxes should be in out of the way places, far away from the core of your home. It simply means that your cat probably needs a bit of privacy, so place litter boxes in private corners or out of sight of the rest of the home.

, Stress can impact the health of your cat greatly, so try to keep your cat's stress to a minimum. One way to do this is to minimize changes to the cat's routine and supplies. For example, avoid changing the type of litter you put in your cat's litter boxes, as this can cause distress and confusion around urination.If your cat's routine is changed dramatically, this can cause it a lot of stress, which can lower its resistance to infections and decrease its usual eating, drinking, and urination cycles.
If you need to make changes to your cat's routine or supplies, make them incrementally. For example, if you do need to change the type of cat litter you use, do it gradually. Add some of the new type into the old type, so that the switch is made over the course of a few weeks.

Look for any signs of urinary problems.,
Have your veterinarian examine the cat.,
Keep a close eye on cats prone to stones.",How to Prevent Stones in Cats3," Cats that have an inability to urinate or are straining to urinate may have stones. Additional symptoms include painful urination, the presence of blood in urine, and urinating in places other than the litter box, if that is not your cat's normal behavior.If your cat is having a hard time urinating, you should take it to be seen by a vet immediately. This is a life-threatening problem that requires immediate veterinary intervention.

, Ignoring the signs of stones can cause your cat a great deal of discomfort. If left untreated, obstructions can block the flow of urine, which can become toxic, or grow so large that the bladder bursts. If you are unsure whether your cat has an infected or blocked urinary tract or stones, it is always best to have them examined by your veterinarian to make sure.The veterinarian should perform diagnostic tests on your cat, such as X-rays, ultrasounds, blood tests to check for toxins and elevated white blood cell counts (a sign of infection), and palpation.

, While all cats and dogs can get stones, some breeds of cats are more susceptible than others. If your cat has had a stone in the past, it is more likely to get one again. Keep an eye out for the symptoms and get regular veterinary checkups, so that you can get veterinary treatment quickly if the condition appears again.If your cat has had stones in the past, periodic urinalysis or ultrasound examination may be helpful. This can help you to detect stones early and will allow you to make adjustments to your cat's diet or ongoing treatment.

Look for a food that offers “hairball control”.,
Let your cat snack on cat grass.,
Provide plenty of fresh water.,
Use a hairball lubricant if hairballs persist.",How to Prevent Cat Hairballs2," Many premium cat food manufacturers make a ""hairball"" control diet. This is usually a dry kibble that contains fiber.The fiber attaches itself to the hair in the stomach and pulls the hair with it through the bowel to be passed. This is most effective when fed as the cat's main food.


These formulas also contain vitamins and nutrients to improve your cat’s coat, reducing the amount your cat will shed.Hairball control foods are not so useful for helping your cat pass an existing hairball. You may need to use a lubricant to help with the latter, and then continue with a hairball control diet to prevent recurrence.

, Cats love to snack on plants—often ones you wish they wouldn’t. Indoor cat grass is another good source of fiber for your cat, and it’s cheap and easy to take care of.Consider keeping some around for your cat to nibble at between meals.

, Water is highly important to your cat’s digestion, and cats can be very picky drinkers. If your cat prefers running water, then provide a circulating fountain-style dispenser or a deep, pool-style reservoir dish.These options come with attachable tanks that ensure your cat has continuous access to fresh water even while you’re away.

, You can find lubricants to help prevent hairballs in a couple of different forms. You apply some brands to your cat’s food while others you apply directly to your cat’s paw for her to lick off as she grooms. Regardless of the delivery method, the lubricant will coat the fur and help it pass more easily through your cat’s digestive tract.You can find several brands of hairball lubricant at your local pet store. Most will suggest giving them to your cat once or twice a week, but you should always follow the manufacturer’s directions.These formulations are most often petroleum based, which is safe for your cat at the suggested dosages.For existing hairballs, a lubricant can help your cat vomit up the hairball as well, so don’t panic if your cat produces a hairball after you’ve started using the product. After the existing hairball is up, the product should help prevent future ones.
A small amount of vegetable oil on dry cat food can help as well, but it may not work as effectively as a petroleum-based lubricant. Check with your vet for the proper amount for your cat.
If you are using a lubricant and your cat stops eating, seems unwell, or strains in her litter box, then seek veterinary attention for the cat.

Monitor your cat for obsessive grooming.,
Check for fleas.,
Provide new toys and more playtime.,
Have your veterinarian test your cat for allergies.,
Take environmental changes into account.,
See your veterinarian.",How to Prevent Cat Hairballs3," If your cat obsessively grooms, she will groom to the point of damaging her coat. Her barbed tongue breaks the hair shafts, causing her to swallow healthy hair that has been barbered and broken off in addition to the loose fur.Check your cat for bald patches. Typically affected areas include the tummy, the back of the hind legs, and the flanks. You should not be able to see the skin, so if these areas lack fur and you can see the skin, the cat is likely to be obsessive-compulsive about grooming.

, One of the reasons your cat may obsessively groom is due to fleas.This is because some cats are over sensitive to flea bites and have an allergic reaction to the presence of flea saliva. This creates an intense itch sensation on the skin, which triggers the grooming behavior. If you find fleas, apply an appropriate flea treatment (such as Frontline) as directed.


These treatments often last for a month or more. You should apply to all pets in the house that can harbor fleas to prevent the resurgence of fleas after the treatment application.

, Some cats obsessively groom due to simple boredom. Try engaging your cat with more playtime than usual and some new toys. Anytime you notice your cat grooming for excessive periods of time, distract her from the behavior with playtime., Just like humans, cats can have allergies that lead to itchiness and therefore excessive grooming. Allergies can range from pollen allergies to food allergies.If your cat obsessively licks her back or abdomen, allergies have a higher chance of being the culprit.See your veterinarian and discuss the symptoms.


Your veterinarian may place your cat on a monitored hypoallergenic diet to test for a food allergy. Follow your vet’s instructions to ensure that your cat maintains a well-balanced diet.

, Some cats over groom because of stress.Anything from stray cats in the yard to moving to the arrival of a new pet or baby can cause stress in your cat. Give your cat time to adjust, and try using a synthetic feline pheromones (such as Feliway), which can have a calming effect.

, Obsessive grooming can also be the result of medical conditions such as neurological disorders.If other steps haven’t stopped your cat from over grooming, then you should see your veterinarian to rule out more serious conditions.


If your cat has episodes of retching without producing the hairball, then you should also seek assistance from your vet. This can be a sign that a hairball has past into your cat’s intestine—which can create a dangerous blockage—or it can also be a sign of a respiratory ailment such as asthma."

Make sure screens are secure.,
Keep medications and vaccinations up to date.,
Avoid vigorous activity.,
Make sure your cat has identification.,
Avoid growing toxic plants.,
Bring your cat inside at night.",How to Protect Your Cat in Summer2," Many cats love to lounge on window sills in the warm sunlight. In the winter, when windows are closed, this is a great way for them to stay warm. In the summer, however, when windows are open, it can be hazardous. Cats leaning into screens that are not very secure can easily pop them out, leading to escape from the house or injury. Don't assume that your cat will understand the difference between a solid window and a flimsy screen. If your cat is used to the window being solid, it will probably assume that it is that way all of the time.

, You should always keep your cat's medications and vaccinations up to date but it's especially important in the summer. Fleas and ticks are more active during the summer, so these infections are more likely to occur in the summer.Also, keeping vaccinations up to date in the summer is especially important because your cat is more likely to come into contact with other animals during the summer months. More contact increases the risk of your cat getting a contagious disease, such as feline distemper, if they are not vaccinated., While a cat won't usually go on a run with you or get heatstroke from playing fetch for hours, excessive activity can increase a cat's body temperature. If it is very hot out or in your home, don't play with your cat for long periods of time and exhaust it. This can lead to an increased body temperature.

, If your cat is spending more time outside during the summer it is especially important to make sure it has current identification. You should put tags on it that includes your current phone number and address and have it micro chipped, so that it can be returned to you if found by animal control.


Having both forms of identification on your cat will help to assure it's safe when roaming the neighborhood.

, Many general houseplants are toxic to cats, and they are grown year round. However, many outside blooming plants, such as daisies, dahlias, and lilies, are also toxic for cats. Your cat is more likely to come into contact with these plants in the summer, when they are grown outside. While outdoor cats regularly roam beyond their yards, it's best to limit the hazards to your cat by avoiding growing these plants.Consult a list of plants that are toxic to cats before planning your garden.Signs that your cat has ingested a plant that is toxic to them range from nausea and throwing up to sudden death. Because the signs are general and hard to pinpoint, it's best to keep your cat away from these plants to begin with.

, Bringing your cat inside will protect it from a variety of dangers that increase at night. These include, but aren't limited to, the dangers of cars and wild animals.Even though you don't see wild animals in your neighborhood it doesn't mean they are not there. For example, coyotes largely move around, and hunt, at night.

Inspect your cat's body.,
Pay attention to signs of heatstroke.,
Take your cat to a veterinarian.",How to Protect Your Cat in Summer3," Take the time to groom your cat and look over the state of its body while you do. This gives you the chance to look for injuries, infections, and pests. It also allows you to identify areas that are sunburned and need some care, which can be given by applying a thin layer of aloe vera to the burns.Your cat's paws can get damaged from walking on hot concrete all day. Look at its pads and make sure they are in good shape. If they look damaged, you should take your cat to the vet so the damage can be treated.
Cats are usually more active outside during the summer and this means that they interact with other animals more during that time of year. This interaction can lead to fights and injuries. Checking over your cat's body can allow you to spot injuries that, without treatment, could become infected and turn into abscesses.

, If your cat is not properly hydrated and has been exposed to high temperatures, it can get heat stroke very quickly. Signs that your cat has heat stroke include:Panting
Drooling
Red tongue or gums
Weakness
Vomiting

, If your cat appears to be having extreme symptoms of heat stroke you should take it to a veterinarian quickly. You should be concerned and take your cat in if it is panting a lot, its gums have turned red, and it appears weak or disoriented."

Get your cat vaccinated.,
Isolate sick cats to prevent further infection.,
Keep your cat's areas clean.,
Look for the signs of an upper respiratory illness.,
Take your cat to its veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Prevent Feline Upper Respiratory Illness," Vaccination against cat flu is considered an essential vaccine. The flu vaccine needs to be given regularly and it comes in a variety of types (modified live, modified live intranasal, killed vaccine) which determines how often the vaccine needs to be given.A typical vaccine regime is an initial loading dose of two injections given 3 - 4 weeks apart followed by a booster one year later, then further booster injections every three years. This is just a guide and varies depending on which vaccine is used.
There is also a vaccine against feline chlamydia but this is considered optional.
The evolving nature of viral infections means that because new strains develop, vaccination may not be 100% effective. Even vaccinated cats may develop signs of upper respiratory tract infection, either because their infection is caused by a bug not included in the vaccine, or because of partial immunity due to viral adaptation. Breeding cats should be vaccinated prior to breeding. Any breeding toms that are brought into the breeding establishment should be vaccinated and preferably watched for 24 hours before mixing with the female, to ensure he isn't showing any signs of sneezing or infection.;
, If you have a multi-cat household of unvaccinated animals, and one starts to show signs, immediately isolate that cat. Get the other cats vaccinated right away. Do not allow the cats to mingle for at least 3 weeks, by which time they should have some protection from the vaccine.Infection is spread when virus particles are sneezed out or are present in discharges from the nose or mouth. This contaminates the environment ready to infect the next cat that comes into contact with that water bowl or the surface that has been sneezed on.Cats most at risk are those kept in large groups (such as breeding catteries), those in a shared air space (such as a shelter or boarding cattery), those with weak immune systems (such as kittens, the elderly, or those cats with another health problem), or cats kept in dirty conditions where the illness can flourish.

, Wash your cat's dishes and bedding regularly. This is especially important in multi-cat households and for indoor-outdoor cats. These cats come in contact with more illnesses and are at higher risk of infection.


If you have a sick cat you should observe scrupulous hygiene. Keep the sick cat in a small room which you can clean easily. Wash all food and water bowls daily in dilute bleach. Wipe down the walls and washed surfaces with a dilute bleach or a cleaning product recommended by your vet. Be careful the surfaces are dry before a cat comes into contact with them, as bleach can be irritant to cats.Wash your hands before petting the other cats, and it's also a good precaution to change your clothing, as viruses can be transported on fabric.
In shelters or boarding catteries it is crucial the staff observe good hygiene, disinfecting their hands between cats. Good cattery design is essential and there should be solid partitions between cats to avoid them sneezing and spreading bugs into the neighboring cage., Most commonly these are similar to the signs you could expect if you had a cold. They include sneezing, coughing, change of voice, a snotty nasal discharge, inflamed eyes, a discharge from the eyes (ranging from watering to a yellow-green purulent discharge), loss of appetite, and perhaps even fever.


In addition, with cat flu the patient may develop painful ulcers on the tongue, which prevent the cat from eating and may cause it to drool.
The incubation period depends on the specific bugs involved, but varies from one day to 17 days, from contacting a source of infection to developing physical signs.

, Your veterinarian will look for the symptoms of a respiratory illness, including sneezing, red eyes, runny nose, and coughing.Your veterinarian may assess the symptoms simply by sight, or they may use a medical instrument, such as a stethoscope, to get a more in-depth sense of the illness.


When you call your veterinarian to make an appointment, tell them what you suspect an upper respiratory infection. They may have instructions for you to follow on arrival, in order to avoid infecting other cats waiting for treatment.

, Treating a upper respiratory illness usually consists of treating the symptoms. However, if the cat has a secondary infection, your veterinarian may prescribe antibiotics for the infection.


Your veterinarian may suggest the use of a nasal decongestant to relieve congestion.Try to make your cat as comfortable as possible while it is recovering. For example, if it has a lot of nasal or ocular discharge try wiping that away on a regular basis.

Assess the cat's coat and skin.,
Evaluate the cat from head to toe.,
Make sure the cat is eating normally.,
Look for signs of digestive trouble.,
Make sure your cat is getting exercise.,
Look for signs of aggression or unhappiness.",How to Perform at Home Health Exams on Your Cat," Begin by looking at your cat's eyes. Make sure that they are clear, there is no discharge, and that the surfaces of them are smooth. Then look in the cat's ears. They should be relatively clean and should not be red or irritated.

When looking at your cat's eyes you are looking for signs of disease or injury. If the surface of the eye is not smooth and there is discharge coming from the eyes, your cat may have conjunctivitis or some other disease. Get the cat looked at by a veterinarian.A cat's ears can have a variety of problems, including ear mites and bacterial or yeast infections. If your cat's ears are not clean, and it is rubbing them or seems to be hard of hearing, you should get it looked at by a veterinarian.;
, Dental health is very important for a cat's overall health. Look at your cat's teeth for signs of decay or disease. You may also want to smell the cat's breath. If it smells putrid or rancid, instead of its normal cat food smell, then you should have the cat's teeth looked at by a veterinarian.It is recommended that you clean your cat's teeth on a regular basis. It is best to do it daily but can be effective for preventing periodontal disease if it is done several times a week., It is important to make sure that your cat is breathing well when you do an at home health exam. Listen to your cat's breathing and make sure there are no signs that it is having difficulty. These signs can include difficulty breathing in and out, an increased rate of breathing, panting, open mouth breathing, coughing, and noisy breathing.Having difficulty breathing can be a symptom of literally hundreds of illnesses. If your cat is having difficulty breathing you should take it so be seen by a veterinarian so that the cat's illness can be determined and treated.

, Feeling your cat's body can help you to assess whether it is at a healthy weight, in addition to spotting the signs of illness or injury. Run your hands along the cat's core, feeling the ribs, stomach, and back. Pay attention to lumps or areas that are overly skinny or fat.You should be able to feel the ribs, but they shouldn't stick out. You should also feel a small area of fat on the abdomen, but it shouldn't be very large.

, Run your hands along the cat's legs and feel down to its feet. Make sure there are no injuries or areas that are sensitive when touched. Also make sure that cat's pads are not cracked or irritated and that the cat's paws are clean between the toes.If you have a cat that is skittish or aloof, you may have a hard time feeling its legs and feet at first. Work with the cat to get it used to your touch by using treats and positive reinforcement.
If your cat has minor cracks or irritation on its pads, try applying a moisturizing product to them. These products are sold at pet supply stores or can be supplied by your veterinarian.

, Look over the cat's entire coat for signs of hair loss or irregular patches of fur. Also make sure that the cat's skin has no pigment changes or areas of lumps or redness. Any problems with your cat's coat that last more than a week or two should be looked at by a veterinarian.

Areas of missing fur can be the result of simple injuries, such as scratches, or they can be a symptom of a health problem, such as hormonal imbalances., When you are giving an at home health exam you should look at every surface on the cat's body. This will help you to spot any developing problems.

It's important to feel the cat's body, in addition to looking at it. If you feel any abnormalities, such as lumps or bumps, you should keep track of them and make sure they are not growing. If they do, you should bring them to the attention or your veterinarian.
A good time to feel your cat's body is when you are brushing it or when it is curled up on your lap. Combining a petting session with a inspection of the cat's body will be more pleasant for the cat.

, If is important to make sure that your cat is eating and digesting its food normally. Assess whether your cat is eating the same amount as it always has and if it is going to the bathroom as much as it usually does. Changes to the amount your cat is eating or going to the bathroom can indicate a developing illness, so you should have the cat seen by a veterinarian if this occurs. Assessing how much your cat goes to the bathroom if easier for indoor cats, as they will only be eliminating in their litter boxes. For cats that go outside, it may be impossible to track their bathroom trips.

, Make sure that your cat is not vomiting regularly and does not have diarrhea on a regular basis. While the occasional case of vomiting or diarrhea that only lasts a day or so should not cause alarm, any bouts that last longer should not be ignored. A cat that is not properly digesting its food should be seen by a veterinarian.

Some diseases that can cause vomiting and diarrhea in cats include bacterial infections, intestinal parasites, and viral infections.It is especially important to get your cat veterinary care if there is blood in its vomit or diarrhea.

, When assessing your cat's health, you should make sure that it is getting enough exercise. A cat that has decreased its activity level may be suffering from an injury or illness that it is hiding. Watch your cat and make sure it is doing everything that it normally does.

Also, try engaging your cat in play and make sure that it moves normally when it plays. If it looks like movement is painful, if the cat is limping, or the cat is hesitant to play in a way that it normally likes, then you may want to have it looked at by a veterinarian.
Exercise is an important part of cat health. Without enough exercise, such as that done during playing, hunting, or exploring, your cat can become overweight and unhealthy., When assessing your cat's health, you need to take its mood into consideration. Aggression or unhappiness, especially in cats that have usually been happy in the past, can be signs that your cat is ill and in pain. Look for signs of unhappiness and if you see them, have your cat looked at by a veterinarian. They include:Inappropriate elimination
Hissing or growling
Hesitance to be touched
A defensive posture
Biting or swatting

Get your cat vaccinated.,
Deter animals from visiting your yard.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Keep your cat's food and water bowls clean.,
Stop the virus from spreading.,
Feel your cat for fever.,
Pay attention to your cat's behavior.,
Watch for vomiting and diarrhea.,
Get a medical diagnosis.,
Treat your cat.",How to Prevent Feline Panleukopenia (Distemper)," If you have a kitten, start the vaccination series between 6 and 9 weeks of age. Your kitten will need injections every 3 or 4 weeks until she's 16 weeks old. Your kitten will need a booster injection one year after the last kitten vaccine and then every 3 years thereafter. If you have an adult cat, she'll need just 2 initial injections (3 to 4 weeks apart), followed by a booster one year later and then a booster every three years.Kittens need more early injections to prevent maternal antibodies from disabling the vaccine.
This vaccine is considered to be a core or essential vaccine even for indoor cats. This is because the virus can be brought inside your home.;
, Raccoons, foxes, and minks can carry the virus, so it's important to discourage them from spending time in your yard. Keep your yard fenced to prevent them from wandering in. You should also keep your garbage cans securely closed, put away any pet food that you keep outside, and consider sprinkling a repellent.You should also try to keep feral or neighborhood cats out of your yard since there's no way of knowing if they carry the virus. Remove any food, cover sandboxes, and make your yard less appealing to other cats., Since the virus can be easily brought into your house from outside, change your shoes, put on a new outfit, and wash your hands if you've been outside. This is mainly important if you'll be handling kittens that are nursing. You should always change into new shoes when coming inside if you have an inside cat that's not been vaccinated.


Be especially cautious if you have a pregnant unvaccinated cat in your house. She can easily pass the virus on to the unborn kittens., Wash your cat's food and water dishes every day using diluted bleach. If your cat is sick, you'll need to talk to the vet about using an effective disinfectant since the panleukopenia virus can survive many common household cleaners and steam cleaning. Your vet may recommend cleaning with a product that contains glutaraldehyde, formalin, or 1/32 solution of sodium hypochlorite (bleach).Always use separate utensils for pets and for humans.

, If one of your cats has the virus, prevent other cats in your house from getting the disease. Even once the cat has been treated for the virus, she'll continue to excrete the virus through her feces for up to 6 weeks. Vaccinate any other cats in your house and keep them away from the infected cat for at least a week after the final vaccine.Cats can be infected indirectly (without having direct contact with a sick cat). For example, a cat might become infected by coming into contact with a contaminated water bowl.

, If your cat gets the panleukopenia virus, it will incubate for 5 to 9 days before she starts showing symptoms. You might notice your cat develops a high fever.


The fever may fluctuate and may be one of the earliest signs of the virus., You may notice other signs that your cat has contracted the virus. Her appetite may drastically change and she may not want to eat. Your cat might seem tired, lethargic, and fatigued.This is especially noticeable in kittens or if your cat is usually playful and energetic.


Your cat's lack of appetite can also lead to dehydration.Monitor how much water your cat drinks throughout the day.

, Once the virus progresses (usually one or two days after the fever), your cat may suddenly develop bloody diarrhea and vomiting. If the virus has severely developed, your cat can hemorrhage. Some cats die quickly because their bodies can't keep up with the virus.The virus rapidly divides cells in your cat's gut and keeps white blood cells from fighting infection, causing these serious symptoms., The vet will take your cat's medical history, look for signs of the virus, and do a physical exam. Specifically, the vet will look for fever, dehydration, depression, thickened intestines, and enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen. The vet will also order lab tests (like blood tests) in order to confirm a diagnosis.If your cat has the virus, she'll have a low white blood count and possibly a low platelet count. A fecal or urine test is more expensive and takes more time, so the vet may only order these if trying to research whether or not your cat has the virus.

, If you notice any signs of the panleukopenia virus, get your cat veterinary attention immediately. While mortality rates are high, your cat may recover with intensive nursing, intravenous fluids, drugs to relieve nausea, antibiotics for secondary infections, and in some cases a blood transfusion.Unfortunately, there's no cure for the virus and the majority of infected cats die, with some passing away before the gastrointestinal (vomiting and diarrhea) signs start.

Pick a time when your cat is at ease.,
Plan how you will position yourself and the cat.,
Put the cat in position and get it comfortable.,
Hold the cat steady on the table.,
Position your fingers.,
Apply pressure gently until your cat opens its mouth by pressing down on the cat’s lower jaw until it opens its mouth.,
Insert any medicine into your cat's mouth while you have the mouth open.,
Force your cat to swallow.,
Maintain the same position for a few seconds before removing the covers and releasing your cat.",How to Open a Cat's Mouth," Don’t try to open your cat’s mouth when it is riled up, playful, or upset. You should also avoid waking your cat up to open its mouth, as it could scare the cat. Instead, just pick a time when the cat is calm and happy and wants to be around you., You need to think about where and how you will hold your cat and how and where you will hold any medications you are going to give it, if you are doing that. Ideally you will do this on a tabletop. Make sure there is nothing breakable nearby on the table, as your cat may break loose and knock things over.


Place the towel or blanket on the table and spread it out. You will use the towel or blanket to wrap the cat up so it can't move.
You will also want to have a syringe (without a needle attached) full of water on hand if you are giving your cat a pill. This will help to wash down the pill.
Keep the pill in your more dexterous hand. Get your arms at the same height as your cat.

, Pick up the cat and place it in the middle of the towel, holding it down in a laying position on its belly. Bring one side of the towel up over the body, then bring the other side up over snugly. Bring the back end up towards the front making sure it’s snug.Finally wrap the front of the towel around the cat’s back snugly. This should only leave the cat's head sticking out. Make sure the material is snugly wrapped around the cat in order to keep legs and claws inside the material.
Try and calm the cat if it is fighting you. Some cats will put up with being wrapped up extremely well, while others will fight you tremendously. Gauge your specific cat and judge whether you can wrap it and calm it down or if you just need to wrap it up right before you open its mouth.

, If giving the cat medicine, hold the cat with your non-dominant hand while you pick up the medication with your dominant hand. If you have a helper, have them hold the wrapped cat for you. If you don’t, slide your elbow and forearm of your non-dominant hand alongside the cat’s wrapped body until you are holding it between your arm and your chest while the wrapped cat is still on the table., Put your thumb on one side and your forefinger on the other side of your cat's mouth along the cheeks where the jaw hinges. You will be able to just barely be able to feel the teeth through the cheeks.

, Basically you are pushing your fingers between the upper and lower jaw while applying downwards pressure. This pressure will be uncomfortable for the cat so it will open its mouth.

, Using your pointer finger and thumb, put the pill toward the back of the mouth over the tongue in one quick movement. Then quickly withdraw your fingers so you don’t get bit. If you are worried about getting bit, you can purchase a pill popper that is like a long syringe with a plunger that you place the pill in and pass this into the cat’s mouth.Don’t just shove a pill down the back of your cat’s throat. The pill could be accidently shoved into the cat’s windpipe causing choking. Conversely, damage could be done to the back of the throat if it is forced down it’s esophagus., Let go of the cat’s mouth and hold its top jaw or face so that its nose points upward. Rub your cat's throat gently to trigger the swallowing reflex.


Use a syringe to place a small amount of water in the commissure between the lips to encourage the pill to “go down” the esophagus. This prevents the pill from irritating or “sticking” in the throat and damaging the tissues.
DO NOT shoot the water down the back of the throat or the cat may inhale the water into it’s lungs.

, You don't want your cat to injure itself while trying to get away, so you should try to calm it down a bit before releasing it. Also, don't forget to give your cat a lot of praise and some tasty treats as a reward for good behavior."

Let your cat get comfortable.",How to Make Vet Visits Less Stressful for Your Cat," If the vet's office is the only place your cat gets handled, it's only natural that being handled would induce a panic. You can help make vet visits a little smoother by regularly handling your cat at home the way a vet would.Get your cat used to having its paws touched. While cradling your cat in your lap, hold each paw and press on each individual toe.Gently probe the cat's ribs, belly, and neck. Your cat may scratch at first, but over time it will realize that you're not causing it any harm.;
, For many cats, being in the carrier means going to the vet. The stress and confusion of being in the vet's office may make some cats frightened by the mere sight of a cat carrier. However, if you can condition your cat to get comfortable with its carrier, it can make visits a little less stressful.Keep your cat carrier out in an easily-accessible area instead of storing it until your visits. Leave the door open so your cat can go in as often as it wants.
Try leaving your cat's food in the carrier. That way it will have to venture inside, and over time it may associate the carrier with the comforts of home.
Consider purchasing a cat carrier with a detachable lid. This can make the carrier feel less confining and easier to get into and out of.

, Car trips, in addition to cat carriers, may be one of the most stressful components of vet visits. If you don't take your cat to pleasant places in your car, it will inevitably come to associate your vehicle with going to the vet's office.Take your cat for short car rides lasting 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure your cat is safely stored inside a carrier in the car, as a loose cat can easily cause a traffic accident.
You can gradually increase your cat's time in the car by taking it to pleasant places. For example, you might drive with your cat to a friend or relative's house, then let your pet roam that person's house freely.
Offer your cat plenty of treats and praise when you take it for car rides. This can help make car trips less stressful and more comfortable.

, While virtually all veterinarians work with cats, not all vets go out of their way to make their offices more cat-friendly. Search around online or ask other friends with cats where to find cat-friendly veterinarians.Some veterinary offices have separate waiting rooms and exam rooms that are just for cats. This can make it less stressful for cats, as they won't see or hear any barking dogs.
Some vets will also use pheromone diffusers or sprays in their exam rooms. This can help calm your cat while your vet conducts the exam or procedure.
A good vet should try to comfort your cat before beginning the exam. If your vet immediately restrains your pet before even feeling out the situation, ask your vet to wait or consider finding a new vet.
If you're considering a new vet, call ahead and ask if they can make any accommodations for anxious cats.

, Being petted and played with can help calm your cat down. This level of calmness can help make your pet's transition to the stressful environment of the vet's office a bit easier.Start about one hour before your scheduled vet visit. This should give your cat enough time to properly calm down and relax before going to the vet.

, Many animals experience stomach problems when they're anxious. You can reduce the chances of this happening by skipping a meal before going to the vet.If you're going to the vet's office between meals, like in the afternoon, skip breakfast that morning.
Skipping a meal before the vet's visit can also increase your cat's appetite. This increases the chances that your cat will want treats at the vet, which you can use to calm your anxious pet.

, If your vet has previously prescribed your cat anti-anxiety medication, you can administer this to your cat before a vet visit. It can take a little while for this type of medication to affect your cat, so you may want to administer the medication about 30 to 60 minutes before your scheduled visit.Only give your cat medication that has been prescribed by your vet.
Check with your vet before your visit to make sure the medication won't affect your visit.

, The smells inside a vet's office are often overwhelming for pets. So many animals come through each day, including dogs (which your cat may be fearful of or completely ignorant of), that cats can easily get frightened or confused. You can reduce this by spraying the carrier with synthetic pheromones before and during your vet visit.Spray the pheromones on a towel, then use that towel to line your carrier. You can also drape a sprayed towel over your cat's carrier.
Bring more of the pheromones with you to the vet. That way, you can reapply it to your carrier as needed.
You can purchase synthetic cat pheromones online, or ask your vet about where to acquire these sprays.

, The sight of another animal, especially a dog, may make your cat nervous. If you cover the carrier with a blanket or towel, your cat will be less anxious, as it will not see the other animals in the waiting room.If you use synthetic cat pheromones, spray some on the blanket or towel you use to cover your cat's carrier.

, Animals can easily detect when humans are feeling anxious or upset. If your cat is fearful of vet visits, it may be helpful to speak in a soft, calming voice around your cat while you are at the vet's office and on the drive there., Treats are a great way to calm a pet and offer it reassurance. With your vet's permission, you can offer your cat tasty treats before and during the exam or procedure. You should also pet your cat and give it verbal praise during the exam or procedure to help it remain calm.Offer something your cat doesn't get on a regular basis. For example, many cats find bonito flakes or tuna to be delicious treats.
Be sure your cat has an appetite when you get to the vet's office. You can help encourage this by skipping your cat's meal before going to the vet.

, If your cat is prone to severe anxiety and/or lashes out when it's frightened, you may need to medicate your pet before bringing it to the vet.A variety of different types of medicine may be prescribed to your cat to reduce anxiety.Some commonly-prescribed medications include:


tricyclic antidepressants like Amitriptyline and Clomipramine
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, and Sertraline
azapirones like Buspirone
benzodiazepines like Alprazolam and Diazepam

, If your vet does not offer a cat-friendly waiting room and your pet is feeling overwhelmed, you may want to see if you can wait outside the office. Explain the situation and ask the receptionist at your vet's office if you can wait in the parking lot or in your car until the doctor is ready to see your cat., When you enter the exam room, your cat may still be frightened. Reaching into the carrier and grabbing your pet will only make this anxiety worse. The best approach is to open the carrier door (or take the roof off, if it detaches) and let your cat come out on its own when it feels comfortable.Your cat may wish to stay inside the carrier for the bulk of your visit. If this is usually the case, consider purchasing a carrier that has a removable top so your vet can conduct a check-up without having to take your cat out.

Buy raised food bowls.,
Put out extra litter boxes, water bowls, and cat beds.,
Put down floor coverings.,
Buy pet steps.",How to Make Daily Life Easier for a Mobility‐Impaired Cat1," To better accommodate your mobility-impaired cat, buy raised food bowls that stand about 4 to 6 inches off the floor. This will allow your cat to sit or stand to eat and avoid stretching downwards to reach their food. Look for bowls that are not too deep, which would force your cat to lean further to reach its food.Look for raised pet bowls at a local pet store, or online.;
, Reduced mobility means that your cat may have difficulty meeting its immediate needs, such as eliminating, hydrating, or resting comfortably. Purchase an extra litter box and place it on the opposite end of the house so that your cat does not have to trek a long distance to relieve itself. Buy extra beds and water bowls to place in different rooms of the house so that your cat has easy access to much needed hydration wherever it is., Tile, laminate, or hardwood floors can be slippery and difficult to navigate for your mobility-impaired cat. Consider installing cut pile carpeting or runners in your home to accommodate your cat, particularly in areas that it spends the most time around (e.g. the space surrounding its bed or food bowl). Avoid loop pile carpeting, which your cat might get its nails caught on., Help your mobility-impaired cat access tall places that it can no longer jump onto, like the couch or a favorite windowsill perch, buy purchasing pet steps. For additional comfort opt for padded pet steps, which are available online and in pet stores and come in different sizes to meet your needs. Most models of pet steps (whether padded, wooden, plastic, or metal) are portable and can be used in different spots of your home provided that the size fits."

Monitor your cat’s drinking habits.,
Pay attention to your cat’s eating habits to see if she has developed uremia.,
Check your cat’s mouth for ulcers.,
Look at your cat’s fur and mark any changes.,
Take note if your cat sleeps more than normal and seems to lack energy.,
See if your cat can lift her head above a horizontal position.,
Perform a ‘tent’ test to see if your cat is dehydrated.",How to Know if Your Cat Has Kidney Issues1," Cats are very efficient at conserving water and do not need to drink as often as other animals. Take note if you begin having to fill your cat’s water bowl more often than normal or have to clean out wet cat litter more frequently than you are used to. These things could mean that your cat has an increased thirst, which could be a sign of kidney problems. When kidney issues occur, nephrons in your cat’s body have a harder time absorbing water out of your cat’s blood. Your cat starts drinking more to compensate.Be aware that cats who are fed wet tinned food should drink little. Cats are actually able to retain a lot of their water from tinned food, so they drink less water.
Cats who are fed dry food are more likely to drink water often, as their dry food is dehydrated.;
, Uremia is a build-up of natural toxins in the blood that the kidney is supposed to filter out. When the kidney isn’t working right, those toxins stay in the blood.This can cause inflammation in the stomach that can lead your cat to:


Eat less or show disinterest in food.
Act nauseous and vomit.
Produce blood vomit if the inflammation has led to ulcers in the stomach.

, Uremia can also cause your cat to develop ulcers in her mouth. As stated above uremia can cause an inflammation and irritation in your cat’s stomach that can affect your cat’s mouth. The condition can lead to your cat having:


Sore gums, which makes her want to eat less.
Ulcers on her gums and tongue.
Trouble keeping her drool in the mouth, leading to foul-smelling saliva and drool.

, A cat with uremia will have a hard time grooming herself because she will feel pain when trying to lick her fur. This is because of the ulcers and sore gums that uremia causes. Look at your cat’s coat and note:


Fur becoming dull in color.
Fur becoming matted or unclean.
Unpleasant smelling fur.

, The kidney is involved in a complex cascade of hormones that stimulate your cat’s bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys produce less erythropoietin, a hormone necessary to stimulate blood cell synthesis. As a result, your cat’s body has a hard time replacing old and damaged blood cells, which leads to a condition called anemia. Signs of anemia include:


A lack of energy.
Sleeping more than normal.
Disinterest in toys and other things you cat likes.
Pale color in her eyelids (they should be pink but will instead look dull or white).

, A slightly bizarre sign that a cat has renal disease, and one that is unique to cats, is being unable to lift her head above the horizontal position. This happens because the kidney leaks potassium out into your cat’s urine. Potassium is an electrolyte that is necessary for muscle contraction and when blood levels are low, the cat's muscles become weak.Your cat's head is relatively very heavy compared to the rest of her body and requires a lot of muscular effort to hold it up. Cats with low potassium levels typically hang their heads.
However, it should be said that this is a rare sign, and if absent, doesn’t mean your cat does not have renal disease.

, As renal disease progresses, your cat’s ability to compensate for water lost via her urine is exceeded. This means that your cat, unable to drink enough to replace lost fluid, goes into a net loss situation and becomes dehydrated.


A good way to test for dehydration is to lift your cat's scruff away from her neck and let it go.
The skin of a fully hydrated animal drops back immediately. The skin of a dehydrated animal's ""tents"", that is it drops back down over several seconds.

Resist letting your cat outdoors.,
Create a good environment for your cat.,
Neuter your cat.",How to Keep Your Male Cat from Roaming1," You may feel that you are depriving a cat of something it enjoys by keeping it indoors. However, letting your male cat roam can actually expose them to risk of injury or death. The simplest way to keep your cat safe and prevent roaming is to always make sure they are kept indoors.Indoor cats live longer on average.
Indoor cats can still live happy and fulfilling lives.
You are actually providing a safer life for your cat by keeping them indoors.;
, Keeping your male cat indoors will help keep it safe and prevent it from roaming. However, you will still be responsible for making your home a protective and engaging space for your cat. By creating an ideal home for your cat you can rest easy, knowing that it is living a fulfilling and safe indoor life.Consider adding a “cat playground” to offer an engaging environment for your cat.
Always provide plenty of toys for your cat.
Offering healthy food, treats, and things like catnip can help keep your cat comfortable and satisfied.

, Male cats will often seek to venture outside in order to find a mate. Male cats may also contribute to the amount of strays or feral cats in the neighborhood. Neutering your male cat can reduce the desire to search for a mate and will also help prevent overpopulation in your neighborhood.Neutering your male cat will greatly reduce their urge to roam."
"
Brush your cat regularly.,
Remove and prevent mats.,
Use pet wipes.",How to Make Daily Life Easier for a Mobility‐Impaired Cat2," If your cat suffers from impaired mobility, it probably won't be able to groom itself as efficiently as a healthy cat would and will require some help. Brushing your cat daily will help to keep its coat healthy and free of mats, dirt, and debris. Use a slicker brush, which is suitable for both short haired and long haired cats, or a rubber grooming glove, which is gentler., In addition to regular brushing, be sure to remove any mats you find in your cat's coat. Instead of cutting them out, which can injure your cat's skin, tease the mats out slowly with a fine tooth comb. If you have a long haired cat, trim the hair around its bottom and hind legs to prevent hair from getting soiled and matted., If your pet's reduced mobility makes it difficult to bathe itself effectively, purchase non-toxic pet wipes to keep it fresh. Most pet wipes contain ingredients to condition your cat's coat (e.g. aloe) and help reduce dust and dander buildup. These disposable cloths can also be used to regularly clean stray litter or dust from your cat's paws."
"
Have your vet check your cat’s blood pressure regularly.,
Have your vet perform a urine test.,
Schedule a blood test for your cat to rule out other conditions.,
Talk to your vet about having a kidney biopsy done.",How to Know if Your Cat Has Kidney Issues2," Cats with kidney disease have a tendency to develop high blood pressure. Unfortunately, unless your cat's blood pressure is checked regularly by your veterinarian, you may not be aware there is a problem with her blood pressure, so it is a good idea to have her checked regularly.Sadly, high blood pressure can cause serious side effects, like sudden blindness and strokes. Luckily, if your vet checks your cat’s blood pressure regularly, he or she will be able to prescribe medication that can control your cat’s blood pressure.

, If your veterinarian is suspicious your cat has renal issues, he or she may request a urine sample. This sample is tested for specific gravity (SG) which is a measure of how weak or strong the urine is.Along with a urine test, a dipstick test rules out other causes of thirst such as diabetes mellitus.
A further urine test called a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC) helps distinguish dilute urine that is due to renal disease from other causes such as behaviorally driven thirst.

, Blood tests have a useful place in monitoring the progress of renal disease. Unfortunately, a normal blood panel does not mean the renal function is normal. This is because the kidney has a large reserve capacity and the kidney has to be more than 75% damaged before it will show any signs through a blood test.The main use of blood tests is to rule out other causes of increased thirst, such as infection, diabetes, or an overactive thyroid gland, and to monitor ongoing renal disease.

, Kidney biopsies are rarely performed because they can have serious and dangerous side effects, like blood clots and strokes. However, biopsy is important if renal cancer is suspected, because a definitive diagnosis can help decide if chemotherapy is an option or not.

Take your cat on walks.,
Note the time of day.,
Create a secure enclosure for your cat.",How to Keep Your Male Cat from Roaming2," Although it is more common to walk a dog, walking your cat can be a great way for you both to enjoy the outdoors and get some exercise. You will be able to find many different styles and models of harnesses and leashes that can securely and safely allow you to walk your cat. Try taking your cat on a walk to allow it supervised and safe outdoor time.Look at your local pet store for a properly sized harness and leash for your cat.
Start slowly to make sure your cat enjoys walking with you.

, There are certain hours in the day that are more or less dangerous for your cat to be outdoors. If you must let your cat outdoors to roam on its own, restrict that time to only mid-day hours. Letting your feline friend roam during this time of day will cut down on the risks that other times of day can expose them too.Early morning, evening, and night are the most dangerous times for your cat to be outdoors.
Your male cat may be more likely to fight other cats over their territory while outdoors during these times.

, Your cat can still enjoy time outdoors and be kept close by creating a safe enclosure for it. These enclosures are generally large cages that fully secure your cat in their outdoor environment. Your male cat will still be able to enjoy the fresh-air and sunshine while being kept safe and close to the home.There are many different sizes available for you to choose from.
You can build your own enclosure or buy one that is pre-made.

Avoid leaving food sources outside.,
Take away potential shelters.,
Make your property unappealing.",How to Keep Your Male Cat from Roaming3," Leaving out food is a major reason that stray cats will be attracted to your property. Cats may be seeking out garbage that they can access or may find a bird feeder to be an attractive hunting ground. By taking away food sources from stray or feral cats you will prevent them from roaming onto your property.Bird feeders might need to be removed if they are attracting other cats to your yard.
Always secure garbage in a bin that cats cannot access.
Never leave food out for strays.

, Outdoor cats will seek shelter and your property may be providing it. Any open spaces that a cat could fit into may be providing them protection from wind, rain, and extreme temperatures. Take a look around your property and look for any areas where you notice stray cats living in or areas that they may visit in the future.Check your house or garage for any holes that a cat could enter through.
Cats will often hide under open porches. Enclosing these spaces can keep cats away.

, Cats have definite preferences when it comes to the areas they enjoy roaming in. It may be the case that your property has many elements that are drawing stray cats in. These simple landscaping issues can be an easy and humane way to keep these feral cats away from your property and your male cat. Cover up dirt flower beds with stone to prevent strays from using them as a litter box.
Remove any plants that might be attracting cats such as catnip or mint.
Avoid having large bushy plants near your home.
Cats hate the scent of citrus. Try leaving orange peels in problem areas.

Purchase a memory foam pet bed.,
Maintain a comfortable temperature.,
Buy heated beds or warmers.",How to Make Daily Life Easier for a Mobility‐Impaired Cat3," Memory foam can provide comfort to cats with joint problems, circulation issues, or weak legs. Look for a cat bed made out of ordinary memory foam, or gel-infused memory foam for extra support. Look online or in pet stores for a cat bed or dog bed, for cats who enjoy having a roomier resting spot., Cold air can aggravate joint pain in cats, leading to pain and stiffness in already mobility-impaired cats. Refrain from turning off or significantly reducing the heat while you are out of the house. You can also provide warm spots for your cat to rest, like warm blankets or furniture moved into the sunlight, which will help soothe pain and improve flexibility. , While a comfortable temperature is good for mobility-impaired cats, direct heat is even more effective in terms of pain relief, improved flexibility, and comfort. Buy a heated or self-warming cat bed at a pet store or look for microwaveable bed warmers, which can be added to your cat's favorite resting spot to keep it warm. Heat can be especially beneficial for cats whose mobility is hindered by conditions like:Spinal injury
Arthritis
Hip dysplasia

See a vet as soon as possible about new lumps.,
Monitor seemingly innocuous lumps.,
Allow your vet to do tests.,
Agree to a biopsy.",How to Identify Lumps on Your Cat1," In general, you should have any lumps that last more than a week or two checked out by your vet. However, it’s worth noting that small lumps that are not growing, oozing anything, or bothering your cat are unlikely to be dangerous.If a lump appears suddenly and grows noticeably, take your cat to the vet at your earliest convenience.;
, Some lumps will be entirely harmless. For instance, hard tissue that forms at the site of an injury or after a surgery is most likely simply scar tissue. However, if a lump ever seems to bother your cat or seems infected, have it looked at right away., Your vet will likely be able to determine whether a particular lump is fluid-filled, such as an abscess, or is solid, such as a tumor or cyst. However, they will not be able to determine whether a tumor is harmless or dangerous without doing tests. They will likely need to use a needle or scalpel to remove a small amount of tissue from the lump and test it in a lab.Note that their initial tests will be quick, easy, and safe. They can likely be completed while your cat is awake, and will cause little to no pain.

, Your vet will recommend a biopsy if they are not able to determine the cause of a lump through initial tests. Your cat will be anesthetized so that part or all of the lump can be removed. This is worthwhile, as it allows your vet to get a definitive diagnosis on the cause of the lump."

Determine whether the cat has been fighting.,
Assess whether an ear lump is a haematoma.,
Have bursting cysts removed.,
Consider a potential food allergy.,
Rule out flea bites.",How to Identify Lumps on Your Cat2," Abscesses are a common type of lump that usually form a few days after a fight with another cat or dog. They are rather large and filled with fluid. If you notice your cat seems feverish or unwell and has a lump with a scab in the middle, it is likely an abscess.Abscesses are bacterial infections. While they are usually not too dangerous, it’s best to have a vet look at them. They can drain the fluid and prescribe your cat antibiotics to rid their body of infection.

, Blood can collect beneath the skin at the site of a minor injury. This will form a swollen, fluid-filled lump called a haematoma. Haematomas are common on cats that shake their head vigorously and damage the capillaries between the cartilage and skin of their ear.Haematomas will usually subside on their own, but larger ones may need to be drained by your vet.

, Cysts are infected hair follicles. If a lump appears suddenly but doesn’t change, and has a hair growing from its center, it may be a cyst. They can be left alone if they do not repeatedly get infected and continue to burst or bother your cat.If you're unsure, the safest option is having a vet check on a cyst and determine whether it should be removed.

, If you have recently changed the type of food you feed your cat and notice lumps on their head and neck, the lumps are likely evidence of an allergic reaction. Discontinue feeding them that food and see if the lumps subside.Lumps of this sort will be small, pale, and filled with fluid.
While the lumps themselves are not dangerous, your cat may hurt itself by scratching.

, If lumps are small, reddish, and slightly pointed, they are likely flea bites. They will usually be accompanied by scratching, and maybe hair loss. Talk to your vet about how to get rid of the fleas, and watch out for wounds on your cat’s skin where they are constantly licking and scratching."
"
Check your cat for tumors regularly.,
Recognize a benign tumor.,
Have any growing lump checked out.",How to Identify Lumps on Your Cat3," Check for lumps on your cat every month, and whenever their behavior changes. If a lump turns out to be a tumor, the sooner it is addressed, the better. Start by placing both of your hands on top of your cat’s head and petting them around their ears and beneath their neck. Then check their front legs, beneath the shoulders, and down their back and belly. Finally, feel their hips and back legs.Call your vet or set up an appointment to have any new lumps inspected.

, Tumors that are benign, meaning that they are not cancerous, will generally grow very slowly. You may notice one when it is still small, and may never even notice a change in size. Lumps from benign tumors will be rounded and firm. You may be able to move them around beneath the skin. The skin itself will not appear unhealthy.Benign tumors are generally not a risk to your cat, but it’s worth having a vet check it out.
Your vet will likely recommend removal of a tumor on a cat’s face or legs, even if it’s benign. Otherwise, they will likely recommend leaving a benign tumor alone.

, Malignant, cancerous tumors pose a risk to your cat and should be addressed immediately. Fortunately, they are also relatively easy to identify. Foremost, malignant tumors will seemingly appear suddenly, be surprisingly large, and will grow noticeably quickly. They may be an odd shape, and the skin above them may appear discolored or otherwise unhealthy.The cause of malignant tumors in cats is unknown, though they sometimes develop near the location where a cat received a vaccine or other injection.

Look and feel for swellings beneath the skin.,
Inspect the swelling for a breathing hole.,
Notice any empty cysts in your cat’s skin.,
Take your cat to a veterinarian.,
Anesthetize the cat.,
Draw the warble out using tweezers.,
Clean or flush the cyst.,
Ask your vet about antibiotics.,
Prevent your cat from going outside.,
Treat your cat with a parasiticide.,
Discourage rodents from living near your house.",How to Identify and Treat Warbles in Cats," Although warbles are not evident immediately after they enter a cat’s body, they can be seen and felt once they’ve formed a shallow burrow under your cat’s skin. These will look like small lumps to the naked eye. They’re also palpable: if you’re petting a cat and feel a small lump beneath its skin, you may have found a warble.Many species of Cuterebra live throughout North America. They reside primarily in southern Canada and throughout the United States, but botflies can also be found in Mexico and tropical regions of Central America.
If you live outside of these regions, it’s unlike that your cat has contracted a warble.;
, Once the warble makes a small burrow under your cat’s skin, it will puncture a tiny breathing hole. These are visible if you look closely. You’ll be able to see a very small hole in the middle of the raised bump. And, if the warble has grown inside of your cat and is almost ready to emerge, the breathing hole will also enlarge.Look for warbles around the head and neck of your cat. Although the warbles can burrow to other regions of a cat’s body and create their breathing holes there, they most often live in cats’ head and neck.

, If you didn’t notice the warble while it was living in your cat’s skin, you may find the empty cyst once the larva has pushed itself out. Cysts can easily become infected—especially if the cat has been scratching, licking, or gnawing at the warble—and can also turn into open abscesses in the cat’s flesh.The cyst is essentially a small open wound. Don’t fall under the misconception that the problem is “solved” if the warble has dropped out of your cat. You still need to take the animal to a veterinarian, who will clean the cyst and prescribe an antibiotic.

, Rather than attempting to remove the warble yourself, schedule a prompt appointment with your vet. A veterinary doctor will be able to confirm the diagnosis, and take the proper steps to both remove the warble from your cat’s flesh and cleanse the wound so that the cat does not risk infection.While warbles can have serious health consequences for your cat (including death, in the case of severe infection), they’re not considered a medical emergency.

, Depending on the depth of the warble, the veterinarian may need to fully anesthetize or sedate your cat. The vet will then surgically widen the warble’s breathing hole, in order to have better access to the larva inside.This process will need to be done in a sterile environment, without you in the room.

Alternately, if the cat is docile and the warble is near the surface of the skin, the cat may not need to be fully sedated. The vet may be able to use a local anesthetic only on the portion of the cat that contains the warble.

, Once the warble’s breathing hole in the cat’s skin is large enough for the vet to access, they’ll use a pair of sterile tweezers to reach inside and extract the full warble.The cat will not feel any pain during this process, since it will be unconscious or locally sedated.

It’s important that the veterinarian remove the entire warble from your cat’s flesh. If the warble rips in half and part stays in the cat’s skin, this can lead to serious infection or allergic reaction.

, Once the veterinarian has removed the warble, the cat will be left with an open cyst in its skin. The vet will either flush or wash this cyst out with water or an antiseptic, such as iodine or hydrogen peroxide.This will help prevent infection and remove any dirt or bacteria from the cat’s flesh.

If the cyst is large or deep, the vet may decide to bandage the wound, or even to sew it closed using a couple of stitches.

, Even once the warble has been removed and the cat’s cyst has been cleaned, there can still be a lingering risk of infection. Mention this to the veterinarian, and ask them if you can have an antibiotic prescription for your cat. They’ll likely prescribe pills to combat the risk of infection.Also ask the vet if you need to wash or rinse the cat’s cyst yourself in the upcoming days.

, This is the simplest solution: if your cat never goes outside, it will never be exposed to the warble in the first place. Keep doors and windows around your house or apartment shut, and use children’s gates or your legs and body to prevent your cat from sneaking outside when you open the front door.There are plenty of other reasons to keep your cats indoors: they won’t run the risk of being attacked by carnivorous wildlife or an aggressive dog; they won’t be hit by a car; and they won’t be stolen or get lost.

, A parasiticide is a specific type of insecticide, which specifically targets and kills parasites, such as botflies. These are commonly applied to your cat by dabbing onto the back of your cat’s neck. If you do choose to let your cat wander outside, speak with your veterinarian about finding an effective type of parasiticide for your cat.Medications found in specific brands of parasiticide include: fipronil (found in Frontline), ivermectin (found in Heartgard), selamectin (found in Revolution), and imidacloprid (found in Advantage).

, Cats technically contract warbles by “mistake”; botflies lay their larva near the openings of burrows where small rodents (mice, rats, voles, rabbits, etc.) live, to allow the warbles to crawl inside these rodents. If cats are poking around rodent holes, they can easily contract the warbles as well. So, if you decrease the rodent population around your house or apartment, your cat will have fewer opportunities to contract warbles.You could place mousetraps or rat traps around the opening to rodent burrows near your house, or call a rodent exterminator.
Although an exterminator may not be able to remove all rodents from with a ½-mile (0.8-kilometer) radius around your house, they could at least give you some tips about where rodents are most likely to build their burrows

Schedule playtime.,
Buy some catnip.,
Roll out balls.,
Point a laser or flashlight.,
Drag string across the floor.,
Use a cat wand to play with your cat.,
Rotate toys to keep your cat’s interest.",How to Keep an Indoor Cat Active1," Your cat should be able to have at least ten to fifteen minutes of exercise each day. Playing with your cat will not only ensure that they get the proper exercise but it will help socialize them as well. It is important for you to interact with your cat as indoor cats do not have as many opportunities to socialize with other animals and people.Older cats will be harder to entertain for a long time so consider breaking up the play time throughout the day. For example, you could have five minutes of play before your cat's breakfast in the morning, five minutes of play after work/school, and five minutes of play before bed.;
, Catnip is a plant that causes energetic frenzies in some cats. You can buy a potted catnip plant, and sprinkle its leaves inside a ball, cardboard tube, or felted toy to entice your cat. You can also buy spray from the pet store and coat their toys in it.


Catnip is safe for cats, but some cats can get aggressive when exposed to it.Cats are usually affected by catnip for ten minute periods. After this point, they may need up to two hours before catnip will have the same effect again., Balls are great fun for cats. Your cat may bat, chase, and pounce on a ball, giving them plenty of exercise. You can have several small balls for your cat to play with. Different types of balls can keep your cat interested for a long time.


Some balls have a small space inside for treats or catnip. Your cat will work extra hard getting the treat out.
You can fold small paper balls for your cat. Simply scrunch up a small piece of paper or tissue. You can fasten it with sticky tape if you want. One standard sized tissue is the perfect size for a ball. Avoid making them too big as it won't roll as fast at the end as well.
You can spray a ball with a catnip if you want to encourage your cat to play with.

, Cats are attracted to moving points of light. Direct a laser pointer or flashlight against the wall. You can simply wave it around and your cat may chase after it.You may not want to do this in area where you have delicate or breakable items. Never direct the light against anything valuable, such as a TV or a vase.


Flashlights may work better in the dark where laser points will be effective in the light.
Do not shine a light or laser into your cat's eyes or you could damage their vision.
When you are ready to put away the laser, finish the game by pointing the laser at a crumpled up piece of paper or a ball so your cat can pounce on it. Otherwise, your cat might get frustrated or stressed by not having caught the laser. Turn off the laser as your cat pounces on the object.

, Ribbons, strings, and cords can be slowly dragged across the ground. Your cat will try to pounce on the end, or they may try to engage you in tug of war. If your cat does not seem interested at first, try wiggling the string or gently thumping it against the ground. Your cat may suddenly take notice and try to hunt the string.


You can also drag the string behind you as you walk across the room.Always put away any loose string or ribbon after you are done playing. If your cat swallows it, it can cause intestinal blockage., A popular cat toy is a wand with a string attached to one end. Dangling at the end of the string might be a mouse toy, some feathers, or another object.


Your cat may try to hunt this object. Slowly drag the string across the ground to get your cat to pounce on it or grab it.
You can also lift the toy in the air and swing it gently in front of your cat’s face (making sure not to hit them). Your cat may try to jump at the toy and wrestle it away.
You may also try tickling your cat on the stomach with the wand. If they roll over and expose their belly, gently bounce the dangling toy off their stomach., Cats can get bored of toys after a few days. If you want to keep your cat active without constantly buying new toys, you can put some toys away and put other toys out. Once your cat gets bored of these other toys, you can bring the old toys back out. Your cat may think they're brand new."

Play with your cat daily.,
Walk your cat.,
Watch your cat’s weight.",How to Keep a Cat's Mind Active1," Cats thrive on routine, and physical activity is strongly linked to good mental health. By making play an important part of your cat’s daily routine, you increase the chances of them staying active later in life. Keep your cat physically active and mentally engaged from the time they are a kitten.Aim to play with your cat for 30 minutes, ideally at the same time each day.You might try:


Dangling some string.
Tossing jingly balls for your cat to chase.
Dragging a ribbon on the floor.;
, An unorthodox, but effective, option is to walk your cat outdoors on a leash. This provides your cat with quality exercise, while stimulating their visual, olfactory, and aural senses. Although some cats will not cooperate with leash-walking, others take it to it very well. Try putting a harness on your cat and taking them for a walk!If you can is unwilling to walk, don't force them.
If you cat grips the ground, meows incessantly, or seems otherwise stressed, bring your cat back inside and try again another day.

, Overweight cats are less likely to engage in both mental and physical stimulation as they get older. As such, it is crucial to try and keep your cat at a healthy weight. To encourage exercise and problem-solving at the same time, try placing their food bowl at the top of the stairs or at the top of a cat tree.Always select the food appropriate for your cat's age. Your vet can help you decide.
For every 8 lbs. of a cat's weight, they should eat 4/5 of a cup of dry food per day.

Provide plenty of space for your cat.,
Set up a cat tree or scratching post.,
Leave a paper bag or box out.,
Build an outdoor enclosure.,
Consider adopting another cat.",How to Keep an Indoor Cat Active2," Cats need space to walk, climb, and explore. Your cat should have access to multiple rooms within your home. They should also have plenty of scratching posts and toys available to them in these rooms. This will give your cat room to exercise while encouraging them to play.Cat condos, perches, and climbing trees can help provide extra space for your kitty in tight quarters. These give your cat multiple platforms at varying heights to jump and climb on., Cat trees help satisfy two urges for cats: climbing and scratching. Both of these activities help the cat strengthen their muscles and stay active.A good cat tree will have platforms, hiding holes, and sturdy posts which the cat can scratch. It should be tall enough that your cat can fully stretch while scratching.If your scratching post has several tiers, you should put it in a central location where your cat can watch the daily activity of the household or look outside. This will encourage your cat to climb the cat tree.You should have several smaller scratching posts in most rooms around your home. This will help prevent your cat from scratching furniture while strengthening their muscles.

, Cats love to hide and climb into things. Cardboard boxes and paper bags, such as the kind given at grocery store, will let your cat hide, jump, and play. You can add some catnip inside and watch your cat chase it around the room.


Remove the handles from a paper bag first so your cat does not get stuck in them.Do not use plastic bags. These can suffocate your cat.

, While your cat may live indoors, they may enjoy sitting outside in a protected environment. An outdoor enclosure allows the cat to play outside in the fresh air and sunlight without risking an escape or injury. Look for one with screen walls and a stable roof.You can buy outdoor enclosures online and occasionally in pet stores. Alternatively, you can build your own. Some websites sell do-it-yourself-kits.
If you do not have a yard or room for a full enclosure, you may also consider a window box.
Some people add tunnels or perches to their enclosures to encourage their cat to run and jump.

, Cats can play with each other, boosting their social interaction skills and providing them an important outlet of exercise. If you only have one cat, you might want to think about whether or not you can take in another one.Think about your lifestyle. Do you have enough room for another cat? Can you afford another cat? You might also want to consider your cat’s feelings. Does your cat do well with other animals? Do you think they would appreciate another pet?
Young cats may get along better with one another than older cats.

Introduce a companion.,
Give them something to watch.,
Create an obstacle course.",How to Keep a Cat's Mind Active2," Bringing a new, younger cat or dog into your home is an excellent way to keep your cat’s mind active. Experts say that introducing a young animal into your home works to “turn back the clock” for older cats.If the new pet is another cat, you’ll want the new cat to be:


Younger.
Smaller.
The opposite gender.
Fixed.

, You can provide visual stimulation for your cat by creating “kitty TV.” Place bird feeders and/or bird baths outside your window where your cat can get a good view. This entertains your cat and provides excellent mental stimulation., Set up cat trees, paper bags, cardboard boxes, scratching posts, and anything else your cat might enjoy to create a interesting landscape for your cat to explore. Try doing this once a week as a special treat for your cat."

Try food puzzles.,
Start out easy.,
Make DIY puzzles.",How to Keep a Cat's Mind Active3," A recent study in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery has shown that using “food puzzles” to nurture cats’ natural hunting behaviors helps alleviate a wide host of mental, emotional, and behavioral issues in indoor cats. These contraptions--usually constructed of plastic or cardboard-- challenge cats to figure out how to get food and treats. Try using these to keep your cat’s mind active!Food puzzles can be purchased at pet stores or online.
Food puzzles can be easily homemade.
Food puzzles come in range of sizes, styles, and levels of difficulty.

, In order to get your cat interested in food puzzles, it is important for them to experience success early on. Start out using simple, see-through food puzzles, and keep them more than half full. It may also help to sprinkle some cat food around the puzzle to pique your cat’s interest, and encourage an association between the puzzle and food.Over time, you will need to increase the difficulty of the puzzles to keep your cat interested.
You can try puzzles with smaller holes or different shapes.
You can place them in more obscure areas of your house.
If your cat is a master, you can try difficult two-part puzzles.

, Although many food puzzle options exists in stores, these games can also be easily constructed at home. All you really need is a container that can contain dry food or treats.


Select a container, such as a shoebox, plastic water bottle, paper towel roll, or egg carton.
Use an X-Acto knife to cut holes into these objects. Either make holes large enough for your cat to insert a paw, or just large enough for food to fall through (particularly with toys that can roll).
Fill the container with food.
Seal any open edges with tape (optional).

They may be inattentive to their kittens and not feed them. They may start acting lethargic or depressed. In some cases, they can even become aggressive., Milk fever may cause cats to be restless or nervous. They may seem agitated and unable to sit still. This may lead to excessive pacing. They may also start whining or panting., Some cats develop muscular symptoms with eclampsia. They may have trouble walking, or start stumbling or tripping. Their gait may be stiff and awkward. Cats may also be disoriented and not know where they are and run into things.The cat may start having tremors and having convulsions.
In some cats, their body may become stuff. They may lie with their limbs stiff and rigid.

, In some cats, they may start vomiting once they develop eclampsia. They may also have diarrhea. In many cases, they stop eating.

, Cats with eclampsia may run a high fever. They may have dilated pupils or start scratching their face a lot because it is itchy., Eclampsia occurs most commonly in nursing cats, but can also happen to pregnant cats. Usually, the condition occurs between two to six weeks after the birth of the litter. However, it can occur outside of this time frame. It occurs most often with a first time litter.If the cat received poor nutrition during or after the pregnancy, she is at a higher risk for eclampsia.

, Once you start to notice that your cat displays any of these symptoms, take her to the vet immediately. Eclampsia is a serious condition that needs to be treated immediately to avoid the death of the cat. Your vet will give your cat a physical examination.The vet may want to know details about your cat’s diet during and after pregnancy and any supplements she’s been given.

, If the vet suspects eclampsia, they will do a biochemical profile to check blood calcium levels. Low calcium in the blood leads to a positive diagnosis. The vet may also look for low blood sugar.Magnesium levels may also be checked.

, The most common treatment for eclampsia is for the vet to give the cat calcium intravenously to help slowly raise the blood calcium levels. The cat will stay at the vet during this procedure. The vet will monitor the calcium blood levels closely to make sure the cat doesn’t get too much calcium in the blood.Vitamin D may also be given to help the cat absorb the calcium.

, If the cat’s condition has progressed to muscle spasms and seizures, the vet may provide them with anti-seizure drugs to help with the seizures and tetany.This will be given while at the vet to stabilize the cat before they are given calcium supplements.

, If the cat has a high fever, the vet will work to try to bring that down. They may try to cool her with a fan to lower her body temperature. They may also cover the cat with cool damp cloths.

, While the mother is being treated, the kittens will have to be hand fed. Talk with the vet about whether or not the kittens can return to nursing normally after the mother has recovered. If the vet says it is okay, the mother’s blood calcium level will be monitored as the kittens nurse.If the vet thinks the mother shouldn’t nurse anymore, they will recommend weaning the kittens.

, After the cat has been treated, the vet will more than likely prescribe calcium supplements for you to continue giving the cat at home as follow-up care. Follow the vet's instructions for the supplements. This is generally the only aftercare since getting treated by the vet generally cures eclampsia.Don’t give the cat calcium supplements without a vet’s approval. Calcium supplements during pregnancy can mess up her ability to absorb it, which can lead to eclampsia. Calcium supplements after pregnancy can also be dangerous.

In connection with this symptom, your cat may begin to go outside the litter box rather than in.In particular, try to see if your cat gets up more at night than usual.;
, Another symptom of kidney disease is increased thirst. Because your cat is peeing more, it needs to drink more to replace the lost water. Therefore, if you notice you are refilling the bowl more often, that could be another symptom., When kidney disease begins to take hold of your cat, it may decide it's not as hungry. In turn, that means your cat will lose weight over time. If you notice your cat getting lighter, that could be another symptom of the disease., ""Lazy cat"" is a common idiom for a reason. Cats sleep a large portion of their day, up to 16 hours or more. However, you know how much your cat sleeps and plays. If you begin to notice a decrease in energy, that could also be a sign of this disease.In more severe stages, the cat may not want to move much at all, and it may sit hunched-over at times., With kidney disease, your cat's coat may become less vibrant over time. In particular, it may become drier to the touch, which can also make it look duller. While this can also be a symptom of other problems, as many of these symptoms are, it can indicate kidney disease., Several symptoms can creep up in the mouth. For example, your cat's tongue may change color, turning a more brownish color. You may also notice that your cat develops ulcers on the cheeks and tongue. A third symptom associated with the mouth is especially bad breath. Of course, your cat's breath probably always smells fairly bad (fish breath!), but if it develops a particularly foul odor, that could also be a sign., Your cat may start showing symptoms in both its urine and feces. The urine may turn cloudy, which can be hard to spot in litter. However, it may also contain blood, which should be easier to spot. Also, make sure your cat is defecating regularly, as constipation can be an indicator. The opposite, diarrhea, can also be a problem., Most cats vomit from time to time, but pay attention if your cat suddenly has an increase in vomiting.However, not every cat has this symptom, so keep looking for other symptoms even if you don't notice this one., If the symptoms come on slowly, that is more likely to be the chronic form of the disease. If the symptoms appear quite suddenly, that's more likely to be the acute form of the disease., The main difference between most early signs and late signs of kidney disease is the severity of the symptom. Therefore, you may not notice it when it is first beginning because symptoms, like increased thirst, are mild.Therefore, if you suspect your cat may have this disease, it's important to take it to the vet right away, as your vet will be able to run tests to help with diagnosis., This disease can stay hidden for a long time. While certain symptoms are common to this disease, your cat may not exhibit any of them in the early stages. Therefore, it is often difficult to spot the disease early on., Chronic kidney disease is usually caused by an underlying condition, but sometimes, your vet may not know what the condition is. However, some common causes are urinary tract blockages, advanced dental disease, and kidney inflammation.Some other conditions that could lead to chronic kidney disease include thyroid issues and high blood pressure, as well as cancer., It is believed that chronic kidney disease can be passed down genetically from generation to generation in cats. Therefore, if you happen to know the parent of your cat suffered from the disease, your cat has a higher chance of developing it.Also, some breeds may be more likely to develop the disease, such as British shorthairs, Persians, and Himalayans.

, When a cat has dental problems, you may think it's confined to its mouth. However, dental disease in cats often leads to systematic problems, which in turn can cause kidney disease. Therefore, if your cat has suffered from dental disease, make sure to watch closely for signs of kidney disease., While you may not be able to spot as many symptoms early on, your vet is trained to look for signs you likely won't notice. Therefore, take your cat in at least once a year. Twice is better, particularly if you have an older cat."

Hide food around the house.,
Bribe your cat into doing jumps.,
Leash train your cat.,
Ask your vet about cat treadmills.",How to Keep an Indoor Cat Active3," You can hide your cat’s food in small portions around the house. This will encourage your cat to walk around the house hunting for their food. Not only will this give your cat some extra movement, but it can help encourage overweight cats to start a more active routine., Jumping is a great exercise for your cat. If your cat does not respond to normal toys, you can use treats to entice them into jumping. They might leap high into the air or on the back of the sofa. Just be sure to reward them with the treat after a few minutes of play.

, Some cats can be trained to walk outside on a leash and harness. While training works better on young cats, you may have success teaching an older cat how to walk outside. Start slow when leash training your cat. Let your cat get used to wearing a harness before you try taking them outside. Your first sessions may only last a few minutes, but your cat may learn after a while.


You may find it more successful to train your cat on a leash inside for a few sessions before going outside.If your cat is lying down, shaking, or yowling during the walk, they may be overwhelmed or scared. Return home. You might try again in a few days.You may not need to take your cat on a long walk. Sitting outside with your cat on a leash may be enough to encourage physical activity. They might play with leaves, explore their surroundings, or scratch on a tree.
Not all cats can be leash trained.

, If your cat is overweight or obese, they may not be able to jump or walk without putting pressure on their joints. Underwater treadmills allow your cat to exercise without injuring them. If your cat needs extreme weight control, ask your vet if this type of therapy is an option."

Watch out for nasal discharge.,
Pay attention to any sneezing.,
Identify the cause of nasal congestion.",How to Help Your Cat Breathe Easier1," Runny noses are common in cats. If your cat has some nasal discharge around her nose, it may be mucus or muco-purulent, which is mucus stained with pus. These sorts of mucus are often yellow or green in color.Some cats with nasal allergies may have a clear, dripping discharge from their nostrils, but this can be difficult to spot if the cat regularly licks it away.
If you see nasal discharge, look closely to see if it comes from one, or both nostrils. A bilateral discharge (from both sides) is more likely to be caused by an infection or allergy, while a unilateral (one sided) drip could be caused by a foreign body, or infection in one side of the nose.;
, When people have a blocked nose, we give it a good blow on a handkerchief. Cats, however, cannot do this and their way to clear their nose is to sneeze.If you notice that your cat sneezes a lot, you will need to schedule an appointment with your vet to determine the cause. It might be allergies or an infection, but your veterinarian will have to test your cat’s mucus to be sure.

, Cats often suffer from nasal congestion because of rhinitis (inflammation in the nasal passages that produces mucus), infection (including viral conditions such as cat flu) and because of inhaled foreign bodies (such as a grass awn that shot up the nose when the cat sniffed at it).The most common cause of nasal and sinus congestion are viral infections. These viruses include feline herpesvirus (FVR) and feline calicivirus (FCV). These infections also cause swollen, red, and runny eyes along with mouth ulcers and salivation.You can help protect your cat from these viruses by keeping your cat’s vaccinations up-to-date and keeping your cats away from any cats that seem sick. The recurrent viral illnesses in cats suppress your cats immune system so that secondary, opportunistic and very damaging bacteria invade the area and cause more severe disease, discharge, and lack of appetite. Realize also that many times your kitty has 'cleared' the viral illness, but the more 'difficult to clear' bacterial invaders remain. This is why it is vital that you have your pet checked by a licensed veterinarian if any of the above symptoms occur.
These conditions cause breathing difficulties because of the mucus that builds up in your cat’s nose. Just like people with a heavy cold, the mucus blocks the nasal passageways and makes it difficult to breath.

"
"
Measure your cat’s respiratory rate.,
Look for labored breathing.,
Watch out for the “air hunger” position.,
Identify any signs of distress.,
Pay attention to your cat if she is panting.",How to Help Your Cat Breathe Easier2," The number of breathes a cat takes each minute is called the respiratory rate. The normal respiratory rate for cat is between 20 to 30 breaths per minute. Both the rate (number of breaths) and how the cat breaths can indicate if she has a problem.


There is a certain amount of leeway in the normal respiratory rate range, for instance a cat taking 32 breaths a minute, who is otherwise perfectly well, is not considered abnormal. You should, however, become concerned if you notice that your cat’s breathing rate is around 35 to 40 breaths per minute, or if her breathing is labored.

, A cat’s normal breathing movements are subtle and difficult to spot, so there may be a problem if your cat seem to be working hard to draw breath. Labored breathing means that your cat must make exaggerated movements with her chest or abdomen in order to suck in or push out air.To determine if your cat is breathing normally, it is best to fix your gaze on one spot (perhaps a whorl of fur on her chest) and watch as it moves slowly up and down.
Her belly muscles should not be involved in filling her chest with air. If her tummy expands and contracts as she breaths, this is abnormal. If her chest ""heaves"" and makes exaggerated, easy to see, in-out breathing movements, or her belly moves in as she breathes, this is abnormal.

, A cat with breathing difficulties usually adopts the ""air hunger"" position. She sits or lies with her elbows held away from her body, her head and neck extended as if to straighten her windpipe.A cat in this position may also open her mouth and begin to pant.

, A cat with breathing difficulties may feel distressed. In order to determine if your cat is distressed, look at her facial expression. She may look anxious, with the corners of her mouth drawn back in a grimace. Some other signs of distress include:dilated pupils
ears flattened
whiskers back
acting aggressive when approached
tail close to body

, Cats may pant after exercising in order to cool themselves down, but panting at rest is not normal for a cat. If your cat pants often when resting, seek veterinary advice because this may be a sign of breathing problems.Cats may also pant when they are anxious or frightened, so consider your cat’s environment as well.

Talk to your vet about putting your cat on antibiotics.,
Use steam therapy.,
Keep your cat’s nose clean.,
Ask your vet to prescribe a mucolytic drug.",How to Help Your Cat Breathe Easier3," If your cat shows signs of an infection (yellow or green mucus from the nose) then talk to your veterinarian about whether or not your cat needs a prescription for antibiotics.If the vet suspects the infection is viral then antibiotics may be of no help. Likewise, if antibiotics are prescribed, it may take four to five days before the infection improves, so in the meantime you can help to ease your cat's breathing in other ways.

, The warm, moist vapor of steam helps to loosen up mucus and makes it easier to sneeze out. Obviously, you cannot put a cat's head over a bowl of boiling water because if she panics and knocks the bowl you will both be put in danger. Instead, use a steamy room to help clear up your cat’s congestion. To do this:Take the cat into the bathroom and shut the door. Switch the shower onto hot and draw the shower screen so that there is a solid barrier between the cat and the hot water.
Sit in the steamy atmosphere for 10 minutes at a time. If you can do this two to three times a day, your cat should be able to breathe a little easier.

, This may sound obvious but if the cat's nose is stuffed up or dirty, clean it. Hold a cotton ball under the faucet and then use the wet cotton ball to wash your cat’s nose. Work away any dried mucus that may be encrusted on your cat’s nose.


If the cat has a heavy nasal discharge then wiping the nose regularly can really help make your cat more comfortable.

, Some mucus is so thick and tacky that it sits like glue inside the nasal chambers and make it impossible for the cat to breathe through her nose. In cases like this your vet may prescribe a ""mucolytic"".


This is a drug, such as Bisolvin, which breaks down mucus and helps it to liquefy. The active ingredient in Bisolvin is bromhexine. When the mucus thins, your cat will have an easier time sneezing it out.
Bisolvin comes in 5 gram (g) sachets and can be mixed in food once or twice a day. The dose for a cat is 0.5 g per 5 kg of body weight. This translates as a ""generous pinch"" from the sachet, once or twice a day on food. "
"
Bring your cat to the vet for diagnosis and treatment.,
Know that breathing difficulties may be caused by pneumonia.,
Understand that heart disease is a possible cause.,
Be aware that lung disease can cause breathing difficulties.,
Consider whether lungworms may be causing your cat’s breathing problems.,
Realize that tumors may lead to breathing difficulties.,
Know that pleural effusion can cause breathing difficulties.",How to Help Your Cat Breathe Easier4," Chest problems include infections, pneumonia, heart disease, lung disease, tumors, and fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion). These conditions need to be treated by a veterinarian.


If you think your cat has chest congestion, do not try home remedies; delaying your cat’s visit to the vet may only make her condition worse., Pneumonia is a serious lung infection. Toxins from bacteria and viruses cause inflammation in the lungs and may also cause discharge to collect in the lungs. When this occurs, the oxygen exchange in your cat’s lungs slows down, forcing your cat to work harder to breathe.


Intense antibiotics are generally prescribed to treat pneumonia. If your cat is very sick, she may also need supportive care, such as intravenous fluids or an oxygen tent., A diseased heart is inefficient at pumping blood around the body. Shifts in blood pressure in the lungs allow fluid to leak out of the blood vessels and into lung tissue. Just like with pneumonia, this reduces the ability of the lungs to exchange oxygen, which may cause your cat to become breathless.


If heart disease is to blame for your cat’s difficulty breathing, your veterinarian will try to determine the type of heart disease and prescribe the right medications. Cats often require oxygen therapy to help stabilize them before any type of medicine or other treatments can be administered., Lung diseases include conditions such as asthma, where the airways constrict and create resistance to air moving in and out of the lungs. This condition is similar to bronchitis, another lung disease, where the airways are very stiff, the walls become thickened and oxygen exchange is blocked. Asthma may affect allergen-sensitive cats breathing in allergens.For asthma, many cats are prescribed corticosteroids, either by a depot inject or in oral tablet form. Steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory medications that work to reduce inflammation in your cat’s airways. However, salbutamol inhalers are also available for asthmatic cats – if the cat tolerates the face mask.
Bronchitis is also treated either with steroids, or a bronchodilator, which is a drug that stimulates the stiff airways to open up.

, Lungworms are parasites that can interfere with your cat’s breathing and may go undetected for long periods of time. Severe lungworm infections can cause nasal discharge, coughing, weight loss, and pneumonia.Lungworms can be treated with anti-parasite drugs such as ivermectin or fenbendazole.

, Lung tumors or tumors in the chest that are compressing the lungs can decrease the amount of working lung tissue. When lung tissue availability is decreased, your cat may become breathless or develop labored breathing.


Tumors take up space in the chest and compress the lungs or major blood vessels. Solitary tumors may be surgically removed, but on the whole the outlook for a cat with lung tumors is poor. Talk to your vet about options., Pleural effusion is the gathering of fluids around the lungs. This can happen if your cat has kidney disease, an infection, or if your cat has a tumor in her chest that is leaking fluid.This fluid can put pressure on your cat’s lungs, which in turn cause them to collapse. Because of this, they cannot expand fully, making your cat feel short of breath.
If your cat is having great difficulty breathing, the veterinarian may drain the fluid off using a special thoracic needle. Removing the fluid allows the lungs to re-inflate and gives temporary relief. However, the fluid will return unless the underlying problem is treated.

Check for face irregularities.,
Look for a split in the roof of the mouth.,
Monitor for any respiratory problems.,
Notice any problems eating.",How to Help a Harelipped Kitten Thrive1," If your kitten has a harelip, the teeth and gums may be showing on the upper part of the mouth. One of the kitten’s nostrils may be misshapen, especially if it is connected to a deformed upper lip.This should be apparent at birth.;
, Harelips often occur with cleft palates. A cleft palate can be easily seen. Look inside the kitten’s mouth. The kitten has a cleft palate if there is a split in the roof of the mouth.The hole may be small or large. Look for a circular opening in the middle of the roof of the mouth.

, Harelips and cleft palates may cause respiratory problems. The kitten may sneeze, cough, gag, or make snuffling sounds often. You may need to watch the kitten closely for a while to see if they exhibit any respiratory problems.They may also cough, gag, snort or sneeze when they eat or drink.

, Harelips cause kittens to have trouble eating or drinking water. They may not be able to feed properly because the harelip makes it so they can't attach to the nipple and get any suction. This causes them to not get the food they need to grow. This can lead to stunted growth and lower weights.They may also end up with fluid in their nose while feeding. This may present as a runny nose. This can lead to pneumonia or death.

"

Take the kitten to the vet.,
Feed the kitten with a feeding tube.,
Feed the kitten with a long nipple.,
Give the kitten water with an overhead dispenser.,
Keep the kitten with the litter.",How to Help a Harelipped Kitten Thrive2," If you suspect the kitten has a harelip or cleft palate, you should take them to the vet. The vet will do a physical exam to determine if the kitten has an oral defect.The problems it causes with eating can make the kitten have poor health, and it also can cause death if the cat gets pneumonia or has other problems from food getting into the nose. Getting this condition fixed will help the kitten survive.

, To help the kitten thrive, you should alter the way you feed them. The defect makes it difficult to swallow normally, so a feeding tube can help them eat more safely. Your vet may place a feeding tube into the kitten’s neck or stomach so they can be fed. The vet may explain to you how to use a feeding tube yourself.To use a feeding tube, you will lubricate it and carefully slide it into the kitten's mouth and down into the esophagus. There should be a line letting you know how deep to go into the kitten's throat. Then, you will use a syringe to feed the kitten.The feeding tube will probably be used for three to four months.
This allows the kitten to receive the nutrients they need to grow and gain weight.

, Kittens with harelips that can suckle may be fed using a bottle with an elongated long nipple. This special nipple deposits the formula farther into the mouth, past the palate.This special feeding bottle can be obtained from your vet, who can also show you the proper way to use it.

, To make sure your kitten gets water, use an overhead dispenser. This will help the kitten swallow the water instead of getting it pushed up through the hole in their palate.An overhead dispenser can be purchased online and at pet stores.

, Though your kitten may have a harelip, they should remain with their litter most of the time. This ensures they are properly socialized. You may want to keep a close eye on them to begin with and around feeding time to make sure they are not trying to nurse from the mother cat, since that can lead to problems. Feed the kitten from the nipple or feeding tube around the same time the kittens are nursing.If your kitten has a feeding tube, you should talk to your vet about strategies to keep the tube safe from the other kittens.

"
"
Have the vet perform surgery.,
Treat any infections with antibiotics.,
Monitor the kitten after the surgery.",How to Help a Harelipped Kitten Thrive3," The most common way to fix a harelip or cleft palate is to undergo surgery. The vet will repair the defects and fix the soft palate. This surgery should happen as soon as possible to ensure that your kitten thrives. Surgery on the soft palate occurs after your kitten is three months old, and surgery on the hard palate is usually after six months.The vet will close the hard and soft palate, which may take two different surgeries.
If the defect is too bad, the vet may suggest euthanasia.

, If the kitten has developed pneumonia, sinusitis, or another secondary infection, the vet will prescribe antibiotics. These antibiotics will clear up the infection. You must monitor the kitten during this time to make sure they don’t have any complications from the infection.For example, you want to make sure the cat can breathe and doesn’t develop any additional breathing problems.

, The kitten will need to be monitored closely after the surgery to ensure they heal and thrive. The kitten may have to eat through a feeding tube at first, but then will have to eat soft food for a few weeks.The kitten will need to wear an e-collar for a few days to keep them from touching their face.
No hard toys or food should be given to the kitten for weeks after the surgery. Wait until the vet gives the okay for the kitten to put hard objects in their mouth.

Consult a vet if problems continue.,
Take the cat to the vet immediately if necessary.,
Give medications as necessary.,
Don’t give your cat human medications.",How to Help a Sick Cat1," When your cat is not feeling well, it may require extra attention. A sick cat might need special food, to have its litter box cleaned more frequently, help moving around, etc. Caring for your cat in this way and being patient with it can comfort it.If your cat wants rest or to be left alone, honor its wishes. Do keep an eye on it, however, to monitor its condition and make sure it improves.
A warm bed can make a sick cat more comfortable.Moving your cat’s litter box closer to it while resting can also make its life easier.;
, Many cats enjoy being groomed, at least occasionally. If yours is not feeling well, it may appreciate the attention. Grooming your cat also provides an opportunity to inspect your cat’s fur and skin. Their condition can often indicate whether or not your cat is well., Generally, you can feed your cat any kind of food that is nutritionally balanced and formulated for felines. If your cat is sick and seems reluctant to eat, you can offer it maintenance food, which is formulated to be especially palatable. Maintenance food is generally canned, and should be available at pet supply stores or wherever cat food is sold.Normally, you can feed your cat either wet or dry food according to its preference.
If you want to ensure quality, you can look for cat food that is certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).
If your cat is reluctant to eat, you can warm its food first, offer its favorites, or try giving it small portions. If it still does not want to eat after 24 hours, contact a vet., Cats, like humans, are susceptible to a number of diseases, pains, and other conditions. Since you can’t know directly how your cat is feeling, you will have to look for various signs that can indicate a problem. These may include:Decreased appetite
Vomiting or diarrhea
Swollen abdomen
Loss of hair
Dull or patchy coat
Flaking or scabs
Bad odors or breath
Unexplained lumps
Discharge from eyes or nose
Red, watery eyes
Difficulty moving
Red gums
Drooling
Frequent sneezing
Unusual vocalization
Change in social habits
Reluctance to groom
Sudden decrease in sleep time

, If your cat shows any worrisome signs, keep a close watch on it. If the symptoms do not improve within 24 to 48 hours, contact a vet. Lingering problems can indicate a serious condition that requires professional attention., In some cases, your cat may display symptoms that are severe enough to warrant consulting a vet right away. Warning signs include:Inability to urinate
Blood in urine
Swollen abdomen
Excessive vomiting or diarrhea
Seizures

, If a vet prescribes medication for your cat, get it right away. Give your cat the medication according to the package instructions and/or any additional advice provided by your doctor. Make sure that your cat takes the medication for as long as the vet advises. Do not stop giving your cat the medication even if its symptoms disappear (unless specifically advised to do so by the vet)., Even if your cat appears in pain, you should never give it any medication that is intended for humans. Painkillers and other medications that humans use can be dangerous to cats. Even vitamins can be toxic to felines. If you think that your cat needs any kind of medication, consult a vet for specific recommendations."

Rest, a good diet, and plenty of fluids are generally recommended as treatment. A vet can also examine your cat to determine if any medications will help your cat recover.If your cat is suffering from cat flu or an upper respiratory infection, you can wipe away any discharge from its nose or eyes using warm salt water (a teaspoon of salt mixed into a pint of clean water)., Cats can suffer from multiple types of diabetes. Depending upon the severity of the condition at the time of diagnosis, your cat may need to be hospitalized. Oral medications and insulin treatment are commonly recommended to care for a cat with diabetes. Glucose tests may also be required, and a vet can show you how to administer these at home.Talk to a vet about testing your cat for feline diabetes if it has a noticeable change in appetite (it eats more or less than previously), drinks lots of water, urinates frequently, has breath that smells sweet, or is lethargic.

, Ringworm is a fungus that can cause hair loss and red rings on a cat’s skin. If you see or suspect these symptoms, contact a vet immediately. Medications, bathing, and special shampoos can help your cat recover. Take care when handling a cat with ringworm, since the infection can pass to humans.

, The heartworm parasite is transmitted by mosquitos. Once a cat is infected, symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and loss of appetite can occur. There are no approved medications in the US for treating feline heartworm infection, although there are some that can prevent it. If your cat develops a heartworm infection, it may be able to fight it off on its own, but a vet can prescribe medications to treat symptoms like coughing and vomiting.Though some cats can beat a heartworm infection on their own, others can suffer heart and lung problems, kidney or liver damage, and even sudden death.

, Various roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, and other parasites can infect cats, particularly those that spend time outside. They can cause a variety of symptoms and problems, including trouble breathing, anemia, and weight loss. Take your cat to a vet if you see unusual symptoms or suspect that it has a parasite. He or she can prescribe the appropriate medication or treatment.Some worms or parts of them may be visible on or near your cat’s anus.
Keep your yard and home clear of cat feces, since many worms are transmitted by contact with it.
Wear gloves and take care when handling a cat that you suspect has a parasite (or the cat’s feces), since it can pass to humans in some cases.
Only give your cat deworming medication that is approved by your vet. The wrong medication (or one intended for dogs or other animals) may harm your cat.

, FIV is a viral infection that a cat may have for some time before the problem is diagnosed. The virus can cause a variety of symptoms. There is currently no specific treatment for FIV, but a vet can prescribe medications to treat symptoms or secondary infections, as well as make dietary recommendations to improve your cat’s quality of life.Common signs of FIV include: weight loss, diarrhea, loss of appetite, inflamed eyes, poor coat quality (patches of missing hair, reddened skin, etc.), sneezing, or discharge from the eyes or nose.
FIV can be transmitted from cat to cat, but not from a cat to a human.

, FeLV can cause problems with your cat’s immune system, as well as a variety of symptoms. There is no cure for FeLV, but a vet can make recommendations regarding the best diet for your cat. Diets for cats should be free of raw meat, eggs, unpasteurized dairy products, and other foods that could cause infections. Rest and quiet can also make your cat more comfortable.Some cats infected with FeLV may show no symptoms. Others may have symptoms including a poor appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, gum problems, and respiratory issues.
Like FIV, FeLV is contagious only between cats, not between cats and humans. Keeping your cat away from other felines can help reduce the spread of the disease.

, Cancer can have a variety of causes in cats, as in humans. Your cat’s vet can talk with you about treatment plans, which may involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. In some cases, pain relief (palliative care) is chosen for the sake of the cat’s quality of life., Rabies is typically caused by a bite from an infected animal, and cause aggressive or erratic behavior, seizures, and paralysis. Unfortunately, rabies is almost always fatal. If you suspect that your cat is infected with rabies, contact a vet immediately. Use extreme care when handling the animal, since the disease can pass to humans as well.If your cat is up-to-date on its rabies vaccinations, it can be given a booster immediately and closely monitored to determine if it will recover.

Give your cat water.,
Withhold the cat’s food.,
Provide a bland diet.",How to Help a Sick Cat3," Vomiting can accompany many common cat illnesses, as well as occasional digestive problems. If your cat has vomited, offer it plenty of fresh, clean water.If your cat vomits frequently, especially within a brief period, contact a vet.

, For cats with an occasional vomiting problem, keeping them away from food for 24-48 hours can give their digestive system time to recover. If your cat vomits even after having water, you can also withhold it for up to 24 hours. However, do not withhold water from a cat with known or suspected kidney disease., After the vomiting has stopped for a time, you can begin feeding your cat again. Try offering small amounts, 3-6 times a day. The food should be bland so as to not upset the cat’s digestive system again. Good suggestions for a bland diet include boiled, skinless chicken or white fish, such as cod.Over the course of a few days, gradually increase the amount you feed the cat.
After a few days on a bland diet, begin mixing a small portion of your cat’s regular food with the bland foods. Start with something like 1 part regular food to 3 parts bland food.
If your cat seems to handle the mixed food without a problem, wait a day or two and mix one-half regular food and one-half bland food. After a day or so of that, try 3 parts regular food to one part bland food. If that also works, then you can go back to feeding your cat only its regular food.

Give your cat a special toy right before the storm.,
Purchase pheromone sprays.",How to Identify and Treat Noise Phobias in Cats1," Cats like to take cover in confined places for stressful situations. Put a bunch of toys and a favorite blanket in a comfortable hiding spot, like a crate or a closet that your cat can take cover in., When you know that a certain noise bothers your cat, use other noises to mask the sound. Turn up the music or television. Close doors and windows to try to block out problematic noise.If your cat responds negatively to all loud noise, this strategy could be counterproductive.

, Exercise will tire out your cat and reduce stress levels. Play with your cat daily to reduce its anxiety levels.Consider purchasing a food puzzle, so your cat has something to play with when you aren’t available.

, It might be hard to restrain yourself from petting your cat and offering emotional support. Providing this support, however, so is a sort of positive reinforcement, which signals to your cat that it should be worried. Instead, act as if nothing is happening., You should try to build positive associations with storms, to make it something that your cat will look forward to. For maximum effect, give it a treat that it likes but doesn’t usually get, or even one that you will only give it during a storm., Your cat probably won’t want to play during the storm, but if you give it the toy shortly before the storm, it will build positive associations with loud noise. Try using a special toy that you know your cat likes, but only gets to play with right before the storm., Pheromone sprays can be purchased over the counter, without veterinarian approval, and reduce cats’ stress levels.

See your vet for regular checkups, as well as emergencies.,
Book appointments in advance.,
Be on time for your appointments.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Cat's Vet1," Building a good relationship with your cat’s vet takes time. Rather than see your vet only once a year for a big checkup, try to schedule several smaller checkups a year. If you only bring your cat in for emergencies, your vet may not see you or your cat very often and not be able to build a relationship with you. Try to schedule appointments throughout the year for checkups so you can get to know your vet and create a connection with them.For example, you may commit to one checkup every three months so your cat gets regular medical care. Or you may try to bring your cat in several times a year so they see the vet often enough and you can build a relationship with them.

This can give you time to calm your cat down before the appointment, if needed, and will make the vet feel less rushed.If you are running late for your appointment, make sure you call the vet’s office and let them know. Apologize for running late and ask if it is possible for you to hold your existing appointment. Your vet will likely be less upset about you being late if you call and explain.

If you have other pets, keep them separated for a few days, to give your cat adequate time to recover. Rough play could result in tearing stitches or irritating the incision site.If your vet recommends exercise restrictions while your cat recovers, make sure you follow them exactly. If you are unsure if your cat needs exercise restrictions, contact your vet for clarification.

Try a hairball formula cat food.,
Brush your cat’s fur more often.,
Give your cat a digestive aid.,
Mix foods that aid with digestion into your cat’s food.",How to Help a Gagging Cat3," Your cat may benefit from a cat food that’s specifically made for hairballs. This food contains ingredients that are supposed to help the hairballs move through the cat’s body so it won’t gag or vomit them up.You can ask your vet for a formula recommendation or find one online or at a pet store.

, If your cat is gagging due to too much hair, start brushing it more often. Try brushing its fur daily to remove loose hair. This may reduce the amount of hair your cat ingests when it grooms.You may also want to wipe your cat’s coat with a damp cloth to remove any loose hair the brush didn’t get.

, You can talk to your vet about getting a laxative or other digestive aid that will help the hair and hairballs pass more easily through the digestive tract. These products contain some type of lubricant that helps hair avoid getting stuck., Hairballs can lead to gagging. Hairballs occur when your cat can’t digest the hair it has swallowed while grooming. To help reduce gagging and get the hair to go through your cat, try mixing one to two tablespoons of canned pumpkin into your cat’s food. This food has a lot of fiber, which can help your cat push the hair through.Olive oil is another food product you can try. Add one teaspoon of olive oil to the food. This can aid in digestion, which can reduce gagging.
You can add these foods once or twice a week to your cat’s food.

Take your cat in for a physical examination.,
Screen for skin cancer.,
Administer antibiotics.,
Apply steroidal cream to the burn.,
Disinfect and bandage wounds.",How to Handle Solar Dermatitis in Cats2," The symptoms of solar dermatitis also appear in other conditions. You’ll need to take your cat to your vet for a physical exam to determine if they do have solar dermatitis. This will probably include a skin scraping so your vet can test the skin., The skin scraping will help your vet determine if your cat’s solar dermatitis has progressed to skin cancer. Your vet will test for squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer to follow this condition.If your cat does have cancer, surgery is probably necessary. You’ll need to discuss this with your vet, as they can tell you what type of surgery is best or what other treatments are available., If your cat has scratched at the infected areas, they might have caused infection. This might also require that you give your cat antibiotics to clear it up.Your vet will tell you the best way to administer the antibiotics they prescribe. Usually, you can crush the pills up and put them in food, or sneak the whole pill into a treat.

, If your cat’s burn is severe, steroidal cream might help to heal it. You should apply it according to the directions, usually once a day until it clears up., If your cat has given itself actual wounds from scratching, they’ll need to be taken care of. Disinfect them every day, using a cleaner like Phisoderm. Then bandage them to prevent your cat from further licking them, etc."

Use sunscreen on your cat.,
Keep your cat inside during peak sun time.,
Close your curtains when necessary.",How to Handle Solar Dermatitis in Cats3," You should apply it fifteen minutes before your cat is exposed to sunlight. A waterproof, hypoallergenic sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher is best.You should check with your vet before using sunscreen. They can recommend the best kind for your cat.

, The sun is usually its strongest between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. If you can, keep your cat inside during these times to prevent overexposure to the sun., If your cat tends to sit in very sunny spots throughout the day, you might have close certain curtains. This is especially important if your cat is still recovering from solar dermatitis."

Address the cause of your cat's ataxia.,
Treat hypoglycemia.,
Treat feline diabetes.,
Treat an ear infection.,
Follow instructions carefully.",How to Help a Cat with Ataxia2," Ataxia itself is always caused by something else. It is crucial that you treat this other condition in order to help your cat recover from its ataxia. Whatever method of treatment your vet recommends, follow it.Ataxia could be caused by a viral infection, meningitis, parasite, spider bites, brain damage, hypoglycemia, ear infection, bone cancer, diabetes-induced nerve damage, tumor, or any other number of underlying diseases.

, Hypoglycemia is when a diabetic cat has low blood sugar and can be a precursor to bouts of ataxia. If your cat has a hypoglycemic event, you will need to encourage your cat to eat some food. If your cat is unable to eat its normal food, try feeding it some honey or corn syrup. If your cat is unconscious, put some honey or corn syrup on its gums and take it to the vet immediately.Some symptoms of hypoglycemia include lethargy, anxiety, difficulty standing, weakness, seizures, muscle twitching, or unconsciousness.

, If your cat has diabetes, this means that it has trouble regulating its insulin levels. You will need to get a diagnosis from your veterinarian and then give your cat daily insulin shots at consistent times each day, with the dosage and frequency determined by your vet.Diabetic cats also need to maintain a healthy weight in order to minimize the effects of their diabetes. You should be cautious about giving your cat too many treats or any human food.
You should also provide your cat with a high-fiber, high-complex carbohydrate diet to help with weight loss and to help control your cat’s blood sugar levels.

, Ear infections can cause symptoms of ataxia in cats. If your cat has an ear infection, it will need to be diagnosed by a veterinarian. Treatment involves cleaning of the ear canals, ear drop ointments (either antibiotics, antifungals, or anti-inflammatory drugs), and possibly surgery – depending on the severity of the case.The main symptoms of feline ear infections include shaking its head, scratching its ears repeatedly, skin wounds around the head and ears, hair loss on ears, discharge from the ear canal, or redness of the inner ear.

, Ataxia can be a symptom of many different underlying issues, and treatment will vary depending on why your cat is ataxic. Be sure to listen to your vet and carefully follow instructions for applying treatment or administering medications."
"
Watch for changes in gait.,
Monitor any change in food intake.,
Notice signs of lethargy.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to Help a Cat with Ataxia3," One of the most prominent symptoms of feline ataxia is a change in gait. This can take several different forms. A cat with ataxia may seem to stumble or wobble often. Or it might start goose-stepping (a high stepping gait). Cats with ataxia may also sway from side to side or lean to one side while walking or standing.A cat with ataxia might also fall over often while trying to walk.
In general, cats with ataxia appear as if they have poor coordination.
Any noticeable change in gait is cause for concern. Monitor your cat’s behavior and the way they walk for a few days. If the change seems to continue or worsen, contact your veterinarian.

, If your cat loses its appetite and seems to not be eating, this is something to worry about. It is often a symptom of some underlying cause, one of which could be ataxia. This is an especially prominent possibility if the appetite loss is paired with a change in gait.Monitor your cat’s food intake carefully and see if it decreases over the span of a few days.

, If your cat seems to be overly lethargic, this could be a symptom of ataxia. Any perceived weakness or unusual amounts of laziness should be monitored and reported to your veterinarian.Try to get your cat to engage in normal play-time activities. If it resists or seems uninterested (or unable), consider calling your vet.

, If you suspect your cat is suffering from ataxia, make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible. Since ataxia is always caused by some other disease, it’s important to figure out the root cause and treat it immediately. Otherwise your cat will not get better.The vet will need to be informed about your cat’s entire health history to help determine the underlying cause of the ataxia symptoms.
Your vet will perform a complete physical checkup, with some possible additional tests. Some additional tests could include a urinalysis, cerebrospinal tap, MRI, CT scan, ultrasound, fecal test, or other blood test.

Make a list of questions for the vet.,
Prepare your cat for the vet.,
Call the vet before you bring your cat in if there is an emergency.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Cat's Vet2," Showing up to your vet appointments prepared will help to build goodwill with your vet. They will likely appreciate that you took the time to make a list of questions to ask them so the appointment has a focus and is productive for you, your cat, and the vet. If you start to notice symptoms or issues in your cat, write down questions about the symptoms or issues to then ask your vet during the appointment.For example, if you notice your cat has a skin issue, you may write down questions like, “What are the possible causes of the skin issue?” “How can the skin issue be treated?” “How can I prevent the skin issue in the future?”
You can also write down general questions that you want to ask the vet, such as, “When is the best time to give my cat their meals?” or “How often should I be brushing my cat?”

, Preparing your cat properly for the vet will make the appointment less stressful for all involved. Always bring your cat into the vet in their carrier, as this will ensure your cat is contained and make the waiting area safe for other animals. Acclimatize your cat to their carrier and to car rides so they stay relaxed and calm on the way to the vet. Get your cat to associate positive feelings to being in their carrier so they are less stressed when they are taken to the vet.You can also try using a pheromone spray on your cat to calm them down on the way to the vet. The pheromones can help your cat relax.
Maintain a calm, relaxed demeanor when you take your cat to the vet, as they will often sense if their owner is stressed or upset and respond in kind.

, Do not bring your cat into the vet’s unannounced or without calling and setting up an appointment in advance. If there is an emergency and your cat needs to see the vet right away, you should still call the vet’s office to make sure they are available. Showing up unannounced can lead to a negative response from your vet and throw off the other appointments they already have scheduled.If your vet is not available during an emergency, you should bring your cat to an emergency animal clinic. Your vet may be able to suggest a good one near you when you call them.

Focus on one major issue or problem at a time.,
Ask clear, concise questions.,
Discuss the treatment costs for your cat.,
Act friendly and polite around the vet.,
Recommend your vet to others.",How to Have a Good Relationship with Your Cat's Vet3," To avoid overwhelming the vet, try to keep the appointment focused on one major issue or problem your cat is having. Present the main issue to the vet and answer any of their questions as best you can. If your cat has several issues, choose the issue that seems the most dire and discuss that one first. Then, mention the other issues once the major problem has been addressed.For example, perhaps your cat has a skin issue and is not eating regularly. You may discuss your cat’s lack of appetite first and then mention their skin issue once your vet is aware of the first issue.

, As you speak to your vet about an issue, make sure your questions are clear and concise. Avoid asking vague questions or questions that are confusing for the vet to answer. Listen carefully to what they have to say about your cat’s condition and ask questions that are thoughtful and to the point. Always ask your vet questions if you don’t understand what they are saying, as you do not want to end up leaving the vet confused or unclear about your cat’s condition.For example, if your cat has a skin issue, you may ask the vet, “What type of skin issue does my cat have?” and “How can I treat the skin issue?”
If you do not understand what your vet says about the skin issue, you may say, “Can you clarify what you just said?” or “Sorry, I don’t quite understand what you meant by that. Would you mind explaining it further?”

, Depending on your cat’s diagnosis, the cost of treating it may be overwhelming. Make sure you maintain open and honest communication with your vet by discussing treatment costs in detail. Ask them for an estimate of the costs for a certain procedure or treatment. Discuss paying the vet in installments or over a period of time. Be honest about where you are at financially with the vet and work with them to figure out your options.Your vet may suggest a more cost effective option for treating your cat, based on your budget. A good vet will work with you to find a financial option that works for you and still ensures your cat gets treatment.

, Maintain an open, friendly demeanor around the vet to build goodwill. If you are having a stressful or frustrating day, try not to bring these feelings with you to the appointment. Make jokes, smile, and display relaxed, open body language around the vet. Maintain eye contact with them when you speak to them. Be polite and considerate during the appointment.Make sure you say “thank you” at the end of the appointment and express your gratitude to the vet for treating your cat.

, Perhaps the ultimate compliment you can pay to your vet is to recommend them to other cat owners. Recommending your vet to others can show the vet that you approve of their services and think they are doing a good job. They will likely appreciate the referral and value you even more as a client.


Some vets offer referral programs for their clients, where you get a discount or benefits towards your appointments when you refer someone to the vet. Find out if this is an option through your vet.

Check on your cat frequently.,
Monitor your cat’s breathing.,
Keep an eye on the incision site.,
Call the veterinarian if any complications arise.",How to Help a Cat Recover from Anesthesia2," Although it is important to keep your cat in a quiet, traffic-free area while they recover from an anesthesia, you should still check on them frequently. For example, you should enter the room with your cat every few hours to make sure that it is breathing normally and not experiencing too much discomfort., In some cases a cat may have a negative reaction to the anesthesia, causing them to experience respiratory distress. This includes laboured breathing. If your cat shows signs of laboured breathing, contact your vet immediately., Usually when cats receive anesthesia, it is accompanied by surgery and/or stitches. As a result, it is important to watch the incision site for any complications. Watch for redness, swelling, or any discharge from the incision, or for your cat biting or scratching around the area.Call your vet immediately if you notice any signs of irritation around the incision site.
You can also help avoid complications such as biting by using an Elizabethan collar, sometimes called a cone collar, available from your vet or pet supply stores. Be sure to properly fit the collar so that your cat cannot get around it.

, If you are at all concerned with your cat’s recovery from the anesthesia, then you should call your veterinarian. For example, if your cat’s energy levels do not begin to rise within a few days, this could be a sign of an underlying issue. It is always best to be on the safe side."

Place its litter box in a warm room.,
Keep the heat on when you leave.,
Move furniture into sunny spots.,
Buy a heated cat bed.,
Keep your cat indoors.,
Make sure that your cat is hydrated.,
Monitor its weight.,
Adjust your cat's diet.,
Keep your cat active.,
Be gentle when handling your cat.",How to Help a Senior Cat Get Through a Cold Winter," If you keep your senior cat's litter box in the basement or garage, move it into a warm room indoors during cold winter months. Older cats do not handle the cold as well as younger cats, so forcing them into a cold, damp place to relieve themselves can cause them a great deal of discomfort.To make this transition, it is best to introduce a second litter box in the new location (e.g. in the laundry room or bathroom) and leave the old litter box where it is, to avoid confusion and to let your cat get used to the new option., While it might seem like an budget-friendly choice to turn down the heat when you leave for work or go out on the weekend, the colder environment might be unpleasant for your senior cat. Leave the thermostat at a moderately warm temperature, keeping in mind that a senior cat will be far more susceptible to the cold, particularly if it is thin. Make sure that the cat has spots to warm up in if it feels a chill, such as a warm cat bed, fuzzy blanket, or a comfortable cushion placed in a sunny spot., If your senior cat has a favorite piece of furniture to sit or lie on during the day (e.g. a cat bed or favorite chair), move it to a spot that gets a lot of sunlight during the day. Your cat will likely gravitate to sunny spots for warmth during cold months, so moving its preferred resting spot will keep it happy and comfortable through winter. Avoid moving too many things around at once, however, as change can cause stress in senior cats., Look online or at your local pet store for a heated bed for your senior cat in the winter. These beds may feature inner heating elements or thermo-reflective material, which uses your cat's body heat to warm the bed. If your cat has a tendency to burrow itself under your blankets or seek closed environments (e.g. hiding under your bed), opt for an A-frame heated cat bed, which will provide warmth and an enclosed shelter for your pet., To keep your senior cat safe and healthy during the winter months (and all year round), keep it indoors. Cold weather can cause frostbite and hypothermia in cats, particularly older ones whose immune systems are not as strong as they used to be. Senior cats have a compromised ability to keep their body temperatures from falling below normal, and should be kept indoors in warm, heated temperatures to prevent illness., Heating during winter months can cause dryness in the air, which can be especially risky for senior cats who are already prone to dehydration. Get a humidifier for your home, which will raise moisture levels in the air and prevent dry skin and irritation. Make sure to leave out extra water for your cat to drink, preferably in different spots of the house so that your senior cat doesn't have to travel too much to quench its thirst., Be sure to monitor your senior cat's weight once a month to maintain an ideal balance. An underweight cat is likely to have difficulty keeping warm, while carrying extra weight might aggravate conditions like arthritis, which plagues many older cats. To get a general idea of what your cat weighs, weigh yourself on your regular scale, then weigh yourself holding your cat, and subtract the difference. If you wish to get a more precise reading, buy a digital scale for babies to weigh your cat.Most house cats should weigh about 10 pounds, but this can vary by breed. Ask your veterinarian what a target weight for your cat should be., Protein will help your senior cat keep its coat thick and healthy during the cold months, so adjust its diet accordingly. Feed your cat canned food, which contains more protein and fewer carbohydrates and additives than regular food. You can also supplement your cat's diet with oils containing healthy fatty acids (e.g. fish oil) to fortify and thicken its fur.Ask your veterinarian about the correct dosage of fish oil for your pet, available in capsules that can be given to your cat directly or pierced and squeezed into its food., Get specific recommendations from your veterinarian about how frequent and intensive your senior cat's exercise routine should be. Make sure that your cat gets a moderate level of activity every day, which will improve blood circulation to keep your cat warm. Play chasing or hunting games (e.g. throwing a toy mouse for it to catch, or having it chase the red dot from a laser pointer) or purchase puzzle toys from a pet store for your cat to play with at its leisure. If your cat demonstrates signs of fatigue, shortness of breath, or injury, stop the play immediately and contact your vet if it persists.
Make sure that your vet has checked your cat for vision and mobility problems before engaging your cat in play, which may be dangerous for an impaired pet.

, The cold can wreak havoc on the joints of senior cats during winter months, causing pain, tenderness, and stiffness. Be gentle when picking up your cat, placing your hand firmly under its body behind its front legs, and using your other arm to gently cradle its hindquarters as you raise it up. Be equally gentle when cuddling or playing with your cat."

Your cat may have just come in from outdoors or he may be in the middle of cleaning himself. Wait until he’s not busy with something else before initiating a massage.


Wait about 2 hours after your pet has eaten before massaging him. This will give him a chance to digest his food.;
, Get close to your cat and make sure that he's happy to be in your presence. You may even want to wait for him to come to you instead of grabbing him out of his comfort zone. Wait for him to hang out with you, relax, lie down, or even to purr or nuzzle up against you.

, Make your kitty feel calm and happy by getting him into the right state of mind first. Start by singing lightly to your cat or using a low, calming voice and telling your kitty that he's a good boy.


Don't use the high-pitched, squealing voice some people like to use to talk to cats (""You're such a cute little kitty!!"") or you'll actually stress out your kitty even more.

, Take deep breaths and adopt a calm manner. If you are tense or trying to rush through the massage, your pet will sense that and won’t want to get a massage from you., A massage doesn’t have to take a long time. Just 5-10 minutes every day will be sufficient. Spend about a minute massaging each part of your cat’s body to get him nice and relaxed.

, Start the massage by stroking your cat at a slow speed so that your cat gets used to the feel of the massage. Pick your cat’s favorite spot, whether it’s under his chin, on his back or behind the ears. Starting with a familiar place will make your cat more amenable to being massaged all over.

, Many people stroke their cats with their fingertips. This touch might be too light for the cat to feel much, especially along the back or belly. Use your full hand and apply some gentle pressure to the cat’s body as you’re stroking it. Save your fingertips for massaging the head and face.


You can use just one hand or both hands.

, Throughout the massage, pay attention to how your cat responds. If your cat keeps trying to get up, he might not be in the mood to get a massage. If he is blinking, purring, drooling, falling asleep, or even looking a little dazed, he is probably enjoying the massage immensely.


If your cat suddenly scratches or bites you, his skin might be getting over-stimulated. Cats’ skin is extremely sensitive and if it’s over-stimulated, it can actually hurt the cat. Get to know how your cat responds to being petted on different parts of his body., Most cats love to have their heads massaged. Use your palms of your hands to give your kitty circular rubs on the top of his head as well as on the back of his head and on his temples.Use your fingertips to massage around and behind his ears.


You might want to come back to the head after you’ve massaged your cat more, since he might need to be more relaxed in order to fully appreciate having his head massaged.

, After you've massaged your cat's head, rub under the cat's neck very slowly and gently. Massage your cat with your fingers, making small circular motions up and down his neck. Be careful not to press into his neck. You can use one hand or two.

, Use little circular motions with your fingers to massage his cheeks and his forehead. You can also use the palms of your hands on each side of his face. Your cat may purr or close his eyes in approval. If he likes what you're doing, he may even let you massage the little area around his eyes, on his nose or around his whiskers.

, After you finish massaging his head and neck, give your cat a few firm pets on his body. Apply gentle pressure with your hand while you stroke him from head to tail.This will help his body relax into the rest of the massage.

, Start rubbing your cat’s shoulders in circles slowly. Place one hand on each of your cat's sides and give your kitty a good rubdown. Gently but firmly use both hands to knead the sides of your cat's body, especially his or her shoulders., Moving down the back from the shoulders, apply gentle pressure along your cat’s back and sides, using circular motions.


Keep your attention on your cat’s upper back, as the lower back and hips can be sensitive for many cats. If your cat likes to be touched in this area, then massage it very gently., If your cat is relaxed enough, he may lie on his back and allow you to rub his belly. Gently hold him with one hand and massage his belly with the other, kneading the skin along his belly. If he's really relaxed, you can even use both hands to massage his belly.


Some cats really don't like to have their bellies touched, so do this carefully at first.You can also mix it up, massaging your cat's belly with one hand while massaging his head or back with the other.
Try massaging your cat's chest muscles too, which need a good massage from time to time.

, Start by massaging your cat's tail at the base, near his rump, and then slowly work your way toward the end of the tail. You can use both hands, but work lightly with the fingers, since the tail is a very sensitive place for the cat. If you just go for your cat's tail first, he's likely to run away from you. You have to get the rest of his body relaxed before he will enjoy a tail massage.


You can even massage his head with one hand and massage the tail with the other.
If he starts wildly moving his tail, then he's getting excited and maybe even angry, which is the opposite of what you want.

, While you’re massaging your cat, this is an ideal time to check your cat’s overall health. Check the fur to see if your cat has been grooming himself.If the fur is matted or greasy, this could indicate health problems such as diabetes, bladder infections or other issues. If it seems unclean in only a few spots, this might indicate that your cat has trouble reaching certain areas of his body, perhaps because of arthritis.
If the fur is over-groomed and the fur is actually missing or sparse in some areas, this could indicate a dermatological issue, such as a skin irritation or allergy.

, As you rub your fingers and hands over your cat’s body, dig under the fur gently to check the health of your cat’s skin. If you feel bites or bumps, your cat might have fleas or other skin irritations.

, Cats can get feverish, which can indicate an illness of some sort. As you massage your cat, you will get a sense of his normal body temperature. If you feel that his body is warmer than usual, start checking for other indications of illness or injury, such as an infected cut or vomiting.


Heated spots on the body might also indicate arthritis., Take note of any abnormalities that you might find as you massage your cat.Lumps and bumps can indicate serious health issues, so it’s good to be aware of what’s normal for your cat and what’s not., Your vet is the best source for assessing your cat’s health. If you’ve discovered a lump, skin problem or other health issue, ask your vet if the issue should be treated.

Make a veterinary appointment.,
Get a veterinary diagnosis.,
Give your cat corticosteroids.,
Begin treatment with antibiotics.,
Consider surgical or cryosurgical treatment.",How to Handle Feline Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex1," If you discover that your cat has lesions on its body, you should get them checked out by a veterinarian. However, this is typically not a life-threatening emergency, so it's appropriate to make an appointment to bring your cat in. Call your veterinary office, describe your cat's symptoms to the veterinary staff, and then make an appointment for your cat to be seen within a day or two.


Lesions are typically raised areas that are red and covered in bumps, which could be described as ulcers or abscesses. They can also be oozing, yellowish or tumor-like.Once you describe your cat's symptoms to the veterinary staff, they may tell you to bring your cat in right away. If this is the case, follow their directions and get your cat veterinary treatment immediately.;
, Once your veterinarian assesses your cat's health, they will do tests to figure out what is causing your cat's lesions. These tests usually include a fine needle aspiration or tissue biopsy in order to look at the cells in the lesions. Once they are sure that your cat has feline eosinophilic granuloma, they will then begin planning the cat's treatment.The vet will be able to differentiate between the types of feline eosinophilic granuloma by looking at the lesions. Eosinophilic plaque lesions are typically on a cat's medial thigh and abdominal regions. Eosinophilic granuloma lesions are typically on a cat's upper thighs or oral cavity. Eosinophilic ulcers are typically located on the cat's upper lip.
Thigh or abdomen sores typically look like red, angry hives, while lip sores may be more pustulent.

, Corticosteroids are used for treating feline eosinophilic granuloma because they reduce inflammation and reduce the body's immune response, which in the case of feline eosinophilic granuloma is over sensitive. However, they can cause side effects in cats, so their long-term use needs to be monitored closely by a veterinarian.Some common corticosteroids that may be prescribed to your cat include methylprednisolone acetate, oral prednisolone, or oral triamcinolone., In many cases, feline eosinophilic granuloma infections can be reduced with the use of antibiotics, in addition to corticosteroids. This type of medication can clear up any underlying infection that occurs due to open sores or additional infection.The specific antibiotics often given to help with this infection include amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones., In some cases of feline eosinophilic granuloma, your veterinarian may suggest surgical or cryosurgical removal of your cat's lesions. With cryosurgery, lesions are frozen with liquid nitrogen and then removed. This is typically only done as a last resort, if lesions cannot be managed in other ways or return repeatedly.Surgery and cryosurgery usually require the cat to be anesthetized. Be aware of the health risks associated with anesthesia, learn about how to help your cat recover from anesthesia, and make sure that your veterinarian is sure that your cat is healthy enough to be put under.
Some alternatives to surgery exist, such as topical medications and treatment with the amino acid lysine. Talk to your veterinarian to determine which treatment is most appropriate for your cat."

Continue parasitic treatment.,
Try an elimination or hypoallergenic diet.,
Begin treatment again when flareups occur.",How to Handle Feline Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex2," It is important to keep fleas and other parasites under control when treating feline eosinophilic granuloma. Bites from parasites can cause the immune system of a cat with feline eosinophilic granuloma to overreact and that can begin an outbreak.If you are already giving your cat parasitic treatment on a regular basis, make sure that it is working well for your cat by checking for parasites and then continue treatment as normal.

, If you, or your veterinarian, think that the lesions could be related to a food allergy, you may want to start an elimination diet or start feeding your cat a hypoallergenic diet. Finding the source of the allergic reaction that prompts the lesions, and then keeping it out of your cat's diet, can go a long way toward clearing up the condition.An elimination diet requires that you transition your cat onto a diet that does not contain likely allergens. Then, once your cat's symptoms decrease, you start introducing possible allergens back into the cat's diet, in order to figure out what exactly was causing the lesions. These diets typically consist of novel proteins, such as kangaroo and duck, as well as a carbohydrate source.
A hypoallergenic diet is a type of cat food that doesn't contain any ingredients that are likely to cause an allergic reaction in cats., While symptoms of feline eosinophilic granuloma can be treated, it can be difficult to eliminate all flareups. In many cases, your cat will need treatment on and off for the rest of its life.If your cat's lesions return after a long period without flare ups, you should have it seen by a veterinarian. This will allow the veterinarian to make sure that your cat doesn't have any new underlying conditions that are causing the flare up.

Assess the cat for lesions on the inner thigh and abdominal regions.,
Look for lesions on the upper thighs and in the oral cavity of the cat.",How to Handle Feline Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex3," Lesions on a cat's upper lip are symptomatic of an eosinophilic ulcer, one of the types of feline eosinophilic granuloma lesions. These lesions are typically not painful or itchy and they are very small in size.There are a variety of causes of lesions on cats, so you should have them looked at by a veterinarian to figure out the exact cause and correct treatment.

, Lesions on the medial thigh and abdominal regions are symptomatic of eosinophilic plaque, one of the types of feline eosinophilic granuloma lesions. These lesions tend to be very itchy and so you will probably notice your cat itching these areas more than normal., Lesions on the upper thighs or in the cat's mouth are symptomatic of eosinophilic granuloma lesions. However, these lesions can occur anywhere on the body, including the head, face, bridge of the nose, pinnate, or pads of the feet, so in most cases it requires a veterinarian to diagnose this condition specifically.These tend to be yellowish to pink colored lesions.

Have follow up testing done regularly.",How to Handle Autoimmune Skin Disease in Cats," If your cat's skin is irritated by an autoimmune disease, it is likely that it will lose patches of fur. Areas of fur loss should be noted and the skin underneath should be watched for signs of irritation and discoloration.

Cats can lose fur for a variety of reasons, including disease or simply over grooming. However, if your cat has areas of fur loss, they should be looked at by a veterinarian, no matter what you may think the cause is.;
, When a cat's immune system goes after its own cells, this can cause those cells to become inflamed and irritated. Look for areas that are red and swollen, as well as areas where the skin is flaky or has discharge.Irritation from autoimmune disease typically looks very different from irritation due to trauma or scratches. However, both should be looked at by a veterinarian if they don't go away after a few days and appear infected.

, In addition to causing areas of fur loss and irritation, autoimmune skin disease tend to cause blisters and ulcers on the skin. There are especially common around the edges of the cat's eyes, lips, nose, and anus, where skin and mucosal tissues meet.Depending on what type of autoimmune skin disease your cat has, its blisters or ulcers may be large or small. They may open up or remain inflated. They may be numerous or your cat may only have a few. Whatever type of blisters the cat has, they should be looked at by a veterinarian.

, If you suspect that your cat has an autoimmune skin disease, you should get it looked at by a veterinarian. A condition like this can cause your cat a great deal discomfort if it goes untreated.While it is important to get your cat looked at and treated, you do not need to bring your cat to a veterinarian immediately if you see one bare patch or blister. Instead, call your veterinary office, explain your cat's symptoms, and make an appointment for the cat to be looked at.

, In addition to having a physical exam done, your veterinarian will need to run some tests to diagnose an autoimmune skin disorder. To get a definitive diagnosis, these tests will typically need to include a skin biopsy. This can be a painful procedure for a cat, but will allow the veterinarian to understand more clearly what it going on in the cat's cells.If your cat is nervous or uneasy around the veterinarian, or if the area being tested is particularly sensitive, sedation or general anesthesia may be required when doing the biopsy.

, Once your veterinarian has finished its exam and testing of your cat, they will likely give you a diagnosis. However, it can be difficult to give an exact diagnosis for autoimmune diseases, so sometimes they may tell you what your cat likely has instead of a definitive diagnosis. Ask any questions you have at this point and discuss with the veterinarian why they have come to their conclusions. There are four common autoimmune skin diseases that the vet is likely to find. They include:Pemphigus complex - usually causes blisters at the cat's mucocutaneous junctions, including the mouth, eyelids, lips, nostrils, and anus
Bullous Pemphigoid - includes itchy and large red welts and hives, which often appear before blisters and ulcers on various parts of the body
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - a rare condition in cats that includes fever, stiffness or lameness, and blood abnormalities
Discoid Lupus Erythematosus - rare in cats, causes loss of pigmentation around eyes and lips

, Depending on what type of autoimmune skin disease your cat has, the treatment may vary slightly. However, it is likely that your cat will be prescribed an immunosuppressant medication, which stops the immune system from fighting the cat's own body. The most common medications used for this purpose are prednisone or dexamethasone. However, if your cat needs a stronger medication, they may be prescribed chlorambucil or oral cyclosporine.Additionally, if there is an underlying bacterial infection, your cat will also likely be prescribed antibiotics.
In most cases, autoimmune skin diseases are controlled, not cured. This means that your cat will likely be on a treatment regime long term.

, Because autoimmune skin diseases can be serious and are usually not cured, your cat's condition will need to be evaluated regularly. This will allow the veterinarian to keep track of the progress of treatment, as well as keeping an eye on any side effects that might occur due to treatment."

Take note of changes in behavior.,
Watch for resistance during a monthly dental check.,
Learn the physical signs of dental disease.,
Brush your cat's teeth regularly.,

Let your veterinarian know about any concerns.",How to Check Your Cat's Teeth," If your cat is normally friendly and affectionate with you, he should be fairly cooperative during a monthly dental check. However, make sure you catch your cat at the right moment. If you bother your cat when he's distressed, he may learn to associate his dental check with pain.


Watch your cat's body language. A happy cat will have his ears forward and his tail held upward. His back may be arched or he may be lying on his side purring.Pet your cat for a few moments before starting the dental check. Make sure he feels calm and happy going into the exam. Consider giving him a treat after you're finished. This can create a positive association with the exam. This may encourage him to better cooperate for its duration.;
, To start, simply examine your cat's face. Swelling below the eyes can indicate a tooth abscess. Fractures along the canine teeth can cause swelling of the nose. Feel around your cat's neck and just above his ears as these areas may also swell due to dental problems., Once you've checked for swelling, gently open your cat's mouth. Pull his lips back using gentle force as not to cause pain or discomfort. Lean in and breathe in slightly through your nose. If you notice a foul odor, this could be a sign of gingivitis and should be evaluated by a veterinarian., After checking your cat's breath, open his mouth. Your cat may struggle during this process. Pause if necessary and soothe him by petting him and talking to him. Then, continue to pry his mouth open. Look over his teeth to check for any fractures.


Chips, indents, and other signs of recent damage are a sign of a tooth fracture. If left untreated, this can result in infections and other complications.
In the event you notice a fracture, take your cat to the vet for a check-up., If any of your cat's teeth are loose, this should be evaluated by your vet. Loose teeth are a sign of gum disease. Your cat may need medication and loose teeth might require medical removal. If your cat allows you to do so, gently press down on his teeth one by one. If you feel any movement, make an appointment with your vet for evaluation., You should do a dental check with your cat each month. However, you should also be on the lookout for changes in behavior. Behavioral issues in cats can be signs of an underlying dental health issue. Signs of teeth and gum disease in cats include:


Lack of appetite
Difficulty eating
Clawing at the mouth, Most cats will resist dental examinations to some degree. Cats dislike having their mouths handled as it can be uncomfortable. However, if your cat seems particularly bothered by his monthly exam he may have a cavity or other dental health problem. A cat may growl or hiss in pain. He may also nip or scratch. If your cat seems particularly resistant one month, take him to a vet for evaluation., There are a variety of physical signs that indicate dental disease. Keep an eye out for physical symptoms. Symptoms include the following:


Redness of the gums
Bleeding
Pus or other discharge
Salivation, Like people, cats need to have their teeth cleaned regularly. You can buy a toothbrush and toothpaste specifically designed for your cat at your vet's office. Brush your cat's teeth once a month to keep his mouth healthy.


Cradle your cat from behind. Cup his chin and slowly lift up his lip. Use your kitty toothbrush to gently brush his teeth. If you don't have a kitty toothbrush, you can cover your fingertip with gauze and add a dab of cat-friendly toothpaste to the tip. Many people find simply using their fingers provides them with more control.It might take awhile for your cat to get used to a teeth cleaning routine. Provide positive reinforcement in the form of praise and petting throughout the process. Consider giving your cat a small treat when you finish cleaning his teeth.

, For dental health, feed your cat a variety of wet and dry food. You should also provide him with deboned raw meat on occasion. This encourages chewing, which keeps his teeth bones strong. Fish, beef, and rabbit are good choices for your cat's dental health.You can also give your cat bones as a treat. Bones help clear tartar off your cat's teeth. However, avoid fish, pork, or chicken bones. These could splinter when ingested, leading to internal injuries., If you notice bad breath or gum bleeding, let your vet know as soon as possible. Dental problems can lead to serious complications. Early intervention is key. If you see anything unusual during a routine dental check, call your vet and schedule an appointment."

Seek and follow the treatment advice of your vet.,
Give your cat an anti-inflammatory medication.,
Treat the underlying medical condition.,
Administer topical epinephrine.,
Have your vet surgically repair cherry eye.,
Discuss removal of the third eyelid’s tear gland.",How to Treat Third Eyelid Protrusion in Cats1," Sometimes, a third eyelid protrusion will resolve on its own.In other cases, though, veterinary treatment will be necessary to move the third eyelid back to its normal position. After examining your cat’s eyes, your vet will come up with a treatment plan, which will likely consist of medication and surgery.


Ask your vet any questions you may have about the recommended treatments, such as how the medications work and how the surgical procedure is performed.
Following the treatment plan will increase the chances of successfully treating the protrusion.;
, If the protruded third eyelid or tear gland is red and irritated, anti-inflammatory eye drops will be useful. Steroids are anti-inflammatory. For cherry eye (protrusion of the third eyelid’s tear gland), a steroid eye drop could relieve the inflammation enough for the tear gland to move back to its normal position.To give your cat eye drops, hold her gently yet firmly in your lap or place her on a sturdy flat surface. Tilt her head up, open her eyelids up with your non-dominant hand, and put the prescribed number of drops in her eye with your dominant hand.
When you give the eye drops, make sure the bottle tip does not touch her eye.Cats usually do not like getting eye drops. Consider giving the eye drops close to your cat's mealtime. Her mealtime will serve as her reward., If a medical condition is causing the third eyelid protrusion, it should be treated as well. For example, a heavy intestinal worm burden has been associated with Haw syndrome.Your vet would prescribe a dewormer to kill the worms.

, Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is used to treat Haw syndrome (both third eyelids are protruded). A few drops of epinephrine will cause the third eyelids to rapidly retract back into their proper positions. The third eyelids may end up spontaneously retracting in a few weeks or months.However, the administration of eyedrops is rarely done in practice. This is because the eyelid protrusion is a symptom rather than a syndrome on its own. The protrusion is not harmful, so most vets prefer to explain the above and either treat the underlying cause or wait for the protrusion to resolve on its own.
A drug called phenylephrine is similar to epinephrine and can be used to treat Haw syndrome.The topical epinephrine or phenylephrine would be applied in the same way as the topical anti-inflammatory. Follow your vet’s instructions regarding the number of drops to put in the affected eye(s).

, If steroid eye drops are not enough to treat cherry eye, your vet will surgically place the protruded tear gland back where it should be. Surgery is a very effective treatment for cherry eye, with recurrence happening in only 5 ‒ 20% of cases. The sooner your vet performs surgery after you notice the protrusion, the more successful the surgery will be., If cherry eye surgery is not successful, tear gland removal is another option. However, tear gland removal will decrease your cat’s tear production, meaning she will have lifelong dry eye.In addition, your cat’s corneas and conjunctiva (inner lining of the eyelids) will develop problems due to dryness."

Plaque can be cleaned away by brushing, but eliminating the buildup of tartar requires the use of special tools and can only be done in a vet’s office. Also, your vet can assess the overall oral health of your cat and should be able to tell you if it is safe to brush the animal’s teeth.
Your vet should also be able to recommend oral health care products that will be safe and effective for your cat.;
, Your basic supplies will include a soft bristled pet toothbrush and a pet-safe toothpaste. You can’t use human toothpaste on a cat as the fluoride in the toothpaste is toxic to them. You will also need a cat toothbrush.,


Cat toothbrushes can will either be a fingertip type (one you slip over your fingertip) or one that looks like a child-sized toothbrush that is specifically designed for a cat’s mouth.
You can actually buy a pet dental kit, including the right toothpaste and toothbrush, at a pet store or from your vet.

, Introduce the tooth brushing slowly, ideally over a few days. This can help your cat stay relaxed and know what to expect so he won't be scared and is less likely to struggle.To start, put a little bit of the pet toothpaste on your fingertip and let your cat lick it off. The next day, do the same and then run your finger along the gums of your cat’s upper teeth. The following day, put the toothpaste on the toothbrush and let your cat lick it off.
Cats, like people, have flavor preferences. To make your brushing session go as smoothly as possible, it may be wise to buy multiple types of toothpaste to see if there is one your cat may prefer over another.

, Allowing the cat to interact with the toothbrush prior to cleaning his teeth will allow him to be more comfortable around the device. Most cats will rub their cheeks and gums along the surface of objects to mark it with their scent, essentially claiming it as their own.Let your cat mark the toothbrush as his and get him used to having it around his mouth before you try to use it in his mouth. Allowing him access to the brush at least once a day for twenty minutes for two to three days beforehand should allow him to become more comfortable with the cleaning apparatus before use.
If you have more than one cat, be sure that each individual animal has his or her own toothbrush and do not use the same toothbrush on multiple cats.

, While acclimating your cat to the toothbrush and toothpaste, be sure to reward him with small treats or a favorite toy after he has interacted with the tooth cleaning devices.If your cat seems reluctant or fearful of the toothbrush or toothpaste, do not give him a treat, as this can reinforce negative interactions with the toothbrush and toothpaste.

, This can help your cat relax while you clean his teeth. If you know your cat likes to struggle, try wrapping him in a towel to keep him from scratching or trying to escape.


It should take you less than 30 seconds to brush your cat's teeth.
It is also wise to wear long sleeves or even gloves if your cat is likely to struggle or will try to escape the cleaning.

, You should have already given your cat two to three days to get used to the toothpaste. On the fourth day, apply the toothpaste on the brush and try brushing a few of the teeth.Repeat this daily until your cat lets you run the toothbrush gently along the gum and teeth. Work the bristles of the brush along the gum line of the upper back teeth and angle slightly up, so the bristles get under the gum line.

, Once your cat is fine with the routine described in the previous step, start to make small circles along the gum line working from back to front, massaging the gums., Make sure to repeat the routine on a daily basis- or at least a few times a week- to ensure your cat’s mouth will be the healthiest it can be. While brushing reduces the plaque and buildup on the visible surfaces of the teeth, it cannot reach the buildup just under the gum line. But every time you brush you greatly reduce the amount of plaque and bacterial buildup in your cat’s mouth., While brushing your cat's teeth, do a quick scan of his mouth to see if there is anything that needs further attention from a vet. For example, bleeding gums are a sign your cat needs professional dental scaling by your veterinarian, so take care of that as soon as possible. Pus, lumps, sores, red areas, and loose teeth in your cat's mouth should also be inspected by a vet. , Certain cats simply will not allow you to brush their teeth at home on a daily or bi-weekly basis. If your cat won't allow the brushing process to happen, you can try coupling the treatments listed below with more regular visits to your vet for professional cleaning.You should know that oral health treats, toys, additives or foods are not a substitute for daily brushing.
Also, if your cat experiences a high or unusual amount of the stress when taken to the vet, you will need to consider this in relation to the stress your cat causes you during the brushing process.

, There are some foods and cat treats that are specifically formulated to help “grind” the plaque off of cats' teeth. Generally the kibble is formed so that it has a rougher texture. As the cat chews, this surface wears away the plaque.Look for food labeled “dental care” or “tooth care” when purchasing a food designed to control plaque. These foods won’t work if there is already tartar on the teeth. This will need to be removed by a dental cleaning prior to starting the food. You should talk to your vet before trying this type of food with your cat as there can be conditions under which cats should not eat this food (including mouth pain, kidney disease, etc.).

, There are additives that can be added to water which will reduce the amount of bacteria in your cat's mouth. Some of these products also come in a spray bottle so you can apply them directly to the teeth.Check with your veterinarian if these additives would be beneficial to your cat and if your cat has any existing medical conditions.
These products can't remove tartar from teeth but instead control the amount of bacteria in the cat's mouth.

, You can also buy netted chewable cat toys that clean your cat's teeth, remove soft tartar, and massage his gums all while keeping him entertained. Cats have a natural inclination to chew so you might as well provide him with something to chew on that also enhances teeth strength and dental health at the same time., Even with regular tooth brushing, there will be those cats that will need an occasional professional cleaning (just like some people have to go to the dentist more frequently than others). If tartar begins to accumulate along the gum lines, it’s time for a dental cleaning.Tartar will appear as a light tan substance on the teeth along the gum lines. As it keeps accumulating, it will become a thicker layer darkening to a darker brown or sometimes grey.

, Bacteria in your cat's mouth forms plaque, which sticks to the surface of your cat's teeth. If this bacteria-laden plaque is not removed by a good brushing, it begins to mineralize into tartar, a substance that essentially cements to the teeth and can only be removed by dental scaling at the vet's office.There are a number of conditions that can develop if you don't properly care for your cat's oral hygiene, so keep a close eye on plaque and tartar buildup., Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums which appears as a dark red line along the gum/tooth line. Just like in humans, gingivitis is a sign of poor dental health and needs to be addressed by a veterinarian before it becomes a more serious problem. , This is caused when gingivitis is left untreated. Periodontitis develops deep below the gum line and infects the tooth socket. This can cause painful abscesses and loosen the teeth., When gingivitis goes untreated, painful mouth ulcers can occur. These will appear as bright red sores in the cat’s mouth. Often times, these ulcers will bleed. , Rodent ulcers look similar to mouth ulcers, but the sore or swelling will form on the cat’s upper lip., Stomatitis is an incredibly painful inflammation of the mouth. The cat will have a lot of trouble eating or even refuse to eat. The inside of the mouth will appear reddened and raw.In addition, there are a number of conditions that can develop if you don't properly care for your cat's oral hygiene., There is mounting evidence that various body organs can be affected by the bacteria and toxins which can travel from the mouth to the body via the bloodstream. Chronic inflammation in the mouth can contribute to problems, such as elevated liver enzymes, heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes."

Look for the third eyelid.,
Remember when you see the eyelid protrusion.,
Check your cat’s eyes for redness.,
Take your cat to your vet.",How to Treat Third Eyelid Protrusion in Cats2," The third eyelid is white or light pink.If it is protruding, it will come out and at least partially cover the cornea (clear covering of the eye). As long as the third eyelid is covering less than 50% of the cornea, your cat will still be able to see fairly well.Haw syndrome is a neurologic condition in which both third eyelids protrude.Horner’s syndrome, another neurologic condition, can also cause third eyelid protrusion.The third eyelid has its own tear gland. Instead of seeing the third eyelid itself, you may see its tear gland protruding. This condition is called cherry eye, which is rare in cats. The gland will look like a pink, oval mass., A protruding third eyelid is not always abnormal. For example, it will protrude when your cat is sleeping deeply and retract back when she wakes up. It will also come out if she gets into a cat fight—a small eye muscle will pull the eye back into the socket, allowing space for the third eyelid to come out.If the third eyelid protrudes when eye protection is not needed, then the protrusion is likely abnormal. Causes of abnormal protrusion include:Significant weight loss or dehydration, causing the eye to sink back into the eye socket
Third eyelid tumor or inflammation
A mass within the eye, pushing the third eyelid forward
Neurologic problem (Haw or Horner’s syndrome) affecting nerve control of third eyelid

, If your cat’s third eyelids are protruding, her eyes may become red from irritation. For example, if the third eyelid’s tear gland is protruding, it may become red from airborne dust.Dust could also cause the third eyelid itself to become irritated and red., Third eyelid protrusion in cats can have many causes. Your vet will need to perform a detailed eye examination and perform some other diagnostic tests to determine the protrusion’s cause. During the eye exam, your vet will examine the protruded third eyelid, measure tear production (Schirmer tear test), test the pupils’ response to light (pupillary light reflex), and use a fluorescent green stain to look for injuries to the cornea.If your vet suspects a neurological cause, they may want to perform other diagnostic testing, including a neurologic exam and skull x-rays.Over-the-counter (OTC) eye treatments for people don’t work well in cats. Do not treat your cat’s eyes with OTC treatments before taking her to your vet. Doing so could make it more difficult for your vet to diagnose the protrusion.
If your cat suffered an eye injury, take her to your vet immediately for treatment."

Listen closely and follow all their instructions., Before giving your cat the medication, read the label and the literature that comes with it carefully. This will give more information on how to administer the medication, along with potential side effects., The vet will tell you how often to give the cat the interferon. Administer only the amount directed by the vet, and don’t give the cat more than that. Make sure to give the cat the medicine around the same time each day.If you happen to miss a dose, give it to your cat as soon as you remember. If you are about to administer the next dose, skip the dose you missed. Never give a double dose because you missed one.

, If the interferon prescribed is liquid, make sure to keep it refrigerated. It should be kept in an airtight, light resistant container. The medication should not get overheated. Do not shake this medicine."

Consider alternative treatments.",How to Handle Degenerative Joint Disease in Cats1," If your cat is having a hard time moving, or you suspect that it is having joint problems, then you should take it to be seen by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office, tell them what you think the problem is, and make an appointment for the cat to be assessed.

When you bring the cat in, be sure to tell the veterinarian what your cat's symptoms are and why you think that it is having joint trouble.;
, When you bring your cat in to be seen by a veterinarian, the veterinarian will likely do a general assessment of your cat's health. After that, then they will take a close look at the cat's joints. If the veterinarian suspects that your cat has degenerative joint disease, they will need to do some further testing to get a definitive diagnosis.The two diseases that are included under the term feline degenerative joint disease are osteoarthritis and spondylosis deformans. These diseases can cause loss of cartilage between the bones, inflammation between the bones, or bony spurs developing in the joints. Your veterinarian may use the general term or either of these more specific terms.
In most cases, the veterinarian will need to x-ray the joint to look for inflammation or abnormal growths.
The vet may also want to take a sample of the fluid in the joint to look for other signs of inflammation.

, Treatment for degenerative joint disease typically includes medication to ease pain and discomfort. Your veterinarian is likely to prescribe a non-steroidal pain reliever (NSAID) or an opioid pain reliever to ease your cat's pain. However, long-term use of these medications has not been thoroughly studied. Thus, you should have your cat's health monitored regularly by a veterinarian if it is on these medications.Other types of treatments, such as surgery, are typically not suggested for cats with degenerative joint disease. The inflammation created by the surgery, combined with the advanced age of most cats suffering from this condition, doesn't make surgery a good risk to take.

, There are some alternative treatments that may be helpful for a cat with degenerative joint disease. Among them is acupuncture, which can help to ease joint pain, and the use of supplements that promote joint health. These supplements, including glucosamine, promote joint health by increasing key enzymes and fluids in the joints.While there is little research about the effectiveness of supplement use for degenerative joint disease in cats, there has been a lot of promising research on their use in humans and dogs.

Look for signs of a flare-up.",How to Treat Conjunctivitis in Cats," Feline conjunctivitis is classified as either infectious or non-infectious. Infectious causes of conjunctivitis include viruses (feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus), bacteria, and fungi. Examples of non-infectious causes are foreign objects (e.g., dust), airborne chemicals, and allergies.The most common infectious causes are feline herpesvirus, Chlamydia felis, and feline mycoplasma.Chlamydia and mycoplasma are types of bacteria.
Taking your cat to your veterinarian will help you determine what is causing your cat’s conjunctivitis. If non-infectious agents are not the cause, your veterinarian will perform different diagnostic tests to identify the infectious agent.;
, Once your veterinarian has identified the cause of your cat’s conjunctivitis, they will recommend various treatment options. Discuss these options with your veterinarian. For general conjunctivitis (no specific cause), treatment usually consists of topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications (e.g., hydrocortisone) that go in the affected eye.For feline herpesvirus conjunctivitis, treatments include topical antivirals, topical antibiotics, and oral interferon alpha (suppresses immune response to virus).Topical antibiotics for general or herpesvirus conjunctivitis treat bacterial infections that occur when the immune system becomes depressed after a viral infection.
For bacterial conjunctivitis, topical antibiotics are used. Tetracycline works for Chlamydial infections.If a foreign body is stuck in your cat’s eye, your veterinarian may need to perform surgery to remove it.Topical eye treatments are available as drops or ointments.

, If you have a multi-cat household, you will need to isolate the cat being treated. Infectious conjunctivitis can easily spread between cats, so you want to make sure your cat does not infect the other cats.Keep your cat isolated for the duration of the treatment.

, Eye drops are easier to administer than ointments, but need to be given frequently (3‒6 times/day). Eye ointments can be given less frequently than drops, but are more difficult to administer.If you are unsure how to give your cat the eye medications, have your veterinarian show you the technique before you leave the veterinary clinic.


Your veterinarian will prescribe the number of eye drops (if applicable) and how often to administer the treatment.
Before applying the eye drops or ointment, you may need to remove discharge around the eyes with a clean cotton ball and eyewash solution.Your veterinarian will recommend an eyewash solution for you.
Eye drops will disperse quickly over the surface of the eye, so you will not need to rub the eye afterwards.For the ointment, you will spread a line of ointment across the eye. Since it is thick, you will need to close and gently massage the eyelid to make sure the ointment spreads across the eye., Your cat's eyes will probably looking better in a few days. However, do not stop treatment. This is especially important for infectious conjunctivitis—if you stop treatment early, the infectious agent may not be completely killed and may end up causing recurrent infection.It usually takes about 1 to 2 weeks before a cat’s eyes fully recover from conjunctivitis. Even if your cat’s eyes look better after just a few days, treating her for a week or more will ensure that her eyes fully recover.You may need to treat your cat for up to 3 weeks., Although treatments are available for feline viral conjunctivitis, there is no actual cure. This can make treatment for this form of conjunctivitis very frustrating and challenging. In addition, topical antiviral treatments tend to be very expensive and need to be given frequently.If your cat has viral conjunctivitis, be prepared for lifelong management of the condition, rather than a short-term cure.

, Since viral conjunctivitis is not curable, it can recur after initial treatment. These flare-ups are often caused by stress.Therefore, you should identify and remove potential stressors in your cat’s environment. For example, keep your cat’s daily routine as steady as possible.


If you have multiple cats, make sure each cat has her own ‘supplies’ (e.g., food and water bowls, toys, litter box) to reduce bullying or fighting between cats.
Your cat may also feel stressed if she becomes bored. Provide her with plenty of toys and rotate them on a regular basis. Puzzle toys are especially useful for keeping a cat busy and entertained.

, Herpesvirus requires an amino acid called arginine to replicate. However, when the amino acid lysine is present, the virus will take up lysine instead of arginine, which will stop the virus from replicating.Your veterinarian can recommend a specific oral lysine supplement for your cat.


Lysine can be used as a lifelong management option for feline herpesvirus conjunctivitis., The severity of a herpesvirus conjunctivitis flare-up can be reduced with ocular (not injectable) vaccination. The vaccination works by strengthening the immune system and making the flare-up more bearable for your cat.Discuss this vaccination option with your veterinarian.

, If your cat’s allergies caused her conjunctivitis, then you should reduce her to exposure to the offending allergen as much as possible.For example, if she is allergic to dust, you will need to dust your home more frequently. If she is an outdoor cat, you may need to keep her indoors and away from outdoor allergens like pollen.


If your cat's eyes became irritated when you used certain household cleaners, try keeping your cat away from the area where you are cleaning.

, If your cat’s eyes start to look swollen and red, and you see colored discharge (e.g., green, yellow) coming from her eyes, your cat is likely experiencing a conjunctivitis flare-up. Other signs of a flare-up include increased tear production, squinting, and sensitivity to bright light.When your cat experiences a flare-up, contact your veterinarian about the best way to manage it.

Inject the cat with the medicine.",How to Give Interferon to Cats with Viral Diseases2," Interferon is most commonly given to cats orally. They are given a dosage of 30 IU that is to be administered once each day for seven days. Then, the cat does not receive the medicine for seven days. After seven days, the cat is given the medication daily again for seven days, and then goes off for seven days.This pattern continues until the vet decides the symptoms have gone away.
To give your cat a tablet, you can try mixing the tablet in with their food. You can also use a treat or pill pockets that are designed specifically to help your cat eat the pill. You can also ask your vet for a pill giver, which is a syringe you place the pill in that you put in the cat's mouth to deposit the pill to the back of the tongue so they will swallow it.Talk to your vet about the best way to give the interferon to your cat.

, An alternate way that the vet may give you the interferon for your cat is a daily pill that is a smaller dosage. This smaller dosage is based on the weight of the cat, and is given once each day with no weeks off.Make sure to ask your vet what dosage the medication is and how frequently you are to give it to the cat.

, If the cat is being treated for the herpes virus, the vet may prescribe interferon in the form of eyedrops. To give this to the cat, wash your hands and secure the cat. Carefully lift the cat’s eyelids with your fingers and drop the medicine in their eyes. Close the eyes and gently massage them to spread the medicine.Make sure not to touch the tip of the dropper to any part of the eye.
To administer the eyedrops, hold the cat securely in your lap. Tilt their head up so their nose is pointed towards the ceiling. If you have an extra person who can help, you can get them to hold the cat while you administer the eyedrops. You can also try wrapping the cat.

, Some viruses are treated with an injection of interferon. The vet will give you the supplies you need to inject your cat with interferon.Many people give cats injections while they are eating because the cat is distracted and you can quickly inject them without too much fuss.Pinch some of the skin of your cat’s back. Hold the syringe like you would a pen. Insert the needle at a downward angle into the fold of skin quickly. Depress the plunger to administer the medicine. Then pull out the needle.
If you need help, have someone hold the cat while you give them the injection.

Notice any signs of an adverse reaction.,
Tell your vet if the cat takes other medications.,
Contact the vet if you suspect your cat is having a reaction.",How to Give Interferon to Cats with Viral Diseases3," Side effects are more common with injections of interferon than when the cat takes it orally. These side effects may include fever, allergic reaction, muscle pain, or loss of appetite., Interferon may interact with other drugs. Tell the vet about all medication and supplements that your cat takes. If your vet prescribes multiple medications, or your cat takes other drugs, watch the cat carefully for any negative drug interactions., If your cat has any side effects, or starts to act unusual in any way, contact your veterinarian. In some rare cases, interferon may cause damage to the nervous system or the nervous system. The vet may decide to change the dosage or completely take the cat off the medication if they have negative side effects."

Continue to treat chronic pain.,
Make your cat's daily routine easier.,
Enrich your cat's environment.,
Help your cat lose weight.,
Give love and affection.",How to Handle Degenerative Joint Disease in Cats2," There can be a lot of pain associated with degenerative joint disease and it is your job as a cat owner to make sure that your cat's pain is managed as much as possible. Pain can be managed with several types of medication, including NSAIDs and opioids. Both should be prescribed by your veterinarian.Since cats are notorious for hiding their pain, you will need to assess its pain medication needs as best as you can. Discuss your cat's pain level with your veterinarian if you are unsure whether your cat has chronic pain or needs medication regularly.

, If your cat has been diagnosed with degenerative joint disease, then movement will become more difficult for your cat. With this in mind, you should change the cat's environment to accommodate its newly limited mobility. Keep essential items, such as food dishes and litter boxes, in close proximity to where your cat spends its time. Also, make sure that the cat does not need to climb stairs to complete essential activities, such as getting to a water dish.

Make sure the sides of the litter box are low enough for the cat to get in and out of it.
You may need to stall ramps or stairs in your home to ease your cat's daily movement. For instance, if your cat sleeps on your bed at night, you may need to install stairs or a ramp to allow the cat easy access., If your cat has degenerative joint disease, it may not be able to complete all of the activities that it used to. In order to keep your cat's mind active, even when its body can't be, you should enrich its environment. Give it areas to watch the outdoors and puzzles to work on that don't take much strength.Enriching your cat's environment will go a long ways towards keeping your cat happy even though it is losing mobility.

, If your cat is overweight and it has degenerative joint disease it may help the cat to lose some weight. Less weight on the cat's body means less pressure on its joints, which can decrease the cat's pain and discomfort.Discuss weight-loss plans with your veterinarian in order to assure that your cat gets a balanced diet while still losing weight.

, If your cat has been diagnosed with degenerative joint disease, it will need veterinary care but it will also need your love and affection. A cat that is in pain and unable to enjoy all the things in life that it once did will require more attention from you. Your love and affection can sometimes fill a void that is created when the ability to move is reduced.Spend quality time with your cat every day. Pet it, play with it, and just generally show it that you care.

Identify problems with movement.,
Look for signs that your cat is hiding pain.,
Look for changes on the surface of the joints.,
Assess areas that have experienced trauma.,
Look for problems in older cats.",How to Handle Degenerative Joint Disease in Cats3," Since the hips and the elbows are the joints most often affected by degenerative joint disease, look at these joints first for problems with movement. Make sure that your cat is walking normally and that its joints are moving freely.If your cat is having difficulty using its joints, this means that the problem with them is fairly advanced. Have your cat seen by a veterinarian right away if your cat is having this type of problem.

, It can be hard to figure out when your cat is in pain because cats are notoriously good at hiding it. Showing outward signs of pain shows weakness, and so cats keep their pain to themselves whenever possible. With this in mind, try to assess your cat's pain level. Look for changes in routine, avoidance of normal movement, and reactions when you try to move your cat's joints.Hiding pain can come across a change in routine or behavior. If your cat is trying to mask pain, it will have to change its way of life to accommodate avoiding normal movement.

, If your cat has severe degenerative joint disease, its joints may be swollen or deformed due to inflammation. If you happen to notice that your cat's joints look strange or different than usual, take the time to inspect them closely.

A swollen joint could signal a variety of health problems, including trauma. If any of your cat's joints are noticeably swollen, have it checked out by a veterinarian right away.

, Degenerative joint disease can occur with no specific cause, but it is more likely to occur in a joint that has be subjected to trauma or excessive wear and tear. If your cat has had an injury to one of its joints in the past, be sure to keep an eye on that joint for signs of osteoarthritis., Degenerative joint disease is largely a problem for older cats. In most cases, it is connected to long-term wear and tear on joints, and so it rarely happens in young cats.If your cat is older do an annual assessment of its ability to move its joints freely and without pain. If you see signs of pain or discomfort, have the cat looked over by its veterinarian.

Practice parasite control.",How to Treat Ear Haematomas in Cats," The pricked ear (upright, as opposed to drop-eared) of a cat is usually normally no more than 3-4mm thick, and is shaped into a gentle concave cone whereby the ""dish"" of the ear faces forwards to collect sound.


A newly formed ear haematoma is equivalent to large blood blister, and the pinna becomes rounded and swollen. The ear flap is often tender to the touch, and feels warm or hot.
When you apply gentle pressure, you may get the impression of fluid beneath your fingertips.;
, Once the haematoma has been present for 5-7 days, blood clots form and the body starts to reabsorb serum (the fluid that remains once the blood has clotted).


Scar tissue then forms but as this contracts it distorts the ear flap. An untreated haematoma heals to form the cat equivalent of a ""cauliflower"" ear. The ear flap is thickened, wrinkled, and shrunken. In itself this is not painful, but it is cosmetically displeasing.
There is also a chance that the contracted pinna can shrivel down and block the entrance to the ear canal. This reduces air circulation in the ear canal and is a predisposing factor for ear infections.

, We have already learnt that trauma causes an ear haematoma, but how does this happen? To understand it, it helps to know a little anatomy.


The prick ear is supported by an inner core of stiff cartilage. This cartilage is lined on either side by skin (the cartilage is the cheese in a cheese sandwich, with the bread being skin). Small blood vessels nourish the skin and attach it to the cartilage.
When the cat scratches she may shear the skin away from the cartilage, which ruptures the blood vessels and causes blood to seep into the space between the skin and cartilage. It is this blood that causes the ear to swell and a haematoma to form.
The bleeding is usually self-limiting, and stops once pressure builds up in the haematoma, which compresses the small vessels and stops them bleeding.

, There are two methods of treating an ear haematoma. Both have advantages and disadvantages.


Surgery provides a guaranteed outcome but involves a general anesthetic and the cat wearing a buster collar to 2, possibly even 3, weeks.
The other option is medical management, which carries around a 50% success rate, but does not usually involve an anesthetic, and can be repeated if unsuccessful the first time.
Surgery is more expensive, but if the medical therapy needs to be repeated, costs can mount up. Also, not every cat tolerates a needle being put in the ear and may need sedation, and this cost needs to be taken into consideration.

, Surgical correction involves general anesthesia. The cat is starved overnight prior to the anesthetic.


Once admitted to the clinic she is given a pre-med injection which provides pain relief and sedates her.
Once the premed has taken effect (usually after 20 minutes) she is given a general anesthetic and the fur is clipped from the ear flap.

, Surgery is performed under sterile conditions. The aim of the operation is to cut a 2–3 centimeter (0.8–1.2 in) incision on the inside of the ear flap to allow the blood to drain out.


Then the empty pocket (between the skin and cartilage) is flushed to remove blood clots. The final step is to compress the skin against the cartilage so that it heals firmly scarred together, so that the haematoma cannot recur.The surgeon does this by placing multiple sutures, offset from one another in a staggered pattern, each separated by about one cm. A thick suture material is used so that the compressive force is spread evenly over the surface of the ear.

, Once the surgeon is satisfied with the suture arrangement the cat is allowed to wake up. She must wear a buster collar in order to protect the ear from scratching.


This is because if a claw got caught in a suture, not only would it be very painful, but it could tear the suture out and rip the ear.

, Some cats are a bit sleepy for 24 hours after an anesthetic. It is best to keep her indoors (she will need to do this anyway because she could get stuck in a tree wearing a buster collar) in a warm environment.


Offer her bland food such as chicken, or white fish, the evening after the anesthetic. This is because some cats may feel nauseous after an anesthetic, and bland food is better tolerated by the stomach.

, During this time scar tissue forms that bonds the skin back to the cartilage to form a permanent adhesion.


The sutures can be removed in the clinic, and unless the cat is fractious, no sedation or anesthesia is required.
The buster collar can then come off and the cat resume her usual lifestyle.

, The vet may suggest you gently wipe the incision site with salt water (a teaspoon of salt to a pint of previously boiled and cooled water) once a day.


This helps to clean away any ooze from the incision and reduces the amount of bacteria on the skin surface, which in turn reduces the risk of infection.
However, infection is rare and if the cat is sore and hisses when you try to touch the area, it is best to leave well alone rather than distress the cat and get yourself bitten.

, Medical treatment involves aspirating (sucking out) blood from the haematoma, and replacing some of the fluid with 0.5ml of injectable steroid. The cat needs to be of a placid disposition to do this.


The vet applies local anesthetic cream (eg EMLA) to the ear prior to inserting the needle. This does help to numb the pinprick, but as you can imagine many cats do not appreciate you fiddling with an already sore ear flap.
If the cat does not tolerate a needle being inserted into the haematoma then sedation may be necessary. If this is the case, then it is worth re-assessing the surgical option, since sedation increases cost and lessens one of the attractive advantages of medical therapy.

, In preparation for medical treatment, the veterinarian assembles a sterile 10ml syringe and attaches a 23-gauge needle. In a separate 1ml syringe he draws up 0.5ml of Dexafort (an injectable steroid).


The cat is restrained in a sitting position by a vet tech, and the ear swabbed with surgical spirit. The needle attached to the 10ml syringe is then introduced into the most swollen part on the ear, on the inner surface.
Suction is applied to the syringe and as much blood aspirated as possible. To do this the needle tip is moved around within the haematoma pocket whilst gentle suction is applied.
Once satisfied that all the blood is aspirated, the vet carefully anchors the needle tip inside the ear by grasping the hub with a finger and thumb, and then detaches the syringe with his other hand.
The 1ml syringe is attached to the syringe hub and the dexafort dripped into the dead space/ pocket. The needle is removed and a spirit swab held over the puncture hole for 1-2 minutes.

, The cat does not need to wear a buster collar and can go about her daily routine undisturbed. No specific post-procedure care is needed. She is checked again in the clinic 7 days later.


Around 50% of ear haematomas treated in this manner refill. The owner then has to decide whether to repeat the process (with a 50% success rate), opt for surgery, or leave the haematoma to contract into a cauliflower ear.
However, after two attempts, there is little chance of success and either surgery, or benign neglect is the order of the day., Ear haematomas usually result from scratching or head-shaking. Common causes of this are ear infections or parasites such as fleas. You can decrease the risk of haematoma formation by regularly checking your cats ears for signs of infection.


These include a bad smell from the ears, skin redness when compared to the other ear, or discharge from the ear. Ear discharge may consist of thick, black-brown wax (often associated with ear mites or yeast infections) or a yellow-cream purulent material (which indicates a bacterial infection.)
Either should prompt a visit to your veterinarian for treatment.

, Regular parasite control with effective insecticides is a recommended precaution against haematomas.


Those products from the ivermectin family, such as Revolution (US) containing selamectin, have the bonus of not only treating fleas but killing ear mites. This product is designed to be applied to the back of the neck, once a month, every month.
Head shaking is most commonly the result of the irritation associated with ear mite infection, and regular application of a selamectin product should kill ear mites that are present and prevent re-infection.

This might be how often to give the medication to your cat or which eye to put the medicine in. Listen to your vet closely and follow all their instructions., You should do this before using the medication. The label and literature that comes with the medication will explain how to give the medication, along with precautions and potential side effects., Make sure to carefully adhere to the schedule given to you by your vet. Give the cat the prescribed amount. Don’t give it to the cat any more or less, and try not to miss any doses.If you miss a dose, give it as soon as you remember. If you are about to give the next dose, just skip the dose you missed. Never give a double dose because you missed one.

, If you are struggling with giving your cat the medication, talk to your vet. Medication can be difficult to administer to cats, especially a cat with sensitive eyes. You can ask your vet to help you learn a good way to give the medication to your cat., Sometimes, the cat will have to take idoxuridine along with another eye medication. If the vet has prescribed another medicine, wait five minutes between each medication. This helps give the medicine time to start working before applying the next one.You should also ask your vet if the order that you give the medications matters. For instance, it may be better to apply an eye drop followed by an ointment.

Look for symptoms of a ""cold."",
Use the l-lysine treatment for the herpes virus.,
Try the anti-viral medication acyclovir.,
Treat other colds with the antibiotics.,
Use eye drops.,
Alleviate stress.",How to Treat Watery Eyes in Cats1," Cat colds are much like human colds. That is, you'll see things like a runny nose, runny eyes, and sneezing. Your cat may also be a bit more lethargic than normal. These symptoms in tandem may indicate your cat has a cold. However, a cold in a cat can be caused by a number of viruses or bacteria, so it's important for your cat to see the veterinarian. You shouldn't try to wait it out.Your cat can't pass a cold to you, and you can't pass a cold to a cat. However, they can pass cold viruses or bacteria to each other.
Just like with humans, you won't find a ""cure"" for a viral cold. Rather, your can give your cat some medications to help alleviate some of the effects of the virus. Other medications may keep the virus from recurring.Colds can also lead to conjunctivitis, particularly if the cold is caused by herpes, chlamydia, or mycoplasma. With conjunctivitis, your cat will squint more and have watery eyes, but the discharge from your cat's eyes may be green, yellow, gray, dark, or rusty looking rather than clear. The cornea and iris may turn colors, as well: the cornea may redden, while the iris may look dull. These symptoms may not show up in both eyes.;
, For the herpes virus, one of the main treatments is an amino acid l-lysine supplement. It works by replacing the amino acid the virus needs to replicate, making it so the virus cannot replicate. That gives your cat a chance to recover, pushing the virus into remission.Generally, you'd give a supplement of 250 milligrams to 500 milligrams a day. This is usually a powder you put on your cat's food.

, This medication, like an l-lysine supplement, only suppresses the virus, but it is effective. It can have side effects, such as stomach problems, but it is relatively safe. However, it can be an expensive treatment., Bacterial colds are slightly easier to treat than viral infections. That is, your cat can actually be given medications that will eradicate the bacteria, rather than just treat the symptoms.All three types of bacterial infections can be treated with the antibiotic doxycycline. However, your veterinarian may choose a different antibiotic depending on your cat's particular infection.
Feline calicivirus is also treated with antibiotics since no particular drug helps with the virus itself. You'll just be giving medications to alleviate the problems it causes. Antibiotics keep the cat from developing other infections. With this virus, your cat will also likely receive pain medications., Eye drops are needed when the eye is showing problems because of the virus. Betadine eye drops are a relatively gentle antiviral eye drop. For more severe infections, try trifluridine. Trifluridine is stronger, but it also causes discomfort for the cat. Nonetheless, sometimes it is needed to save the eye., Besides treating the underlying infection, eliminating stress in your cat's life can also help suppress the infection, particularly if it's caused by the herpes virus. The herpes virus can go into remission, but it will still be in your cat's system. It can be brought to the surface again if the cat is under stress.The main stresses in a cat's life are things like a new pet in your home, you being gone for extended periods (on vacation), the cat being boarded, and changes in the routine or environment (such as moving or remodeling). While you can't eliminate all of your cat's stressors, you can try to keep them to a minimum.

Watch for allergy symptoms.,
Use antihistamines for allergies.,
Minimize allergens.,
Try an omega-3 fatty acid supplement.,
Bathe your cat.",How to Treat Watery Eyes in Cats2," While watery eyes are sometimes a symptom of allergies, cat allergies often show up on the skin. Therefore, you may notice crusty skin, lesions, or hair loss. Your cat may also scratch excessively., Cat allergies are treated much like human allergies. That is, most of the time, your cat will be prescribed an antihistamine to help deal with the body's reaction to an allergen.The main antihistamines used for cats are Benadryl, Atarax, Tavist, and Chlor-Trimeton.Steroids may also be helpful when your cat has a particularly bad allergy attack, but they should only be used for a short period. Ask your vet if it's a good option for your cat.

, If your veterinarian did an allergy test, they should have some idea of what things your cat is allergic to so you can limit exposure. For instance, if your cat is allergic to pollen, grass, or trees, you can keep the cat inside and keep the windows closed as much as possible. You can make sure dust is minimized around the house and switch foods to find one your cat isn't allergic to., Some cat owners have had good luck with omega-3 fatty acids improving their cat's allergies. When looking for a supplement, make sure it's derived from fish oil. Also, ask your veterinarian about an appropriate dose for your cat., This recommendation may sound like one you want to avoid. However, most of the time, cats aren't as resistant to bathing as you might think. Plus, a bath using a colloidal oatmeal, hypoallergenic, or hydrocortisone shampoo (made for cats) can help alleviate some of the itchiness your cat is experiencing.Try bathing your cat when you notice they are itching more or they have a flare up.

Check for signs of an object in the eye.,
Watch for signs of a scratch.,
Treat scratches and objects.,
Decide if surgery is an option.,
Care for chronic watery eyes.",How to Treat Watery Eyes in Cats3," Sometimes, your cat will get something in its eye that will cause irritation. It could be a splinter, for instance. It could also be something like sand, glass, metal, or really any small object that attaches to the cat's eye.You'll see watering, of course, as well as redness and swelling. The cat may try to scratch at its eye, and the eye might twitch a bit.

, Cats are sometimes able to get scratches or ulcers in their eyes. They can accidentally catch their eyes with one of their own claws, or an eye could be scratched by another cat (either in play or in a fight). They can also catch their eye on other objects. Even not enough tears can cause a cat to get an ulcer in its eye, as the eyelid rubs against the eye without lubrication., The veterinarian will obviously need to remove any object in your cat's eye. A simple flush may do it, but they may also need to use tweezers. In some cases, the eye may need to be sewn up. The vet will also likely prescribe antibiotics, either in eye drop form or a pill.In some cases, the eyelid may need to be sewn closed for a period to heal.

, Sometimes, the eyelids or hairs around the eyes are what cause the eye to tear up. In those cases, it may be appropriate for the cat to have surgery to correct the issue, though it cannot always be corrected., Sometimes, a cat will just have watery eyes that cannot be changed. If your cat is this way, you should wash around the cat's eyes each day with a warm, wet cloth. Make sure to dry off the area, as well.Your vet may also suggest tetracycline to help when the tears are particularly irritating. Your veterinarian might recommend other anti-inflammatory or antibiotic medications.

Rule out allergies.,
Ask about a cold.,
Discuss conjunctivitis.,
Expect a stain test.,
Be ready for other tests.",How to Treat Watery Eyes in Cats4," Allergies can be a common cause of watery eyes in cats. Like humans, cats can be allergic to certain allergens that cause a histamine reaction in the body. In turn, that can cause symptoms like watery eyes.The vet can run an allergy test on your cat to determine if that's the cause. Some vets may come to this conclusion simply from a physical examination.
Cats can be allergic to pollen, trees, and grass, just like humans. They can also be allergic to things like milk, rubber, dust, flea bites, certain foods, and some fabrics (wool, nylon)., Before you can treat the virus causing your cat's cold, including the watery eyes, you need an expert opinion. The two main viruses that cause colds are herpes and calici. Three bacteria can cause cold-like symptoms, too: mycoplasma, bordetella, and chlamydia.While even a vet may find it difficult to determine what virus or bacteria is causing the problem, they may be able to narrow down the options to determine the best treatment.

, If your cat has a ""cold,"" they may have developed a more serious eye condition called conjunctivitis. Typically, the treatment for this condition is the same as treatment for the infection, but it's important to ask your veterinarian if they think your cat has developed conjunctivitis., This test lets the veterinarian see your cat's eyes better. Basically, the vet adds a dye to the cats eye which can illuminate problems in the cornea. The vet will then use a blue light to check out the eye more closely.A stain test can show an ulcer or erosion on the cornea., Your veterinarian will likely perform other tests to determine the cause of your cat's watery eyes. For instance, they may perform a Schirmer test to see if your cat's tear production is normal or not. They may also flush the tear duct system to see if it has good flow, as well as do a pressure test on the eye to rule out glaucoma (which is high pressure in the eye that can damage the optic nerve).Cat scans, MRIs, or x-rays may also be needed.

Have the cat seen by a veterinarian.,
Have the cat's ears cleaned.,
Allow veterinary procedures to be performed.,
Put drops in your cat's ears.,
Follow additional treatment suggestions.,
Watch for excessive scratching.,
Inspect your cat's ears.,
Look for additional symptoms of ear disease.,
Decide what type of care your cat needs.",How to Treat Itchy Ears in Cats," If your cat is scratching its ears a lot, if you spot signs of infection, or if the cat's itching has caused it to injure itself, then it needs veterinary care. Make an appointment with your veterinarian and take the cat in. Discuss the cat's symptoms with the veterinarian and allow them to do an exam.


After the vet does the exam, discuss your cat's diagnosis. Itchy ears can have a variety of causes, including ear mites, ear infections, and polyps or growths.In severe cases of ear disease, your veterinarian may suggest sedating your cat so that they can do a thorough exam.;
, Your veterinarian may suggest that the cat get its ears cleaned at the veterinary office or by you at home. If you are told to clean them at home, your veterinarian should give you very clear instructions and they should provide you with cleaner or the name of a product they recommend.Use a specific cleaner made for cats’ ears. Clean very carefully, as cleaning that is too rough can damage the cat's eardrums or inner ear.
If the cat's ears are very dirty, cleaning its ears will allow the veterinarian to get a sense of the severity of the issue.
In some cases, cleaning the cat's ears will remove the dirt and debris that was causing irritations, and thus will be all that is needed to treat the itching.

, If your veterinarian has found polyps or other growths in your cat's ear, they are likely to suggest removal. This type of surgical procedure will require that your cat be put under anesthesia and it will need pre and post surgery care from you.Other procedures your cat may have to undergo at the veterinary office include removal of foreign bodies and stitches to close up wounds or trauma., If you are told to put medicated drops into your cat's ears as part of its treatment, you will need to take care when applying them. Hold your cat on your lap and gently fold back one of its ears with one of your hands. Then use your other hand to quickly drop the prescribed number of drops into your cat's ear. Once the drops are in, fold the ear all the way back over to close up the ear and hold on to your cat.Once the drops are in your cat's ears, you need to be quick about closing up the ear canal and holding onto your cat. If the cat gets away, it will shake its head a lot, which will dislodge the medicine from the ear canal.

, In addition to drops, your veterinarian may prescribe other medications and provide suggestions for care during recovery. Follow these directions so that your cat cat make a speedy recovery.In many cases, you will need to put a cone on your cat to prevent it from itching its ears and further injuring itself.
Your doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics in addition to medicated drops if your cat's infection is especially bad or it has traveled beyond the cat's ears.

, Cats normally scratch their ears to ease minor itches or irritations. They may also rub on their ears as they clean them, licking their paws and then rubbing their paws on their ears. However, there is a difference between itching normally and excessive itching. If you notice that your cat is constantly itching its ears, then you should assess the ears for potential problems.A cat that is itching its ears constantly, and damaging the skin around the ears, may have an ear issue that needs veterinary care.

, Once you notice that your cat is spending a lot of time scratching its ears, you should do an inspection of the ears. Hold your cat in your lap or go down to its level. While petting it and keeping it calm, you should look closely at the outside of your cat's ears. Then gently fold back the cat's ears and look inside them.Make sure there is no redness, scabbing, or flaky skin on the inside or the outside of the ear.
A cat's ears are usually covered in fur on the outside but the inside has less fur. You should be able to see a lot of healthy pink skin in the inside of the ear., While inspecting your cat's ears you should be looking for signs of disease. In addition to scratching, if your cat has an ear infection or other ear disease they may exhibit other symptoms. These symptoms may include:Discharge
Sensitivity to touch
Ear odor
Repeated head shaking
Rubbing the ears on the floor or other surfaces

, If your cat has a little bit of waxy build up or grime in its ears, but they seem otherwise healthy, then you may simply choose to clean your cat's ears. Once the cat's ears are cleaned, you should then keep a watchful eye on whether the itching persists. However, if your cat has injured itself with its itching, or there is evidence that your cat may have some sort of ear disease, then it should be seen by a veterinarian.Cats are very good at hiding discomfort and pain. Just because you do not notice any behavioral changes or signs of unhappiness, that does not mean that your cat doesn't need veterinary care.

Discuss the need for additional testing.",How to Treat Feline Glaucoma," Feline glaucoma cannot be cured, and so treatment is aimed at controlling the buildup of pressure so that it does minimum harm. Unfortunately, by the time the eye is visibly swollen, the harm to the optic nerve is already done and many cats have lost their sight permanently.


If your cat has already lost its sight, it will need additional care to control the pain associated with glaucoma.
The pressure builds up within the eye because the fluid (aqueous humor) that is produced to keep the globe inflated, is produced faster than it is drained away. Treatment, then, is aimed at rebalancing the inflow and outflow of liquid. This is done by either reducing the production of aqueous humor or increasing the rate of drainage.;
, Medical treatments involve drops applied to the eyes that work to limit liquid in the eye. Unfortunately, they are less effective in more pronounced glaucoma, and work best when given as a preventative treatment for a healthy eye that is at high risk of glaucoma, or when a problem is spotted early. Medicines used for treatment include:Dorzolamide 2% drops: This is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that works by reducing the production of aqueous humor. This is the most effective treatment for cats and is generally applied 2 - 3 times a day.
Timolol 2.5%: This contains a beta blocker that encourages the drainage of aqueous humor out of the eye. It is applied 2 - 3 times daily but there is a slight risk, in some cases, of it lowering the heart rate and blood pressure.
Topical steroid drops: These decrease inflammation and so if the glaucoma is due to inflammation in the eye, taking that swelling down can improve drainage. The vet will carefully assess the patient to see if this is an appropriate treatment, since in some cases it can cause an increase in IOP.
Ocu-Glo: This is a complementary therapy, drops containing antioxidants which help nourish the cells responsible for draining fluid from the eye, which helps them to function with maximum efficiency., Surgical options are limited, especially since most cats have lost their sight by the time the glaucoma is diagnosed. This means that the kindest surgical option is usually to alleviate discomfort through enucleation (removing the eye).There is a complex specialist procedure whereby a special laser is inserted into the eye and is used to destroy some of the cells that produce aqueous humor. However, this is complex surgery that requires removal of the lens, and replacement with an artificial one. This procedure is not widely available and undertaken at only a few specialist centers.

, The vet may also prescribe systemic pain relief, such as drugs from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory group. You will be responsible for giving your cat these drugs on a regular basis and to gauge whether you are giving it enough to alleviate its pain.


However, these can only be prescribed provided the cat is not using steroid drops.Relieving your cat's pain is an important part of caring for glaucoma. In fact, in severe cases it is sometimes the only course of action.
If you don't think your cat's pain is alleviated by the prescribed meds, contact your veterinarian and ask him or her to reevaluate the level of pain management.

, Make sure that your cat gets all the love, attention, and gentleness it needs after treatment, whatever treatment your cat is receiving. This means understanding that it may have limited physical ability for awhile and that you will have to give it special care.


As your cat loses its sight, you may need to make accommodations for it. For example, you may need to give it easier access to its litter box or move objects that could be a hazard to it if it can't see them.Your cat may act strangely while dealing with glaucoma. Understand that it is probably not feeling well and that your job is to make sure it is not uncomfortable or in pain, even if it is not its usual happy and loving self.

, If your cat has had surgery for its glaucoma, you will need to help it recover. Limit its activity and make sure that it not scratching or rubbing at stitches.Make sure that your cat's spaces are clean and comfortable. This will help it to feel better and limit the chances of infection.

, This is a painful condition, so your cat's temperament might change. It might become withdrawn or unexpectedly aggressive. The cat may also seem especially wary or uncomfortable if you move to touch the affected side of its face.In the early stages, the eye is liable to water, and the cat may squint and partially close the eyelids on the affected side.

, Hold your cat still and look at its eyes. One clear sign of glaucoma is that eye appears bigger than the other. This enlargement is caused by the pressure building in the eye.


Also, the cornea may take on a misty or blue appearance as it stretches.
The pupil may also be round and dilated.

, Many cats with glaucoma become blind suddenly. Be suspicious of sudden blindness if your cat starts bumping into objects or seems unsure of its footing.


If you are at all suspicious that your cat has glaucoma, then a vet check is essential.

, The vet will examine the eye, looking for signs of underlying inflammation, as well as changes suggestive of glaucoma. The majority of cats suffer from glaucoma as a result of inflammation in the eye, which blocks the draining of fluid (aqueous humor) causing it to build up.That inflammation can be the result of a variety of causes such as a knock to the eye, or infection with Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Immunodeficiency virus, or high blood pressure, or cancer of the eye.

, To complete the examination of the eye, the vet uses a device called a tonometer. This instrument measures the pressure within the eye and is essential to a diagnosis of glaucoma.The most accurate devices are very expensive pieces of equipment and your cat may need referral to a specialist to get this test done., The vet may also want to run blood tests or other diagnostic tests. This will help him or her rule out the presence of underlying diseases, such as Feline Infectious Peritonitis.


Additional testing will cost you more money, so understand this before agreeing to the tests.
It's especially important to understand if a test will result in better care for your pet or if it will just result in a specific diagnosis but no change to treatment.Ask your veterinarian if the tests he or she wants to perform will affect treatment or health outcomes.

Very often, eye problems are indicative of larger underlying problems. Ultimately, routine physical examinations and bloodwork may make it so you can head off any eye problems.

Have your cat seen by a vet annually or semiannually.
Notify your vet if you think your cat has allergies or other conditions, like runny eyes.
Contact your vet immediately if you notice your cat has any eye problems.;
, A somewhat common cause of eye problems in cats is injury inflicted by another pet. Whether it be friendly playing or a minor fight, your cat’s eyes could get scratched and become infected.

Supervise interactions between animals that don’t get along.
Watch how new pets interact with other pets for the first days or weeks after you get them.
Separate animals that may get into fights., Protecting your cat’s eye health involves maintaining proper nutrition. Without the right nutrition and vitamins, your cat’s eyes could suffer and be more susceptible to infection or other problems.

Make sure your cat consumes enough beta-carotene and vitamin A.
Provide your cat with a food that is specially formulated for their lifestyle. For example, if your cat is an outdoor cat, make sure they eat food that provides them with the nutrition they’ll need to thrive outside.
Change your cat’s food if you think it causes an allergic reaction that irritates their eyes., If you own a long-haired breed, you should trim their eye hair regularly. This is important, as eye hair accumulates debris and bacteria that could lead to an infection. To do this, take safety scissors and trim hair that is longer than an inch in length.

If you're uncomfortable trimming your cat's eye hair, consult a groomer or your veterinarian., Cats, like dogs and people, often have discharge from their eyes. This discharge could accumulate bacteria or get lodged in the eye at some point. Because of this, you should wipe your cat's eyes regularly with a warm wet rag.

Make sure the rag is clean and soft. You don't want to introduce bacteria or hurt your cat.

, By cutting your cat's nails regularly, you'll decrease the chance that they accidentally scratch themselves in the eye. This is important, as scratches may lead to infections and serious eye problems.

When trimming your cat's nails, always make sure to cut above the quick (the fleshy part of the nail). Cutting the quick could cause your cat a lot of pain., There are variety of signs of discomfort that could indicate something is wrong with your cat’s eyes. If your cat shows any sign of discomfort or any sign that their eyes are bothering them, you should contact your vet.

Watch to see if your cat tries to scratch or rub their eyes.
Look to see if your cat blinks a lot or acts as if something is lodged in their eyes., One of the most obvious signs of eye problems is a buildup of crust or other material around the eye. Most of the time, this indicates some sort of infection or related problem.

If you notice buildup, you should contact your vet immediately.
The crust may appear green or yellow. In some cases, the buildup could be dark brown or black., If you see that your cat seems to have tears or watery discharge coming from their eyes, they could have a potentially serious eye problem.

These eye problems could be caused by infection or allergies.
Watery discharge could be worse at certain times of the day or could occur throughout the day., Any change in the eye is likely a symptom of a potentially serious eye problem. You should contact your vet if your cat's eyes appear:

Red
Cloudy
Milky, If your cat has an infection, your vet will likely prescribe an antibiotic. You’ll be able to give your cat antibiotics as a pill, drops, or a topical cream. Without antibiotics, your cat may not be able to fight off the eye infection., In some cases, eye issues may be caused by a virus or fungus. If this is the case, your vet will prescribe an anti-viral or anti-fungal cream. The cream will fight the virus or fungus and help your cat’s eye to heal.

Your doctor may opt to prescribe anti-viral or anti-fungal drops instead of a cream., Elizabethan collars are cone-like devices that fit around your cat’s neck. They will prevent your cat from scratching their eyes.

If your cat has an infection, has had a surgical procedure, or has some other issue, you may need to fit them with an Elizabethan collar.
Your cat will have to wear the collar until their eye recovers.
You may be able to remove the collar while you supervise the cat.
You can purchase a collar at a pet store or from your veterinarian."

Give your cat after surgery care.,
Pay attention to signs that your cat's vision is reduced.,
Look closely at your cat's eyes.,
Consider your cat's health.",How to Treat Feline Cataracts," The veterinarian will check the eyes using an ophthalmoscope, which looks at the retina and inner eye.Typically, a cataract blocks the passage of light and so the lens now casts a shadow on the retina when the bright light of the ophthalmoscope is directed at it.


This test helps differentiate a cataract from a condition called nuclear sclerosis, which can mimic the condition but is subtly different. Nuclear sclerosis is just part of the normal ageing process of the lens and light is still able to pass through, meaning the cat's eyesight is not impeded.;
, Your veterinarian may need to do more than look in your cat's eye. This will cost you more money but it will allow your veterinarian to give your cat a more specific diagnosis, which can help him or her figure out the most effective treatment.


For example, if diabetes is suspected, your vet will run blood tests to monitor blood glucose levels and reach a definitive diagnosis., The veterinarian will likely prescribe medication to reduce the pressure in the eye. If the eye is inflamed secondary to trauma with a viral infection, then the vet may prescribe eye drops. These contain an anti-inflammatory, either from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory family or containing steroids.


Reducing inflammation within the eye helps decrease the drive for the cataract formation, but will not reverse any changes that have already taken place., The glaucoma may be at least partially caused by an underlying medical condition. In many cases, the underlying cause of the glaucoma is diabetes.


Treatment of diabetes is done with insulin and dietary changes.
This is an integral part of treating the cataract because insulin therapy will not reverse any changes already present, but it will help slow the deterioration and maturation of the cataract., If the cataract is already well established, then removing it and replacing the diseased lens with an artificial lens can restore the cat's vision. This is a specialist surgery performed by a veterinary ophthalmologist.


Surgery means your cat will go under anesthesia. The vet will use a magnifying operating loop to make a small incision in the cornea (the outer layers of the eye) and in the front capsule of the lens.They will then remove the lens and put an artificial replacement lens in its placeWhether or not to have your cat undergo surgery is a decision you will have to make by weighing the pros and cons. For example, if your cat is very old, or you don't have the money to pay for surgery, then you may forego the surgery. However, if your cat it relatively young, you may want to go ahead with the surgery.

, The veterinary ophthalmologist will want to carefully screen the cat prior to operating to make sure they are strong enough for the anesthetic. The veterinarian will also make sure that the retina is still healthy and working, otherwise the surgery is pointless.Surgery carries a high success rate and it is possible to operate on both eyes during the same surgery., Your cat will need some recovery time after surgery. When it is released after surgery, be gentle with it and make sure it is comfortable.


Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for after care. This may include giving your cat medications and caring for its wounds.

, A cat with cataracts may be less sure of its footing when jumping, and may become clumsy. It may have a hard time finding its food dish and litter box. As a result, its habits may change and it may spend more time sleeping than it used to.Cataracts affect the lens and reduce the amount of light passing through to the retina, and blur the image. The effect is similar to wearing a pair of very dark sunglasses indoors with the lights off.
However, the behavioral signs of cataracts may be to subtle to notice, especially if your cat is very familiar with its home and can move based on memory.

, Use a bright light and check for a white, milky, or blueish haziness in the pupil. In the early stages of cataract formation, this is a subtle change.However, as the cataract becomes more mature, the whiteness within the eye becomes more noticeable.

, Bear in mind that cataracts are commonly associated with diabetes or with eye trauma. If you identify the signs of these medical problems, then it may signal cataracts as well.Has your cat been more thirsty and has it lost weight? This can be a sign of diabetes.
Has your cat had a sore red eye? This could be a clue it has knocked its eye and caused inflammation.

Cats with aural polyps might have trouble walking in a straight line. They might also tilt their head to one side or another.If you notice this behavior in your cat, take it to the vet immediately. It could signal the presence of aural polyps, but it could also indicate very serious neurological issues.;
, Watch the way your cat moves their head. If you them shaking their head a lot, they may have aural polyps., Be on the lookout for bloody discharge coming from your cat’s ears. It might be a mix of blood and pus, or it could just be pus. If you see these symptoms, your cat might have aural polyps., Aural polyps usually form in the middle ear. This means that as they grow they can block your cat’s throat. This will create a snorting sound as your cat breathes. If you hear this, they might have aural polyps.In severe cases, the polyp can grow large enough to block your cat’s airway. If you notice your cat has difficulty breathing take them to your vet right away.

, Aural polyps will obviously create discomfort in your cat’s ears. If you notice your cat excessively scratching or batting at their ears, they might have aural polyps., The only true way to diagnose aural polyps is by using careful examination to retract the soft palate, or through use of a scope. Both procedures usually require heavy sedation, which means your vet will have to do it.Your vet may recommend a CT scan to determine the origin and full extent of the polyp. This procedure will allow your vet to evaluate the middle ear as well.
Your vet may order a biopsy to make sure the polyps are not cancerous. They might also order blood work to make sure there aren’t any other issues causing your cat’s symptoms., Depending on the location of the polyp, your vet might be able to treat it with a simple surgery. This involves pulling on the polyp and cutting it off at the exposed stem.Recurrence is common with this procedure, with polyps usually reappearing within one to eight months. Treating your cat with steroids after removal may reduce the risk of recurrence.
Sometimes this might be the only option, particularly given that other surgeries are more complicated., This a more complicated surgery that removes the lower bone of your cat’s ear to fully remove the polyp. It’s a very delicate procedure and must be performed by a veterinary surgeon. This type of procedure has a very low recurrence rate, but it’s not always a possibility.This process can be very expensive and might cost up to $2,000., If your cat’s polyps are not overly severe, your vet might prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs. This might include corticosteroids. Some vets believe polyps are caused by over-inflammation in the ears, so this treatment might reduce symptoms.This will probably not permanently fix the issues for your cat.

, If your cat has surgery, your vet might prescribe antibiotics. The most commonly prescribed feline antibiotic is amoxicillin, but your vet might also prescribe tetracycline.You’ll usually have to administer these to your cat for several weeks., The surgeries to treat aural polyps can cause nerve damage. You should expect your cat to have droopy eyelids or problems walking in a straight line. There is really no way to prevent these symptoms, and if your cat experiences these symptoms you should have them evaluated by your vet."

Know the risk factors for ear mites.,
Watch for symptoms of ear mites.,
Be aware of other conditions similar to ear mites.",How to Check Cats for Ear Mites1," As ear mites can mimic the symptom of other veterinary issues, it's important to recognize the risk factors. This way, you'll know if your cat is at increased risk for ear mites.


Ear mites are crablike parasites that can live inside the ears of cats. They are very common, and usually the most likely culprit when a cat's ear is inflamed or irritated.Ear mites are highly contagious. Most cats get ear mites from another cat. If you have an outdoor cat or recently introduced a new cat to your home, ear mites are far more likely. Your cat could also come across ear mites while being boarded, but this is rare. Most animal boarding businesses check for ear mites before taking in cats.Ear mites can happen to cats at any age but are more likely in kittens and younger cats. Their immunity is generally weaker so ear mites will choose them out over older, healthier cats.;
, Know what symptoms could be indicative of an ear mite issue.


Your cat might appear irritated with his ears, scratching and pawing at them. Your cat might also shake his head frequently, causing hair loss.An increase in ear wax or any thick and black crusty discharge from the ear is a sign of ear mites.Skin lesions or sores may develop around the ear from excess scratching., Ear mites mimic a variety of other ear conditions in cat's. Know the other possibilities and discuss them with your vet when you take your cat into a clinic for a visit.


Yeast infections can sometimes produce black discharge in a cat's ear.Hypothyroidism can cause inflammation and discharge around the ear.Allergies, particularly food allergies, can cause symptoms similar to ear mites."
"
Check your cat's ears.,
Make a trip to your vet's.,
Be aware of complications.",How to Check Cats for Ear Mites2," Before making a trip to the vet's, check your cat's ears at home. The more information you can provide in the vet's office, the better. Self-diagnosis is not recommended, but doing a preliminary check to examine symptoms is a good idea.


The wax from a cat with ear mites is excessive and dark in color.
There will often be scratches of scabs near the base of the ear from excessive scratching.Cats may be sensitive about having their ear's touched if they're experiencing discomfort. Try having a friend or family member help you by holding the cat while you push back their ears to look inside.

, To get a firm diagnosis, a vet trip is necessary. This prevents a misdiagnosis of ear mites, which is common as other conditions mimic the same symptoms, and the vet can also provide you with treatment options.


Diagnosis ear mites is very easy for veterinarians and it can usually be done via a routine and non-invasive physical exam.Your vet will use an otoscope, an instrument used for examining the ear, to magnify the ear and look at its internal structures under light. Usually, if ear mites are causing the symptoms, the vet will see them.If your vet does not see ear mites, this does not necessarily mean your cat does not have ear mites. They will probably request a swab of the ear and examine it under a microscope to confirm ear mites., Ear mites are usually a benign condition but can sometimes cause complications if not treated properly or promptly. Be aware of the various complications of ear mites.


Ear mites can lead to infection if not treated promptly. Your cat's ear canal can be affected, which can permanently damage hearing.If your cat scratches excessively around their ear, this could lead to ruptures blood vessels that require surgery.For these reasons, home diagnosis and treatment is not recommended for ear mites. After watching for symptoms and checking your cat's ears, make a vet appointment immediately."
"
Treat your cat's ear mites.,
Avoid past mistakes.,
Wash a cat's bedding and toys.",How to Check Cats for Ear Mites3," Following the vet's instructions, treat your cat's ear mites to eliminate the problem.


Never treat ear mites without having them diagnosed by a vet. Anti-mite solutions could easily irritate or worsen problems with similar symptoms to ear mites..
Regular and thorough ear-cleaning is required to cure ear mites. Commercial cleaner is usually used to clear the ear of debris, followed by cleaning with prescription ointments.A cat's tail should be cleaned as well, as they frequently wrap themselves in their tails to sleep. This means eggs and mites can spread to the surrounding fur.Ointments and pesticides prescribed by your doctor should be used for 7 to 10 days following an outbreak. If you have any other pets in your home, clean their ears as well as ear mites have likely spread.Cats can be stubborn about taking medication. Have a friend help you if your cat is particularly resistant to treatment.

, Try to limit your cat's interactions with places and situations that expose him to ear mites.


If you have an outdoor cat, you might consider keeping him inside if he is prone to frequent ear mite outbreaks. However, outdoor cats can be difficult to keep inside if they're accustom to coming and going as they please.
If your cat suffers from Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) he should not go outside. Not only does his weakened immune system make him more susceptible to ear mites, the spread of FIV can be prevented by limiting his exposure to strange cats.
Be wary of animal shelters and pet stores where ear mite outbreaks are common. Check all incoming kittens and cats for signs of ear mites before releasing them into your home.

, Items cats use frequently should be washed after an outbreak.

Position the applicator tip above your cat’s eye.,
Administer the eye drops.,
Keep your cat still.,
Do not massage her eyes.,
Give your cat a treat.,
Watch your cat for signs of discomfort.",How to Give Your Cat Eye Drops," How well you restrain your cat will play a big role in your ability to give her eye drops. One way to hold her is in your lap. When she is resting comfortably in your lap, place one of your forearms across her body to keep her in place.The length of her body should be against your abdomen.


You can sit wherever is most comfortable for you—couch, chair, bed, etc.
The forearm across her body should be your non-dominant arm. For example, if you are right-handed, your left forearm should lie across her body.
If you think she is going to scratch, wrap her in a towel so that only her head is sticking out.If you would like to sit on the floor but holding your cat in your lap won’t work, try positioning her such that she is in between your knees and unable to get away.;
, It may be easier and more comfortable for you to have your cat on a surface that is about at your waist level. If the surface is a little slippery, place a towel down first so your cat has some traction under her. You can also wrap her in a towel.


It may take some trial and error to determine whether holding your cat in your lap or restraining her on a table will work best.

, To give your cat eye drops, you will need to hold her head steady with your non-dominant hand. Place the thumb of this hand on one side of her jaw and your fingers on the other side. In effect, her head should be cradled firmly in your hand, with your hand under her chin.Gently, tilt her head upward to make it easier to give the eye drops., For the eye drops to be most effective, your cat’s eyes will need to be free of discharge. If necessary, clean your cat’s eyes by putting a small amount of sterile eyewash solution on a cotton ball and wiping around her eyes.Along with the eye drops, your veterinarian would already have recommended an eyewash solution to clean your cat’s eyes.

, Use the thumb of your non-dominant hand to pull down your cat’s lower eyelid. This will create a small pouch into which you can administer the eye drops.Although convenient, it is not necessary for the drops to go into the pouch. The drops will disperse quickly across your cat’s eye,so you do not have to worry about placing the drops in a particular spot on her eye.

, Hold the applicator tip about two centimeters (one inch) above your cat’s eye. It is very important that you not touch your cat’s eye with the tip.Not only would this be irritating to your cat, but it would also contaminate the tip.


If you’d like, aim the tip towards the pouch you created with your thumb.It may help to rest the heel of your dominant hand on top of your cat’s head. This will allow you to have a steady aim of the drops and prevent you from accidentally touching your cat’s eye with the applicator tip.Place the bottle cap to the side on a clean surface., Squeeze the bottle and quickly dispense the prescribed number of eye drops into your cat’s eye.Be careful not to dispense more than the prescribed amount.


If both of her eyes need to be treated, repeat the same procedure to put drops in the other eye.
If your cat seems restless and refuses to be still, consider trying again later when she is more calm. You do not want her moving around so much that you can’t get the drops into her eye.

, Even if your cat was a willing participant in getting the eye drops, she probably will not want to stay still after you’ve finished giving her the drops. In fact, she may want to start rubbing at her eyes. It is important that you keep her restrained gently until the drops have a chance to disperse over her eyes., You may think that massaging your cat’s eyes will help spread the eye drops across the eyes.However, the drops will disperse quickly on their own.Your cat may enjoy having an eye massage after getting the drops, but it is not necessary from a medical standpoint.

, A good way to distract your cat after giving her the eye drops is to give her something tasty to eat. Your cat would love a scrumptious treat,like a small piece of tuna, after the perceived indignity of receiving eye drops. You could also time the eye drop administration with mealtime so that you could reward her with a meal afterwards.You will probably need to give your cat eye drops several times a day, so be judicious with your treats. You do not want her to fill up on treats each time you administer the drops.

, Usually, eye drops are not uncomfortable for cats. If anything, your cat will blink a lot after the drops hit her eyes. However, if the drops are bothersome, she may paw at her eyes or even try to rub her face across the floor. Contact your veterinarian if your cat becomes extremely bothered after getting the eye drops.

Ask about hereditary deafness if your cat has blue eyes.,
Discuss the pros and cons of hearing aids.",How to Treat Hearing Loss in Senior Cats1," Having a vet examine your senior cat at least once a year is essential to maintaining its overall health. In addition, you should bring it to the vet as soon as you notice signs of hearing loss or ear infection.If your cat has a chronic medical condition, its vet might recommend more frequent visits.;
, Medications, such as some antibiotics and diuretics, can cause hearing loss in cats. If your cat is on any medications, ask the vet it they are related to its hearing loss.Ask, “Is it possible that one of my cat’s medications caused its hearing loss? Can you recommend an alternative medication with less significant side effects?”

, Hearing loss can be related to a variety of causes not directly related to age, like wax, infection, or mites. The vet might simply have to remove excess wax buildup in the outer ear and canal. To treat an infection or ear mite infestation, they will most likely prescribe an ointment or oral medication., An overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism, is common in middle-aged and senior cats and can cause ear, eye, kidney, and heart problems.The vet will check your cat’s neck for enlarged glands and administer a blood test. Treatment often includes a prescription medication to regulate hormone levels in the short term and, depending on your cat’s heart and kidney function, surgery or radioactive-iodine therapy.Signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss despite increased appetite, increased thirst and urination, vomiting, diarrhea, and hyperactivity.

, Up to 85% of white cats with blue eyes are born deaf or hearing impaired in at least one ear. If your cat is white and has at least one blue eye, ask the vet if they suspect that its hearing loss is an inherited disorder.There is no treatment available for hereditary hearing loss, but you can take steps to make your cat more comfortable. Gently touch your cat if you need to wake it, clap or stomp to make vibrations, and turn lights on before entering a room to avoid startling your cat.

, Ask the vet if they think your cat might tolerate having hearing aids. While dogs usually do well with hearing aids, most cats don’t like having a foreign object in their ear. Most cats fitted for hearing aids end up scratching them out and losing the device, so vets generally recommend against them."

A deaf cat can still feel vibrations, so stomp and clap to announce your presence and avoid startling it.If possible, keep carpeting and rugs to a minimum so your cat can sense more vibrations through the hard floor., A deaf or hearing impaired cat won’t be able to respond to you when you call for it. To prevent it from getting lost or stuck in a hiding spot, you can attach a small bell to its collar. That way, you can easily locate your cat without having to search the entire house."

Check inside your cat’s ears regularly.,
Look for behavioral changes that indicate hearing loss.,
Tear or crackle a piece of paper or tin foil.,
Tap a box to make a low drumming noise.",How to Treat Hearing Loss in Senior Cats3," Regardless of your cat’s age, you should look inside its ears weekly with a flashlight. Check for wax buildup, redness, discharges, and smell for foul odors that indicate infection. Look for tiny, pinhead-sized mites moving within the ear.If you see any of these signs or if your cat constantly scratches at its ears, bring it to the vet as soon as possible.

, Notice if your cat seems unusually aggressive or fearful when you enter a room. This could indicate that it’s losing its hearing, didn’t hear you enter, and was startled. Other behavioral changes include unusually excessive vocalization, failure to respond to being called, and ignoring a food can being opened or other sounds that would otherwise get its attention., If you suspect your cat is experiencing hearing loss, you can issue tests at home to be sure. While it's sleeping or not looking, tear paper or tin foil and see if it responds. You can also jingle your keys or a small change jar.These noises will test its ability to hear high frequency sounds.

, When it’s not looking or while it’s sleeping, get a cardboard box or other hollow object. Tap it and see if your cat responds to the noise.


Drumming sounds will test its ability to hear low frequency pitches.Bring your cat to the vet for a more accurate diagnosis, and let them know the results of your high and low frequency pitch tests.

Look for the symptoms of an eye infection.,
Check your cat's eyes in bright light.,
Assess whether you should take your cat to the veterinarian.,
Clean eye discharge.,
Take extra care with kitten's eyes.,
Keep the cat's eyes clear of irritants.,
Keep up to date with your cat's vaccination.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian so the infection can be assessed and treated.,
Apply medicine as directed.",How to Treat Cat Eye Infection," Be alert for signs that your cat has a problem with its eyes. Symptoms can include one or a combination of the following:Winking or holding the eye closed: This is not normal and is a sign the cat has pain in that eye or is uncomfortable. This could be the result of trauma (a scratch to the eye) infection, increased pressure within the eye, a foreign body trapped under the eyelids, or inflammation within the eye.Swollen eyelids: This speaks for itself but swollen, puffy eyelids are a sure sign something's not right - usually trauma, infection, or allergy.
Discharge from the eye: All cats develop gloop in the inner corner of the eye, especially when they wake and haven't yet washed themselves. Normal gloop is usually clear or rust-colored. Indeed, as the clear gloop sits in contact with the air it dries out and becomes rusty looking - this is normal. A yellow or green discharge is a sign of infection.
Inflamed whites of the eye: The white of the eye should be just that - white. If is is a rosy pink or there are angry blood vessels snaking across it, this is abnormal and can be a sign of allergy, infection, or glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye.)
Loss of a shiny surface: The healthy eye has a highly reflective surface, and when you look carefully any reflections are have smooth edges and are unbroken. If you look at the surface and it appears dull so it is difficult to see reflections, or the reflections are broken up and jagged, this is abnormal. This can be an indication of dry eye (not enough tear fluid is present) or an ulcer on the surface of the eye.;
, Having noticed there is a possible problem, check the cat in good lighting. Decide which eye is the abnormal one by comparing one eye with the other, and make a note of which one it is. Study the sore eye carefully and make a mental list of what you see, such as the color of discharge, any inflammation on the whites of the eye, soreness, and so forth., Some infections need to be treated by your vet, instead of at home. If you see the following signs then the cat should be checked by a veterinarian:Visible discomfort (closing the eye)
Yellow or green discharge
Dull surface to the eye
Enlarged blood vessels on the surface of the eye.

, If your cat has runny eyes or a discharge, use dampened cotton wool to wipe away the gunk. Do this as often as is needed, which for some cats with a heavy infection could mean hourly.


Pat the eye dry afterwards.
As the cotton wool become soiled, switch to a fresh piece. Use separate pieces for each eye.

, It is not uncommon for kittens with an eye infection to have their eyelids stuck shut by discharge. It is important to clean their eyes because the infection could build up behind the eyelids and then cause blindness.If the eyelids are gummed shut, soak a clean ball of cotton wool in some previously boiled (and cooled) water. Repeatedly wipe the damp cotton ball over the eye, wiping from the inside corner to the outside. At the same time use the finger and thumb of the opposite hand to apply gentle pressure to the upper and lower lids in order to pry them open., Trim long hair away from the eyes and keep its face clean. It is also a good idea to avoid using aerosols near a cat, as its eyes are very sensitive and may weep as a result.

, It may be surprising but vaccinations can prevent some eye infections. Cat flu and chlamydia are two common causes of eye infections that vaccination can prevent., Eye infections are commonly caused either by bacteria or viruses. Viral infections are self-limiting and the cat's own immune system will fight the infection. Bacterial infections are treated with topical eye ointments or drops that contain antibiotic.


Viruses which affect the eye include herpesvirus and calicivirus. Some veterinarians will supply topical antibiotics even if a viral infection is suspected, this is because these infections could be mixed with complicating bacteria that cause secondary infections.The bacteria that may colonize the eye and cause infection include Staphylococci, E.coli, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. It is very important to always wash your hands thoroughly after handling a cat with sticky eyes, as these infections can spread.

, Depending on the formulation antibiotic treatments are applied anywhere from twice a day to hourly. Oral antibiotics are not usually given for eye infections unless it is not possible to use an ointment because of the cat's temperament.


Treatment is usually given for a minimum of 5 days, and should not be discontinued before this because of the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance."

Look at your cat’s cornea.,
Locate an oval pink mass on your cat’s eye.,
Identify redness of the third eyelid.,
Check for discharge coming from your cat’s eye.,
Take note of when you see the third eyelid protrusion.,
Take your cat to your vet.,
Tell your vet about your cat’s history.,
Have your vet examine your cat’s eyes.,
Allow your vet to perform additional diagnostic tests.",How to Diagnose Third Eyelid Protrusion in Cats," If your cat’s third eyelid is protruding, you will see it covering at least part of the cornea. Fortunately, third eyelid protrusion will not automatically affect your cat’s vision—as long as the third eyelid covers less than 50% of her cornea, she will still be able to see relatively well.If your cat has an eye injury, the third eyelid of the affected eye will cover more of the cornea than the third eyelid of the non-injured eye.;
, The third eyelid has its own tear gland, which works with the upper and lower eyelids to keep the cornea moist. In a condition called cherry eye, the firm attachment holding the tear gland in place becomes loose, causing the pink-colored gland to protrude from the third eyelid. Cherry eye can occur in one or both eyes.If you see a pink mass in the corner of your cat’s eye, she may have cherry eye.

, A healthy third eyelid is white or light pink. If it is irritated, it will become red.With cherry eye, the protruded tear gland may look red because of irritation from dust or debris in the air., Cherry eye in cats can produce a liquid discharge, the consistency of which will vary according to the underlying cause of the cherry eye. If the cause is an infection, the discharge will be thick and mucus-like. Weakness in the attachment of the tear gland causes watery and clear discharge.Protrusion of the third eyelid itself (without tear gland protrusion) may not cause discharge.

, Not all cases of third eyelid protrusion are abnormal. For example, if your cat is in a deep sleep or perceives the threat of eye injury, her third eyelids will come out to cover to her eyes.In these cases, the third eyelid will retract back to its normal position. However, if you see the third eyelid come out and not go back in, this signals a problem that could require veterinary treatment.

, Although a protruded third eyelid is easy to notice, it is important to determine the cause of the protrusion, which your vet will be able to do. Before your appointment, do not give your cat any over-the-counter eye treatments, such as Visine®. They are not very effective in cats and can make diagnosis of third eyelid protrusion more difficult., A full medical history is always important when making a diagnosis. During the appointment, tell your vet about your cat’s previous and current health conditions. For example, if your cat recently had an intestinal infection, the inflammation from that infection could have damaged the nerve controlling third eyelid movement, leading to protrusion.Tell your vet when you first noticed the protrusion.
If your cat has lost a lot of weight, describe her diet.
If your vet is already familiar with your cat’s medical history, they may be able to look through her medical records to identify some possible causes of the protrusion.

, In addition to a physical examination, your vet will perform a thorough examination of your cat’s eyes. A number of ophthalmic diagnostic tests are available:Examination of the protruded third eyelid with small forceps. Your vet will apply an anesthetic to the eyelid first.
Pupillary light reflex, which determines how the pupils respond to light. When your vet flashes a light in your cat’s eyes, the pupils should get smaller.
Schirmer tear test, which measures the amount of tears your cat’s tear glands produce. A thin test strip is placed in the area of the third eyelid for 1 minute. The strip will dampen as tears are produced.
Fluorescein stain of the cornea, which helps to visualize injury to the cornea. Fluorescein is green. Your vet will apply the stain to your cat’s cornea and turn off the lights to visualize the fluorescent stain.
If only one of your cat’s third eyelids is protruded, your vet will examine the unaffected third eyelid to see if it looks like it may start protruding., After taking a good look at your cat’s eyes, your vet may want to use other diagnostic methods to determine the cause of the third eyelid protrusion. For example, a neurologic exam would be useful if your vet suspects a neurologic cause. Skull x-rays would help your vet see if there’s a problem with the bony socket of the eye. Blood work would indicate overall health status and the presence of an infection.If your cat has an active respiratory infection, your vet will want to take a fluid sample (e.g., discharge from the eyes or nose) and analyze it under a microscope.

It may also try to rub its head on furniture or the floor due to the irritation and pain in its ears., Lift the cat’s ear flaps to check for any discharge in its ear. The discharge may have a foul smell. There may also be redness and swelling around its outer ear due to ruptured eardrums.Be very careful when you check the cat’s outer ear area. Do not put any objects or items down the cat’s inner ear when examining it. Only look at the outer ear as best you can.

, Cats with ruptured eardrums may scratch at their ears, face, or head to try to address the irritation in their ears. If the cat has scratches or surface wounds in these areas, it may be because there is an issue with its eardrums., Cats who have medical issues tend to stop eating due to a general feeling of unwellness. Notice if the cat has not eaten its cat food or any treats in 24 hours. If it has no appetite as well as other symptoms, it may have a medical issue., If you suspect the cat has a ruptured eardrum, bring it to the vet right away. Ear issues that go undiagnosed and untreated will only get worse. Even if you are not 100% sure the cat has a ruptured eardrum, you should still bring it to the vet for a check up, especially if it is not eating., The vet will examine the cat for symptoms like head tilting, pain when its ears are touched, and scratches or wounds on its ears and face. They will also closely examine the cat’s ears, looking for discharge and swelling of the ear canal. The vet may sedate the cat to do a thorough ear exam.They may put a special dye into the cat’s ear canal to determine if its eardrum is ruptured. They may also look for tiny air bubbles to appear in the cat’s ear canal when it breathes, which is a sign of a ruptured eardrum.

, The vet may do special tests like a myringotomy on the cat’s ears. In a myringotomy, a sterile sample of fluid from the cat’s ear is taken and analyzed. The cat will be sedated or under anesthesia for this test.The vet may also do skull X-rays of the cat as well as CT and MRI scans. These tests will help the vet better identify if the cat has ruptured eardrums.

, In most cases, the vet will flush the cat’s ears to help treat the ruptured eardrums. They will use a flushing solution to try to remove bacteria and germs in the cat’s eardrums. The cat will be under sedation or anesthesia during the ear flushing., The vet may also recommend oral antibiotics or antifungal medication. They will instruct you on the proper dosage of the medication for the cat. You may also refer to how to give a cat medication to help make the process easier.If the cat is a lot of pain, the vet may recommend steroids. They will explain the proper dosage for the cat.

, If the cat’s condition is severe, it may require surgery. The surgery can help to repair the damaged eardrums. The vet will outline the surgical procedure as well as the risks of the procedure.Surgery on the cat can be expensive so speak to the vet about the best course of action before you choose this option.

An infected ear can have painful and inflamed tissues along with a damaged eardrum. Damage to the inner ear can drive the infection deep into the ear and lead to dangerous problems with balance, pain, loss of appetite and head tilting.If the eardrum is ruptured or damaged, medication can drain into the inner ear and damage the inner ear structures.;
, Before restraining your cat and beginning the process of administering the medication, make sure you read the directions for the medicine. Know the proper dosage of medication to be given prior to starting.Trying to figure out that information after restraining your cat can cause unneeded difficulties.

, First, make sure you have everything you need before you start. The following items should be close at hand:Medication. Open it but leave cap on loosely to prevent contamination.
A few cotton balls
A hand towel
A large bath-sized towel

, You need to wrap your cat in a towel. This ensures that neither you nor the cat is injured. Place the towel down on a table lengthwise across the table.Make sure the towel is large, like a bath towel. It needs to fit around the cat completely.

, Make sure when you approach your cat, you do it calmly and slowly. You do not want to upset your cat. When you pick up your cat, pet him and talk to him in a quiet voice., Lift your cat calmly. Make sure you do not cause your cat to be nervous or upset before wrapping him in the towel.Carefully place the cat on the towel about two-thirds from one side. The head should be facing away from you, the tail towards you.This position should make it so you can wrap the shorter end around the cat, then the longer end.

, Take the shorter end of the towel and wrap it snugly around the cat. Tuck the end underneath the cat’s body, leaving only the head exposed. Make sure you wrap the legs in the towel.If you cat starts hissing or struggling, bring the cat and the towel up so you can cradle him against your chest. Start petting the cat and reassuring him. Gently stroke his chin, head, and neck.

, Take the longer end of the towel and wrap it around the cat snugly. This end of the towel should wrap all the way around the cat, underneath him and then around the top again.The cat should be tightly wrapped in the towel, like a burrito, leaving only the tail and the head exposed.
You should be able to hold the loose end of the towel to keep the towel closed.
If the cat is still struggling, wrap him as best you can in the towel. The important thing is to make sure the cat's claws are covered so you don't get scratched.

, Hold your cat in your lap with the head facing away from you. Hold the cat’s head with one hand, and use the arm to keep the cat wrapped in the bath towel. Using the thumb of that hand, gently fold back the cat’s ear so the ear canal is easily accessible., Gently tilt the cat’s head to the side, and place the medication in your other hand. Holding both the ear flap and the cat’s head in place, gently place the appropriate amount of medication in the ear or ears.Make sure not to let the loose end go so the cat doesn’t get out of the towel burrito.

, After placing the drops in the ear, gently massage the base of the ear to help the ear drops move down the ear canal. Try rubbing in a gently, slow circular motion.If your cat has an infection, this may be painful, so remember to be gentle so as not to cause your cat any additional pain.
Do not do this aggressively or you can rupture the eardrum.

, After administering the medication, quickly place a small hand towel over the cat’s head. You cat will shake his head, so this will keep the medication from splattering onto you or the table.Remove the hand towel when the cat is done shaking his ears.

, Use a cotton ball to gently wipe any medication that has run out of the cat’s ear onto its fur. Then release the cat from the towel.Make sure to re-cap the medication and throw away any used cotton balls.

Learn about eye pressure and glaucoma.,
Understand the different types of glaucoma.,
Understand the different causes of glaucoma.",How to Diagnose Feline Glaucoma," Your cat may be keeping its eyes partially closed or rubbing at its eyes repeatedly. In addition, if you try to pet it on the head, near its eyes, it may move away., There are subtle symptoms of a slow progressing glaucoma. If the pressure rises slowly within the eye it allows the globe to stretch over time. These changes tend to be gradual and less painful, but can be seen in a difference in the size of the cat's eyes.Compare one eye with the other to see if one looks bigger. Comparing eye sizes can be helpful in cases where glaucoma is only present in one eye or if it progresses more quickly in one eye than the other.

, Cats with glaucoma may have unequal pupil size. When the retina becomes damaged by the increased pressure, it cause damage to the nerves and the pupil may no longer be responsive to bright light. This leads to a large, fixed pupil that doesn’t get smaller in response to bright light., There may be bluing or mistiness of the surface of the eye. The cornea is normally clear so that light can pass through uninterrupted. As the globe stretches, the cornea can become hazy or misty looking, but this doesn't happen in every case.


The eyes may also appear red and have a clear, watery discharge., The vet should perform a thorough physical examination to check the cat’s overall health. The vet may also look for any illnesses could have caused the glaucoma. For example, if the vet is suspicious of feline immunodeficiency syndrome, then he or she may run a blood test to check if the cat is negative or positive.


The vet examines the eye by starting with the pupil’s response to bright light. The vet also compares one eye with the other to see if they are the same size.
Using an ophthalmoscope (an instrument that has a light source and magnifying lenses) the vet then examines the internal structures of the eye, including looking at the iris to check for inflammation that could block the drainage angle of the eye.

, A definitive diagnosis of glaucoma is given by measuring the pressure within the eye. To do this, the vet uses a device called a tonometer.


There are different types of tonometers. The simplest form is a tiny plunger that drops against the surface of the cornea to see how far it rebounds back up. More sophisticated tonometers use tiny puffs of air to measure the pressure.Normal eye pressure is around 12.3 mmHg +/- 4 mmHg. Readings constantly above 25 mmHg are considered highly suggestive of glaucoma.The pressure in the eye can vary depending on the time of day, and so multiple measurements are advisable to confirm glaucoma.

, Feline glaucoma is not curable, however, the problem can be treated with eye drops which help to reduce eye pressure. This can slow the progression of glaucoma and protect eyesight, as well as alleviating any pain associated with the illness.Even with treatment, your cat may eventually lose its sight. If pain persists, your cat may even need to have one or both of its eyes removed. If you would like a second opinion or information on other treatments, consult with a veterinary ophthalmologist., The eye is a round sphere that contains fluid and, much like the air in a balloon, it is this fluid that maintains the circular shape of the eye. There is a delicate balance where the rate the fluid that is produced in the eye is balanced against the rate it drains away. This maintains the correct pressure within the eye.


In glaucoma, fluid builds up within the eye, usually because there is a problem with it draining away. Thus more fluid is produced than leaks away, which results in a rise in pressure., Glaucoma can take two forms, a sudden spike in pressure over a few hours or days, which causes severe sudden illness, and a slower form where pressure builds slowly over weeks to months. Cats tend to suffer from the second, slow form of glaucoma. Since the signs come on very slowly and are less dramatic, they are difficult to spot and may not be noticeable until the glaucoma is severe., Cats can suffer from primary or secondary glaucoma. Primary glaucoma refers to it being an illness in its own right. This is usually the result of a genetic tendency to glaucoma. This occurs in certain breeds, such as the Siamese and Burmese, and the glaucoma usually presents in middle to old age. This genetic form of the disease usually affects both eyes.Secondary glaucoma refers to the problem arising as a consequence of another disease. Typically this might be due to trauma, such as a blow to the eye which causes inflammation and blocks the drain inside the eye, or due to a disease associated with inflammation, such as FeLV (feline leukemia virus), FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus), or FIP (feline infectious peritonitis). This can occur in just one eye or in both eyes."

Most cataracts for slowly, gradually spreading over the surface of the eye. The earlier you spot it, the more can be done for your cat. If your cat has an illness or injury, the cataract may spread rapidly.If your cat is starting to lose her vision, her other senses will start to adjust in order to compensate. This might make it difficult to see any changes in her sight. But, you should still watch for signs that your cat is struggling to see.;
, At first, you may notice a slight white color or haze over the lens of your cat's eye(s). The longer your cat has a cataract, the whiter and denser it will look. Your cat might have a cataract in one or both eyes.


Sometimes a cataract will have an intense blue spot in the center of the pupil. The spot might stay small or it can quickly expand to cover the pupil., These changes are an obvious sign of cataracts. Normally, the lens is clear so when you directly look at the pupil, it appears black. This is because you can see straight through to the back of the eye. But, if your cat's lens and pupil look milky or cloudy, she may have cataracts.If you don't see milky or cloudy eyes, but notice that the eye color has changed, you should still have your cat examined by a vet., If your cat is having trouble with her vision, you may notice her squinting. Her eyes may also be watery. These symptoms show that she's trying to cope with failing vision.The loss of vision varies from cat to cat. Some cats only have mild vision problems, while others might become completely blind.

, If your cat has severe cataracts, she may lose her vision. You might notice this if she startles more easily, because she doesn't see you approach. Or, she might walk into objects that are put in her path. Your cat might seem clumsier than usual.


Your cat may lose confidence and and become withdrawn, because she fears not being able to cope in strange situations or defend herself from other pets., Cataracts can form because of trauma to the eye, like a knock or blow. These can cause inflammation. Naturally occurring toxins can also build up in the lens which makes it turn cloudy white. This usually happens with conditions like diabetes. Cataracts can also be congenital or genetic, affecting your cat from birth.If your cat has another condition or infection that causes inflammation within the eye (like iritis, FeLV, FIV), she is more likely to get cataracts.

, If you suspect your cat has cataracts, take her to the vet as soon as you can. Getting an early diagnosis usually means you'll have more treatment options available, like getting surgical therapy. Also, recognizing that your cat has impaired vision can help you take safety precautions.


For example, a cat with cataracts should live indoors so she's not bothered by other cats or at risk of getting injured in a road traffic accident., The vet will do a thorough examination before looking at your cat's eyes. Your vet may start by standing back and looking at your cat's eyes in order to get an overall impression. The vet will check to see if the eyes are the same size and whether there's increased eye pressure (a sign of glaucoma).


The vet will also take a history of any changes with your cat (like changes in thirst, weight, and behavior). This helps rule out other conditions that can affect vision, like diabetes.

, The veterinarian will use an ophthalmoscope which is a lens with a light on it to examine your cat's eyes. The vet will stand back and shine the bright light in each eye to look for 'red eye.' 'Red eye' is similar to the reflection you get when you take a flash photograph and the flash reflects off the retina.If your cat has 'red eye', this means that the light has passed through the lens and isn't blocked by cataracts. Your cat may be affected by another condition.

, The veterinarian will also use an ophthalmoscope to look for a shadow on the retina. If your cat has a cataract, it will stop light from passing through the lens. This casts the shadow. The test is used to differentiate between a cataract and a cloudy lens caused by old age.


A cloudy lens from old age still lets some light through, unlike cataracts which can blind the cat., If your cat is young or the cataract is very mild, your vet may recommend leaving it alone to see if it improves on its own. If the cataract begins to affect your cat's vision, you may want a specialist vet ophthalmologist to surgically remove the cataract, although this can be expensive. Or, the specialist can use a ultrasonic waves to remove the cataract (phacoemulsion).If your cat is affected by a condition other than cataracts, the vet will treat any underlying eye inflammation before starting treatment for the other health issue (like diabetes).

, If your cat has cataracts, she may have some discomfort. Ask the veterinarian about giving her anti-inflammatory eye drops. Your vet might also want to give her nutritional supplements if she's developing cataracts because of nutritional deficiencies.If left untreated, the cataracts may cause blindness and pain, at which point the eye might need to be removed.

Monitor for signs of mites.",How to Check Your Cat's Ears for Possible Problems1," If your cat gets into a fight, this may lead to ear injuries. Gently look inside your cat’s ear to check for any signs of a bite or scratch. If there is a scratch wound from a claw, it will be long and thin. Bite marks may look like tiny punctures or a scrape.If your cat has shallow bite or scratch marks, you probably can just let it heal. Make sure to watch it for infection.;
, If your cat has gotten into a fight or somehow gotten a wound in their ear, make sure to monitor it for signs of infection. Some wounds heal without any problems. However, some bite or scratch marks can get infected. Signs of infection may include colored or cloudy pus around the wound and foul odors. It may also be hot to the touch.Look for swelling of the tissue inside or outside the ear. These are signs of infection.
Abscesses with pus can develop in ear wounds.

, Though rare, cats may develop a hematoma. This is a swollen place on the ear that is filled with blood. It occurs when a blood vessel bursts under the skin. This generally occurs from some sort of shaking or scratching by the cat.The cat will have a swollen, red place in their ear.
It is painful, so the cat’s ear may be sensitive to touch.

, Solar dermatitis is a condition that causes swelling of the ear tips. This is caused by excessive exposure to sunlight and UV rays. This is more common is light or pale colored cats with light colored ears. This also can happen more readily in areas with higher levels of UV sunlight.Look for skin that is pink and scaly. If it advances, the skin may be crusted, develop sores, or start to bleed.
If left untreated, this can turn into skin cancer.

, Mites can infect your cat’s ears. This can cause irritation and redness. The ears may be sensitive to touch or swollen. You may find that your cat is scratching their ears more or shaking their head a lot.Often, you can see mites in the cat’s ear. They may be white, orange, or darker dots. You may also notice the specks moving around.

You can see a white buildup around the ear canal or right inside the ear canal. The buildup is made up of mites, so it may look like it’s moving.The most obvious sign of an ear mite infection is head shaking or itching.
Depending on the severity of the infection, there may be a dark discharge from the ear canal.
Ear mites may also lead to bacterial infections.

, Ears can develop bacterial infections, often in conjunction with other ear problems. If your cat has a bacterial infection in their ear, you will see pus in the ear. Generally the ear has a bad smell. You cat may also favor the ear or be sensitive to touch.Bacterial infections may also occur with fungal infections.

, Cats can get ear tumors, especially once they are seniors. The tumors occur along the skin lining. They can look like nodules on the ear. They are usually accompanied by an infection.The tumors may be benign or malignant.

, When your cat develops problems in their inner and middle ear, there may not be any symptoms on their ear. Instead, their behavior may be affected.Your cat may walk oddly due to balance problems. They may fall down or trip.
The cat may hold their head to one side as they walk. Your cat may also walk around in circles.

Instead, monitor the ear to look for any signs of infection.

, After the veterinarian examines your cat’s ear, they may do a physical examination to determine any underlying causes of the ear condition. Some conditions, like hematomas, have underlying conditions that lead to the ear problem.Underlying problems may include a hematoma, a respiratory infection, or other infections.
Make sure to tell your vet all important information about your cat. This may include if they have been in a fight or around other cats, if they have changed their eating habits, or if they have any other symptoms.

, Once your vet has determined the specific ear condition, they will come up with the appropriate treatment. This may be something simple, like antibiotics, antifungals, or other medication if it is an infection or problem with ear mites.For some conditions, like a tumor, the treatment may be serious, like surgery. But this is usually for rare cases.

Boil the water.,
Gather the cotton balls.,
Sit your cat in your lap.,
Wipe the gunk from your cat’s eyes.",How to Clean Gunk from Your Cat's Eyes1," You will need access to sterilized water for this method, as you want to be sure you are cleaning your cat’s eyes with the cleanest materials possible. Boil water on the stove or in a kettle. Then, let it cool to room temperature.Pour the water in two small bowls and place them close to you so you can access them easily.;
, You will need clean cotton balls to apply the warm water to your cat’s eyes. You can also use a clean, soft towel or a cloth. Make sure whatever item you use it is soft to the touch and will not scratch or irritate your cat’s eyes further., You will need your cat to stay still so you can wipe the gunk away from their eyes. Try sitting your cat in your lap with their head facing away from you. Then, hold then under their chin to their head stays still. You may need to work fast to ensure your cat does not move around too much.Alternatively, you can ask a friend or partner to help you hold your cat still.
Some pet owners find putting a towel over their cat’s head and then adjusting it so their eyes are exposed can help their cat stay still.

, Once you have your cat in a still position, dip the cotton ball in the bowl of water. Then, use your dominant hand to carefully wipe the gunk away from one of your cat’s eyes. Try not to get any of the gunk in your cat’s eye as you remove it.Once you have cleaned one eye, use a different cotton ball and dip it in the other bowl of water. Wipe your cat’s other eye with the fresh, wet cotton ball.
Make sure you use a different cotton ball for each eye. Never use the same cotton ball twice, as this can spread bacteria and lead to an infection.

Watch for any increase or change to symptoms.",How to Diagnose and Treat Dry Eye in Cats," When spending time with your cat, look for a red tinge to the surface of its eyes. This signals that there is something wrong with them and that they should be looked at by a veterinarian.


If your cat's eye glands don't produce enough fluid, the surface of it's eyes are likely to get red and irritated. This is due to the friction caused by the eyelid moving across a dry eye.
Red eyes can signal a variety of health problems. The color may be caused by dry eyes, but it could also be caused by something more serious, such as glaucoma.;
, If your cat is squinting a lot and excessively blinking, it's a sign that your cat may be in pain due to dry eyes. Your cat may also hold its eyes shut for excessive amounts of time if it is having eye pain.As with other symptoms of dry eyes, pain in the cat's eyes can signal other health problems, such as corneal ulcers., If your cat has KCS, it is likely to have yellowish, thick discharge around its eyes. This is caused by the lack of eye fluid being produced for the eyes.This discharge usually builds up at the corners of the eyes.
Even if you don’t see discharge, your cat may still have a problem. Some cats are excellent groomers and can remove discharge themselves.

, There are some illnesses that commonly cause dry eyes. If your cat has one of these diseases, you need to be more vigilant in looking for the signs of dry eye. For example, if you know your cat has feline herpes virus, you should be on a constant look out for the symptoms of dry eyes, as it is a common side effect of that condition.You should also look for dry eyes is your cat has had its third eyelid or third eyelid gland removed.This surgery has been used as a treatment for cherry eye and it can cause dry eyes to develop. Cherry eye is a condition in which the gland of the third eyelid moves out of place and becomes visible on the side of the eye., If your cat is suffering from painful dry eyes, you should take it to a veterinary office to have it looked at by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office, explain your cat's problem, and make an appointment for your cat to be seen.


In most cases of mild to moderate dry eyes, you do not need to make a same day appointment. Making this type of last minute appointment is usually reserved for life-threatening emergencies.

, When you take your cat in for its appointment, you may need to assist with keeping your cat calm during the appointment and giving information about the cat's condition. For example, it is very likely that your veterinarian will want to discuss when the cat's symptoms began and whether they have increased over time.


During the exam your veterinarian will likely do a general assessment of your cat's overall health, in addition to looking at its eyes. This will help them assess the underlying cause of the eye irritation.

, In order to understand the cause of your cat's eye irritation, your veterinarian may run a test to assess your cat's tear production. The most common test used is the Schirmer tear test (STT).The Schirmer tear test entails placing a special piece of paper inside the lower eyelid for a specified amount of time and then gauging how much moisture has collected on it.

, There are a variety of medical conditions that could be causing your cat to have dry eyes. In order to treat the dry eyes, these underlying conditions must be identified and treated. Some conditions that your veterinarian will look for that could be causing your cat's dry eyes include:Damage to the tear-producing glands
Systemic diseases, such as feline herpes virus
Medication side effects (usually caused by sulfa drugs)
Inner ear infection

, It can be very soothing to cats with dry eyes to clean around their eyes with a warm, damp cloth. It is also good practice to clean the eyes before applying medication, so that no bacteria is pulled into the eyes with the medication. Using a cloth dampened with warm water, simply wipe gently around the eyes, removing any discharge that may have accumulated.Be sure to use a clean cloth every time to wipe the cat's eyes so that you don't introduce any debris or bacteria into the eyes.

, There are a variety of eye drops that your veterinarian may prescribe to treat dry eyes. How often you need to apply them varies, however it is usually between 3 to 4 times a day. The different types of eye drops your veterinarian may prescribe include:Artificial tears
Antibiotic eye drops (used to clear any existing infection)
Mucolytic eye drops (helps to dissolve mucus on the eyes)

, If your cat has dry eyes due to an underlying condition, such as feline herpes virus, then that condition needs to be treated as well. Treating the cause of the dry eyes may not always clear up the dry eyes completely but it will make it easier to keep the symptoms under control.For example, in the case of feline herpes virus, treatment usually includes immune support medications.

, When treating dry eyes, you should keep an close watch on your cat's eyes to make sure they are improving. Any increase in redness, irritation, or pain should be brought to your veterinarian's attention.An increase in symptoms may mean your cat has a corneal ulcer, which can cause permanent damage if not treated right away.If the underlying condition that caused your cat's dry eyes is treated effectively and the dry eyes themselves are treated, your cat should be able to avoid further redness and discomfort. However, in most cases treatment needs to be continued indefinitely to keep symptoms at bay.

Bring your cat to a spot by a window or in a well lit room.,
Have an assistant sit on a chair with your cat on her lap.,
Stand or kneel facing the cat, with your eyes level with her eyes.,
Check if both of your cat’s eyes are the same size.,
Notice if her eyes are red or inflamed.,
Look for any discharge coming from her eyes.,
Use a pen light to examine your cat’s eyelids.,
Check if your cat’s eyelids are flush with the surface of the cornea.,
Watch your cat blink.,
Notice if their eyelashes point away from the cornea.,
Check if the edge of their eyelids are smooth.,
Place your fingertip 1cm away from the leading edge of your cat’s eye.,
While applying traction to your cat’s eyelid, look for any wet hairs.,
Notice if your cat has rust-colored streaks on her cheeks.,
Take your cat to the vet if they have entropion.,
Try to draw a mental line of eyeliner around your cat’s eyelids.,
Ask your vet if your cat needs surgery to remove any cysts.,
Notice if your cat has constantly wet cheeks.,
Allow your vet to check your cat’s tear ducts.",How to Diagnose Eyelid Conditions in Cats," Make sure your cat is facing into the light so that her face is fully illuminated., Ask the assistant to gently restrain your cat by holding her in a way that seems comfortable for her but will also keep her still.


Your assistant can cup her against your chest or place both hands on either side of the cat. Your assistant should put your cat in a position where she feels relaxed.

, Use one hand (your left hand if you are right handed) to steady her head and turn it towards you.


Do this by making a ""C-shape"" with your forefinger and thumb; place your cat’s chin on your thumb and place your forefinger over her forehead.

, If one eye is smaller than the other, the chances are she is squinting.


Cats do this in response to eye irritation or discomfort, so the smaller eye bears closer examination later as it may be the problem eye.

, Eyelid abnormalities are often caused by rubbing and redness on the surface of your cat’s eye, so examining the cornea can help tell you if there is a problem. Irritation or infection will cause the cornea to become red or inflamed.Compare one eye with another. Both should appear the same, and the whites of both eyes should not be inflamed. Look for any large angry blood vessels threading over the white of your cat’s eyes.
If one eye is redder than the other, this is likely to be your cat’s problem eye. If both eyes are red it could indicate a more general problem such as an eye infection, but it is also possible your cat may have an anatomical problem that is affecting both of her eyes.

, Discharges can be mucopurulent (a mixture of jelly and pus), purulent (pus), or clear (usually tear fluid).A common eye problem in cats is a narrow or blocked tear duct within the eyelid. Because your cat’s tears cannot drain away they may spill over her cheek and leave a rust-colored stain.

, This is a useful tool because it throws strong shadows on the eye and can illuminate any stray hairs casting a shadow on the corneas of the eyes.You will also be able to see your cat’s eyelids more clearly.You need good eyesight to examine your cat’s eyelids, as you’ll be looking at your cat’s eyelashes and for any stray hairs. So if you are farsighted, put on your glasses before you start the examination with the pen light.

, In cats a common problem is entropion, where their eyelids turn inwards. Normally, their eyelid should glide across the cornea without digging in or rubbing eyelashes against the surface of the cornea.If you aren’t sure what a normal eyelid looks like, study your own eyelids in the mirror. You will notice your eyelashes point away from your eye, and your eyelid has a narrow rim of hairless skin which rests against the cornea. As you blink, your eyelid will travel parallel to the cornea without digging in.

, Does their eyelid glide over the surface or does it have a tendency to roll inward?

, Take your time and examine each eyelash to make sure none of them are rolling inwards towards the eye.


If just one hair is rolling inwards, give your cat’s eye a wipe with a moist towel or cotton ball. Your cat may just have one stray loose hair that comes away easily.
Most anatomical problems on cats involve their whole eyelid, in which case a whole row of lashes will turn inward rather than just one eyelash.

, Just like your eyes, your cat’s eyelids should be smooth without any lumps or bumps.


A common eye problem for cats is cysts that develop on the leading edge (far edge) of their eyelid. These cysts look like round fleshy beads stuck onto the cat’s eyelid.

, Then, apply a gentle dragging movement to the skin, away from her eye. This will help you check for entropion in your cat’s eye.Entropion is the turning in of the eyelids. It can affect both of your cat’s eyelids or just one eyelid. This turning in happens because of excessive skin that pushes your cat’s eyelid up into a scroll shape.
To check the lower eyelid you will gently pull downward, and to check the upper eyelid you will gently pull upward. This will help to move your cat’s eyelid away from the cornea. In a normal eyelid, the pink lining of the eyelid will be revealed.
If your cat has entropion, you will be taking up slack skin, rather than dragging on the eyelid, so it will be more difficult to expose the inner pink lining of your cat’s eye.

, If wet hairs are rubbing on your cat’s eye and popping out towards you, your cat likely has entropion., Sometimes entropion puts a kink in your cat’s tear ducts, which are located in the inner corner of your cat’s eyelids. If your cat’s tear ducts cannot drain properly, your cat will have tear staining or rust-colored streaks on her cheeks., Entropion is an uncomfortable condition for your kitty. It really is the equivalent of having permanent grit in your eye.


Keep in mind that many cats do not show discomfort due to entropion, because they have gotten used to having the condition and are not aware this may be an issue that can be fixed.

, If any bumps get in the way while you do this, your cat may have eyelid cysts. Eyelid cysts (meibomian gland cysts) look like small pink or brown beads stuck onto the margins of your cat’s eyelids., Eyelid cysts are not cancerous and not life threatening, but they do rub on the surface of your cat’s eye and cause irritation, so, you would likely want to have them surgically removed from your cat’s eyes., Keep in mind that some cats are born with narrow tear ducts which can't properly drain tear fluid away. As a result, their tears will continually spill over onto their cheeks, making them wet.

, To reach a clear diagnosis, your vet will put a few drops of a special dye called fluorescein into your cat’s eye.This dye is safe and non-irritating. It will drain via the tear ducts to the tip of the nose and inside the upper lip, leaving a green stain. If the tear ducts are blocked, the dye will spill over your cat’s face, leaving an orange stain.
To treat blocked tear ducts, it is possible to flush them by placing a fine catheter into the duct and washing them through with sterile saline. However, your cat will need to be anesthetized during this procedure.

Keep an eye out for the symptoms of conjunctivitis.,
Consider common causes of conjunctivitis in a healthy cat.,
Review your cat's recent health history.,
Look for the symptoms of underlying illnesses.,
Regularly check the physical health of your pet.,
Take your cat to the vet.,
Discuss a possible diagnosis with your vet.,
Follow your veterinarian's treatment advice.,
Bring your cat back to the vet if the condition does not clear up.",How to Diagnose Conjunctivitis in Cats," Although there are many causes of conjunctivitis, the symptoms are largely the same. These include:Squinting or Blinking: The surface of the eye feels hot and itchy, so the cat may squint or even blink more than usual, or perhaps rub her face along the ground. This is one of the most common signs of conjunctivitis in cats.
Red Eye: A red or bloodshot eye. This affects the white of the eye, the lining of the eyelid, or the surface of the third eyelid. When you look carefully the tissue has a rosy glow, or in more extreme cases it is obviously reddened.
Discharge: The type of discharge will differ depending on the underlying cause of the conjunctivitis. If an infection is present, the inflammation is usually accompanied by a yellow-green discharge from the eye. In cases of dry eye causing conjunctivitis, the discharge is thick, tacky, and almost glue like. Eyes that are irritated by dust or inflamed due to allergy tend to be very watery.
Swollen Eyelids: Sometimes the eye has a puffy appearance because eyelids are slightly swollen.;
, The inflammation in your cat's eye is not necessarily related to an illness or disease. Many times the inflammation is caused by a foreign body entering the eye. Causes for conjunctivitis in cats can also include:


Allergies: Some cats have allergic conjunctivitis where pollen or other allergens set up an allergic reaction. This causes the eyes to become red and inflamed
Irritants: Dust blowing into the eye, shampoo, or accidentally spraying perfume into a cat's eye can cause irritation that leads to inflammation and redness.
Foreign Bodies: This might be a grass awn that has become trapped beneath the third eyelid or long hair that falls into the cat's eyes. The rubbing causes irritation that leads to inflammation.
Dry Eye: It is rare for cats to suffer from a condition known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye. In this condition the cat doesn't produce sufficient tear fluid to lubricate the eye, which then dries out and becomes red and inflamed.

, Conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the eye, which can be a result of many different infections or conditions. It may be an infection in the eye (a primary infection) or appear as a result of a more general infection in your cat's body (a secondary infection). Conditions which may lead to conjunctivitis include:Bacterial or viral Infection: This can take hold in the eye, just as in any other body tissue. In particular, cats are prone to infection with feline chlamydia, feline herpesvirus, and feline mycoplasma.General illness: Problems such as an upper respiratory tract infection are often accompanied by conjunctivitis. In this case conjunctivitis is just part of a syndrome including a running nose, sore throat, coughing, and sneezing.
Trauma: If a cat has a scratch or injury on its eye, it can cause redness and inflammation as a result.
Autoimmune Disease: In rare cases the body's own defense system attacks the lining of the eye as if it is foreign material, leading to conjunctivitis.
Eyelid Conformation: Some cats have droopy eyelids. This can expose the inner mucous membrane lining to the drying effect of air, which leads to conjunctivitis. Breeds such as Persians that have flat faces, may also have facial folds which press hair in towards the eye.

, Conjunctivitis can occur if your cat has another infection that has weakened his immune system. Secondary signs of common feline illnesses that occur in conjunction to conjunctivitis include sneezing, lethargy, or coughing. These could indicate an allergy or an upper respiratory tract infection.


Conjunctivitis can occur because of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV). The symptoms of this disease include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, weight loss, diarrhea, dental disease, poor skin and fur health, as well as respiratory distress.Take your cat to the vet if he has these symptoms in addition to conjunctivitis.

, Like most diseases, its best to catch conjunctivitis early. This can be achieved most easily by giving your cat regular physical checks. If you do this on a regular basis you will be more able to notice when something is off. While you are playing with or petting the cat, look over her body for physical changes. Take the time to feel her body for abnormalities, look into her eyes to check for clarity, look in her ears for cleanliness, and even inspect her paws for burrs or injuries.

, It is best to get an eye infection checked out by a veterinarian. Just remember that you do not want to put your cat's eyesight at risk. The vet will take a history and check for signs of trauma (such as scratches on the skin from trees or a cat fight), the vaccination history (protection against the respiratory viruses such as feline herpesvirus, and also feline chlamydia), and use of aerosol sprays around the cat., A physical examination of the eye is enough to reach a diagnosis of conjunctivitis, however the cause is not always visible. The vet will look for contributing factors, such as hair rubbing on the eye, poor eyelid conformation, and a history of recurrent conjunctivitis problems.Be proactive about your pet's health and feel free to discuss the diagnosis. Make sure your vet is getting to the root of the problem.


The vet should rule out corneal ulcers. This is done by placing a special orange dye called fluorescein into the eye. This stains damaged tissue on the surface of the cornea green.
The vet may wish to rule out dry eye as well, although this condition is not common in cats. She will test for this with a Schirmer tear test, which involves allowing a special blotting paper to absorb the tear fluid from the eye. If the paper isn't saturated up to a certain point, your cat may have dry eye., If an underlying cause is found, your veterinarian will usually treat that condition and assume the conjunctivitis will clear up once the other condition has been eliminated. If no underlying cause is found, the vet may treat the eye against general infection and prescribe antibiotic drops.


Corneal ulcers can be very painful and treatment for the ulcer with antibiotic drops is usually enough to settle down the associated conjunctivitis.
If dry eye is diagnosed, the vet will treat this problem with artificial tears, lubricants, and either steroid drops or cyclosporine drops., If the patient is not better after five to seven days, then the vet may swab the eye with a sterile cotton swab, and send it away for culture. This tells the vet if bacteria are present, and which antibiotics will kill them.


If the swab comes back positive for chlamydia, then the vet may prescribe a course of oral antibiotics (from the tetracycline family) as well as eye drops.
If no bacteria are present then an allergy is more likely and the vet may prescribe steroid drops.

Steep two green or black tea bags.,
Keep your cat still.,
Apply the tea bags to your cat’s eyes.,
Wipe away any gunk from your cat’s eyes.",How to Clean Gunk from Your Cat's Eyes2," Black and green tea have antibacterial properties and can help sooth an irritated or itchy eye. Use organic tea to ensure your cat is not being exposed to any chemicals or additives. Steep the two tea bags in hot water for three to four minutes.Remove the tea bags and set them on a clean paper towel. This will allow them to cool.

, You will need to keep your cat very still for this method, as the tea bags will need to sit on her eyes for a few minutes. You may try sitting your cat in your lap and placing a towel over head. Then, you can adjust the towel until just her eyes are exposed.


You may also ask a friend or a partner to help you hold your cat still. Sometimes having an extra pair of hands to assist you can make keeping your cat still much easier.

, Once you have your cat in a static position with her eyes exposed, place each tea bag on her eyes. Make sure they are not too hot before you put them on her eyes as you do not want to burn or irritate her.Let the tea bags sit on your cat’s eyes for one to two minutes.
If there is any crust around your cat’s eyes, the tea bags will help to loosen it and make it easier to wipe off.

, Remove the tea bags. Then, use a clean, soft cloth dipped in warm water to wipe away any remaining gunk. The gunk should come off easily due to the warmth of the tea bags."

Discuss your treatment options.",How to Clean Gunk from Your Cat's Eyes3," You should bring your cat to the vet if you notice the gunk is not going away and your cat’s eyes appear very red, as this could be a symptom of conjunctivitis, or pink eye. You should also bring your cat to the vet if the gunk looks green or yellow and is sticky or smelly, as this could be a sign of a bacterial infection.If you notice your cat is constantly pawing her eye or scratching at it, you should bring her to the vet. She may also tear up a lot and her eyes may appear sensitive to light. These are all possible signs of a cornea or inner eye issue.

, Allow your vet to examine your cat’s eyes. She may take a sample of the gunk to test it for bacteria and observe if your cat’s eyes appear very red, inflamed, irritated, or sensitive to light., Your vet will recommend specific treatments based on the type of infection or issue your cat has. Many eye issues can be treated with antibiotic eye ointment or drops that you give your cat for a set period of time. Often, with the right treatment, eye issues heal well in cats.If your cat has conjunctivitis or corneal disorders, your vet may recommend an antibiotic ointment. She may also suggest keeping your cat’s eyes clean on a regular basis.
If your cat has a blocked tear duct, she may use plain water or a saline solution to flush out the duct.

Pupils should both get larger in low light and get smaller in bright light. The affected pupil may be smaller or larger than the normal pupil., An eye affected with anisocoria may undergo structural changes. The eye may end up in a different position. The shape or position of the eyelid opening may change. The color of the eye may also be altered.The eye may become bluish or cloudy in color.
You may also notice changes in the cat’s vision.

, The cat may show signs of eye pain. The cat may squint and rub at its face, or it may shy away when you try to touch its face. The eye may also become red, irritated, and inflamed. In some cases, the eye may have a discharge or pus.The cat may also become depressed or lethargic.

, If you notice any of these symptoms in your cat, you should take it to the vet immediately. These symptoms may be connected to a life-threatening condition. Treatment is based on the underlying condition, so the vet will need to figure out what caused the anisocoria.The vet will do a physical exam and ask you about any recent trauma that your cat has undergone. You will need to give them a complete medical history and list of any medications your cat is taking.
The vet will try to determine if the problem is due to a problem with the eye or a neurological problem.
If they cannot figure out what is wrong, they may send the cat to a ophthalmologist.

, The vet may start by checking your cat’s eyes and pupils. They may check the blinking reflexes, how well the cat follows an object, and how sensitive the pupils are to light. The vet may also test the production of tears.The vet may stain the cornea with a dye to look for ulcers, scratches, or trauma.

, Next, the vet may do blood tests and blood counts to check for the Feline Leukemia Virus (FLV). The vet may also do a biopsy or conjunctival scraping and send it to the lab if they suspect cancer.The vet may do an ultrasound, x-ray, MRI, or CT scan.
The cat may have its spinal fluid tested if neurological problems are suspected.
Urinalysis may done if there is an infection.

, Some underlying conditions that cause anisocoria are not life threatening. Because of this, it doesn’t require any treatments. For example, if your cat has hypoplasia or iris atrophy, the vet may not recommend any treatments., For some underlying conditions, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications will be prescribed by the vet. These drugs will be used to treat cats who develop anisocoria due to bacterial infections and inflammation.Cats who have an underlying condition of glaucoma will be prescribed medication to treat the condition. This should help fix the pupils, too.
High blood pressure may also cause unequal pupils. It can be treated with medication, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers.

, Some medications can cause problems with the pupils. If your vet determines a medication that your cat is taking has caused the difference in pupil sizes, they will take the cat off the drug. When the medication has gotten out of the cat’s system, the anisocoria should clear up., If the vet finds cancerous tumors that are related to the unequal pupils, they may operate to remove the tumors. The cat will be put under anesthesia while the vet performs surgery.When removing cancerous tumors, the vet may also have the cat go through radiation or chemotherapy.

, Some underlying conditions, like Horner’s Syndrome, cause the cat to have related eye symptoms, like irritation or redness. This can be treated with prescription eye drops to relieve the symptoms."

Look for missing fur.,
Look for hot spots.,
Check for strips of short, stubbly fur.,
Look for asymmetrical patches of fur.",How to Tell if Your Cat Grooms Excessively1," If your cat over grooms, it will be missing strips of fur on its body. These missing strips are most likely to be on your cat's belly or back. Some cats will groom at the change of seasons, so your cat’s fur might be shorter in some areas at this time. Over grooming often results in bald spots, however., If your cat is over-grooming, their skin can become red and irritated. Vets calls these areas hot spots. They are more common in dogs who over groom, but they can show up on cats, too. Look for any spots that are red or irritated on your cat’s body., If your cat hasn’t been over grooming for very long, they won’t have total bald spots. They will probably have strips of very short, stubbly fur. It won’t feel smooth and silky like the rest of their fur. If you see strips like this, your cat is likely over grooming., If your cat is over grooming, they’ll often focus on one or two areas. This will give their fur an asymmetrical look. So, for example, one half of the fur on their back might look fine, while the other half is short and stubbly. This is a good sign that your cat is over grooming."

Use the tunnel when you want to.",How to Use Cat Tunnels," You can purchase different types of cat tunnels. Crinkle cat tunnels are one type of popular cat tunnels. They make noises as the cat walks, which some cats like and respond to. Some cat tunnels can be connected to other tunnels at the end, and you can buy Y and T shaped pieces to create an intricate network for your cat.Some cat tunnels have dangling toys at one end and holes in the top. Others have soft sides instead of crinkling ones.;
, Paper bags make a great base for cat tunnels. Gather a few paper bags. Cut out the bottoms so the bag is open on both sides. Take the edges and fold them back around one inch to help keep the shape.Place the ends of the bags against one another and tape them together to make a cat tunnel.

, Box tunnels are another great thing you can make your cat yourself. If you have a long box, you can just use it. Make sure both ends are open. Cut the flaps off each end so the openings stay unobscured.For small cats, you can leave the top flap so your cat feels more secure in the box.
If you don’t have one long box, find multiple boxes of similar sizes. Cut off the flaps and tape the boxes together for a long cat tunnel. You can also use the flaps to tape the boxes together.

, Since the cat tunnels are supposed to help the cat venture through the house, use the tunnels to guide the cat to the things they need. Place a few tunnels leading the way to the litter box and another set of tunnels leading to the food.The tunnels will help the cat feel more confident and hopefully soon they will be able to go to these areas on their own.

, Many cats are afraid of open spaces. They may hide in closets or stay under furniture. They only like to walk around the edge of the room, where they are protected by the wall and furniture. To help the cat get out in the open, put a cat tunnel in the middle of the room.Once the cat takes the the tunnel, they will use it to to cross through the open space in the room. The tunnel provides them a safe environment. Once they start venturing out from along the wall into the tunnel, they will hopefully realize that the middle of the room is a safe space for them.

, Tunnels can also be fun for your cat when you play with them. The tunnels can also help nervous or scared cats feel more comfortable and secure when playing. Try placing a toy at the end of the tunnel and wait for your cat to get comfortable and move towards it.For confident cats, you can place a toy near the opening of a cat tunnel and let them use the tunnel for a surprise attack on the toy.

, Instead of using a toy, you can get down on the floor to play with your cat in the tunnel. Get at one end of the tunnel and call the cat to you. You can also hide outside the tunnel and play peek-a-boo with the cat., Some cat tunnels are made of netting or another transparent material so your cat can enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. These outdoor tunnels have covers on the ends that you can close to keep the cat safely inside the tunnel so they can’t run away.

, Some cats immediately love cat tunnels. Others will not like it immediately. They may see the strange object as something suspicious. To help a reluctant cat use the cat tunnel, put a favorite toy or some treats into the tunnel.After a few hours, put the tunnel up if the cat hasn’t started using it and try again later.
You may also want to make sure the tunnel is secure and won’t roll around. That may scare some cats. To secure the tunnel, you can place it between two pieces of furniture or two heavier objects that will keep it in place and stop it from rolling around as the cat walks through it.

, Tunnels are a helpful way to get scared, new, and unconfident cats to leave their comfort zone. To help your cat get used to moving beyond the bedroom or under the sofa, place the tunnels near where your cat spends their time., Cat tunnels are easily collapsible, which means they can be moved or put away whenever you want. If you have a small space or you don’t want the cat tunnel in the floor all the time, you can put it up until you are ready to let your cat use it."

Be patient during the recovery period.",How to Treat a Cat with Blood in Its Stool," As soon as you notice blood in your cat’s stool, make a call to your vet. Tell them what you saw in your cat’s litterbox and ask them to make you an appointment. Most vets will take these symptoms very seriously and will try to get you in very quickly. Ask them for any advice as to how to care for your cat in the meantime.It is important to get professional care for your cat quickly, as blood in your cat’s feces can indicate a variety of serious conditions, including infections and poisoning. A vet can narrow down the list of possible causes and create a treatment plan.
Expect the vet to take a blood sample and conduct a physical examination on your cat. They may also order ultrasounds or additional tests.;
, When you talk to your vet they may ask you to gather up the bloody stools and any other ones that your cat has prior to the appointment. Get a plastic baggie and scoop the stool into it. Seal the baggie tightly. Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands afterwards.It’s okay if you get a bit of litter in the bag as well, that is to be expected and won’t interfere with the testing.
Your vet may give your cat an in-office fecal test, too.

, Depending on the diagnosis, your vet may prescribe medication for your cat. Make sure that you carefully read the instructions that come with the medication and call your vet with any questions. Give your cat the full run of the medicine, even if they seem to be doing better. Some medicines, such as antibiotics, are only truly effective when completed.With some medications, such as very powerful antibiotics, it is possible that your vet will want to administer the medicine personally and will keep your cat under observation until the treatment is complete., After the physical examination and initial tests, your vet may recommend a surgical intervention. This can be the case when your cat is suffering from polyps, tumors, or a foreign object stuck in the digestive tract. Make sure to talk with your vet about the risks and rewards of a surgery. You may also want to seek out a second opinion before moving forward.For example, you might ask, “What is the recovery time for a surgery of this nature?” Or, “How will you put my cat under for the procedure?”

, As you seek out professional assistance for your cat, make sure to ask the vet to clarify how much each procedure will cost you. Get a clear financial figure before you okay any action. Taking care of a cat with blood in their stool can get expensive quickly, so you may want to contact vets who offer a discount on long-term care.For example, the average cost of treating a cat suffering from blood in their stool is $800. This cost can rise if long-term care is needed.

, If you think that your cat has eaten something poisonous or harmful, then go immediately to a vet ER. If your cat has thick, black, tarry stools, then visit the vet quickly as well. If blood in the stool is accompanied by a fever or vomiting, then your cat may need emergency assistance, too.You can find an emergency vet in your area by entering “emergency vet” and your city into a search engine. You can also call the after hours number for your standard vet., Intestinal problems and diarrhea can dehydrate your cat very quickly. Make sure that you keep a water bowl available and accessible for your cat. Many cats actually prefer to drink moving water, so a fountain style bowl is a great option. You can tell if your cat is dehydrated by lightly pinching the folded skin behind their neck. In a dehydrated cat, the skin takes a while to return to its flat position or remains bunched up.You can also give your cat a 50-50 water and Pedialyte solution in their bowl.
Be aware that dehydration can hit senior cats particularly hard. Don’t be surprised if your vet suggests an IV if your older cat gets dehydrated.

, Your vet might suggest some dietary changes for your cat, or you may take the initiative on your own. You can put your cat on a bland ground beef and rice diet by gradually switching out their meals over time. Quick dietary changes can make intestinal problems worse, while also making your cat more stressed.It is possible that your vet will ask you to withhold food from your cat for up to one day. You can give your cat water during this period, but the temporary food stoppage is intended to allow your cat’s digestive system to “reset.”Your vet may also recommend a modified diet if they think that a food allergy is causing your cat’s bloody stools., Some foods naturally irritate a cat’s digestive system. Try not to give your cat dairy products, not matter how much they seem to like them. Milk, yogurt, or cheese can result in your cat suffering from severe gas or other intestinal problems. If these problems are severe enough, then your cat can create bloody stools., Colitis occurs when your cat’s intestines are irritated and inflamed. If your cat is stressed, they are more likely to suffer from colitis. To keep your cat calm, try to minimize any major changes in routine, such as moves or new additions to the household. Wait to introduce another cat or dog into your home until your present cat feels better., After talking with your vet, you might want to give your cat natural supplements in order to improve their digestive health. Elm extract can add fiber to your cat’s diet. Peppermint can minimize the presence of diarrhea and irritation. As with any other medication, follow all dosing guidelines closely.If you give your cat a supplement, make sure to talk with your vet about any potential warnings or side effects. For example, slippery elm can cause abortions in some animals and may also trigger an allergic reaction., Your cat’s everyday behaviors may give an indication as to whether they are feeling better or worse. Pay close attention to their eating and drinking habits as your cat may stop eating entirely if suffering from digestive issues. Acting overly hungry and gorging can be another sign of problems. Reach out to your vet if your cat seems to lack energy as well.Try to watch your cat use the litterbox to observe any signs of stress as they pass stools. If your cat appears to strain or is shaking, or if they make repeated trips to the litterbox without producing any stools or urine, then that can be a sign of a problem., An adult cat should produce stools on an average of once a day. Their stools should be 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long and about .5 inches (1.3 cm) wide. They should be brown in appearance, sometimes lightening to tan. The odor can be noticeable, but should not be lingering or too strong., There are many types of blood that can be present in your cat’s stool and they all indicate different things in the body. Blood that appears red or pink can mean that the problem originated in the lower intestine or anal region. If the blood appears black or brown, then the problem likely exists in the small intestine and may be more problematic as a result., Your cat’s stools should be fairly firm in appearance. You should be able to pick up the stools with a scooper without them running through the gaps. When the colon is not operating properly, then water mixes with feces and creates stool that is loose and resembles diarrhea. On the other hand, rock hard stools can mean that the digestive system is not properly lubricated and your cat may be dehydrated., It is possible that your cat may take a while to recover from bloody stools, especially if they indicate an underlying digestive problem. Your cat may even need to spend part of their recovery period at the vet under observation. Just try to follow the vet’s instructions and this should speed up the recovery."

Keep the diffuser in place for at least a month.,
Replace the diffuser head after approximately 6 months.",How to Treat Cat Behavioral Problems Using Pheromones," Pheromones can relax cats and prevent them from urinating outside the litterbox. However, urinating out of the box can also be a symptom of other issues, including serious medical problems that require intervention from a professional veterinarian.Cats rarely defecate outside of their box, but evidence suggests that pheromones can help prevent this behavior as well, if it arises.
If your cat does not respond in a few days to pheromones, take it to the veterinarian for an examination. Peeing outside of the box, especially in male cats, can be a sign of urinary tract obstructions that can be deadly.;
, Scratching, like urinating, can be a way for cats to mark territory. Pheromones will help stop this behavior. However, the problem could also be that you haven’t provided enough scratching posts.Cats need to scratch and if you don’t provide scratching posts they will scratch your furniture instead. Be sure to have at least one scratching post per cat in the house.
Do not spray scratching posts. This will discourage your cat from scratching the post. This, in turn, might encourage your cat to scratch furniture and other household items you would prefer it not scratch., Cats often fight each other because of stress. Spray pheromones to help prevent fights between your cats., Cats are extremely uncomfortable in new environments. Visits to the veterinarian or moving to a new home cause anxiety and can cause bad behavior, including urinating out of the litter box. Spray pheromones in your cat’s carrier whenever it leaves the home., Spraying pheromones on new additions to your home, like furniture, will make your cat more comfortable with them. This can help eliminating scratching., If you are bringing home a new, crying baby or doing repairs on your house, these noises are likely to upset your cat. Spraying pheromones in advance can help head off bad behavior., If you don’t clean the urine first, it will continue to draw the cat to mark the territory. Blot the surface with paper towels or cloth towels that you don’t mind throwing away. Then apply a store-bought cleaner specifically designed for picking up cat urine and let it sit for a couple of hours before vacuuming it up. Never use ammonia cleaners; they will only make the pee smell worse.For a homemade solution, try mixing 1 ½ cups of warm water with ½ cup of vinegar. Put it on the stain, and then, after 3-5 minutes, add baking soda. Allow it to sit for approximately eight hours and then vacuum it up. Repeat if it necessary., Standing a couple inches away from the spot, press down to spray the pheromones. Spray eight to ten pumps of the pheromones. Target spots that your cat likes to scratch or urinate on.The spray is the preferred method for delivering pheromones when your cat is scratching one object in particular or when you are prepping a carrier for a trip. In all other cases, the diffuser is preferred because it is longer lasting and spread out more widely., After a few hours, the pheromones will begin to fade. Respray target spots ever few hours for best results Continue respraying until cat’s behavior improves or until the cause of its stress is eliminated., Pheromone sprays are largely composed of alcohol, which can be dangerous if sprayed on your cat. Also, do not spray it on something that the cat is wearing, because this poses similar risks.Some companies now sell collars that purport to safely distribute pheromones wherever the cat goes. These have not been as thoroughly tested as sprays or diffusers.

, If your cat is peeing in a particular room, you can place the diffuser in there to discourage bad behavior. If the cat’s problems aren’t isolated to a single room, place the diffuser where the cat spends most of its time, so it will have as much exposure as possible.

If your cat is scratching up furniture in one room, you can also place the diffuser there.The diffuser will fill an entire room, of up to 700 sq. feet, but is unlikely to affect areas outside of a confined room., If you know that some changes will be occurring in the household that are likely to bother the cat, install the diffuser in advance. This way your cat will already be calm before the change.

Examples of changes that could provoke a reaction include: getting a new cat, rearranging furniture, bringing a baby home, or having a lot of company., Be sure that there is nothing in the top outlet that will obstruct pheromones from being released. Do not place it behind a couch, in a cabinet, or by an open window., The diffuser will have a removable chamber filled with liquid. When this gets low, which should be after approximately 30 days, purchase a refill. Remove the chamber and replace it with a similar one., It often takes at least a month for a cat to adapt to changes in its environment. If it does not seem to have adapted to changes after a month, continue to use the diffuser to help calm your cat.Your cat might not have adapted yet if it is still hiding, fighting, or marking territory.
A good sign that your cat is comfortable is that it rubs something with its head. Particularly, if you see that your cat has begun rubbing an area that it used to mark with its cheek, this means that it now feels comfortable with it. If you don’t see your cat performing this act, consider extending the use of pheromones.

, The part of the diffuser that plugs into the outlet is also subject to wear and tear. After about 6 months, purchase a new diffuser and replace it."

Work with a local shelter or humane society.,
Schedule a kitten shower in the spring.,
Recruit around twenty volunteers.,
Assign tasks to each volunteer.,
Ask local businesses to provide food and prizes.,
Purchase decorations and supplies from the dollar store.,
Ask local pet-related businesses to collect donations.,
Set up a system for collecting money donations.",How to Throw a Kitten Shower1," If you’re not already affiliated with one, contact a local animal shelter or humane society. Let them know that you’re interested in throwing a kitten shower to benefit their organization.While shelters and humane societies often plan their own kitten showers, they make great projects for Girl and Boy Scout troops, church or civic organizations, or a group of animal loving friends.
A shower is typically held at the shelter or humane society it benefits.;
, In the Northern Hemisphere, many shelters are in greatest need during the month of April. While a shelter or humane society would doubtlessly benefit from a charitable event any time of the year, a springtime shower will have the greatest impact., A kitten shower involves lots of groundwork and careful planning. Recruiting around twenty volunteers will make sure the work is accomplished without one or a few people getting overwhelmed.The shelter or humane society likely has a pool of regular volunteers. Recruit helpers from this pool and send out a request to the shelter's email list. Their staff can also help plan and run the event.
Find additional volunteers by asking other members of your troop or organization, coworkers, or neighbors. If you have kids, ask around their daycare or school.

, Once you’ve assembled your team, make sure everyone has a clear task or tasks. Examples of duties that you should delegate include:Set up and clean up crews
Invitation and press release design
Marketing coordinator
Foster and adoption coordinators (likely members of the shelter’s staff)
Food prep and serving
Donation collectors
Raffle and game coordinators

, Ask local restaurants to donate food as soon as possible, preferably months in advance. Many have a limited budget for charitable donations, so you’ll want to make sure they can provide you with some light bites.Ask multiple restaurants to donate one appetizer instead of relying on one to cater the entire event. Ask in person or send a friendly email.
If the shelter or humane society can provide a charitable donation receipt so the restaurant can use the donation as a tax write-off, use that as an incentive.
You should also see if a restaurant or other local business can provide a gift certificate or other prizes that you can use for raffles and games., Buy balloons, streamers, tablecloths, cups, plates, napkins, and other items from a dollar store to keep your budget low. You should be able to decorate and supply the event for less than $100 (US).You can also see if restaurants donating food can also supply serving-ware and napkins.

, You don’t have to limit donation drop-offs to the shower date and location. Ask local pet supply stores, groomers, and other pet-related businesses if they can set up a donation station on premises.Ask if they’re willing to accept donations throughout the entire month instead of just on the day of the shower.

, Not everyone will want to donate supplies, so you should make sure you’re able to field cash donations. Make sure your system is simple and secure. To enable guests to donate money via credit or debit, use a mobile credit card reader linked to an account in the shelter’s name.For example, some shelters in Florida, USA, use WeGive.org to collect donations in multiple payment methods. The site also allows shelters to list information about what various dollar amounts will buy, like toys, food, and veterinary care."

Pay attention to their grooming time.,
Pay attention to where they groom.,
Check for excessive grooming in the genital area.,
Pay attention to your cat’s behavior.,
Check if your cat is producing more hairballs.",How to Tell if Your Cat Grooms Excessively2," Cats spend a lot of time in their day grooming - 30 to 50 percent of the time they are awake. Each cat is different and you'll know your cat's behavior better than anyone. If your cat seems to be grooming more than usual, they're probably over grooming., Cats who over groom tend to focus on the same spot. These spots are often not a usual grooming place for cats. So, for example, if your cat is spending a lot of time grooming its belly, back or rear legs, it is likely over grooming.Cats do groom certain areas more often than others. For example, they’ll groom their faces after they eat, and might spend quite a bit of time on their front paws, neck, chest, and shoulders., All cats need to clean themselves, but if your cat is spending a lot of timing grooming its genital area, they might indicate a urinary infection, which can be fatal to cats. If you notice this behavior in your cat, take them to the vet right away., There are other symptoms of over grooming that don’t have anything to do with actual grooming practices. If your cat’s behavior suddenly changes, check their bodies to see if you see signs of over grooming. For example, if your usually social cat is suddenly withdrawn or your generally independent cat is suddenly overly clingy, there might be something else going on.

, Cats that over groom, especially long-haired cats, will likely produce more hairballs than usual because they'll be ingesting more hair. If you notice your cat is bringing up more hairballs than they usually do, they might be over grooming.

Check their food.,
Look at your cat’s skin.,
Evaluate environmental factors.,
Take your cat to the vet.",How to Tell if Your Cat Grooms Excessively3," Switching your cat's food can cause an allergic reaction, which might cause over grooming. If you've recently switched their food to a different brand, this might be the cause., If your cat seems to be over grooming, check their skin where most of the over grooming seems to occur. If it looks or feels dry and flaky, their over grooming might be in response to dry skin that itches., Some cats over groom as a way to deal with stress. If you think your cat is over grooming, consider changes to their environment. Have you moved recently? Had a new baby? Changed the cat’s routine? These can all cause stress for your cat and they might over groom in response., If you suspect that your cat is over grooming, take it to the vet. The vet can check for certain causes of over grooming - like the presence of parasites or an allergic reaction - better than you can at home. The vet can also prescribe medication if it's necessary."

Give your kitten shower a catchy name.,
Design promotional materials.,
Promote the event online.,
Share a wishlist of needed supplies.,
Issue a press release to local media.",How to Throw a Kitten Shower2," A great name will help grab attention and encourage attendance. Go with a cute, clever, or seasonal name and theme to spark the interest of your community.For example, the Jacksonville Humane Shelter has held “Pitter Patter of Little Paws Kitten Shower” and “Purrs and Paws Kitten Shower.”

, Tap the graphic design talents of a volunteer or see if someone on the shelter staff can design invitations, flyers, and other promotional materials. Include the date, time, and location of the event, as well as a list of needed supplies that guests can donate.It’s always a good idea to include lots of kitten pictures on your invitations and flyers.
If the shelter or humane society office can’t print a high volume of flyers, ask a local print shop for a donation. Post printed flyers in locations like restaurants, coffee shops, pet stores, groomers.

, In the weeks leading up to the shower, have your volunteers promote the event regularly via their Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. If the shelter has an email list, send an invitation and one or two reminder emails. Post information about the event on the shelter website and social media accounts. If your troop, group, or organization has a web presence, be sure to promote the shower there as well., Let people know exactly what the shelter or humane society needs, from food and water bowls to cat nail clippers. Include the list on the flyers and invitations. Consider using an online registry to help ensure a broader range of items.You can create an Amazon.com registry and share it via email and social media. You can find instructions on how to make a registry in Amazon’s help section., Three weeks before the event, send a press release that describes the event to your local newspapers and news channels. Send another press release three days before the event.At the top, title the press release with a concise headline, such as, ""Local Animal Shelter Hosts Kitten Shower and Supply Drive.""
Include the event's location, date, time, and a brief description of the shower. Be sure to list suggested donations.
Include contact information for the shelter and shower organizer in case a media outlet has questions or wants an interview.

Clean up and save decorations for next year.",How to Throw a Kitten Shower3," Contact all of your volunteers to make sure everyone understands their assignments. If possible, schedule a meeting within a week of the event to sort out last minute details.


Make sure set up and clean up crews know how early to arrive and have an idea of how late they’ll be staying.
Contact any restaurants donating food to confirm your arrangements. Confirm any other gift or prize donations with other businesses.
If any volunteers are preparing food, gently remind them and confirm what they’re bringing.

, On the day of the event, have one volunteer in charge of each game. Fun fundraising games and raffles include:A raffle drawing where the winners get to name kittens
Raffle drawings for donated gift certificates and gift baskets
Pin the tail on the kitten (or pin the kitten on the cat lady)
Word scrambles, crosswords, and guessing games

, In addition to entertainment, you should set up an informational table to educate guests about fostering and adopting kittens. Have members of the shelter staff volunteer to coordinate this station.If you elect to offer adoptions the day of the shower, have around ten kittens on hand in a play corral or pen at the shower. Remember that you’ll need extra volunteers to keep the kittens.
Have the shelter ask current pet foster parents to help at the foster table and provide information about the fostering process.

, You’ll need to designate a spot for people to place donated kitten supplies. A playpen is a cute option and, like the kitten shower itself, it’s a fun reference to a baby shower.See if a volunteer has a playpen they can lend for the day. You can also look for one at a local thrift shop.

, After throwing your successful kitten shower, rally your clean up crew and break down the event. Be sure to be as delicate as possible when breaking down decorations and packing up party supplies. Reuse as much as possible to cut the costs of next year’s shower."

Increase your cat's water intake.",How to Treat Frequent Urination in Cats," Before visiting your vet to look into medical causes, look for signs that the problem is behavioral. Your cat urinating outside of the litter box could indicate urine-marking, which is likely to occur in an area of your home that you, other family members, or another pet enjoy spending time.

To get help dealing with such behavioral issues, search for a certified animal behavior consultant near you by visiting the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants' website at http://iaabc.org/consultants/cat.Urine marking can be due to a change in the household, like getting a new pet or moving furniture around. Try to make changes gradually to help your cat adjust.;
, While frequent urination is somewhat common in cats, specific details about your cat's symptoms may assist your vet in determining the cause. Write your observations in a journal over the course of several days. Note how often your cat visits the litterbox, how much urine it actually expels, and how much water it is drinking.For instance, frequent attempts to urinate with little success may be because of an infection or bladder irritation.
Excessive drinking and urinating may be a result of diabetes or hypothyroidism.

, If your cat is displaying signs of frequent urination, schedule a visit to your veterinarian as soon as possible. Share all relevant information about your cat's symptoms with the vet (e.g. frequency of urination, amount of urine produced) so that they can test for possible illnesses. In the worst case, surgery might be necessary to address the problem (e.g. a pituitary tumour).Be sure to mention to (or remind) your vet of any medications that your cat might be on, that may have side effects contributing to your cat's frequent urination.
If your cat's frequent urination (or frequent attempts at urination) is accompanied by serious symptoms or obvious distress (e.g. blood in the urine, crying when trying to urinate), contact your veterinarian right away or call an emergency animal clinic.

, If your vet has ruled out medical causes for your cat's frequent urination, stress may be the culprit. Your cat’s anxiety may be explained by recent changes in its life (e.g. moving to a new home, adjusting to a new pet) or separation anxiety, which might result in elimination issues. To ease your cat’s stress, maintain a solid routine by:Maintaining set mealtimes
Moving furniture as infrequently as possible
Keeping a set time for grooming (e.g. brushing)

, Synthetic pheromone sprays (available online and at veterinary clinics) simulate cheek pheromones released by cats to mark their territory as safe. These sprays have a calming effect on nervous cats and can alleviate anxiety that causes behavioral issues. Ask your vet if a pheromone spray would be right for your pet., To help reduce your cat’s stress, play with it every day for at least 15-20 minutes. Regular, interactive play helps cats build confidence and reduce anxiety. Opt for chasing and hunting games, which will also ensure that your cat uses built up energy that may contribute to jumpiness or stress., To keep your cat busy and entertained when you are busy, purchase a puzzle toy that can be filled with treats for your cat to work for. These interactive toys can keep your cat busy and motivated for hours, which may in turn reduce separation anxiety, boredom, and stress. A variety of safe, non-toxic puzzle toys are available online or in pet stores., If your cat's frequent urination is due to a urinary tract infection or bladder infection, you will likely have to administer antibiotics to your cat for several weeks. Give your cat medicine by hiding it in food, or by wrapping your cat in a towel or blanket to keep it calm and restrained while you administer the medication orally. Reward your cat for its cooperation with treats or petting., If your cat's frequent urination is due to a condition like diabetes, your vet will recommend dietary changes to improve the situation and prevent further complications. Low protein diets, for example, are used to treat diabetes and chronic renal failure in cats. Be sure to buy good quality food with minimal preservatives., As contradictory as it may seem, increasing your cat’s water intake may help to alleviate its frequent urination. If your cat has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) or lower urinary tract disorder (i.e. a condition affecting the bladder or urethra), it will likely urinate more frequently, but in smaller amounts. Not drinking enough water can increase your pet's risk of having such conditions recur, especially older cats who are prone to dehydration.Place extra water bowls around the house, or purchase a small drinking fountain at a pet store to entice your cat to drink.
Replacing dry food with canned food is another way of increasing your cat's water intake.

, Your cat my be frightened after the burn and try to bite you even though you are trying to help. Wrapping your cat gently in a towel calms and secures it so you can assess and treat the burn.Be careful not to rub any sensitive or burned areas with the towel, which can further damage the skin.

, Gently apply the cool compress to the area of your cat’s burn. Always wrap your compress to protect any delicate skin.Ice will stick to any wounds causing further damage; don’t use it.

, Thermal burns can cause blisters of fluid to form on your cat’s skin. Opening these blisters can make your cat more prone to infection. Leave any blistering intact and let it heal naturally in due time.Do not apply any ointments to the wound. This can actually trap heat against the burned skin and cause further damage.

, Place your cat in its carrier and take it to the veterinarian. The vet can assess the severity of the burn and outline a treatment plan. Use any medications or treatments your vet advises as directed., If the burn is obviously very minor or your vet confirms that the burn is mild, it is safe to apply small amounts of aloe vera gel to the area daily.This will soothe any discomfort and speed healing at home."

Identify a lost pet cat.,
Try to find its owners.,
Enlist the help of a local shelter or vet.,
Find the cat a home.",How to Take Care of a Stray Cat1," Pet cats do not behave in the same way feral ones do, although if a cat has been lost for some time or is frightened, it may behave in a way that appears feral. If the cat approaches you and does not appear to fear humans, it is likely a lost pet.A collar is an easy way to identify a lost pet cat.
Pet cats may appear less clean than feral cats because they are unaccustomed to living outside and needing to clean themselves more frequently.
Pet cats may try to approach you or to enter your home. Feral cats would not.
Lost pets will often rub against the leg of humans when hungry, a feral cat will not.;
, The best thing you can do for a lost pet cat is to find its owners. Chances are a loving cat that finds you has a home with an equally loving family looking for it. Most neutered cats will not stray far from home, but intact male cats may travel further and may not be from the immediate area.


Look around the neighborhood for posters about a lost cat. Consider making and putting up “found cat” posters in case the family is actively looking.
Put a collar on the cat with a note attached to it. The cat may just be an outdoor cat that knows its way home. When the family finds the note on the cat’s collar, they may contact you to let you know.
Look in the classified sections of local websites and newspapers in case anyone has posted an ad looking for their cat.

, Local animal shelters or veterinarians may be able to help you identify the owners of a lost pet cat. They interact with a large number of pet owners on a daily basis and may have heard about a cat that’s gone missing.In order to get assistance, you must first Catch a Stray Cat.
You can transport the cat in the cage you used to catch it.
Have the shelter or vet scan the cat for a microchip ID tag that may identify the owner.
Check to see if anyone has reported a missing cat to the shelters in the area.

, If your efforts to find the original home for a lost pet cat fail, it may be time to find a new home for the cat. Lost pet cats are not well suited for outdoor life, so you may not want to simply release the cat back where you found it.


If you are willing to adopt the cat, take it to the veterinarian to be vaccinated and checked for other health issues.
If you are unable to adopt the cat, bring it to a shelter that will try to find it a good home.

Take your cat to the veterinarian.",How to Treat Burns on a Cat2," Chemical burns are often caused by caustic household cleaning solutions or other strong chemicals. If you witness your cat playing with or ingesting something it shouldn’t, try to clean up the substance immediately to minimize any further riskIf the substance might also be harmful to you, don rubber gloves and any other appropriate safety gear before handling the substance and the cat.If the burn is from a dry chemical, try to brush away as much as possible., After the burn, your frightened cat may try to scratch or bite you even if that is not in its nature. Wrapping your cat in a towel calms and secures it so you can assess and treat the burn., If your cat has a burn from contact with a chemical substance rather than ingestion, run the affected area under cool running water. Try to soothe and talk to your cat to keep it calm while you do this.If your cat has gotten the chemical substance in its eyes, flush them with water or saline for 15-20 minutes to rinse away as much as possible., If the burned area is the mouth, flush with lots of water to limit possible damage.If possible, try to hold the cat’s nose out of the stream of water as you flush so it can breathe easier and will be more tolerant of the water., Secure the container of the offending chemical (if you have it) by placing it in a leak-proof bag. Bring it to the veterinarian with you so they have as much information as possible about the source of the burn., Gently place your cat in its carrier and transport it to the veterinarian. Especially with chemical burns, time is of the essence. The vet can assess the severity of the burn and provide further advanced treatment as necessary.Your cat may need a feeding tube for a few days as chemical burns of the mouth may discourage it from eating and drinking properly.

Observe the time to onset.,
Note the color of the burn.,
Look for the location of the burn on your cat’s body.",How to Treat Burns on a Cat3," If you do not witness the cat being burned, there are other clues that can help you determine what kind of burn your cat has incurred and how to treat it. Thermal burns are usually immediate, whereas chemical burns can take several hours to become obvious. Thermal burns, such as a cat walking on a hot stove, are also more common than chemical burns, such as ingesting household cleaner., Chemical burns usually cause a whitening of the surface layer of the skin. Thermal burns are more likely to look a like a darkening of your cat’s normal skin color.Asses the color of the affected area to determine how your cat was burned.

A thermal burn exception would be a sunburn, which causes a reddening of the skin, just as it does in humans. Severe sunburn in cats is abnormal because of the protection provided by their fur. If your cat’s nose gets a bit too much sun, offer it plenty of water. The burn will fade in a few days.

, Chemical burns most often affect a cat’s tongue and esophagus.Thermal burns are more likely to affect areas your cat uses to explore its environment, such as its paws."

Make sure it’s not a feral cat.,
Isolate the cat from your other pets.,
Get it vaccinated.,
Take it slow.",How to Take Care of a Stray Cat2," Feral cats look just like the cats we keep in our homes (they are in fact the same species) but feral cats do not have the social ability to live in homes with people that pet cats do. While it is not impossible to adopt a feral cat, it can be extremely difficult for you and the cat.


Feral cats prefer to live outside and probably have a colony nearby that they belong to.
Pet cats prefer the company of people and enjoy a life that includes being indoors.

, Once you have decided to adopt a stray cat, you need to make sure it doesn’t pose a health risk to any other pets you may have in the house. Even if the cat seems friendly, you don’t want to risk it spreading any diseases to your pets.Keep the cat in a separate room from any other pets or small children you may have.
Do not allow your other pets to interact directly with the cat until it has seen a vet and been vaccinated.

, Even if the cat you adopt is an adult, it may not have been vaccinated by its previous owners. Vaccinations are important to prevent your cat from being infected with a preventable disease, but also to prevent your cat from carrying such diseases to other cats in the area or your house.There are a number of vaccines cats should receive including rabies, feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).
Your veterinarian will help you decide which vaccines beyond the “core” requirements may be a good idea for your cat based on its condition.
Ask the veterinarian to tell you if there seem to be any other medical issues with the cat that you should be aware of.

, Even if the cat came from a loving home before it was lost, it still may be reluctant to trust you or the other people in your house. You can’t know what kinds of experiences the cat may have had before it entered your home, so keep your distance as you learn how the cat adapts to its new surroundings.Introduce the cat to other pets in your home slowly and in a controlled manner.
Start by keeping the cat in a cat carrier while your other cats or dogs have an opportunity to smell the new cat without coming into contact with it.
Let the cat retreat to a safe place when it wants to, otherwise it may feel threatened by you or your other pets.

Make sure the cat is feral.,
Consider leaving it alone.,
Trap-Neuter-Return a feral cat.,
Provide care to injured or sick feral cats.",How to Take Care of a Stray Cat3," It can be difficult to tell for sure whether or not a cat is feral or simply adventuring away from home. Both lost pet cats and feral cats may behave aggressively toward you or run off out of fear when you approach, so determining that a cat is feral may require subtle cues.Feral cats may appear to be better groomed than a lost pet cat that hasn’t gotten accustomed to living outdoors yet.
If you start feeding the cat, pet cats will grow to trust you and behave like a pet whereas feral cats will remain skittish.

, Feral cats have existed around humans for thousands of years, and often don’t require any assistance from people to survive. These cats are not really homeless, they’re wild animals.Feral cats are not socialized to people, so they cannot be adopted as pets easily.
Feral cats often live in social groups called colonies. If you see one, there are likely a number of other feral cats in the area.
Feral cats probably do not need your help unless it appears sickly or weak.

, Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a phrase used to describe a common population control method utilized with feral cats. TNR can improve a cat’s health, the health of its colony, and prevent an overpopulation of feral cats that could lead to some cats starving. After a feral cat has been vaccinated and neutered it can be adopted or returned to the area it was trapped.First, contact your local vet or animal shelter. They may offer TNR services for the community free of charge or for a reduced cost. They also may be able to offer assistance and traps.Next, you’ll need to safely Trap a Feral Cat.
Negative behaviors associated with mating such as fighting and yowling stop after the cat has been neutered.
After treatment the vet will help you determine if the cat should be re-released or put up for adoption.

, If a feral cat appears to be injured or sick, you may choose to help the cat regain its health. Remember that feral cats are wild animals, so the injury could make it aggressive. Also remember to keep your own health in mind when dealing with feral cats, especially ones that seem ill. Make sure to wash your hands after coming into contact with a feral cat.


If the cat appears to simply be malnourished, do not attempt to bring it inside, but consider leaving food and water out for the cat to eat and drink when you aren’t around and it feels more comfortable.
If the cat seems seriously ill or injured, do not approach it. Either entice the cat into a carrier or cage with food or place it there gently if it is not moving, then bring the cat to a local animal hospital for treatment. There are many shelters and animal hospitals that will care for stray cats at reduced or no cost.You can also call animal control in your town if you would rather not approach the animal yourself.

Hide your cat’s favorite toy.,
Move a mechanical mouse under a piece of furniture.,
Place an unopened container of food near your cat’s food bowl.,
Watch a nature show with your cat.,
Increase your knowledge on cat intelligence.,
Do not compare your cat’s intelligence to that of a dog.,
Identify the challenges of testing cat intelligence.",How to Test Your Cat's Intelligence," A cat’s intelligence is similar to that of the average two- or three- year old child.One way to test your cat’s intelligence is to hide one of her favorite toys behind a solid item such as a thick piece of paper or file folder.Let her a get a good look at the toy first, then hide it behind the item.It is best to do this activity in an uncluttered area where your cat can focus all of her attention on you.If she tries to look behind the solid item to see where the toy went, she is demonstrating an understanding that the toy is hidden and did not simply disappear.This level of intelligence is about that of an 18-month old child.;
, If you have a mechanical mouse, turn it on and maneuver it such that it ends up going under a piece of furniture, such as a couch or refrigerator. Watch your cat as she studies the movements of the mouse.


Even though she may not be able to see the mouse once it goes under the furniture, she may be able to predict accurately where it will come out.Your cat may be able to make this prediction by watching the mouse’s movements before it goes under the furniture.Her ability to predict where the mouse comes out demonstrates the intelligence of a two-year old child., How your cat responds to this action tests her ability to reason and provides insight on her intelligence. If your cat has a high level of intelligence, she will likely look back and forth between you and the container, waiting for you to open it.If she completely ignores the container, or does a quick sniff of it then walks away, her intelligence level may be a little lower., Choose a nature show that involves birds. Your cat is demonstrating her intelligence if she watches the show intently.Although she may not initially understand that the birds are only TV and that she can’t actually catch them, she at least understands what image is being shown on the screen.

, Your cat’s intelligence is largely based on how she can use her skills to play, get food, gain attention, and ensure that her needs and wants are met.Her intelligence also stems from her highly inquisitive nature.Part of your cat’s intelligence has to do with her ability to rapidly change her behavior according to her environment. For example, if you give her a toy that allows her to bring out her predator side, she is showing that she can rapidly adjust from a pampered house cat to a cat on the hunt.Another aspect of her intelligence is her ability to manipulate and handle objects in her paws.The next time your cat is playing with her toys, watch how she is able to grip and manipulate them with her paws.
Cats are sometimes unfairly labeled as less intelligent than dogs, or simply unintelligent, because they do not perform like dogs on certain intelligence tests. For example, when put in a maze, a cat is likely to stop and investigate the blind alleys, rather than navigate quickly through like a dog.Rather than indicating a lack of intelligence, the investigation is a cat’s way of exploring, and getting a good feel of, its environment.The entire scope of feline intelligence is beyond what can be explained in this article. Consider talking to your veterinarian or visiting your local bookstore or library to learn about feline intelligence.

, Cat owners and dog owners have long debated which animal is more intelligent.While both sides can make valid claims,the intelligences of dogs and cats are too different to easily compare the two. Simply put, cats and dogs are intelligent in different ways.


Dogs are social creatures and have become increasingly skilled at performing different social tasks in the human world (e.g., therapy dogs, seeing-eye dogs, rescue dogs), which gives them a high level of social intelligence.However, the intense domestication of dogs may have caused them to lose some survival skills along the way.Cats, who are independent and aloof, tend not to have the same level of social skills as dogs. However, their independence means they can largely survive on their own without being heavily dependent on people.This independence is an aspect of cat intelligence.
Because cats and dogs have different skills sets, they use their intelligence in different ways. Neither intelligence is necessarily superior or inferior to the other.

, People may assume that cats are not very intelligent because they do not demonstrate their abilities as readily as dogs. That is one main challenge of testing cat intelligence—the difficulty in convincing a cat to show what it knows and how it learns.Whereas dogs are social animals and are eager to please their owners, cats are more independent and less likely to look to their owners for approval.Your cat may wonder why she needs to show you her intelligence at all.
Another challenge is that there are no scientific tests to accurately assess a cat’s intelligence.In addition, humans tend to equate high levels of animal intelligence with how similar the animal acts to humans. For example, an animal who has good eyesight is deemed more intelligent than an animal whose eyesight is not as good.Looking at a cat’s intelligence through the lens of human expectations presents a challenge to really knowing how intelligent that cat is."

Check for low energy.,
Take the kitten to the vet.",How to Tell if a Kitten Is Healthy Before You Adopt It," A kitten's eyes should be clear and bright. They shouldn't be runny, for instance, and they should also be able to focus easily on your finger. If you notice discharge around the eyes, that could indicate a health problem., If you notice the kitten has discharge around its nose, that could indicate that it's sick. Similarly, sneezing and coughing can also indicate sickness, such as an upper respiratory infection caused by a virus., Some unhealthy kittens may have ear mites. To check your kitten out, look in the kitten's ears for coffee-like granules. Also, notice if the kitten seems to be scratching its ears a good deal or shaking its head.The ears should look clean inside and out. Inside, they should be pink, not inflamed or red., Gently lift the edge of the kitten's mouth so you can look at the gums and teeth. The gums should be pink, not red or inflamed. They also shouldn't look white. The teeth should be white., A kitten should have a full belly, but it shouldn't seem swollen or warm, which can indicate worms. Also, you shouldn't be able to feel a kitten's ribs, as kittens tend to be more rotund than older cats.The kitten's body should also look symmetrical., A kitten's body should be smooth. You shouldn't be able to feel any noticeable lumps on the kitten's body. If you do, that could indicate a health issue., The kitten should be free from parasites like fleas and ringworm. Fleas will leave little dark reddish particles. These particles will turn redder when wet. Ringworm will leave bald patches. Also, check for dandruff.You'll most likely find flea dirt at the base of the ears, near the tail, and on the lower end of the back., While this step isn't exactly pleasant, it's important to make sure the kitten doesn't have worms. The rear end should be mostly clean. You shouldn't notice any signs of diarrhea in the fur, for instance.Also, look for cucumber-seed like parasites, which are likely tapeworms., Kittens are a bit clumsy, of course, but the kitten should be able to move in a coordinated fashion. If you notice that it has trouble walking, for instance, that's not a good sign. Head tremors are also not an indicator of good health., If you're there during dinner time, watch the kitten to see how it interacts with food. It should be interested in the food and come over when the food is put out. It should also eat with relish., Of course, every kitten is going to spend time napping. However, when it's awake, it should be fairly playful. Most kittens have two speeds (when they're not eating or going to the bathroom): sleeping and playing., It's always a good idea to have your cat checked out by a vet before taking it home, particularly if you have other animals. The vet can catch things you can't and help you treat them. Plus, they can let you know if the kitten should be quarantined from other animals for a period of time.


If you can't take the kitten to a vet before taking it home, try to do so within 72 hours of adoption.

Don't give your cat human food.,
Provide your cat with stimulation.,
Be careful of the cold.,
Keep your cat indoors.,
Get your cat microchipped.,
Stay regular with your veterinarian.",How to Take Care of an Oriental Cat," While most Orientals are shorthair, they still shed all the time. Thus, you’ll have to comb them frequently. By combing them, you’ll remove loose hair, dirt, and ensure your cat has a healthy coat.


Use a soft bristle brush. You can also use a stainless-steel comb.
Comb your cat a few times a week. This is important, as you’ll want to prevent your cat from having tangles and knots.;
, Like other cats, you should trim your Oriental’s nails relatively often. This is especially true since most Orientals are indoor cats and do not have the opportunity to scratch and wear their claws down outside.


Trim their nails every 10 days to 2 weeks.
Be careful not to cut your cat’s quick – the fleshy top part of their nails., Most vets today highly recommend that you brush your cat’s teeth regularly. Without regular brushing, cats could suffer from periodontal disease – something that Oriental cats are highly susceptible to.


Try to brush your cat’s teeth daily, if possible.
Use a toothpaste formulated for cats. This is important, as human toothpaste often has ingredients that are dangerous to cats.
While you can use a toothbrush intended for small children, you can also buy one specifically designed for cats.
Consult your vet about regular teeth cleanings done in your vet’s office., Because of their build and metabolism, Orientals are very susceptible to rapid weight gain. Thus, you need to be careful not to give them too much food at one time.


Watch to see if your cat is becoming overweight. One of the best indications of this is the development of a potbelly.
Be careful about your Oriental’s weight, as their body type is not amenable to supporting extra weight. Overweight Orientals could develop a wide variety of muscular-skeletal problems.
Consult your vet about proper portions for your Oriental., Because many oriental cats are indoor cats, you should provide your Oriental with a diet suited to an indoor lifestyle. This is important, as just feeding your Oriental any cat food could have a negative effect on their health.


Indoor cat food usually has a lower caloric content.
Some indoor cat foods are formulated to be easy on your cat’s GI tract, aiding in digestion, and decreasing the odor that emanates from their litter box.
Popular foods for Oriental cats include: Royal Canin Feline Health Nutrition, Hill’s Ideal Balance Canned Cat Food, and Royal Canin Feline Health Nutrition Kitten Instinctive., While many foods that people eat are safe for Oriental cats to eat, specific foods or methods of preparation (like frying) may cause issues for your furry friend. Thus, don’t give your Oriental cat human food unless you are sure it is safe. Some common food that your Oriental cat should not eat include:


The seeds of fruits
Grapes
Fried foods
Many types of nuts
Tomatoes
The sweetener xylitol
Chocolate, As relatively active and energetic cats, you need to provide your Oriental cat with stimulation. This is important, as cats that aren't stimulated could become antisocial or destructive.


Interact with your Oriental cat as much as you can. Try to reserve play time before work, after work, and at night. Even five minutes of interaction before you leave for work will be beneficial to your cat.
Consider adopting a second cat, if you don't already have one.
Purchase toys like a scratching post, stuffed mice, or a fishing pole teaser toy., Since Oriental cats are slim and very often have short hair, you’ll need to be extra sensitive about the temperature in your home and your cat’s exposure to cold. This is important, as shorthaired cats have a severe sensitivity to the cold.


Try to maintain a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or warmer in your home.
Avoid letting your Oriental cat roam outside during the late fall or winter months.
Consider providing your cat with a sweater during the cold winter months., Oriental cats are bred primarily to be indoor cats. As a result, you should keep them inside to protect them from a variety of dangers. Some dangers include:


Predators, like birds of prey such as hawks and eagles.
Cars.
Theft., Microchipping is an increasingly popular way that pet owners can attach contact and medical information onto their pet. This way, if your cat gets lost, a veterinarian or animal shelter worker will be able to contact you.


Talk to your veterinarian about implanting your cat with a microchip.
Microchips typically cost between $10 and $50 dollars to implant.
You'll also have to pay either a lifetime or annual fee so you can update your contact information with the microchip company., Orientals share many of the health conditions that afflict Siamese cats. Thus, you should learn about the many conditions that your cat could develop and make sure to keep regular vet appointments. Common conditions your vet may be able to catch in the early stages include:


Asthma or bronchial disease
Congenital heart problems like aortic stenosis
Gastrointestinal problems
Lymphoma
Progressive retinal atrophy
Neurological disorders like hyperesthesia."

Taming a stray cat can be a difficult process that lasts several months. A feral cat may never behave the same way a domesticated house cat would, but many reach a point where they make loving pets and are able to live indoors.Some stray cats are actually lost cats that were previously domesticated. Providing food, shelter and attention is often the only thing required to tame a lost cat. Try leaving some food out for them and then petting them when they come close. If they allow it, there is a good chance they are a lost cat.
Try to track down the owner before claiming the cat as your own. Look around town for any posters or fliers that might have been put up for this lost cat. Talk with your local human society and veterinarians to ask if anyone is looking for the cat you have found.It’s much easier to tame feral kittens than feral adult cats. Kittens have yet to learn the behaviors of either indoor or outdoor life. Adult cats are set in their old ways and habits and it can be tough to retrain an older cat.
Socialize a feral kitten before it is eight weeks old. Socializing early on will help them grow comfortable with behaviors expected from an indoor cat. You should also let kittens stay with their mother until they are four weeks old.
Newborn kittens will still have an umbilical cord stump on their stomach. They will also no open their eyes until seven to fourteen days have passed.If the kittens incisor teeth have grown in, it's likely about two weeks old. If you notice any teeth behind the canine and incisor teeth, where our molars are, the kitten is at least four weeks old. If the kitten has all of it's adult teeth, you can assume it to be around four months old.If a cat seems aggressive or hostile towards you, leave it alone.;
, You won't be able to simply pick up a feral cat with your hands. Feral cats are wild animals that must be handled with extreme care. The best way to start the process of taming a feral cat is to set out a trap.Feral cats may hiss, spit and scratch so let the trap take the abuse.
Use a special trap designed for cats. Do not use traps designed for other animals.
You can get traps from your local trap-neuter-release organization.
Set the trap in a place where the cat spends most of its time.
You'll need to bait it with a little tuna or other food to lure the cat inside.

, Place the trap on a blanket or towel in your car and drive it to the vet. Feral cats can carry diseases, and they usually have fleas and other ailments. Have the cat treated for these problems before you bring it home.Be careful not to handle it yet. The cat will not want to be touched.
Seek medical attention immediately if you get scratched or bitten.
Cat scratches and bites can lead to serious infections.
Put a towel over the trap to help it feel more comfortable.

, Don't do this until the vet has treated the cat and given the OK to take it home. The cat should spend its first few days in your house in a small, contained area to get used to its new setting.Use a carrier big enough for a litter box, bedding, and dishes for food and water.
Keep the carrier in a room away from family members or other pets.
Let the cat stay contained for two days before you touch it.
Make sure it has enough food and water for two days.
Put a full box of kitty litter in the cat's litter box.
Make sure the cat won’t be able to escape as it may cause harm to the cat or your home.
It is normal for the cat to be agitated during this time.

, Spend time near the carrier and speak in soothing tones until the cat seems calm when you're nearby. When the cat is used to your presence and no longer acting as wild, you can allow it more space to move around. Allow the cat to leave the carrier but stay in a small room that you have cat-proofed.Don't force the cat to come out, let it willingly come to you.
Provide a private hiding space where the cat can go to reduce stress levels. Make sure it's an accessible spot so you can reach the cat if necessary.
Make sure there's no way the cat can escape through a door, window or crack.
Smaller rooms make the best socialization rooms.
Alert your family members so that the cat won't escape the room if they enter.

, Plan to settle in for a few hours to help the cat get used to your presence. You can entice it to come closer by setting out a trail of treats leading to where you are sitting. Sit on the floor to get closer to the cat's level, and be patient while it gets used to you being there.


Do this every day, possibly for weeks, until the cat comes close enough to be handled.
Don't make eye contact with the cat, as they view it as a threat.
Try lying on the floor to help the cat feel more comfortable, as you will appear smaller.

, If the cat doesn't seem comfortable coming up to you even after several days, adjust how and when you feed the cat. Don't leave food out for the cat when you leave the room. Bring food in with you when you visit the cat and be with it while it eats.Keep the food dish close to you while you're feeding the cat.
When the cat is finished eating and you're ready to leave the room, take the food with you.
Don't starve the cat, make sure it is actually eating.
You should leave water in the room at all times., After several days, most cats will begin feeling more comfortable approaching you for food and treats. Now it's time to advance to helping the cat feel safe while being picked up or petted. When the cat comes close, use a towel to lift it into your arms.


Lift the cat gently and carefully.
If he cat runs away or hisses, try again tomorrow.
Never use your bare hands to pick up a feral cat.
You might want to go in wearing thick jeans, long sleeves and gloves.
Don't scare the cat or force interaction. This will undo any trust.
When holding the cat, try giving it some treats., When you successfully have the cat in your arms, pet the cat's head from behind, very gently. Speak to the cat in soothing tones. Stroke the cat's head and back for several minutes.


If the cat resists, let it down.
Do this every day until the cat comes to you to be picked up.
Never approach from the front, as this will startle the cat.
Always reward the cat for good behavior with some treats.

, The last part of the taming period can last more than a month. Keep working with the cat until it no longer exhibits fear or has any problem being handled and petted. Eventually the cat should feel comfortable being handled.


Change the cats food and water daily.
Pick the cat up, pet it, and talk to it at least once a day.
The cat could remain skittish for quite a long time.
Invite your friends to visit the cat to help it get used to people in general.
The cat will eventually not require treats when you pick them up.

, Once the taming period is complete, the cat is ready for a normal domestic life. You may decide to keep the cat in your house or bring it to a shelter to put it up for adoption.


If you keep the cat, be sure to get it neutered or spayed.
Introduce the cat to other pets in your household slowly.

, This program has been shown to be an effective way to keep wild cat populations down. The trap-neuter-return program is a non-leathal way to control feral cat populations. Populations left to grow unchecked can be bad for both cats and the neighborhood they live in.Cats that go through a trap-neuter-return program do not need to be house trained.
These cats will go back to live outside, but they'll be much healthier if they're part of the program.
See if there's already a program happening in your neighborhood.
Talk with a local shelter or vet about resources available in your area.

, Use a special trap provided by your local trap-neuter-return program. Set the trap in an the alley, backyard, or other place where you see a lot of cats hanging out.Trap cats and help them through the program one at a time.
Do not try to trap a cat with a trap used for other types of animals, as it may injure the cat.
Do not approach a stray cat and try to touch it with your bare hands.
Seek medical attention immediately if you are bitten or scratched.

, The vet will examine the cat for signs of disease, fleas and other maladies. Most importantly, the vet will spay or neuter the cat, so it won't be able to keep producing litters. After the cat has recovered, the vet will release the cat back into your care.


Medical procedures and surgery should be free under the trap-neuter-return program.
Some programs clip a cats ear, marking that they are in the program., Bring it back to the same spot where you trapped it, and release the cat back into the neighborhood. If you were feeding the cat before, continue to do so, and allow it to live out its life outdoors.


Don't try to force any interaction with the cat.

, Continue the process until the population has been reduced and the cats are all neutered or spayed. Without help, this could take many months to accomplish.


Monitor the amount of feral cats in your neighborhood to check how successful your work is.
Try to recruit neighbors to help with the program and increase results.

Trim your cat’s nails.,
Brush your cat’s teeth.",How to Take Care of a Li Hua Cat1," Start at your cat’s head and brush gently down toward its tail. Work on one section at a time, and be sure to brush its sides, chest, and abdomen.The Li Hua breed has a short coat and therefore requires minimal brushing. Brushing once a week should be adequate.Brushing reduces your cat’s hairballs and the amount of hair that gets left strewn about the house.;
, Before a brushing session, check your cat’s skin for wounds, redness, bald patches, or other signs of irritation. If you notice these or similar symptoms that your cat has been scratching or suffering from irritated skin, contact your vet., Li Hua cats don’t have an undercoat, so there is no need to use an undercoat rake. Instead, use a brush with bristles that aren’t too dense and stiff. An angled wire brush is your best option for this breed.You might also find a rubber brush useful for removing dead hair., During your regular brushing session, use a flea comb to check for flea excreta. Flea excreta looks like small comma-shaped specks of dirt, and will get caught in the flea comb. If you’re not sure if you’ve found flea excreta, place the offending speck on a paper towel and place a drop of water on it. If it runs red, it is flea excreta. Contact your vet for treatment options., To trim your Li Hua’s nails, use a pair of clippers appropriate for a pet. Clip the claw with a firm squeeze of the clippers, then continue onto the next.To get your cat’s claw to extend, only squeeze the individual toe pads, not the whole paw.

, Ideally, you will brush your Li Hua cat’s teeth once daily, but once weekly is better than nothing. To get started, sit your cat on your lap. Apply a bit of feline toothpaste to a pet toothbrush or a finger brush (a thimble-sized brush with short bristles designed for pets). Scrub the outer faces of the teeth in a gentle up-and-down motion.Talk to your cat in a reassuring tone throughout the brushing session.
Do not use human toothpastes when cleaning your cat’s teeth.

Using a cat-specific hair brush—which you can purchase at your local pet-supply store—brush the Selkirk’s back, head, neck, stomach, and legs.If you’re unfamiliar with grooming a Selkirk rex, speak with the cat’s breeder or a professional groomer. Ask them for tips on how best to brush this unique breed. If you brush the coat incorrectly, you could stretch out the curls.;
, The curled hair of a Selkirk rex will have a tendency to tangle or mat. When this problem occurs, you’ll need to use a comb to remove these tangles. You’ll be able to purchase a cat comb at your local pet-supply store. When removing mats from the Selkirk’s coat, be gentle; never yank or pull on hair to remove a tangle. This will both hurt the cat and damage the fur.Be aware that, although Selkirk rexes are born with their distinguishable curly coat, the fur will straighten out when the kitten reaches about 6 months. The curls will return when the cat reaches maturity (about 1 year), and the coat will remain curly for the rest of the cat’s life.

, Like all other cats, a Selkirk rex will bathe itself with its tongue, and so it will rarely be necessary for you to bathe the cat. If it gets extremely dirty somehow and needs a bath, wash it in the tub with a moisturizing shampoo, so its fur and skin will not dry out. Dry the cat lightly with a towel, then let it finish air drying for a few hours.Bathing and combing a Selkirk rex is a good way to remove excess, dead hair that the cat has shed. Otherwise, this dead hair will shed as the cat walks around your house and brushes up against furniture and people.

, Like all cats, Selkirk rexes are prone to periodontal disease, and frequent tooth brushing can help combat this disease. Ideally, brush your cat’s teeth once a day—however, if that’s impractical, brushing the teeth once a week should suffice. When you brush the teeth, make sure to brush the cat’s molars, in addition to its canines and incisors.You can find a cat-specific pet toothbrush and toothpaste at your local pet-supply store. Ask the sales staff for their recommendation regarding the best type and brand of toothbrush for your cat.

, Although Selkirk rexes are not especially susceptible to eye and ear diseases, the eyes and ears will still need occasional cleaning. Daily, wipe the corners of the cat’s eyes to remove any excess fluid. At least once a week, look into your cat’s ears. Dirt and wax can accumulate inside the fold of the ear. If you notice an accumulation, wipe this out with a cotton ball.You can dab your cats eyes and wipe out their ears using a paper towel, or a cotton ball. Do not put a Q-tip in your cat’s ear; a cat’s ear canal is much larger than a human’s, and a Q-tip could cause damage.

, Although Selkirk rexes are sociable, curious, and friendly, it’s best to keep them as permanent indoor cats. Due to the rarity and novelty of this breed, a Selkirk is much more likely to be stolen than a more common-looking cat. The outdoors are also generally unsafe for housecats, due to cars and other vehicles, and threats from wildlife in rural areas.You should also spay or neuter your Selkirk, unless you plan to responsibly breed the animal.

, Selkirk rexes are generally healthy cats. However, like any purebred breed, there are certain genetic concerns that may lead to illness in a Selkirk. These can be detected by your veterinarian, so be sure to schedule regular veterinary appointments for your cat. Specifically, Selkirk rexes are genetically prone to contract Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM).If you’ve purchased your Selkirk rex from a breeder, ask them if there are any hereditary health problems in the cat’s genetic line. Check and see if the breeder has tested the cat’s parents and grandparents for any genetic illness., Selkirk rexes are intelligent cats and enjoy interacting and playing games with their owners. Try playing fetch with your Selkirk, or flick a piece of string around on the floor for your cat to chase. Selkirks also like to cuddle and will want to sit in your lap from time to time. Like all cats, Selkirks also need time to themselves, and will retreat to their beds or another safe space when they have had enough attention.When you visit your local pet-supply store, look for some toys that your Selkirk will enjoy to play with. These include: laser pointer, scratching post, a catnip-filled chew toy, and a feather or toy mouse on a string.

, Like many other feline breeds, a Selkirk rex will prefer a structured day and won’t necessarily handle alterations to the routine well. Feed them at regular times; for example, once at 10 am and again at 8 pm.Changes to this daily routine may disconcert or confuse your cat.

, Because Selkirk rexes are so social and thrive on interacting with humans, they won’t do well if frequently left alone. The cat may feel abandoned, and the trust that it has formed with you as the owner may suffer. To avoid this, try not to ignore the cat; spend quality time cuddling or playing with it when you’re around it.Selkirk rexes do well with children, and are also very compatible with other friendly cats or with dogs who enjoy being around cats. If you need to leave your Selkirk alone for many hours a day, another pet can provide suitable company.

Don’t trim all your cat’s nails at once. Work on one or two paws per session.
Don’t try to rush the process. If your cat is agitated, cut the session short or give it a treat.

, Use a soft infant toothbrush, a short-bristled finger brush designed for pet teeth, or even a soft cloth wrapped around your finger to clean your cat’s teeth. When first introducing your cat to the toothbrush, just dip it in a bit of chicken broth and rub the cat’s teeth for a short time. When your cat has grown accustomed to this process, add toothpaste to the brush and brush the outer faces of your cat’s teeth using gentle circular motions.Ideally, you will brush your Japanese Bobtail’s teeth daily. Less frequent brushing is also acceptable but not preferred.
Do not use human toothpaste to brush your cat’s teeth. Instead, use a specially formulated feline toothpaste in a flavor that your cat seems to prefer.
Ask your vet to demonstrate how to properly brush your cat’s teeth before trying it yourself.

, Japanese Bobtail cats don’t need their ears cleaned regularly, but you should check them from time to time. If the ears look dirty, wipe them with a cotton ball or a soft cloth dampened with a mixture of half water and half cider vinegar. Do not use cotton swabs on your cat’s ears, as you could hurt it."

Schedule annual veterinary check ups.,
Reduce long-term costs with vaccination.,
Look for a mobile spay and neuter clinic.,
Find cheaper medications.,
Keep your cat at a healthy weight.,
Tell your veterinarian when a procedure is out of your price range.,
See whether pet insurance is worthwhile.,
Don’t let your cat outside.",How to Save Money on Home Cat Care2," The single best way to save money on your cat’s healthcare is through prevention. If you get your cat looked over by a veterinarian once per year, they should be able to catch any illnesses early. It is cheaper to treat your cat’s health issues early, as opposed to waiting and having to pay more for expensive treatments.Depending on your cat’s age and current health conditions, you may need to get more frequent check ups, such as twice a year or even quarterly. Your veterinarian should be consulted on this matter.

, You should get your cat vaccinated at your veterinary office, which will reduce the likelihood of paying for expense diseases down the road.It is best to avoid home vaccinations because some pets have allergic reactions, which you will be unable to treat if you try to do the vaccination at home.
You can save money on vaccinations by going to a pet rescue or mobile vaccination clinic, which is typically volunteer-run and much cheaper.

, You can save a lot of money by getting your cat spayed and neutered at a not-for-profit clinic. Charity run organizations focus on feline health and reducing the number of stray cats in a region.You will save on long term health costs by spaying and neutering your cat, regardless of whether you go to your regular veterinarian or a not-for-profit clinic.You might also consider volunteering for one of these clinics, since they are not-for-profit.

, There are many competing sources for cat medications, so consider shopping around. Look at the cost of the required medication at a local pharmacy, at an online pharmacy and at your veterinarian. Buy from the cheapest source but make sure it meets your veterinarian’s specifications.When deciding where to purchase, remember that some companies only guarantee the effectiveness of their products if it is purchased directly from a veterinarian.
Consider asking your veterinarian if they can match the online prices, which could get you a significant discount.
Never give your cat human medications without asking your veterinarian first.

, A lot of very expensive medical conditions are related to obesity, such as heart disease, diabetes, joint disease and arthritis. To save money on such conditions, feed your cat an appropriate amount of food and watch their weight. Your veterinarian should be able to give you advice no your cat’s diet.It is best to avoid free-feeding, which could put your cat at risk of obesity.

, Since veterinarians typically offer a spectrum of healthcare services ranging from high to lower priced options, you should be upfront about your financial situation. They may tell you about an expensive treatment option. However, if you tell them you simply cannot afford it, they may be able to offer a cheaper option that is within your financial means.Try saying, “I’m sorry, that sounds like a great treatment plan. However, I simply cannot afford it at this time. Can you find a different treatment plan that is cheaper?”

, Look into the cost of pet insurance and consider whether it is worthwhile. Pet insurance can help you save money down the road on treatment of expensive diseases. It can also help you save money on emergency veterinary visits. See what is covered by various pet insurance plans in order to see whether it is worthwhile.If you have a healthy, indoor cat, you may be better off just paying for the veterinary visits upfront., Keep your cat indoors and away from stray cats, who may carry all kinds of diseases. If you let your cat wander the neighborhood, they may end up getting fleas or picking up expensive to treat diseases."

Use natural light.,
Avoid using the flash.,
Choose a comfortable location for your cat.,
Create contrast with the background.",How to Take Action Photos of a Cat1," It is always best to use natural lighting when shooting action photos. The best lighting occurs when the sun is low in the sky, typically around dawn and dusk. This will give a warm and soft light and you will not see as many shadows. If you are taking pictures inside, position your cat near a window. The light should come from behind the photographer so that it brightens the cat.If you have to shoot during the middle of the day, try and find a shady spot.;
, A flash aimed directly at a cat may distract or even scare them and will result in a red-eye effect. As a result you should avoid using a flash when taking action photos of cats. If a flash is required due to low lighting, make sure to aim the flash upwards into the room and not directly at the cat. This will add light to the image without startling the cat., You should always take photos of your cat in a place where they are completely comfortable. The cat will be relaxed and you will be able to capture it in its favourite environment. For example, your cat may enjoy looking out the window, or scratching on a cat tree. These photos will best capture your cat’s personality., Your cat will show up best in a picture if you use a contrasting and simple background. For example, if you have a black cat, you could hang a white sheet for the background. This way your cat will stand out. If the background is patterned or too busy, the cat may blend in rather than stand out."

Buy a food puzzle.,
Play with your cat every night.,
Buy a cat tree.,
Keep scratching posts around.,
Feed your cat more frequently.,
Give your kitty love and affection.",How to Stop Your Cat from Stealing Things1," Food puzzles are toys that release food if played with correctly. These can keep your cat engaged with something positive. It will also wear it out, so that it will be less likely to cause trouble later.


There are many designs for food puzzles. Start out with an easier one so that your cat can get interested in the concept and become invested enough to do harder puzzles.;
, Cats naturally tend to stay awake during the night, making it easy for them to get into trouble when you are out cold. Playing before bed will wear them out and increase the odds that they spend the night in peaceful slumber, instead of hoarding your belongings in the closet.Every cat is interested in a different type of play. Some like to be chased or to play fight. Others like to run after toys that you roll on the floor or toss around.
Cats love new things. So, you should regularly get new toys, rotate toys, or keep toys away from your cat when you aren’t using them. This will ensure that your cat continues to be interested in the toys.
Popular toys include cloth mice stuffed with catnip, laser pointers, and anything with a long string.
Cats also love to take advantage of new household objects, like boxes and bags., Cats love to climb. Having a high perch for your cat to jump onto will keep it happy, engaged, and tired. Cat trees can be purchased online and in most pet stores to give cats more vertical space.Place the tree directly by a window for optimal results. If you place the tree somewhere the cat doesn't like to be, it won't ever use it.If you have multiple cats, be sure that the tree has enough platforms and scratching posts for each cat.

, Cats need to scratch. Having a couple of things around the house to scratch on—that aren’t your furniture—will help keep your cat occupied. Be sure to have at least one scratching post for each cat in the house.The ideal material for scratching posts is sisal fabric. The scratching post should be tall so that your cat can reach up and strech as it scratches., In nature, cats love to eat slowly throughout the day. If your cat is stealing items to eat, it might be because they are hungry or anxious about not having food around. Try splitting meals up into several feedings of smaller portions or experiment with a new type of food., Your cat might be stealing things because it has found that it is the best way to get your attention. If you spend more time with your cat, pet it, and talk to it, it won’t feel like it needs to seek attention by misbehaving.Though cats are often perceived as independent, studies suggest that most cats care more for human affection than food. However, earning the trust of a cat can take a lot of time and effort. If your cat doesn’t seem to interested in interacting, don’t give up. Slowly work your way up to more social time. "

Make sure your cat is getting enough water.,
Prevent access to problematic water sources.,
Give your cat a pet fountain.,
Give your cat fresh, cold water twice daily.,
Wash your cat’s water bowl each day.,
Place water bowls in multiple places.,
Talk to your vet.",How to Stop a Cat from Drinking from Odd Places1," If your cat is drinking from odd places, it might not be getting enough water on a daily basis. Your cat should be drinking at least one cup or 250 milliliters of fresh water each day., If your cat is drinking from a problematic water source like a fish tank, bathtub, or shower, you can stop this behavior by closing the cat off from these sources. If your cat is drinking from the toilet, for example, make sure the toilet lid is always closed. If your cat is drinking from the fish aquarium, keep the door to that room closed., One way to discourage your cat from drinking out of odd places is to provide them with a pet fountain. A pet fountain will give your cat the running water it enjoys. It will also encourage the cat to drink more water. You can purchase a pet fountain at any pet supply store.Try placing the pet fountain in the room where you feed your cat.
Placing the pet fountain on a hard floor surface like tile or linoleum will make cleanup easier if your cat splashes in the fountain.

, Sometimes cats drink from places like sinks and toilets because they find the water in their bowl unappealing. If you leave your cat’s water sitting out for days, debris can accumulate in the bowl and the water will turn to an unappealing room temperature. Give your cat a bowl of cold fresh water every morning and every evening., Each time you refill your cat’s water bowl, you should make an effort to remove any food debris, dirt, or cat hair that has accumulated. Wash the bowl out before you fill it with fresh, cold water. A clean bowl will make the water more appealing to your cat, and may prevent them from seeking out other sources of water.Stainless steel bowls are easy to clean and disinfect.
The bowl should be just large enough for your cat's nose to reach the bottom.

, Sometimes your cat will be more likely to drink from their water bowl if there are several options. Try leaving two or three different water bowls in several places around the house. Make sure you wash and refill these bowls twice a day., Your cat could be drinking from odd places because of extreme thirst. Underlying medical conditions, low protein diets, and certain medications can cause your cat to become abnormally thirsty. Make an appointment with your vet to make sure your cat's thirst is not related to another issue."

Buy cat toys at the dollar store.,
Make your own cat toys.",How to Save Money on Home Cat Care3," By brushing your cat’s teeth on a regular basis, such as once per week, you can avoid expensive medical bills down the road. You will need a cat toothbrush and toothpaste, which you can find at your local pet store. Ask your veterinarian about the best brands and an appropriate routine., Clumping kitty litter is more expensive than regular kitty litter. It is more expensive because it lasts longer and helps control odor. If you scoop out the dirty litter on a regular basis rather than changing all of the litter at once, the clumping kitty litter will save you money.If you prefer to change all of the kitty litter at once, you will end up spending much more on the clumping variety. In this case, you should purchase the non-clumping variety., Instead of going to the boutique pet store, try shopping for cat toys at your local dollar store. Your cat won’t know the difference.

, Instead of buying expensive toys, sew some catnip mice and make little cat houses. However, always check to make sure there are no sharp objects or joking hazards on the homemade toys.


If you are not a confident craftsperson, you should avoid making homemade toys. They could be a hazard to your cat.
Use some old fabric, needle, thread and some catnip to make your own catnip mouse.Let your cat play with leftover book boxes, paper bags and other stuff in the house. Often, they will prefer to play with random boxes than the toys you buy for them.

Use Aperture Priority Mode.,
Adjust the shutter speed.,
Set your camera to automatic mode.,
Take a series of shots.,
Get down to your cat’s level.",How to Take Action Photos of a Cat2," To take an action photo of a cat you will need to open up the aperture of the camera. This will allow you to focus on the cat and blur out the background, creating a dramatic effect. Using Aperture Priority Mode will automatically adjust the shutter speed so that you can capture your cat in motion. A wide aperture will require a fast shutter speed.A wide aperture is also necessary for shooting indoors.

, When taking action photos of your cat, you should use a fast shutter speed. This can help to freeze the cat in motion. To create this effect, try setting your shutter speed to 1/500th of a second or higher. To do this, you can shoot in “manual mode” or “shutter priority mode.”Alternatively, you could choose a lower shutter speed. This will blur the image, giving the appearance of motion.

, One way to capture a cat in motion is by setting your camera to automatic mode. This will save you time and will make it easier to take a photo at an unexpected moment. You will not waste time fiddling with the camera settings. For example, the camera will automatically focus, making it easier to capture the cat.This is also a great setting if you are new to photography and you are still learning how to manually adjust the shutter speed and aperture.

, If you want to capture your cat jumping, you could take a picture of the cat taking off, in mid-air, and landing. This will be very difficult to do manually, unless you have cat-like reflexes! Alternatively, you can set your camera to “continuous drive” or “burst mode.” This way your camera will take a series of fast photos and will make it easier for you to get a quality image of your cat in motion., If you are taking photos of a cat, they can have more of an impact if you take them from the cat’s level. Get down on the floor and shoot directly at the cat. You will get a more intimate photo and will do a better job capturing the cat’s personality.For an action shot, you could get down on the floor and take a picture of the cat in hunting mode. This adds drama to the photo and provides a unique angle.

Don’t get angry.,
Hide problem items.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian, if necessary.",How to Stop Your Cat from Stealing Things2," Cats do not respond well to negative reinforcement. Instead of yelling at your cat or spraying it with a spray bottle, ignore it when it does something bad.Cats often respond defiantly to anger. In contrast, ignoring the cat will teach it that nothing positive will come from stealing your things.

, If you know that your cat likes to steal one particular item, hide it so that your cat can’t reach it. Otherwise, try to keep the likely suspects out of your cat’s reach. Their favorite objects to steal include: strings, stretchy items, and anything that rolls.Be especially careful about anything that your cat could eat. Eating household items could pose a serious health risk for your kitty., In some rare instances, your cat might be eating unusual items because of a medical condition known as Pica. This can be a symptom of other, very serious illnesses. If your cat persists in eating items after all your best efforts, visit a veterinarian for a check-up. "

Engage in regular interactive play with your cat.,
Give your cat a puzzle feeder.,
Create vertical space for your cat.",How to Stop a Cat from Drinking from Odd Places2," Your cat might be turning on faucets or drinking from the toilet as a source of entertainment. You can distract your cat from these activities by making sure they are stimulated through interactive play every day. Try playing games with a laser, wand toy, or bubbles. You can also engage your cat with balls and feather toys they can chase., Another way you can enrich your cat’s environment and provide stimulation is with a puzzle feeder. A puzzle feeder is a toy that you place food inside of. The cat is rewarded with a treat when it solves the puzzle. This can distract your cat from playing in the toilet or turning on faucets., Consider setting up a cat tree in your home. By creating more vertical space for your cat, you will give them opportunities to play and climb in the new space. You can try a simple cat tree, catwalk, or shelving that you install yourself. You can also purchase more elaborate spaces for your cat, like a floor to ceiling cat tree."

Carry your camera with you at all times.,
Be patient.,
Use a camera extender.,
Sneak up on your cat.,
Use the zoom mode to capture close ups.",How to Take Action Photos of a Cat3," Cats can be difficult to photograph because they are quite independent and will not always pose for a photo. As a result, you should have your camera charged and ready to use at all times. You never know when you will see your cat in a unique position, like chasing a leaf or playing with toys.Having your camera ready and accessible will make it easier for you to capture candid photos of a cat.

, It will take time to capture the perfect action photo of your cat, and as a result you need to be patient. Your cat may not immediately respond the way you want. Do not force them to move to a certain spot. Instead, you may have to wait until they are ready. It could take a number of photo sessions to get the exact image you want., Sometimes cats will sleep on top of cupboards or under the bed. It can be difficult to take pictures in these hard-to-reach locations. Try using a camera extender. This works the best with small point-and-shoot cameras or cell phone cameras. Simply attach the camera to the extender and then position the camera so that you can see the cat., Sometimes the best action shots are unplanned. For example, two cats may be playing with each other and you happen to see them. In order to take candid photos, it is best if you are quiet and the cat is unaware of your presence. Avoid making sudden movements so that you do not distract or scare the cat., You can also capture candid shots by remaining far away from the cat and then using the zoom on your camera lens to get a close up shot. This way you will not distract the cat and can still set up a shot of the cat in motion."

Play with the cat.,
Wake your cat up to get yawning photos.",How to Take Action Photos of a Cat4," Treats can be a great way to get a cat to pay attention to you. Begin by giving the cat a few treats to get their attention. Then you can use treats to get the cat to move into a certain position or look in a specific direction. For example, hold a treat near the lens so the cat will make eye contact with the camera. Alternatively, you can attach the treat to a string and get the cat to move by following the treat.Treats can be a great way to get a cat feeling comfortable with you and the camera. This is especially true if you are taking pictures of a cat that is not yours.

, Try rustling paper to get them to look in a certain direction. Alternatively, you could throw stones or pebbles to try to move the cat to a certain spot. The cat will likely move towards the stones in order to check out what made the noise.You could also place a box or favourite item in the middle of the room. Your cat will likely be curious and examine the new item. You can then take photos of your cat interacting with the box.

, Try turning your next play session into a photo shoot. Have a friend or relative play with the cat using toys. Try to make the cat chase or jump after the toy in order to get the cat moving. Then, use this playful time to take photos of your cat in action.Try using a toy that is attached to a wand or pole. This way you won’t get the person in the photograph.

, Many people want to capture a photograph of their cat yawning. These images show the cat with their mouth completely open. In order to get a yawning picture of a cat, you need to wake them up. When a cat wakes up it typically yawns about 15 to 30 times. You can be ready with your camera to take a photo of your cat in action."

Play with the cat.",How to React If You Find a Lost Kitten or Cat," It can be difficult to tell whether a cat is truly lost, or if it is allowed to venture outside its home. The cat may also be a stray with no home to return to. In general, if a cat seems healthy and calm, you may want to leave him alone. If they seem malnourished, injured, or afraid, they may be either a stray or a lost pet. If the cat is wearing a collar or tags, they definitely belong to someone. It never hurts to contact the owner., The first step in rescuing a lost cat is to get it into your custody. In order to do this, you must first approach the cat slowly and with caution. You do not want to startle it, and you also don’t want to get hurt., As you approach the animal, speak to them in a calm soothing voice. Kittens and cats tend react well to calm words. You may also try clicking, meowing, or saying “here, kitty kitty.”, Using food to coax the animal toward you can be a safe and effective way to bring them close. Be sure to use food that a cat likes, such as canned cat food, tuna, cheese, or milk., Generally speaking, cats do not like to be held or restrained, so it is a good idea for stray cats to be confined somewhere safe. You can try placing the cat inside a pet carrier, a secure cardboard box (with air holes), a small room in your home, or, briefly, in your car, as long as your car is well ventilated and it the temperature isn’t too hot., If you come into contact with a wild or feral cat that you do not feel comfortable restraining, contact your local animal control agency. Never put yourself in danger trying to capture an aggressive cat.In rural areas, you may call the police instead., Once you have restrained the animal, the next step is to look for I.D. tags. If the cat it wearing a collar, look for tags attached to the collar, or information written directly on the collar. Read this information, and use it to contact the cat’s owner., If you do not see any I.D. tags, it is possible that the cat has been implanted with an I.D. chip. Visit your local animal shelter to have the cat scanned for an I.D. chip., If you are considering keeping this cat as your own (if the owner cannot be found), it is a good idea to check the pet ownership laws in your state. In most places, a stray animal is not “owned” by a finder until certain requirements are met.Requirements may include keeping the cat in custody for a specific length of time, obtaining vaccinations, and obtaining a license.
Contact your local animal control agency, SPCA, or humane society to determine the requirements in your state.

, When a pet goes missing, the first thing most owners will do is contact animal shelters in the area. Make a list of any animal shelters near the place where you found the cat and call them. Either a cat fitting this description may have been reporting missing, or you can report the lost cat as found. This way, if the owner should call, the shelter will put them in touch with you.

, If this cat has been missing for a few days (or more) there may be lost pet fliers or ads posted in your area. Look on local bulletin boards, as well as in the newspaper or on craigslist for ads fitting the description of the cat you’ve found.

, If you have not found fliers or ads looking for this cat, you may want to post some yourself. Take a picture of the cat and photocopy it onto a sheet of paper with a brief description of the animal, where you found it, and your contact information. You may also consider placing an ad in your local newspaper or on craigslist (both are usually free)., If you do not want to keep the animal in your care, the best course of action is to drop them off at an animal shelter. This is actually the most effective way for lost pets to be reunited with their owners., Whenever you begin helping a lost cat, you must ask yourself a few important questions. First, you must ask, “If I locate the owner, will I be willing to give this cat back to them?” Second, you must ask, “If I do not find the owner, am I willing to welcome this cat into my home?” If the answer to either one of these questions is “no,” then you should take the cat to your local animal shelter right away., If you are going to take the cat into your home, even for a short period of time, you need to ensure that the cat stays healthy. An important first step is providing a litter box for the cat. Fill the box with litter, place it someplace quiet, and show the cat where the litter box is.


You can purchase an inexpensive box and some littler at a pet store.
Using something from your home, like a cardboard box, is likely to leak and cause a mess.

, Cat food comes in many different types. Select a dry food appropriate for the cat (e.g., kitten food for a kitten or regular cat food for an adult). Offer dry food to the cat first, following serving size on the package. If the cat will not eat the dry food, you may try offering canned cat food.

, In addition to food, set out a dish for your cat with clean, fresh water. Just like you, the cat must drink water daily to survive. Be sure to refresh this dish with fresh water each day.


Avoid offering the cat milk.
Although many cats enjoy milk, it can actually cause digestive distress.

, Whenever you bring a new animal into your home, you need to give them some space and time to get comfortable. Choose a quiet room for the cat. Place their food, water, and any toys there, as well as someplace comfortable to relax. If you have other animals, it is a good idea to introduce them slowly.

, Especially if the cat is very young, or if they seem sick, you may consider bringing the cat to a veterinarian. A vet will be able to tell you the approximate age of the animal, and check for any serious injuries or illnesses. Before seeking medical treatment for a cat, be sure that you are prepared to take on that financial responsibility., Cats need plenty of activity and attention. You can play with a cat using household items (like a feather on a string) or store-bought cat toys. Playing with the cat will boost their mood and help them to stay healthy.

Learn about feline diabetes.",How to Care for a Diabetic Cat," Most people know that human diabetics have to be careful what they eat, and this is also the case with cats. The ideal cat diet is rich in protein and low in carbohydrates. Unfortunately, most cat foods you find at the supermarket will be high in carbs and low in protein. You'll need a cat food geared for your cat's needs.Many premium pet food companies offer high protein prescription diets. These companies include Purina, Hills, and Royal Canin. The Purina diet, DM, comes in wet and dry varieties. As long as the cat has free access to drinking water, either formulation is fine. 
Feeding your cat a protein-dense diet will help your cat’s body reduce the amount of excess glucose it produces. This will help your cat’s body to stabilize itself. Some cats may not need anything more than switching to a high-quality, protein-dense diet. These cats may even go back to normal after a few months of this new diet.;
, Until recently, many believed that the best time to feed a diabetic cat was directly after an insulin injection. However, scientists now recognize that insulin levels will peak 3 to 6 hours after injection, which causes your cat to become hungry. The principle is to match the main meal to the peak insulin activity, which happens around 3 hours after you give them an insulin injection.Before you give your cat an insulin injection it is important to check that they are eating as usual. That's why it is a good idea to give them a snack before their injection. If you notice that your cat refuses to eat, give your vet a call before giving them the injection. If the cat is sick, giving a full dose of insulin could result in an overdose.  
In simple terms, this means splitting your diabetic cat’s daily food allowance into four small meals. Give two small snacks before each insulin injection and the rest in two meals, approximately 3-6 hours after each injection. A typical regime might look something like this:

7am  —  snack + insulin injection
10am —  a meal
7pm  —  snack + insulin injection
10pm  — a meal



, Your cat will require frequent vet visits. The vet will teach you how to give insulin shots or how to track blood glucose, but there will still be some tests that only the vet can perform. These tests might include kidney and liver function testing.If your cat’s diabetes is being well-managed and there are no problems, a vet visit every three months should be sufficient.
Be familiar with warning signs. Changes in thirst, appetite, and the volume of urine the cat produces are all signs that something is wrong. If you notice a diabetic cat is more thirsty than usual, it could be a sign their blood glucose is not adequately controlled. Take your cat to the vet if this happens.

, Find someone reliable to care for your cat when you cannot be at home because of work, school, or travel.Hiring someone knowledge to care for your cat, if you will be out for a long time, will give you and your cat peace of mind. Most veterinary clinics offer boarding, and can recommend cat sitters for diabetic cats.
If a friend will be caring for your cat, be sure to show them how to give injections and/or monitor blood glucose levels. Educate them on behaviors to be aware of, and teach them about what to do and who to contact in an emergency.

, Websites such as FelineDiabetes.com, CatInfo.org, and Diabetic Cats In Need are great resources for diabetic cat owners. Having information and support on hand will be helpful.


Constant veterinary care can get expensive. Some groups like Diabetic Cats In Need offer financial support to owners of cats with diabetes., You will need to use a new, sterile syringe for each injection. Doing this will help to avoid infections. Prepare the syringe with the dosage instructed by your vet.


Don’t try to prepare the syringe while your cat is around. Let your cat do whatever they are doing while you prepare it, prepare the cat’s treat, and then go find your cat.

, You should try to give your cat their injection(s) at the same time each day. Have a high protein, low carb snack for your cat, and approach them with the snack and the prepared syringe. Giving your cat a treat before their injection will help them associate positive things with getting an injection.If you give the injections at the same time each day, you will also be less likely to forget. You can set a reminder on your smart phone if you’re worried about forgetting.

, If you feel worried your cat will try to get away from you, have a person the cat trusts hold onto them firmly, but gently with both hands. Make sure that you can easily and comfortably reach the cat. Help the cat get used to this routine by keeping it relaxed and calm. Avoid startling the cat.

, Use your thumb and forefinger to gently pinch the cat's skin. Typically, you will give the injection in the shoulder or the hip. Pinching the skin will help you insert the needle and will also numb the area a bit.If your cat has long fur, try using a brush or comb to gently part the hair so that you will be able to see the skin when you give the injection.
If you aren't sure where to give the injection, contact your vet.

, When giving an insulin injection insert the insulin just under the skin and not into the muscle. Putting the insulin into the muscle will be painful for the cat. You can do this by holding the syringe so that it is almost parallel to the cat’s skin. Insert the needle into the skin where you are holding it. Do this as quickly and smoothly as you can.You don’t want to jab the needle into the skin as this may make it more painful for the cat. The needle will be sharp, so a quick and smooth insertion is possible. 
Make sure that the bevel (the tip of the needle) is pointed up when you insert the needle. This will help the needle pierce the skin as cleanly and painlessly as possible.
Once you have inserted the needle push the plunger to inject the insulin underneath the cat's skin. Once you have done this, you can remove the needle.

, After you have completed the injection be sure to praise your cat. For example, you can pet them or brush them, and tell them they did a good job. You want your cat to know that they behaved well, so don’t skip this part.Keeping a positive routine will ensure that your cat doesn’t try to hide from you around injection time.

, The gold standard in diabetes control is measuring blood glucose levels. Digital glucose monitors for humans can be used to check your cat’s blood sugar levels. The normal glucose range for cats is around 80 to 120 mg/dl. After a meal the sugar levels in normal cats may rise between 250 to 300 mg/dl. Since the blood sugar of a diabetic cat is maintained by insulin injections, the glucose levels in the blood should be within the normal range.


Regular blood glucose monitoring will help avoid the effects of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Hypoglycemia may occur if accidental overdosing of insulin occurs. In this condition the animal may suffer weakness, confusion, lack of coordination, and in extreme cases coma.
Consult your vet immediately if your cat has high blood glucose even after an insulin injection. 

, Your vet may have suggested you test your cat’s urine with a dipstick a couple of times a week. A typical urine dipstick, like Ketodiastix, has two pads that change color depending on the amount of glucose and ketones in the urine. The main use is to check if the cat is ketone-negative, rather to than monitor urine sugar levels. Your vet will instruct you on how to use these dipsticks.Ketones are toxins produced when blood glucose is high for too long. If ketones are present in the urine, this is a warning the cat is not stable and you should seek urgent veterinary advice.

, Whether or not your cat has diabetes, you should always try to remain aware of how your cat is behaving. Cats are not able to tell us when they are not feeling well. Thus, it is important to know what is and isn’t normal for your specific cat.Contact your vet immediately if you notice that your cat is drinking a lot more water than usual, urinating frequently and in large amounts, is having trouble with coordination, is losing weight for no clear reason, or seems lethargic.

, Just as in humans, cats can suffer from two different types of diabetes. The first type is type 1 diabetes. This type usually requires insulin injections as the pancreas cannot produce the insulin needed to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. The second type is called type 2 diabetes. If your cat has this type of diabetes they may or may not need insulin injections. This depends on whether or not the pancreas is producing enough insulin.


There are four major symptoms of diabetes. These include: frequent and high amounts of urination, increased water consumption, unexplained weight loss, and increased appetite.In some cases, cats with diabetes have returned to normal when the disease was caught early enough and were treated carefully
Cats don't respond well to oral hypoglycemics (drugs that lower blood glucose). This is why insulin injections are necessary to control their condition.

Purchase or rent the appropriate equipment.,
Prepare the equipment.,
Restrain the animal using whichever method keeps the cat calm and is easy for you.,
Obtain the blood sample.,
Place a lancet (the sharp, pin-like tool you will use to draw blood) into the lancet holder and cock it to set the lancet.,
Transfer the blood to the test strip by holding the strip's blood collection tip to the drop of blood.,
Evaluate the results.",How to Check Blood Sugar of a Cat,"


To check the blood sugar of a cat, you will need several pieces of equipment, all of which are similar to those used by humans to test diabetes. These include a blood sugar monitor, which will read and evaluate the blood, a lancet to draw blood from the cat, and test strips upon which to place the blood. All of these pieces of equipment can be obtained from your vet, or from pet supply stores.;
,


Make sure that you have all of the equipment described above nearby and ready for use to achieve the best results when it comes to taking the blood sugar of a cat. This includes placing the glucose test strips into the appropriate port of the blood sugar monitor before performing each test. Having everything prepared and ready to use before getting the cat in place will complete the steps more quickly and thoroughly.

, This could be holding him between your knees, in your lap, between your leg and the back cushion of a couch or chair, or even wrapped gently in a towel with the cat's head exposed.


Having a blood sugar check performed is not an enjoyable process for cats. During testing, they may be more prone to scratching, biting, or otherwise injuring individuals who are in the vicinity, and especially those assisting with the actual test. To prevent this occurrence, consider asking a friend or family member to assist you in performing the blood sugar check. Encourage the untrained assistant to hold the cat securely, while you proceed with the proper protocol.

, The relatively fine fur and the abundance of veins on your cat's ears make them an optimum place from which to take a blood sample.


Before taking the blood sample, it helps to warm the cat's ear slightly to increase the blood flow. Wrap a warm wet washcloth in a sealed sandwich baggie around the ear, or wrap the ear around a pill bottle filled with warm water. You can also try gently massaging the ear for a minute to warm it up.

, Place it on the cat's ear, and press the trigger to engage the lancet's point. A small amount of blood should now be visible.


When finding the right place to take the sample, look along the edge of the cat's ear for a visible vein.

, You will receive a signal when the appropriate amount of blood has been absorbed by the test strip.


After transferring the blood to the test strip, relieve any pain your cat may experience as well as slowing the blood flow. You can rub the ear with a tiny amount of petroleum jelly or pain-relieving antibacterial cream.

,


Within a short period of time, the results of the test should be displayed on the screen of the blood sugar monitor. As ideal blood sugar levels may vary from cat to cat, it is important to work with your veterinarian to determine if the blood sugar levels you are receiving are appropriate for your pet.

You need to get a diagnosis from your vet and advice on a recommended plan for treatment.If you think your cat has diabetes, or if your cat’s existing diabetes has changed, you need to schedule an appointment to see the veterinarian.;
, Insert the end of the sterilized syringe into the vial of insulin and pull back on the dropper until you reach the proper dosage. You should push the plunger all the way down to release the insulin back into the vial, and redraw the insulin again. This will help you safely get the right dosage, as insulin can stick to the inside of the plastic syringe or create an air bubble inside.Don’t shake the insulin bottle unless directed to do so by your vet.

, This is usually given to cats by injection twice daily, but sometimes can be administered differently depending on the formulation. Follow your vet’s advice on how to give your cat the insulin. Typically, insulin shots are given in the back, in the skin between the cat’s shoulder blades.Pull on this loose skin so that it pulls up and away from the cat’s body. Insert the syringe at a 45 degree angle, and pull back on the plunger a bit. If you can see blood enter the syringe, that means you’ve inserted the needle in a blood vessel and you need to remove the needle and choose a new spot.
If there is air, it means you’ve accidentally gone through the skin rather than into it. Remove the air from the syringe and try again.
If there is no blood, push the plunger down slowly until the entire dose of insulin is expelled.
If you give your cat oral hypoglycemics instead of insulin, it may help to hide the pill inside a treat so that your cat will willingly swallow it.

, One of the biggest causes of remission in cases of feline diabetes is regularly providing doses of insulin. After a period of time with a consistent course of insulin treatment, many cats go into full remission.Always consult your vet before making any decisions about changing doses or weaning your cat off of the insulin.
Ask your vet about a new kind of insulin called glargine, which has been shown to promote remission of feline diabetes.

, Early treatment is the single most important factor in feline diabetes remission. The longer the disease is left untreated, the more damage is done to your cat’s body and the less likely it is that the cat will ever experience remission.Watch for symptoms of diabetes and report them to your vet immediately if you suspect feline diabetes. The faster you act, the better the outcome will be.

, Cats who are obese are at a much greater risk for diabetes than cats who are not. In order to keep your cat in diabetic remission, you need to strictly manage its diet. Feed your cat a high quality food that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates. This means that the food should be made with real meat ingredients, not something with “meal” or “byproduct” listed as one of the first ingredients.How much you should feed your cat depends on various factors – like the age, weight, and energy level of your cat. But typically, cats should be fed 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of food twice daily.Consider giving your cat a high quality wet food rather than dry kibbles.
Remember to always change your cat’s food gradually over a period of a week or two, rather than all at once. This will help your cat adjust to the new food and avoid any digestive issues.

, While allowing your cat to self-feed is a much more convenient option, it usually isn’t the best option for your cat. Allowing your cat to eat whenever it wants is one of the leading causes of obesity in cats. Instead, feed your cat a predetermined amount twice daily.Kittens need more food per pound than adult cats do. But regardless of the age of your cat, you should follow your vet’s recommendation for how much food to give the cat at each feeding.
Remember that cats receiving insulin should be fed according to the insulin schedule, meaning that diabetic cats should eat at the same time as the insulin injection.

, Encourage your cat to play and be active in order to help it remain in diabetic remission. This is one of the best ways to help your cat stay healthy and strong in the face of a diabetic diagnosis.Provide your cat with various toys to keep it entertained and active. Try letting your cat chase you around with a string toy, or jump after a feather toy. Throw a toy mouse and play fetch with your cat.

, Cats who suffer from feline diabetes often exhibit an excessive increase in thirst. They can be seen drinking water constantly from many different sources.This also means that there will be an increase in urination with more frequent trips to the litter box.
Remember that most cats enjoy drinking water from running faucets; this is totally normal. You need to be wary of any sudden and excessive increase in thirst, not just normal cat behavior.

, Urinating outside the litter box is a big sign of feline diabetes. If your cat seems to be having accidents, you might want to bring it in to the veterinarian’s office for some test to determine whether or not diabetes is affecting the cat again. Urinating outside of the litter box could also be a sign of a urinary tract infection, which is also a symptom of feline diabetes.
This is especially true for cats who rarely urinate outside of the litter box under normal circumstances.

, If your cat’s coat seems to have suddenly lost its sheen, this could be a sign of the diabetes recurring. You should also take notice if the cat’s fur has become somewhat raggedy over a short period of time.Groom your cat regularly with a wire-bristled pet brush to give yourself an opportunity to inspect the cat’s coat.
If you notice any sudden change in your cat’s appearance or in the texture of its coat, you should notify your veterinarian.

, Some cats with feline diabetes develop a change in the way they walk. Normally cats walk on their feet, but cats with diabetes often start walking with their hocks touching the ground – these are the parts of the cat’s back legs that stretch from the feet to the first joint (kind of like the knee joint). If you see your cat’s hocks on the ground while it walks, take it to the vet immediately.This condition is called diabetic neuropathy. It is the result of a nervous system abnormality that is most often caused by diabetes.

, Another major sign of recurring diabetes in cats is noticeable lethargy. If you notice a sudden decrease in your cat’s energy levels, this could be a warning sign and may be indicative of a serious problem.Monitor how much your cat plays and how interested it seems in being active when you encourage playtime.
Keep track of your cat’s activity levels so that you can report it to your veterinarian.

Feed your cat controlled meals.,
Use a blood glucose monitor to test your cat.,
Schedule insulin shots.,
Download a pet diabetes app.,
Maintain a consistent amount of exercise.,
Treat infection or disease as it occurs.",How to Prevent a Diabetic Emergency in Cats1," An important part of managing diabetes is keeping your cat's diet healthy and consistent. Feed your cat the same amount of food at the same times each day to control its blood sugar. If necessary, set alarms on your smartphone to make sure you remember when to feed your cat.Opt for high protein, low carb cat food (e.g. canned food instead of dry cat food).The amount that you feed your cat should be determined based on its size and energy output (e.g., a cat with reduced mobility will require less food than a playful, active cat).;
, Keep track of your cat's blood sugar at home by using a blood glucose meter. These meters use blood procured from a tiny prick to your cat's ear to assess glucose levels. Brace your cat gently but firmly with one arm before taking blood, and praise and pet it for its cooperation.Another way to measure your cat's blood glucose is to test its urine with urine dipsticks (available from your veterinarian)., If you have to give your cat insulin shots as part of its diabetes treatment, make sure to administer them at the same time each day. To make this easy, give your cat the injections around already-scheduled mealtimes. Your cat might be more amenable to receiving the shot if it knows that its meal will be following right after.To avoid giving your cat too much insulin or ""double-dosing,"" designate one family member to be in charge of administering the daily injections.

, To make managing your cat's diabetes simpler, download a pet diabetes app for your phone. Such an app can help you develop a regular schedule around meals and injections, monitor your pet's glucose levels, track its food and water consumption, set alerts, and record and relay information to your veterinarian. Pet Diabetes Tracker, for instance, is a free app available for iPhone, iPad, and Android.

, Make sure that your cat maintains a regular amount of exercise by engaging it in short periods of play every day. Set aside at least 10-15 for small intervals of activity (e.g., chasing or hunting games). If your cat does not show interest in playing, look online or in pet stores for new toys to get its attention., Be vigilant about treating any illnesses or medical issues that your cat may experience to keep it at peak health. Health issues outside of your cat's diabetes may reduce the effectiveness of its diabetic treatments and should be dealt with promptly. Follow your veterinarian's advice on how to manage any ailments your cat may face and be proactive about monitoring its health."

Help your cat lose weight.,
Feed your cat a specialized diet.,
Increase your cat's activity level.,
Feed a healthy diet.,
Feed small meals throughout the day.",How to Naturally Manage Diabetes in Cats1," In many cases, diabetes symptoms can be minimized through weight loss. Consult with your veterinarian about the best way to achieve weight loss safely, however, the basic principle will be to feed your cat fewer calories over the course of the day.Not all cases of diabetes in cats are weight related. If your cat is not overweight but has developed the condition the cause could be genetic or due to a medication it is on.;
, Your veterinarian may suggest a specific cat food that will help your cat lose weight. In many cases, putting your cat on a diet formula will help it to lose weight. These specialized diets are similar to ordinary cat food, they are just formulated to give your cat fewer calories.


The vet may also suggest decreasing the amount of food you feed your cat every day.

, Weight loss can also be increased by increasing your cats physical activity. Play with your cat often, encouraging it to run around, pounce, and generally move its body.


You can also give your cat toys that it enjoys playing with and chasing after.

, It is recommended that a cat be fed a diet that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates. If at all possible, the carbohydrates that your cat does eat should be complex carbohydrates only, so that sugars are broken down and digested very slowly.Look for commercial cat foods that are high in protein, such as animal protein, and low in carbohydrates, such as grains.


If you want to give your cat a very specific diet, you can make its food at home. However, this kind of diet can also be accomplished with a commercial raw diet, which is usually only available at a natural pet store or from an online supplier., In order to keep your cat's blood sugar level stable it's a good idea to feed multiple small meals over the course of the day. Instead of feeding your cat one large meal, which will make its blood sugar spike, spreading the food out over the day keeps the cat's blood sugar at a more even level.If you are not home to feed your cat during the day, try purchasing a timed feeder for your cat that will give it small meals throughout the day.

Recognize the physical signs of hypoglycemia.,
Observe changes in behavior.,
Watch for reduced energy levels.",How to Prevent a Diabetic Emergency in Cats2," Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can strike your cat quickly even when you make the effort to prevent it. Too much insulin, a change in diet, infection, increased exercise, or other diseases can bring it about. Look for the following physical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia:Muscle twitching
Seizures
Weakness
Inappropriate elimination (outside of the litter box)

, Sudden changes in your cat's behaviour may indicate a hypoglycemic attack. Symptoms like anxiety, depression, and restlessness are common, but may be too subtle to pick up on. Take note if your cat:Breaks out of its daily routine
Is irritable
Vocalizes more or less than usual
Avoids cuddling or being pet

, Lethargy and weakness are possible signs of an impending hypoglycemic attack. If your cat refuses to engage in play or move around for incentives like treats, take note and look for other signs of a hypoglycemic attack. Call your veterinarian to gauge whether emergency medical care is necessary."
"
Determine the cause of your cat’s diabetes.,
Use alternative medicine to treat your cat.,
Test your cat's blood sugar.",How to Naturally Manage Diabetes in Cats2," Talk to your veterinarian about the medications that your cat is on and if they could be causing the diabetes. Certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, can cause diabetes to develop.The good news is that once the use of the medication that is causing the diabetes is suspended, the condition usually clears up on its own.

, Many people who treat their cat's diabetes naturally are proponents of the use of Chinese herbal formulas or other natural supplements, including a variety of natural herbs. Consult with a veterinarian that is trained in traditional Chinese medicine or in another type of natural medicine in order to get a formula that is right for your cat.Homeopathy, an alternative type of medicine, has also been used to treat diabetes in cats. Trained homeopathic practitioners can treat your cat with homeopathy.
Acupuncture can also be used on a cat with diabetes. Contact a trained veterinary acupuncturist if you would like to use this treatment.
The effectiveness of these alternative veterinary therapies is up for debate. Some argue that they have been proven effective, while others argue that there is more research needed to prove that they can help with diabetes. As with other veterinary procedures, it is best to get a trained professional to implement these treatments.

, Even if you decide to avoid giving your cat traditional medication for its diabetes, you should test its blood sugar regularly to make sure it is improving with you natural treatment. This blood sugar testing can be done by a veterinarian or by you at home, with proper training.Discuss the possibility of home glucose testing with your veterinarian. This can be a very accurate and cost effective way of testing your cat.Testing your cat's blood sugar at home requires you to take a small blood sample, basically a pin prick, and to put it into a blood sugar meter. This is a simple process but you may be met with some resistance from your cat.

Discuss the need for insulin with a veterinarian.,
Consider the use of hypoglycemic medications.,
Consider combining various types of treatment.",How to Naturally Manage Diabetes in Cats3," If your cat is severely diabetic it will benefit from insulin therapy. Your cat's pancreas is not producing enough insulin and so giving your cat some will help it process sugar more effectively.Discuss your concerns about treatment with insulin with your veterinarian. They may be able to assuage your fears. Even if they can't, having a conversation about your options can't hurt.
Insulin needs to be given in the correct dosage, otherwise it could cause your cat's blood sugar to drop to a dangerously low level. Be sure to follow the directions of a veterinarian if you do decide to give your cat insulin., These medications will lower your cat's blood sugar. However, they are not usually prescribed. Consider using them if your veterinarian suggests them, as this means that your cat's condition is serious and needs extreme treatment., Just because you decide to put your cat on insulin that doesn't mean that you shouldn't work on changing its lifestyle or that you can't also use natural medicine practices also. With enough lifestyle changes you may be able to decrease your cat's need for insulin so much that it no longer needs the medication.


In a case like this, the insulin only served as a temporary solution that helped your cat until the disease was under control.
However, if you decide to wean your cat off of insulin, it should be done under the care of a veterinarian. Extreme changes to insulin levels can be dangerous for your cat."

Dispose of the used needle properly.",How to Administer Insulin to a Cat," Your insulin will come with detailed directions on proper storage and handling. Make sure to familiarize yourself with these directions, and ask your vet if you have any questions.;
, Insulin will deteriorate and become ineffective if it is exposed to heat. It is best to store the insulin in the refrigerator door, where temperatures are the most stable.If the insulin appears cloudy, discolored, has been exposed to heat, or is expired, dispose of it and start with a new bottle.

, This will make the injection more comfortable for your cat. To do this, take the insulin vial out of the refrigerator and let it sit in a cool area, out of direct sunlight, for up to an hour. You can also warm the insulin by gently rolling the bottle between the palms of your hands., Roll the bottle 2 or 3 times so the contents are uniformly mixed. Never shake the insulin, as this can cause bubbles to form., Remove the needle guard from the end of your syringe. Turn the insulin bottle upside-down and slide the needle into the rubber stopper at the top of the bottle., Draw back the plunger to fill the syringe with the amount of insulin indicated by your vet as the correct dosage for your cat. Push the plunger back in to shoot the insulin back into the bottle, then draw the insulin back into the syringe a second time. This will help reduce the chances of air bubbles getting into the syringe, which can make it difficult to measure the dosage accurately.Double-check the syringe to make sure that you have the correct dosage. Your vet should provide you with clear instructions about how many units or milliliters to administer to your cat.

, Once you have double checked that you have the right dosage of insulin in the syringe, put away the insulin bottle in your refrigerator and place the syringe somewhere safe (e.g. on a clean kitchen counter, in your bathroom medicine cabinet, or in some other cool, stable place where it will be out of reach of pets and small children) until you are ready to administer the dosage to your cat.

, Your vet may instruct you to give your cat an injection once or twice a day. It is best to administer the injections at approximately the same time(s) every day. Insulin injections are most effective when administered immediately after the cat has eaten.It’s okay if you are not able to administer the injections at exactly the same time(s) each day. A variation of an hour or so will not harm your cat.

, It is best not to inject the insulin while the cat is eating, because this may cause your cat to feel nervous and unsafe during meal times. Allow the cat to finish eating undisturbed.Ask your vet what to do if your cat skips a meal or vomits immediately after eating. They may recommend giving the cat a reduced dosage in these situations.

, Pet or groom your cat a few times to ease anxiety, and speak to your cat in a quiet, reassuring voice. You can try offering a small, healthy treat, like a piece of cooked, unseasoned chicken, as you are preparing your cat for the injection.If your cat tends to struggle or panic during an injection, you may wish to ask someone else to help you hold or gently distract the cat while you administer the injection.

, If you are confident that your cat will remain calm during the injection, you might place the cat on your lap. However, there is less risk of injury to you and your cat if you place the cat on a flat, elevated surface, like a table top., Once you have the cat in position and ready to receive the injection, pick up the syringe that you filled with the correct dosage of insulin. Take the safety cap off the needle, and hold the syringe with your dominant hand (i.e. if you are right-handed, hold the syringe in your right hand)., Select a small fold of skin along the cat’s back, shoulders, side of the chest, or abdomen.Avoid injecting the insulin into the same site repeatedly, as this can result in scar tissue buildup or granulomas., Take care not to push the needle all the way through the fold of skin or into your thumb or finger where you are holding the cat’s skin. Keep your thumb on the plunger as you are inserting the needle., Push the plunger in with your thumb, and immediately pull the needle out when you are finished.You may wish to draw the plunger back slightly before you make the injection, to insure that you have not hit a blood vessel. If blood enters the syringe when you pull back the plunger, remove the needle and make the injection somewhere else.
Replace safety cap on the needle as soon as you have finished making the injection.

, Praise your cat in a gentle voice and gently pet the cat. You may also offer the cat a small treat, like a piece of cooked chicken.

, Place the capped needle in a puncture-proof container. You may be able to obtain a specialized “sharps” container from your vet’s office or your local pharmacy. Ask your vet or your local waste disposal service about proper disposal procedures in your area."

Keep records.",How to Spot Feline Diabetes," Diabetic cats aren’t able to absorb and use glucose properly, which leads to abnormally high levels of glucose being filtered out through the urine. When this process occurs, extra water is carried out of the body along with the glucose. This means that your cat is losing too much water and will start trying to counter this by increasing their water intake.Watch your cat’s water bowl to see if the water levels are decreasing more quickly than usual.
You should also be mindful about whether your cat is searching for alternative water sources – like drinking out of the sink, the toilet, or other unusual locations.
A diabetic cat will seem to be constantly drinking water.;
, Because the glucose is being carried out with the water and the cat tries to make up for this by drinking more, a diabetic cat will also start urinating much more frequently. Clean your cat’s litter box regularly so you can monitor this symptom.Check your cat’s litter box for signs of excess urination compared to their regular usage.
And be mindful about whether or not your cat starts peeing in other places outside the box.

, There are many reasons why a cat may stop using the litter box for its bathroom needs (this is called inappropriate elimination). Feline diabetes is one of the major causes of inappropriate elimination. If your cat starts urinating or defecating outside of the litter box, you should take your cat to the vet to make sure it doesn’t have feline diabetes or another kind of urinary problem.Inappropriate elimination can also be caused by stress, overcrowding, the location of the litter box, or because the cat thinks the litter box isn’t clean enough.

, A diabetic cat may have a significant change in appetite. This can take several forms including eating too much or eating way less. So try to notice any change in appetite or eating habits exhibited by your cat.A diabetic cat may feel unwell, which could lead to a loss of appetite.
Additionally, a diabetic cat may feel the need to eat more because they aren’t getting the glucose that they need from their normal diet.

, Because the body of a diabetic cat can no longer handle the glucose within it, the cat will tend to lose weight rather quickly. Watch your cat carefully if you notice any weight loss. You can even try weighing the cat at home to regularly monitor your cat’s weight.Cat’s have such small bodies, relatively, that any noticeable change in weight is cause for concern and should be discussed with your veterinarian as soon as possible.

, Because feline diabetes can often affect the nervous system, some cats who suffer from this disease end up walking differently. Most cats walk on their paws, but diabetic cats often begin walking on their back hocks – this is the part of the leg above the paw that runs up until the first bend in the cat’s leg. If your cat is walking with its hocks touching the ground, you should notify your veterinarian immediately.This condition is called diabetic neuropathy.

, There are still more signs and symptoms that could be present in cats with feline diabetes. Since cats who are affected by this disease aren’t able to ingest and digest food in the proper way, they may also suffer from other symptoms as a result. Some of these related symptoms include:Vomiting
Weakness
Depression
Dull, unhealthy coat

, Just as in human diabetes, the single greatest risk factor for your cat developing feline diabetes is your cat’s weight. If your kitty is overweight, its chance of developing diabetes increases exponentially.If your cat is getting dangerously obese, your veterinarian may recommend a weight-control diet to help your cat lose weight and reduce the risk of developing diabetes.

, Elderly cats often are more prone to developing diabetes than younger, healthier cats. Watch your older cat for symptoms of feline diabetes to be sure that you catch it in the early stages and are able to treat it properly.Once your cat is about eight years old, they are more prone to developing health issues that could be potentially harmful and need monitoring.

, Because glucose is processed through the pancreas, a cat with a history of pancreatic problems is already at a greater risk for developing diabetes in their lifetime. It is important to monitor your cat’s pancreatic health if your cat has existing problems with its pancreas.Take your cat to regular yearly vet appointments (or more frequently if recommended by your veterinarian) so that your vet can monitor your cat’s pancreas and the possibility of developing diabetes.

, As soon as you start spotting the signs of feline diabetes, make an appointment with your vet so they can run some tests on your cat. To test for feline diabetes, your vet will most likely take a blood sample to check your cat’s blood glucose levels.Your vet will also be able to perform the necessary treatment for any possible side effects of the disease like dehydration.
You can Check Cats for Dehydration ahead of time so you have more information to give the vet.
If your cat is dehydrated, your vet might recommend switching your cat to wet food since there is more water content in this type of food.
In emergency situations, your cat may require an IV for rehydration purposes – administered by your vet.

, Understanding feline diabetes can be a difficult task but it is important for your cat’s health that you learn all you can about it. There are two types of the disease, aptly named Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Symptoms for both types are similar, and only a veterinarian can diagnose the difference.Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin.
Type 2 diabetes is when the body cannot handle the insulin production that is taking place efficiently.

, One thing that is usually advised is that the diet of the cat must change and the weight must be monitored. Complex carbohydrates alongside high fiber content is usually advised and this is to not only ensure that the cat loses weight safely but also to keep a steady level of glucose in the body. A high protein/low carbohydrate diet is usually the best choice for a diabetic cat.Confer with your vet about what kind of food is best for your diabetic cat.
Your vet may suggest mixing some wet food into your cat’s diet since there is a higher water content in this type of food.

, Just like human diabetes, the feline kind of the disease can also be treated with injections of insulin as well as orally taken medications. Your veterinarian will discuss medication options with you and help you decide which route is best for your cat.It is very likely that you will have to give your cat daily insulin injections in order to keep your cat healthy. Your vet will demonstrate how to do this and you’ll soon be able to do it easily.

, In order to ensure your diabetic cat is receiving the proper treatment, you should keep daily records of their behavior. Your vet may also wish to do regular testing on your cat’s urine to check glucose levels. In your daily records, include observations about:Time of insulin injection
Amount of insulin injected
Amount of water consumed
Amount of food consumed
Weight of the cat

Feed your pet.,
Rub syrup or honey on its gums.,
Make an emergency plan.,
Getting veterinary care.",How to Prevent a Diabetic Emergency in Cats3," If your pet is alert, feed it a meal to regulate its blood sugar. If your cat is not alert enough to eat, give it a tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to lick to perk it up. Once your cat is responsive enough, feed it its normal food.Never pour syrup or honey directly into your cat's mouth as it might cause choking, or get absorbed into the lungs.

, If your cat is unconscious, rub corn syrup or honey on its gums to try to revive it (which should occur within 1-2 minutes of the sugar being absorbed into the gums). If it wakes up, try to feed it some of its regular food and bring it to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your cat does not wake up, or if it experiences seizures, bring it to the nearest emergency animal clinic immediately., Make a plan for veterinary emergencies beforehand to prevent panic or uncertainty in a crisis. Write down the name, phone number, and address of the two nearest 24 hour emergency care pet clinics. Place the information on the fridge or another easy-to-spot place so that it will be accessible in an emergency., If your cat is unconscious or has seizures, do not hesitate to bring it to an 24 hour emergency veterinary clinic immediately. If your cat is conscious but sluggish during an attack, wait for it to stabilize then transport it to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your cat misses an insulin shot, or is given too much insulin, contact your veterinarian for see when it should receive the next dose."
"
Do a body condition score.,
Visit the vet.,
Discuss a variety of options.",How to Put Your Cat on a Diet1," Before you put your cat on a diet, it’s important to determine whether or not your cat really needs to lose weight. A body condition score consists of a scale from one to five—with five being obese and one being emaciated. An ideal score is three. Rate your cat on the scale according to the following standards:Score 1: Ribs, spine, and pelvis stick out and can be seen even at a distance. The cat has no body fat and looks starved and bony.
Score 2: Ribs, spine, and pelvis can be easily felt. Viewed from above, the cat has a distinct waist. Viewed from the side, the belly is tucked up. The cat looks thin.
Score 3: Ribs and spine can be felt but not seen. The cat has a slight waist when viewed from above, and a level (but not saggy) tummy from the side. Ideal.
Score 4: Ribs and spine difficult to locate. Pear-shaped tummy from above and sagging down from the side. Can be described as chunky or stout.
Score 5: Bony landmarks obscured by fat. Thick cover of fat over chest and tummy. Oval silhouette. Obese.;
, If your cat’s body condition rates as a four or five, then see your veterinarian for more guidance. Your veterinarian will have tools to determine the target weight for your cat based on your cat’s exact size, using a series of measurements such as the length of your cat’s head, width of head, backbone length, radius of the wrist, and girth measurement.The visit to the vet is equally important because your vet will perform a physical exam of your cat to ensure that simple overeating is the cause of your cat’s weight problem and not a more serious medical condition.

, Several methods are available to help your cat lose weight. When your veterinarian sets a target weight for your cat, discuss the various options available. Your vet will likely recommend a combination of options that may include restricting your cat’s caloric intake, putting your cat on a metabolic diet, and/or making changes to the cat’s lifestyle.


Regardless of the strategy you and your vet determine is best for your cat, prepare for a long-term commitment because gradual weight loss is healthier for your cat than a sudden change. In fact, starving your cat puts her at risk for developing hepatic lipidosis (or fatty liver disease), which is where an abundance of fat stores overwhelm and affect the functioning of your cat’s liver."
"
Learn how caloric intake affects weight.,
Determine the ideal caloric intake for your cat.,
Consider switching to a prescription weight loss formula cat food.,
Weigh your cat weekly.,
Consider taking the cat to a pet weight-watching clinic.,
Feed your cats separately.",How to Put Your Cat on a Diet2," Weight loss from a calorie-controlled diet involves following a simple equation: the calories in versus the calories out equals weight loss or gain. Therefore, if your cat consumes more calories than she burns off in a day, she will gain weight. Thus to get the cat to lose she must take in slightly less than her daily needs., This option means counting your cat’s calories as you switch her to the reduced diet. Veterinarians recommend that you feed your cat 75 to 80 percent of the resting energy requirements for her ideal weight.This amount should help your cat lose weight at a healthy pace of one to two percent of her body weight each week.You should consult your vet for the exact caloric amount, but approximate amounts are:180 calories/day for an ideal weight of eight pounds
210 calories/day for an ideal weight of ten pounds
230 calories/day for an ideal weight of twelve pounds

, You may have difficulty achieving this caloric intake with a standard, calorie-dense cat food simply because it’ll be much less food. Your cat especially won’t appreciate it. A formula specifically meant to help with weight reduction in cats will be low in calories and high in fiber, allowing your cat to eat nearly the same amount of food per day while still achieving the desired reduction in calories.The cutback in a standard food will leave your cat feeling hungry and underfed, which means she’ll both pester you for more food and her body’s metabolism may slow due to the perception of underfeeding, which will make it harder for her to lose weight.Your veterinarian will determine the best weight loss formula for your cat. Options include Hills R/D and Purina OM. These formulas also often contain L-carnitine, which is a supplement that can encourage your cat’s body to burn off fat instead of lean muscle.
Use a kitchen scale when measuring instead of a dry measuring cup in order to be more precise.

, Weigh your cat and record the weight on a weekly basis.It is perfectly normal for your cat to hit plateaus in the process where she might stop losing weight before the target weight.Consult your vet about reducing the caloric intake another five to ten percent for further results.

, Those attending a pet weight watchers are much more likely to reach their target weight than those not attending. This is because the regular weigh ins and the moral support of the staff make you less likely to give in to your cat pestering for food. Plus, the staff can often spot areas where you can make a difference or are perhaps slipping up.


These weight-watching clinics for your cat may be put on through your veterinarian’s office, or your vet will likely have more info on where to find one in your area.

, If part of the problem is that you have two cats but only one is overweight, then feed them in separate rooms.This will ensure that each cat only gets the portion of her food that corresponds to her diet.

"
"
Understand what metabolic diets do.,
Consult with your veterinarian.,
Consider the ‘catkins’ diet for your diabetic cat.",How to Put Your Cat on a Diet3," These diets work by stimulating your cat’s metabolism to work harder and burn fat, while protecting your cat’s lean muscle. Researchers found that lean cats have genes coding for a higher metabolic rate, and in turn discovered certain foods’ molecules are more likely to switch these genes on more than others.In contrast, research showed that calorie-restricting diets turned these genes off, making it more difficult for some cats to lose weight., If your cat cannot seem to lose weight on a reduced-calorie diet—or has hit a plateau in her weight loss prior to her target weight—then ask your vet about a metabolic diet for your cat.


Hills is the main producer of metabolic formula diets. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions based on your cat’s target weight.

, Another metabolic diet option for your cat is the “catkins” diet, which is a low-carb, high-protein diet that works especially well for overweight cats that have developed feline diabetes.One study showed that 68 percent of diabetic cats on the “catkins” diet were able to come off insulin as compared to 40 percent of those on a standard, high-fiber weight loss diet.Your veterinarian will test for feline diabetes in your overweight cat and discuss this option with you.
Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for your cat’s target weight for a high-protein, low-carb weight loss formula food.

Exercise your cat.,
Provide plenty of water.,
Entertain your cat.,
Provide a higher frequency of smaller meals.,
Reduce treats.,
Use your cat’s hunting instincts.",How to Put Your Cat on a Diet4," More activity burns more calories. An active cat will lose weight much more effectively than a cat that never gets any exercise. In addition to the extra calories burnt, exercise for your cat will also reduce her appetite and increase her metabolic rate—which can counter the slowed metabolism related to reduced-calorie diets.Engage in a game of chase by projecting a laser pointer on the ground and having your cat chase it.
You can also use toys attached to string to play with your cat and get her burning calories.
If you have trouble getting a lazy cat up and running, then try a catnip toy., Water is important in keeping your cat active as well as aiding metabolic function. As with people, drinking fluid can also assist in making your cat feel fuller while on a restricted diet. Ensure that you keep her water dish consistently clean and full., Like people, cats can eat out of boredom. Many cat owners make the mistake of providing attention mostly in the form of providing food and treats. Instead, spend more time playing with your cat and brushing her to cut down on potential boredom., Do not place all of your cat’s food for the day—whether a diet formula or otherwise—out at one time for your cat to eat freely throughout the day. Cat’s do better with controlled portions provided at intervals, so you should divide your cat’s meals into two or three servings a day., You should cut back heavily on the amount of treats you’re giving your cat since these amount to empty calories. Instead, use play, grooming, and other attention as positive reinforcement., Another behavioral strategy you can try is to get your cat to mimic hunting behavior. A feral cat living off mice makes a kill three to four times a day, and is used to having several small snacks throughout the day. To mimic hunting behavior, fill several small food bowls and hide them around the house. This will force your cat to go ‘hunting’ and exert some energy to try to find her food bowls.


This faux hunting helps to engage your cat both physically and mentally.
Another option is to use a play ball filled with food. These sort of balls require the cat to play with the ball and bat it around in order to make the kibble fall out.

Know your cat's ideal weight.,
Learn how to body score your cat.,
Take your cat to the vet.,
Be aware that a greedy cat with a thin body indicates a problem.",How to Put Weight on a Cat1," Have a target weight or body shape in mind. It is a common problem to overshoot the mark and turn a thin cat into a fat cat, which comes with a whole new set of health problems.;
, This will help you recognize when it reaches an ideal weight.Body scoring is about feeling for your cat's ribs and backbone, to see how much fat covers the bones, and looking at the cat's body shape to recognize if it is over or under weight.


The perfect cat should have ribs and a backbone that is easily felt, but without standing out through the fur. The cat should also have a slight waistline when viewed from above and the side, but without sharp angles.
Healthy weight charts can easily be found online that illustrate and describe feline body scores, making it easier to analyze your cat's body.
Alternatively your vet can weigh your cat and make an estimate of their desired target weight. Weigh the cat weekly at home and keep a record of its weigh-ins.

, They can assess your cat's health and make suggestions for any necessary treatments. In addition, your vet can take care of routine deworming. If your cat is healthy but underweight, make sure it is dewormed against both roundworms and tapeworms. Be sure to check whatever product you use is effective against both sorts of worms. Some common products, such as Stronghold (UK) Revolution (US) and off the shelf products such as Hartz once-a-month wormers, work against roundworms but NOT tapeworms.


Speak to your vet about a multi-wormer containing praziquantel, in order to kill tapeworms as well.

, If your cat is older, runs around like a kitten, eats well, but is losing weight, be aware the cat may have a medical problem called hyperthyroidism. This involves the cat having high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood stream, which acts as a stimulant. The cat burns off calories quickly and eats loads to try and replace them. However, despite the cat's apparent good health, this stimulation puts pressure on the organs, including the heart and kidneys.


Rather than trying to combat the problem by feeding the cat more, seek veterinary help and get the source problem corrected to preserve your pet's good health.The vet might tell you that your cat has anorexia. This means that it lacks the desire to eat. In this case, they may tell you to water down canned food and give it to your cat using an oral syringe. Ask your vet if they think this approach would help your cat bridge the gap until it is in better health.

Manage your cat’s diabetes.",How to Get Your Cat Out of the Malnutrition Stage," Although cats can be clever when it comes to concealing illness, your cat will probably not be able to hide her malnourishment. Signs to look for include dry and scaly skin, muscle weakness, and runny or hard feces. She may also stop grooming, feel fatigued, and become very skinny.Malnutrition can cause neurologic signs in cats. For example, a vitamin B1 deficiency can cause a cat to have a head tilt, become uncoordinated, and possibly have seizures.;
, Malnutrition is a serious disease in cats that can lead to other serious medical conditions. If your cat is showing signs of malnutrition, take her to your veterinarian.Your veterinarian will examine her physical condition and perform other diagnostic tests, such as blood work and urinalysis, to determine the severity of the malnutrition.


Diagnostic test results can also reveal if your cat is suffering from other malnutrition-related diseases, such as hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease).
After the examination, your veterinarian will be able to provide you with a treatment plan.
Be aware that your veterinarian may recommend that your cat be hospitalized if the malnutrition is severe.
Your veterinarian may recommend dietary supplements, such as vitamin B12 injections., Weighing your cat on a regular basis can help you to see if he or she is gaining weight or not. Try to weigh your cat about once per week to see if he or she is gaining weight.


To weigh your cat, step on a scale while holding your cat. Observe the weight and write it down.
Then, put your cat down and step on the scale again by yourself. Write this number down as well.
Next, subtract the higher weight (while holding the cat) from the lower weight (not holding the cat) to find out how much your cat weighs.

, Worms can cause weight loss as well as other serious problems in cats, so ask your cat’s veterinarian about deworming your cat as part of your efforts to deal with your cat’s malnutrition.Your veterinarian may require a stool sample from your cat to determine whether or not he or she has worms.


Newborn kittens need to be wormed starting at two weeks of age and then continuing every two weeks until the kitten is eight weeks old.
Kittens over eight weeks need to be wormed every month until they reach six months of age.
Cats over six months old need to be wormed once every one to three months., Dental issues may also interfere with your cat’s ability to chew food, so you may want to inspect the malnourished cat’s teeth to check for problems. If you notice any problems, then you should take your cat to see a veterinarian. Some things to watch for include:pawing at the mouth
bleeding from the mouth
bad breath
drooling
flinching or crying in pain if you touch your cat’s mouth

, Older cats may have a hard time getting to food dishes that are placed in inconvenient places, such as in the basement or on a counter top. Make sure that you place your cat’s food and water dishes in locations that will be easy for him or her to access.


You may even consider placing a food and water dish upstairs and another food and water dish downstairs.

, Cats sometimes develop food guarding behaviors that may lead them to chase other cats away from the food bowls.Watch to see if any of your cats are bullying the malnourished cat. If so, then you may need to provide a separate space for the malnourished cat to eat in peace.


For example, you could feed the malnourished cat in your bedroom with the door closed so that the bullying cat cannot bother the malnourished cat.
Another option is to provide additional food bowls in multiple locations of your house., This is applicable if you are currently feeding your cat a homemade diet. Your intentions are likely good for preparing your cat’s food at home, but the homemade diet may be low in essential vitamins and minerals. In addition, if you use vegetable oil to cook the foods, you could be giving your cat food that she will not want to eat anyway—cats tend not to like vegetable oil.Refusing to eat the food you prepare for her could be causing your cat’s malnutrition.
Commercial diets are formulated to contain the proper amounts of essential vitamins and minerals, making them a good choice for your cat.If you choose to continue feeding your cat a homemade diet, consult with your veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist. These experts can formulate recipes for you that will meet your cat’s nutritional needs and address her nutritional deficiencies., Since cats are carnivores, it is essential that your cat eat meat. Meat provides your cat with protein and vitamin A that are necessary for her overall health.Commercial wet cat foods are good sources of meat for your cat.Even if you are a vegetarian or vegan, your cat’s health will suffer if you feed her a meatless diet as well. In addition to protein and vitamin A deficiencies, she will also become deficient in a nutrient called taurine,which can lead to tooth decay and heart failure.Vegetarian/vegan diets for cats are also deficient in such nutrients as calcium and vitamin E., Cats love fish and liver, but these two foods do not necessarily love cats back. If your cat eats a lot of fish, she could develop a thiamine deficiency. Too much liver can lead to vitamin toxicities.Fish contains an enzyme called thiaminase that breaks down thiamine, leading to a deficiency of this important nutrient.If fish and liver have become regular staples of your cat’s diet, consider limiting her intake of these foods to the occasional scrumptious treat.

, Tuna is another food that cats love. Unfortunately, too much tuna can lead to vitamin E deficiency and eventual malnutrition. This vitamin E deficiency can cause a disease called steatitis (‘yellow fat disease’).Limit your cat’s tuna intake to the occasional treat.
Your cat may have gotten accustomed to the taste of tuna if you have fed it to her regularly.She probably won’t be too pleased with eating less of it, but the reduced amount will help bring her out of the malnutrition stage.

, It is important to increase your cat’s food intake gradually rather than feeding him lots of extra food all at once.If you want your cat to eat more food, then try adding a little extra food to his or her food bowl every day. Otherwise, the cat may end up getting sick and may become more malnourished as a result.

, If your cat is a carrying a few extra pounds, it would be a good idea to get her down to an ideal body weight, which is 8 to 10 pounds (3.6 to 4.5 kg).Obesity is among the most common causes of malnutrition in cats,so your cat’s extra pounds could be contributing to her malnutrition.


Weight loss in cats should be done gradually to prevent hepatic lipidosis.Talk with your veterinarian to develop a weight loss plan that includes reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity for your cat.

, In addition to rapid weight loss, prolonged malnutrition can lead to hepatic lipidosis. If your cat remains deficient in nutrients for too long, her internal organs, particularly her liver, can start to fail. When your cat’s liver can no longer function, it begins to accumulate excess fat.Hepatic lipidosis can start develop as soon as one to two days after your cat has stopped eating. Take your cat to the veterinarian for treatment if your cat has not eaten for 24 hours.Symptoms of hepatic lipidosis include constipation, depression, and yellowing of the eyes.Treatment for hepatic lipidosis primarily involves dietary treatment: immediate replenishment of protein and various dietary supplements (e.g., taurine, vitamin E).Depending on the severity of the disease, your cat may need intensive veterinary treatment that involves force feeding through a tube placed down her esophagus, or a syringe., Diabetes, when left untreated, can lead to a loss of appetite and eventual malnutrition in cats.If your veterinarian has diagnosed your cat with diabetes, make sure that you are following the treatment recommendations to effectively manage the diabetes and prevent malnutrition.


Treatment for feline diabetes typically includes insulin injections and dietary changes (e.g., high-fiber and high-complex carbohydrate diet, scheduled feedings)."
"
Assess the quality of your cat's diet.,
Speak to your vet about a high quality diet.,
Consider competition between cats.",How to Put Weight on a Cat2," Cat digestion is designed to process a high protein diet. A food which contains a high proportion of cereal or non-animal protein is less than optimal and may be hard for your cat to digest, resulting in insufficient calories.Read the label of your cat food. It should list a named meat as the first two or three ingredients, with cereals and vegetables way down the list. If cereals or soy are high up the list, switch foods.

, Many premium supermarket foods are highly palatable, but are made so with the addition of flavorings and therefore not nutritionally ideal. Your vet should have some suggestions about what foods will be best for your cat.


Raw food diets are high in water and nutrients. Ask if raw food would be a better choice for your pet. You can buy raw food at pet stores, online, or make at home. Be very careful that your raw food is nutritionally complete or you may end up damaging your cat's health.
A good indicator of quality is to chose a manufacturer who also creates prescription diets for the veterinary market, because their knowledge of treating ill health through diet could also cross-pollinates into their regular cat foods.
Royal Canin and Hill's are examples of over the counter foods that also manufacture prescription food.

, If your have several cats be careful to observe the dynamics between the cats and make sure the thin cat is not being bullied or kept away from the food bowl. Make sure each cat has its own food bowl, and be sure to place the food bowls at opposite ends of a room, or even in separate rooms. This makes it harder to a dominant cat to patrol the food area and prevent other cats getting access.


If you have a greedy cat that eats everyone else's portions, consider getting a microchip activated food bowl. These devices have a locked lid which is only opened when the cat approaches whose microchip bears the number programmed into the dish.

"
Increase the frequency of feeding.,
Increase the calorie content of the food.,
Consider giving your cat treats between meals.,
Be careful what you add to food.,
Reassess your feeding schedule once the cat reaches its target weight.",How to Put Weight on a Cat3," Most cats would rather graze throughout the day, rather than gorging themselves all at once. With this in mind, feed the cat more frequently, rather than offering larger meals.


This is more in tune with the cat's natural digestive processes and its more likely to finish a small bowl of food than a large one.

, Canned food has a high moisture content (around 70-75% is water) so an easy way of getting more calories into a cat is to switch to dry kibble (provided kitty is happy to eat dry food). The lower moisture content means that for each mouthful of food eaten the cat is taking in nearly four times as many calories.Consider offering a highly palatable, calorie dense food. Hills AD is a recovery diet made to put weight on cats that are convalescing after an illness. It is liver based and ultra tasty for many cats, as well as being calorie dense. It's soft pate like texture also encourages cats to eat who have sore mouths, or are otherwise feeling delicate.

, Treats are usually tasty, which means high calorie, and attractive to most cats. However, be careful not to dull the cat's appetite when it comes to mealtimes., For example, be careful if you decide to increase your cat's calorie intake by giving cream or milk. The cream has a high fat content that can trigger diarrhea, which will then cause your cat to lose precious calories. Milk contains lactose which many cats are unable to digest and will therefore also give the cat diarrhea., Stop feeding for weight gain and start on a maintenance food. Weigh out the ration and give the amount recommended on the package for a cat of that weight.

Monitor your cat's weight.",How to Determine if Your Cat is Overweight," You can start determining if your cat's overweight by looking at him. Examining your cat from above and from the side should help you determine if his weight is a problem.


Look at your cat from above. The area between his ribs and hips should move inward slightly, creating a clearly defined waist. If there is no waist or if his waist is wider than either his hips or ribs, your cat may be overweight.You should also look at your cat from the side. Cats who are at a healthy weight have what is called an abdominal tuck. This means the area just behind their ribs should have a smaller diameter than the chest. If you do not see an abdominal tuck, your cat may be overweight.;
, You can further examine your cat by touching him. Run your hand over your cat's sides. You should be able to easily feel his ribs. If you cannot feel his ribs, or have to push down to do so, your cat may be overweight., You should also be able to feel bones near the base of your cat's tail. While there should be a small layer of fat protecting this area, you should be able to feel the outlines of his bones without much effort. If you cannot easily feel bones here, your cat may be overweight., A cat's spine, hips, and shoulders should also be fairly bony. While very visible and pointy bones may indicate your cat is underweight, in a healthy cat you should be able to easily detect hip bones, spine bones, and shoulder bones through gentle petting. If you're unable to feel these bones due to layers of fat, your cat is overweight., Many cats have a saggy bit of flesh that hangs down between their back legs. If your cat is otherwise bony, this small pouch of skin is unlikely to be an indication of a weight problem. This skin flap is referred to as the ""primordial pouch"" and its purpose is to protect the stomach during fights with other cats. Cats often kick with their back legs when angry, and this flap of skin protects your cat from such attacks. Many cats will develop a primordial pouch at some point in their lives and it is not necessarily an indicator of feline obesity.However, excess fat may be stored in your cat's primordial pouch if he is overweight. If he shows other symptoms of obesity, check his pouch. It should hang loose and be mostly comprised of skin. If the pouch seems to be filling out with fat, this can be an indicator of obesity., If you're concerned after doing a body check, you should take your cat to see a veterinarian. You can weigh your cat yourself at home but it's better to take him to the vet. The scales at a vet's office are specifically designed for use on animals. A vet will also be able to determine if your cat is medically obese considering his body type. While a body check can give you insight as to whether you should be concerned, professional veterinary evaluation is important when diagnosing your cat as overweight or obese.

, When you're at the vet's office, your vet will ask you a variety of questions regarding your cat. This helps determine whether your cat's weight is due to environmental or medical factors.


Obesity in cats can be the result of environmental factors. Your vet will want to know how often you feed your cat as overfeeding can lead to weight gain. If your cat hides a lot due to fear of children or other pets, he may not be getting enough exercise. Your cat also may be bored and not have enough toys or entertainment. You might have to adjust your home environment to help your cat lose weight.However, environment is not always the cause. Some medications, diseases, and medical conditions can cause your cat to gain weight. If your cat has any other troublesome symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, let your vet know. He or she may want to conduct certain tests or lab work on your cat to rule out an underlying medical problem., If your cat's weight gain is environmental, talk to your vet about how you feed your cat. He or she can suggest changes you can make to get your cat to a healthier weight. It's important you talk over major changes to your cat's diet with your vet beforehand.

, If your cat is overweight, you'll need to change how you feed him. Changing a cat's feeding schedule can make a huge difference in regards to his weight.


Always make transitions gradual. If you suddenly swap out a cat's old food for a new diet brand, he may act out or refuse to eat. Keep your cat on his regular food but offer him a little bit of the new food you're trying each day.Cats will work for food. You can use a foraging device, which is a puzzle-like device a cat must dismantle to get food trapped inside. This encourages exercise which is also important to help a cat lose weight.In nature, cats are pure carnivores. A lot of dry foods are primarily wheat-based and can lead to weight gain if used as a primary food source. Talk to your vet about switching your cat over to canned food., Many cats do not get enough exercise. If your cat is an indoor cat, it's especially important he gets moving each day. Buy your cat a variety of toys and take 20 to 30 minutes each night to play with him. Consider getting electronic, interactive toys a cat can use while you're away at work., Treats are also a major culprit when it come to cat weight gain. Try swapping out normal treats for low-calorie diet treats. Your cat won't have to give up a luxury and will still be able to lose some weight., Keep an eye on your cat's weight to make sure he's losing weight as needed. You can weigh your cat at home, using your own scale. This may not be as accurate as a vet's scale, however. Some veterinary clinics allow you to do free weigh-ins if your cat needs to lose weight. Ask your vet is you can periodically bring your cat in to check his weight.

Let your cat outside.",How to Keep a Cat from Becoming Fat and Lazy," Avoid drastic measures that could cause rapid weight loss in your cat. This could lead to a serious liver condition called hepatic lipidosis, where excess fat that is broken down accumulates in the liver. This makes your cat feel ill and decreases his appetite, setting up a vicious cycle of more body fat breakdown and fat accumulating in the liver.


If you suspect your cat has hepatic lipidosis, get your cat prompt medical treatment at a veterinary hospital. It's a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.;
, Overweight cats are more likely to develop diabetes, where the body doesn't create or manage insulin and blood sugar levels properly. If a cat develops diabetes, it may be manageable through gradual weight loss and a high-protein diet alone, while other cats will need daily insulin injections by their owners for the rest of their life.Obese cats are also at risk to develop painful osteoarthritis due to years of excess weight stressing the bones and joints.In addition, they are at risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease, and some forms of cancer.


Obese and overweight cats have a tendency to be less energetic, sleep more, and have fewer interactions with their families. This is how they get the reputation of being fat and lazy.

, The vet will do a thorough examination to make sure there are no underlying health issues. The vet can then guide you on to the type and amount of food you should feed your cat. You'll also be told how much weight your cat should lose each month and how much weight he should lose overall. Your vet will probably recommend that your cat lose a quarter pound a week or one pound a month, depending on your cat's frame, size, breed, and sex.You may want to get a measuring cup with 1/8th measure increments. This will help measure the appropriate amount of food for your cat.

, Look for commercial cat foods that are high in fiber and can be fed ""as-is"" or mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of a powdered fiber supplement into wet food. You can also feed 1 to 2 tablespoons of canned plain pumpkin to add fiber to a regular diet. If you add powdered fiber or pumpkin instead of the commercial high-fiber food, cut back on the amount of cat food by 1 to 2 tablespoons at the same time.If you're having trouble getting your cat to eat the less flavorful high-fiber food, add a little water that's been drained off of a can of tuna. This can entice your cat to eat it.
Fiber is an important form of carbohydrate that will take a while for your cat to digest, making him feel fuller without contributing too many calories. High-fiber foods will give important nutrients and keep your cat from eating too many calories.

, Look for a commercially prepared high-protein food or have a trained pet nutritionist create a homemade diet for your cat. This is important because cats need the amino acid taurine in their diets or they'll develop heart and vision problems. While high-protein foods are generally tastier for cats, they might not be as filling or satisfying to a cat used to eating more food.Note that a cat with kidney disease should not be placed on a high protein diet since it will further damage the kidneys.
If you do chose to gradually switch cat food, do so over a period of one to two weeks. The first two days mix ¼ new food with ¾ old food. The next four days mix ½ new food with ½ old food. The next 2 to 4 days mix ¾ new food with ¼ old food. If the cat leaves the old food in the dish, make a more gradual transition to the new food. If he absolutely refuses the new food consult your veterinarian for advice., You might try keeping your cat's regular food, just offering a smaller portion. Use the measuring cup to measure out the recommended amount on the cat food label and feed that amount. If it's more than what your cat normally eats, cut down accordingly, since some manufacturers are fairly generous in their serving sizes. A good rule of thumb is to decrease the amount of food fed by 10%.It is important to understand that if your cat was used to having food available to eat at all times, you will need to begin feeding your cat two or three times a day. Since your cat has been overeating, you need to control feeding times.

, Before starting your cat on a diet, write down your cat's weight on a calendar or notebook. Weigh your cat every week while he's dieting.It's easy to do this by holding your cat in your arms, stepping on a bathroom scale and then weighing yourself after you place the cat down. Subtract this number from your first number to give you your cat’s weight.


Remember the goal is for your cat to lose no more than ¼ pound a week or 1 pound a month.
If you find after two weeks that no weight has been lost, cut down portion sizes by 10%. If your cat still hasn't lost weight after 2 more weeks, talk again with your veterinarian.

, You might try tossing a ball or crumpled up piece of paper across the room for him to chase. Or, buy a few fuzzy toys for him to bat around, buy a feather toy on a wand to wave for your cat to jump at, or use a laser cat toy for a fun game of catch the dot. Playing with your cat will keep his mind off food and help him become more active.


Try to play with your cat for 10 to 15 minutes a day. This will give him much needed exercise. , Buy a couple of food puzzle toys. Fill the toys with your cat's food so he can work at it to get the food. This will occupy his attention for quite a while as he bats the toy around and chases it to get to the food.


Puzzle feeders offer environmental enrichment to indoor cats that don't have the opportunity to chase and hunt for food., Cats can use scratching posts to let off extra energy, mark their territory, and shed the outer layers of their nails.A scratching post or climbing tower can give your cat some much needed exercise.


Giving your cat the chance to play will make him happier and less likely to trouble you with bad behavior., Sprinkle catnip on new toys to get your cat's interest. You may find that your cat is instantly motivated and playful, which will increase his activity levels.Take care not to use catnip constantly, or your cat may become desensitized to its effects.


Some cats aren't interested or sensitive to catnip, so you may just need to offer a variety of toys instead.

, Take a few toys outside and try to engage your cat while playing in the yard. You may find that your cat is interested in exploring his surroundings. Or, if your cat is up to it, you may put him on a leash and take him for a walk around the neighborhood. Make sure the harness fits comfortably and he can't slip out of it.If you're cat is only an inside cat, consider letting him use an outdoor enclosure.This will let him experience the outdoors in a contained space.

Get rid of a snake’s food source.",How to Treat a Cat for Snakebite," Most snakebites occur on either the muzzle or leg of a cat.If a venomous snake has bitten your cat, her skin may have one fang mark or several fang marks at the bite site.Unfortunately, these puncture marks may be obscured by your cat’s hair.Also, because snakebites can be extremely painful, your cat may be in too much pain or too agitated to allow you to look for the bite.


A bite by a venomous snake will also cause the skin to swell and become red. Because snake venom can negatively affect the blood’s ability to clot, there will likely be bleeding at the bite site as well.The closer a venomous snakebite is to the heart, the more quickly the venom will be absorbed into the body and spread through the lymphatic and circulatory systems.If your cat has been bitten by a nonvenomous snake, you will see teeth marks, but not fang marks, at the bite site. Also, there will probably little to no swelling, redness, or bleeding at the site where the snake bit your cat.;
, After a venomous snakebite, your cat will become lethargic and may start vomiting. She will probably start to become very weak and collapse. In addition, her muscles may begin to twitch and her pupils will start to dilate. As more time passes after the snakebite, she could exhibit even more serious signs, such as seizures, paralysis, and shock.Signs of shock include rapid shallow breathing, hypothermia, and a rapid heart rate.Because of the amount of pain she is in, she may also be more vocal.
Do not wait to see if your cat shows symptoms of a snakebite. If you saw the snake bite your cat, or if you see the bite wound, take your cat to the veterinarian immediately.
The onset of clinical signs after a snakebite is usually rapid—within a few minutes to an hour of being bitten. If your cat shows no clinical signs after 60 minutes, then the snake's venom likely did not enter her system.Your cat may not exhibit these clinical signs if she has been bitten by a nonvenomous snake. However, you should still take her to your veterinarian for treatment and monitoring.

, In order to give the appropriate antivenin, it would be helpful for your veterinarian to know the species of the attacking snake. In the US, the most common venomous snakes are rattlesnakes, water moccasins, copperheads, and coral snakes.If you witnessed the attack, stay calm and take note of the color, length, and pattern of the snake. For your safety, do not approach the snake to get a closer look.
Do not try to kill the snake. You will put yourself in more danger of being bitten by approaching the snake and trying to kill it.Venomous snakes have slit-like pupils (similar to a cat), whereas non-venomous snakes have round pupils (like people).There are exceptions, however. For instance, the venomous coral snake has round pupils.
If you are not able to identify the snake or do not know if it is venomous, assume that it is venomous.The negative effects on the cardiovascular system can cause your cat to go into shock.

, For a snakebite from a venomous snake, keeping your cat calm and quiet is the best first aid that you can administer to your cat before she receives veterinary care. The more agitated and active she is, the more quickly the venom could spread through her body and make her even sicker.It is actually recommended that keeping your cat calm and quiet is the only first aid that you should administer on your own.Do not allow your cat to walk or run around as this will increase her heart rate and stimulate more blood circulation.
Keep in mind that your cat may snap at you or try to bite you because of the amount of pain that she’s in., Gentle pressure will help control the bleeding from the bite wound. An example of first aid that you should not administer is cutting the wound open to suck out the venom or drain the wound.Not only is this ineffective, you would cause more pain and suffering for your cat. In addition, the venom could be venomous to you.Do not apply a tourniquet or compression bandage in the area near the bite wound.Do not apply ice to the bite wound.The ice does not slow the spread of the venom and can actually damage the skin.Do not wash the wound if the bite was from a venomous snake. Washing the wound could increase the absorption of the venom., The action most likely to save your cat's life is getting her to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If possible, transport your cat in her carrier or a large box in which she can comfortably lie down.To help keep her calm and still during the drive to the veterinarian, loosely wrap your cat in a large towel or sheet.


The effects of snake venom are usually irreversible and often begin immediately after the snakebite.To increase the chances of your cat’s survival and treat the effects of the snake venom, your cat will need immediate veterinary treatment.

, Your veterinarian may have a snakebite detection kit, which would allow him or her to identify what type of snake bit your cat.However, in the event that your veterinarian does not have the kit, you will need to provide as much information as you can about the snake bite, such as a description of the snake, how much time has passed since the snakebite, and what clinical signs your cat started to show after being bitten.

, Although clinical signs and the appearance of the snakebite may seem like enough to start treatment, your veterinarian will want to run diagnostic tests to fully assess the severity of the snakebite. For example, your veterinarian will run blood tests to see how well (or poorly) your cat’s blood is clotting. He or she may also take a urine sample (snakebites can lead to blood being in the urine).Depending on how well-equipped the veterinary clinic is, your veterinarian may want to perform an electrocardiogram to assess your cat’s heart beat., Because of how quickly snake venom can spread and cause damage in your cat’s body, your veterinarian may want to begin some forms of treatment immediately to stabilize your cat. Do not be surprised if your veterinarian needs to start treatment to stabilize your cat before he or she gets a more detailed history from you. One form of immediate treatment is intravenous fluids, which will bring your cat’s blood pressure back up (very important if your cat has gone into shock).Antivenin works by neutralizing the snake’s venom and is most effective when administered within the first six hours of a snakebite.It can help to prevent bleeding disorders and reduce the amount of swelling at the bite wound.Keep in mind that antivenin is not a vaccination and will not protect your cat from future snakebites.Your veterinarian will likely administer a steroid, which will minimize further tissue damage, control shock, and prevent a possible allergic reaction from antivenin administration. Steroids are usually given only in the first 24 hours after a snakebite.Your cat may also need oxygen supplementation and additional breathing support, depending on her level of respiratory distress when you get her to your veterinarian.If your cat is suffering from serious blood circulation problems (little to no clotting, low blood cell counts), she will need to be treated with blood replacement products and other appropriate treatments.Antibiotics are usually not necessary, since wounds from snakebites rarely become infected., The prognosis for your cat varies depending on how much venom was injected, the species of snake, and how time has passed since the snakebite happened. Fortunately, nearly 80% of pets will survive snakebites if they receive immediate veterinary treatment.Provided that your cat has a good prognosis, she will likely recover in 24 to 48 hours. This recovery may take longer (at least several days) depending on the extent of tissue damage.Your veterinarian may recommend that your cat stay at the hospital overnight for an observation. She would need stay overnight if she needs continued intensive treatment. Once your veterinarian is confident that your cat has recovered well from the snakebite, he or she will send her home with you., When your cat is well enough to come home, you will need to be responsible for her at-home care. Your veterinarian will probably prescribe a pain medication to control the pain from the snakebite. Your cat may need additional medications, depending on her clinical signs and results of the diagnostic tests., Snakes use their venom most frequently to catch their prey. Keep in mind, however, that a snake would much rather flee than fight/bite if it encounters a human or a pet. If your cat has been bitten by a snake, the snake likely bit her in self-defense rather than as a predatory attack.Snakes have control over whether they inject venom with their bite. If they do not inject venom, the bite is known as a ‘dry bite.’They may not inject venom if they have recently made a kill and used up their venom.
Snakes can also control how much venom they inject when biting. For example, a smaller snake who fears for its life may inject more venom than a larger snake whose life is not in danger.Snake venom spreads rapidly via the lymphatic system and circulatory systems in the body and can eventually have a profound effect on all body systems. Typically, the venom targets the nervous and circulatory systems., Snakes like to hide in long grass, overgrown foliage, and under piles of wood.They also like to hide under rocks and logs.If your cat is indoor/outdoor or exclusively outdoor, clearing away any potential snake hiding spots will lessen the chance that your cat will come into contact with a snake.


You can also keep your cat inside., You can spray snake repellant in your yard to keep snakes away.Visit your local pet store for recommendations on which snake repellant to purchase. You could also purchase snake repellant online.

, Rodents are a food source for snakes. Snakes may be attracted to your home if you have a rodent problem.You can place rodent traps in and around your home. Alternatively, you could hire a pest control service to clear the rodents from your home.

Talk to your vet.,
Give the cat a balanced diet.,
Encourage your cat to exercise frequently.",How to Get Rid of a Fat Pouch on a Cat," It is important to have your cat assessed before deciding on a diet and exercise regime for the cat. It is quite possible that your cat has a natural pouch that is simply part of its genetic makeup. It may also be possible that the cat has a medical condition or disease and this is something that only a qualified vet can determine.
, This means ensuring that the cat is fed appropriate food that meets its nutritional requirements at set mealtimes. Keep the quantities small, in alignment with the weight that the cat ought to be and taking into account its age, health and gender. Your vet can advise you more about this aspect, along with how many meals a day would be appropriate in the case of your cat.

Do not free feed the cat. The cat will keep on eating until the food is gone, it doesn't care about its ""fat pouch""; if the food is there, the cat will eat it.

, This means playing with your cat regularly, using cat toys that cause the cat to move around a lot and chase, jump and run after. Moving toys are great because they can be chased by the cat in its own time, while a laser pointer is great fun for both you and the cat, as the cat chases it around and pounces on it.

If possible, take your cat on daily walks using a cat harness and leash. This can be done in the safety of your own yard or anywhere else that you consider to be safe for the cat. Realize that not all cats will permit this. You can try to shine a laser pointer ahead to encourage the cat to move towards it.

Talk to everyone involved in the cat's life.",How to Treat Obesity in Cats," Before starting your cat on a diet, it's important to talk to your vet. A vet can help you determine the best, safest diet for your cat, including what's a good weight for your cat.Ask your vet about the best food for your cat. Your vet may recommend putting your cat on a diet food to help it lose weight. The bonus of a diet food is your cat can likely have the same amount of food it's been getting but at a reduced caloric intake.See your vet if your cat stops eating when you adjust its diet. A cat not eating can lead to a serious disease known as fatty liver disease.;
, To put your cat on a diet, you need to know how much it is eating. To be sure, you can't free feed your cat, meaning you never leave the bowl empty. You also can't have auto-feeders.Instead, you need to measure out how much food it is getting each day. If your cat isn't adjusting well to being off of free feeding, try breaking up its food into several small meals throughout the day., A cat generally needs about 20 calories for every pound that it weighs to maintain its weight. So if your cat is 8 pounds, it needs 160 calories to maintain its weight., Once you've determined how much your cat needs to maintain its weight, you need to lower that amount so the cat can lose weight. Reduce the maintenance amount by 40 calories to help it steadily lose weight.Read the food package to see how many calories are in your cat's food. Don't forget to take treats into account if you feed those to your cat.

, As your cat loses weight, you'll need to lower its intake to adjust for that lost weight. Also, if your cat's activity level changes (decreases), you may need to decrease its intake as well. Always talk to your vet about decreases, as you want to provide your cat with enough food., If you feel the need to give your cat treats, stick to ones that are lower in calories. You can find diet treats on the market, and some will even clean your cat's teeth, which is helpful.You can also try a few human treats, such as cooked green beans, broccoli, or air-popped popcorn (no salt or butter).
Another option is baking thin pieces of canned diet food until they are crunchy. Bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Refrigerate the pieces when the food is done. Frozen pieces of canned food will also appeal to some cats.

, If your cat tends to gobble its food, you can slow down eating by using puzzles to make it actively hunt for its food. It will keep your cat entertained, and it will also increase its activity as it tries to get the food out.You can make a simple food puzzle at home by cutting holes in a plastic bottle that are large enough for dry food to fall out. Put the food inside, and close the lid. The cat will need to move the bottle around and make the food fall out.

, If you have more than one level in your house, forcing your cat to climb the stairs can increase its activity. One way you can do that is to put the things it needs on different levels, such as the bathroom on one floor and the food on another., If your cat isn't used to being active, you may need to lend a hand. Get out a lure toy, for instance, and encourage your cat to play with it. Most cats will find playing with their owners much more interesting than playing a game on their own.Try to get in at least 20 minutes of play each day, though it doesn't all need to be at once.

, Cats get bored with their toys, just like humans and other animals. To keep them interested and active, switch out their toys from time to time so they always have something new to play with.You can try ball toys, jingle toys, and feather toys. Keep in mind that any toys with strings should always be used under supervision, as strings can be very dangerous to a cat if swallowed.

, While walking a cat may seem a bit out of the ordinary, it can be a way to get a cat more active. First, you'll need to get a leash and a harness, so that cat can't wiggle out while you're outside.Start out by getting your cat accustomed to the harness around the house. Once your cat seems okay with wearing the harness, you can try taking it outside on a leash. Don't try walking yet. Just take it out into the yard, and let it explore while leashed, always under your supervision.
After a while, you can start taking walks, if your cat seems comfortable outside. Of course, a walk with a cat will never be quite the same as a walk with a dog, but you can take short excursions where your cat has a chance to explore places in the neighborhood.

, It's always tempting to give into pets when they beg for table scraps. However, what seems like an insignificant amount to you can actually be a significant amount of a cat's daily intake. For instance, the average bite you take is 25 calories. If you consider that a 5 pound cat only needs 100 calories a day to maintain its weight, 25 calories is a quarter of its daily intake.To discourage begging, try distracting your cat with a game or with some cuddles. You could also take the cat out of the room, or you could give the cat part of its food at the same time. A puzzle ball may also help.

, If you have more than one pet in your household, you may need to monitor food intake more closely, as your obese cat could be stealing from other animals in the household. Feeding animals separately can help solve the problem. You can either feed at separate times, or you can try feeding in separate rooms.You can also try feeding more agile cats up higher (such as on a washing machine) and the obese cat down lower., If you put the cat on a diet but someone else is feeding it extra treats, it's not going to lose weight. Talk to everyone in your household about what the plan is so that everyone is on board. The same holds true if your cat is an indoor/outdoor cat. Talk to your neighbors about not feeding the cat extra treats."

For example, if she has fractured a leg bone, she may hold the injured leg up in the air and hop around on the other legs. Or, if she can put weight on the injured leg, she may walk with a limp. If your cat has fractures in multiple legs, she would likely be unable to walk at all.A pelvic fracture would make it very difficult for your cat to walk.
If your cat has a spinal cord fracture, she may be unable to walk due to paralysis.With an injured tail, your cat may drag her tail when she walks or lack coordination in her back legs.If your cat has a jaw fracture, she may not be able to chew or keep food in her mouth. Not being able to eat could be just as serious as not being able to walk.;
, Fractures are painful. As sweet as your cat may be under normal circumstances, the pain from her fracture may cause her to lash out at you. In addition, she may be frightened.To get close enough to your cat to examine the fracture, approach her calmly.Examine the area for swelling and bleeding.Your cat may be very vocal due to the pain. Don’t be surprised if she howls, moans, or cries, especially if you try to touch her.Several classifications exist for fractures, including hairline (bone is not completely broken), closed (bone doesn’t penetrate the skin), and compound (bone penetrates the skin).Don’t worry if you can’t determine what kind of fracture your cat has—your vet will do that.

, When your cat has a fracture, she will need immediate treatment by your vet. If you cannot get her to your vet right away, you can perform a few first aid measures at home to stabilize her. If the fractured area is bleeding, or if the fractured bone is sticking out from the skin, place a clean towel or sterile gauze over the area.Sterile gauze is available at your local drug store.
If there is bleeding, you do not have to stop it completely.

Do not try to move the fractured bone. Doing so could make your cat’s injury worse.If you are unsure what you can do for your cat, call your vet first. Do not give your cat any pain medications unless your vet has advised you to do so., Keeping your cat as still as possible, wrap her in a thick towel and transport her to your vet.Your vet will perform a physical exam and examine the fracture. X-rays will help your vet determine the fracture’s type and severity.Provide your vet with a detailed description of your cat’s injury, including how and when it happened and any first aid you performed.
The fracture may not be your cat’s only injury—she may have internal injuries (e.g., internal bleeding, organ damage) and/or other external injuries (e.g., cuts, bruises).Your vet would use the physical exam and imaging tests (x-ray, ultrasound) to identify other injures.
Depending on the extent of your cat’s injuries, your vet may assess these other injuries before examining the fractured area.

, If your cat’s life is in danger from her injuries, your vet will perform aggressive and immediate treatment to stabilize her before tending to the fracture.Emergency treatments include intravenous fluids, ventilation, and pain relief.Once your cat is more stable, your vet will devise a treatment plan for the fracture.

, Various surgical and non-surgical treatments are available to treat cat fractures. Non-surgical options like splints, casts, or cage rest may work for some fractures; other fractures may need surgical placement of implants (e.g., screws, pins).The type of treatment your cat needs will depend on several factors, including her age, overall health, and the nature of the fracture (which bones are broken, the type of fracture).Be proactive in asking questions about treatment options and deciding on the best treatment plan for your cat. Being actively involved in the decision-making process may help improve your cat’s treatment outcome., When you and your vet have decided on a treatment plan, allow your vet to do what is necessary to treat the fracture. In many cases of fracture, surgery is the best treatment option.If the fracture is complex, your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon.If your cat needs to be hospitalized for fracture repair, ask your vet about visiting your cat. Spending time with her and talking to her can help reduce her anxiety and stress about being hospitalized.Some fractures are so severe that they are beyond repair. If your cat’s fracture is this severe, your vet may suggest amputation, especially if the tail is fractured., Fractures heal best when the affected bone is kept still and undisturbed.Following veterinary treatment, you will need to keep your cat relatively still at home—no running or jumping. If she usually roams freely throughout your home, consider restricting her to a smaller area when you cannot supervise her.If possible, put your cat in a room that does not have any furniture or counters on which she could jump.If this is not possible, consider using a tall plastic gate to confine her within a larger room.
If she has a jaw fracture, you may need to feed her by hand and give her soft foods so she does not have to use her jaw too much.
There is no set amount of time for restricting your cat’s activity. Your vet can advise you on when your cat can get back to her normal activity level.

, Even if she tries to hide it, your cat will likely be in a lot of pain. Your vet will prescribe a pain medication for your cat. If the fractured bone penetrated the skin, then the injured area may have gotten infected. In that case, your vet would also prescribe an antibiotic.Follow all prescription instructions carefully. If you are unsure how to give your cat the medications, ask your vet to demonstrate how to do so.

, If your vet has bandaged the fractured area, you may need to replace the bandages when they become wet or dirty. Urine is a common reason for bandages to become wet.Your vet can show you the proper way to remove the old bandages, clean the affected area (if necessary), and put on new bandages.


When bandaging, it is important not to wrap the bandages too tightly—this would cut off circulation to the affected area and delay healing. It would also be very uncomfortable for your cat.
Bandaging material is available at your local drug store. Your vet can recommend which materials to purchase.
If you are uncomfortable with changing your cat’s bandages, have your vet do this for you.

, Following fracture treatment, a follow-up appointment will be necessary for your vet to assess your cat’s improvement. For example, your vet may want to take x-rays to see how well the bone has healed. Bones usually take between 4 and 6 weeks to heal completely, so your follow-up appointment will probably be about a month after initial treatment.If you notice any redness, swelling, or discharge from the affected area, take your cat to your vet before the follow-up visit.The affected area may be infected and need additional treatment.

Feel for your cat’s ribs.,
Look for a tucked up abdomen.,
Observe your cat's waistline.",How to Assess Your Cat's Weight1," Have your cat in a standing position and kneel behind it. Place your thumbs on its backbone and spread your hands down over its ribcage. Then feel for your cat’s ribs.You should be able to feel your cats ribs, but they should not be visible with your naked eye. If your cat’s ribs, spine, and pelvic bone are visible, then your cat may be underweight.
If a thin or thick layer of fat is preventing your from feeling your cat’s ribs, then it may be overweight or obese.;
, Do this by viewing your cat from the side, i.e., its profile. Get on your hands and knees to view its profile from an even level. Your cat’s abdomen should tuck up in front of its hind legs. Its underbelly, i.e., flank fold, should also be present.If your cat’s abdomen tucks up sharply and an underbelly is not present, then it may be underweight.
If your cat’s abdomen only tucks up slightly (or not at all) and its underbelly wobbles or sways when your cat walks, then it may be overweight.

, Do this by viewing your cat from above while it is in a standing position. Try to observe a visible waistline in the space between its ribcage and hindquarters. Look for a slight narrowing in this area.If your cat’s waist dramatically narrows behind its ribcage, then your cat may be underweight.
If your cat has little or no waistline and its back broadens, giving it a rounded shape, then it may be overweight.

Place your cat in its carrier.,
Weigh the carrier.,
Place the carrier on the scale.",How to Assess Your Cat's Weight2," Position the carrier on its end with the entrance facing the ceiling. Then pick up your cat by placing one hand under its front legs and one hand under its bottom. Starting with your cat's backend, lower it into the carrier. Close the door and place the carrier in its correct position.If your cat becomes anxious at the sight of its carrier, then try holding your cat instead of placing it in a carrier.

, Do this by placing the carrier with your cat in it on the scale. Then record the weight and take your cat out of the carrier.If you are holding your cat, then stand on the scale and record the weight.

, Record the weight of the carrier without your cat in it. Then subtract the weight of the carrier from the weight of the carrier with your cat in it. The resulting number is your cat’s weight.For example, if the carrier plus your cat weighs 22 pounds and the carrier weighs 5 pounds, then subtract 5 from 22 to get a total of 17 pounds.
If you held your cat while standing on the scale, then weigh yourself and subtract your weight from the total (your weight plus the cat’s weight) to get your cat’s weight.

Compare your cat's actual weight to its ideal weight.,
Take a trip to the vet.,
Check your cat’s weight periodically.",How to Assess Your Cat's Weight3," Do this to see if your cat is underweight, overweight, or at a normal weight. Ideally, a domestic cat weighs 8 to 10 pounds (3.6 to 4.5 kg). However, a cat’s ideal weight depends on its breed and body type. Therefore, you may need to consult your vet to see how your cat's weight compares to the ideal weight for its breed and body type.For example, 10 to 25 pounds (4.5 to 11.3 kg) is the ideal weight for Maine Coon cats, 7 to 12 pounds (3.2 to 5.4 kg) is ideal for Persian cats, and 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) is ideal for Siamese cats.

, Do this if your scale at home cannot register your cat’s weight, or if you are still unsure after assessing its weight visually and manually. Your veterinarian will use a body condition scale to accurately assess your cat’s weight.Make sure to consult your vet before implementing any kind of diet plan.

, Do this to monitor your cat’s health. Rapid weight gain or loss may be a sign of disease or illness. Take your cat to the vet immediately if you notice any sudden changes in weight."

The best way is to have someone help you. Contain the cat by wrapping it securely in a towel or blanket. Hug it so it has trouble moving, and then examine the paw. Leave its head out so it has space to breathe.You may think your cat would never bite you, but animals who wouldn't normally bite may lash out when in pain.;
, If the nail is bleeding, you need to stop the bleeding. You can simply hold a clean cloth on the nail for about 5 minutes until the bleeding stops., If the cut won't stop bleeding, you can use a styptic pencil instead. Rub it across the cut to help stop the bleeding. You can also use styptic powder or cauterizing powder.If you can't don't have those options available to you, try using cornstarch or flour pressed gently into the end of the nail. You can also try a bar of soap pressed into it., The claw may be doing more than bleeding. It may also have discharge, such as pus. If it does, it most likely has an infection, and it will definitely need to be treated by a vet.Also check for swelling and redness, which indicate infection as well.
If you suspect an infection at all, take the cat to the vet. The claw is connected to the bone, and infection in the claw could spread to the bone., If the claw isn't infected, you may be able to trim it at home. If you examine the claw, you may notice part of it that you can trim away easily. You can try to treat it, but you may still need to take the cat to the vet., Once the claw stops bleeding, you may need to apply a bandage. The best way to bandage it is to apply a sterile gauze pad to the claw. You can wrap a layer of cotton gauze around next for padding. For the final layer, use a layer of elastic bandages that stick to themselves. Wrap it around the paw., A broken claw may not need treatment by a vet, particularly if it stops bleeding. However, sometimes this condition continues to be painful, and you'll need to see the vet. Make a call first to see what the vet recommends., While your cat won't need to be knocked out completely, the vet may use light sedation to make it easier to work on the cat. Then, the vet will trim the nail with a professional trimmer.The vet may also need to drain pus if the infection is bad.

, When the vet is done trimming back the nail, they'll apply a bandage. Pay attention to how the vet bandages the nail, so you can apply it properly at home. The vet will likely use an antibiotic ointment on the nail to help prevent infection., Your vet will likely prescribe an antibiotic for prevention or treatment of infection. If the cat is in pain, the vet will also prescribe a pain medication., You'll need to change the bandages for several days to help keep it clean. The vet should show you how to do it. You should also look to make sure an infection isn't developing., Because of the possibility of infection, you may need to visit the vet again. You certainly should if you notice infection, but the vet will likely want you to come back in a couple of days anyway, just in case."

Difficulty in breathing
Blue tongue and gums
Panting
Vomiting and/or diarrhea
Gastric irritation
Coughing and sneezing
Depression
Salivation
Seizures, tremors or involuntary muscle twitching
Weakness and potentially unconsciousness
Dilated pupils
Frequent urination
Dark urine
Shivering;
, When poisoning is suspected and your cat is lying down, unconscious or weak, immediately remove your cat from the area, and transfer it to a well-ventilated and well-lit place.


Wear long sleeves and/or gloves to protect yourself from the poison. Sick and wounded cats are likely to bite and scratch because they are upset and afraid.
When a cat feels unwell, or is anxious, her first instinct is to hide. If the cat has been poisoned you will need to monitor her symptoms and so it is not appropriate to let her hole up somewhere. In a gentle but firm manner, pick the cat up and take her to a safe room. The kitchen or bathroom is ideal, since you will need access to water.
If the poison is within the area, cautiously remove it away from reach of any pets or humans., An experienced vet or helpline can help you calm down and will be able to give you clear instructions on what to do or what antidote to give to your poisoned cat. Always remember that the chances of your cat surviving will be higher if you immediately call the vet. This should be the very first thing to do after stabilizing your cat.You can also call the Pet Poison Helpline (800-213-6680) or the ASPCA Poison Control Center (1-888-426-4435).
Pet poison hotlines are not funded by the government like human poison hotlines are, so they usually charge a fee to help pay for the service.

, This will help you decide on whether it is correct or inappropriate to make the cat vomit. If you have access to the packaging make a note of the following information: trade name, active ingredient(s), and strength. In addition, try to estimate how much the cat has consumed. (Was it a new box? How much is missing?)Your first contacts should be your vet, the pet poison hotline, and the product manufacturer.
If you have access to the internet, search the active ingredient. It is helpful to phrase the search like this: Is toxic to cats?
Some products may be safe when ingested and if you find that out, you need go no further. If the substance is poisonous, the next step is to decide whether to make the cat vomit or not.

, Do not give your kitty any food, water, milk, salt, oil or any other home remedy unless you know what poison the cat ingested and the specific medication or first aid. Giving any of these without any consultation or instruction from a veterinarian or a Pet Poison Helpline may worsen the condition of your cat.The vet or the helpline will have more knowledge and skill in determining what to do or what to give your poisoned cat.

, Do not make your cat do anything without instruction from a vet or a pet poison helpline. Some poisons (particularly corrosive acids) can do more harm if vomiting is induced. Only induce emesis (sickness) if:


The poison was eaten within the past two hours. If it was eaten more than two hours ago, it has already been absorbed, so vomiting is useless.
The cat is conscious and able to swallow. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious, semi-conscious, or seizing/mentally altered cat.
The poison is NOT an acid, strong alkali or petroleum product.
You're 100% certain you know the poison was ingested.

, Acids, alkalis and petroleum products cause caustic burns. Irrespective of when they were consumed, do not induce vomiting because they will likely damage the gullet, throat and mouth on the way back up.Strong acids and alkalis are found in household rust removers, glass etching fluids, and cleaning products such as bleach. Petroleum products include lighter fluid, gasoline and kerosene.
As previously mentioned you should not make the cat vomit, instead encourage her to drink full-fat milk, or eat a raw egg.If she will not drink freely, then use the child’s dosing syringe to drip feed up to 100 ml of milk into her mouth. This will help dilute the acid or alkali, and neutralize it. A raw egg has a similar action.

, You will need a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide (do NOT use the more concentrated hydrogen peroxide supplied with some hair perms or dyes) and a teaspoon or child’s dosing syringe.You will find it easier to syringe peroxide, rather than spoon it into her mouth. Here's what you should know:


The dose of 3% hydrogen peroxide is 5 ml (one teaspoon) per 5 lb body weight, by mouth. An average cat weighs around 10 lb, so you will need about 10 ml (two teaspoons worth.) Repeat this every ten minutes, for a maximum of three doses.To dose the cat, hold her securely and gently insert the syringe into the cat’s mouth, behind the upper fangs. Depress the plunger, dribbling about of ml at a time onto the cat’s tongue. Give her time to swallow each time and never shoot the full amount in quickly since you may flood her mouth and then she will inhale the peroxide into her lungs.

, After vomiting, your aim is now to reduce the absorption of poison that has passed further down into the intestine. For this you need activated charcoal. The dose is 1 gram of dry powder for every 1 lb body weight of the cat. An average sized cat will require around 10 grams.Dissolve the powder in the smallest volume of water possible, to form a thick slurry, and syringe it into the cat’s mouth. Repeat this dose every 2 to 3 hours, for 4 doses.

, If there is poison on her coat, when the cat grooms herself she will swallow it and risk further toxicity. If the contaminant is a powder, brush it off. If it is sticky, such as tar or oil, you may need to use a specialist hand-cleansing product such as Swarfega Hand Cleaner (as used by motor mechanics) worked into the fur. Bathe the cat in lukewarm water for 10 minutes to remove all residue, and then rinse well with water.


As a last resort, you may wish to cut off the worst affected hair with scissors or clippers. Better safe than sorry!

, Many poisons are harmful to liver, kidneys, or both. To reduce the risk of organ damage from poison already absorbed, ensure the cat drinks freely. If she will not drink spontaneously, then syringe water into her mouth. Slowly dribble it in one ml at a time and be sure to let her swallow.


An average cat requires 250 ml of water a day, so don’t be afraid to refill that dosing syringe lots of times!

, Include all labels, packaging and bottles, so that all information can be relayed to a veterinarian or a Pet Poison Control Hotline. Your efforts may help future cat owners (and cats!) in similar predicaments.

, Your cat needs to be checked out by a vet to make sure that it's okay. The vet can make sure that you got all of the poison, and that there are no long-term issues to be concerned about."

Take your cat to the vet or animal emergency room immediately if you see any of the following symptoms:Rapid or labored breathing
Facial swelling
Pale gums or mucous membranes
Vomiting (especially within the first 5-10 minutes after the sting) or diarrhea
Weak or rapid heartbeat
Collapse;
, Bee stings are a little different from wasp or hornet stings, and you will need to take a slightly different approach to treatment depending on what kind of insect delivered the sting.If you saw the insect that stung your cat but are not sure how to identify it, you may be able to narrow it down with a visual guide like this one: https://www.southribble.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Bee-wasp-and-hornet-leaflet.pdf


Wasps do not usually leave their stingers behind when they sting, but bees generally do. If your cat was stung by a bee, you will need to find and remove the stinger.Bee venom is acidic, while wasp venom is alkaline. It is better not to try to neutralize the sting with an alkaline substance (like baking soda) or an acid (like vinegar) unless you know for sure what stung your cat., Look for signs of swelling, redness, or tenderness. If your cat has been stung in the mouth or throat, or if you suspect that your cat has been stung multiple times, take your cat to the vet immediately., If the cat was stung by a bee (rather than a wasp), the stinger is likely to be embedded in the cat’s skin. A bee stinger can continue to seep venom into the skin for several minutes after the sting is delivered. Try to remove it as soon as possible.The stinger will look like a small black splinter.
Gently scrape the stinger out with your fingernail, a butter knife, or the edge of a credit card.
Don’t try to remove the stinger with tweezers or pinch it out with your fingers, or you might squeeze more venom into the wound.

, This can help soothe inflammation and reduce swelling. Wrap some ice or an ice pack in a washcloth and hold it on the sting for about five minutes. Take it off for five minutes, and then put it back for another five. Continue to do this for the first hour or so after the sting., Mix three parts baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and one part water. Apply this mixture to the sting once every two hours until the swelling diminishes.Do not treat the sting with baking soda unless you are certain that your cat was stung by a bee (rather than a wasp). For wasp stings, apply apple cider vinegar to the sting instead.
Take care not to get baking soda or vinegar in your cat’s eyes.

, If the swelling from the sting increases or spreads in the hours after the sting, contact your vet. Look out for signs of infection, such as redness, pus, or further swelling around the site of the sting over the next few days., Benadryl (diphenhydramine) can help reduce inflammation, itching, and discomfort. Consult your vet about the appropriate dosage for your cat.Do not give your cat a medication containing any ingredients other than Benadryl (diphenhydramine), as other types of medications intended for humans may be harmful or fatal to cats.

, Be sure that the gel does not contain other ingredients, such as alcohol or lotion. Take care not to get any aloe in your cat’s eyes."

To help your cat reach her ideal body weight, you'll need a plan to put these principles into practice. Your veterinarian can help you develop this plan, but he or she will need to examine your cat first.


Your veterinarian can determine if there are any underlying health conditions that could make it more difficult for your cat to lose weight.Your veterinarian will do a thorough physical examination of your cat and weigh her. He or she will also analyze your cat’s blood and urine.A swinging pouch behind your cat’s hind legs indicates that your cat is overweight.The ideal weight for the average domestic shorthaired cat is 8 to 10 pounds (3.6 to 4.5 kg).;
, Weight loss should happen slowly in cats. Rapid weight loss can cause a serious medical condition called hepatic lipidosis.Your veterinarian will be able to recommend a carefully crafted plan that will help your cat lose about one to two percent of her body weight per week until she reaches her optimal weight.One to two percent weight loss per week is ideal for a cat on a weight loss plan.The plan may involve a 20 to 40% reduction in your cat’s current food intake.Discuss the plan with your veterinarian so you understand exactly what you will need to do at home to help your cat lose weight. The plan will likely involve changes to your cat’s daily feeding and activity routine, so you should make sure you are comfortable with the changes you will need to make.

, Because you look at your cat every day, it may be difficult for you to see any changes in her weight, whether loss or gain.On a daily basis, record her daily food intake and activity.Weigh your cat once a week and record her weight.Weigh your cat on the same day and at the same time of day. This will give you a more accurate assessment of her weight loss. She probably will not simply step onto the scale herself, so you will need to hold her in your arms when you step on the scale. Weigh yourself first, then weigh yourself with your cat.Subtract your original weight from the ‘you + cat’ weight to get the weight of your cat.Take your cat to your veterinarian every two to four weeks for a more thorough examination.Your veterinarian may recommend adjustments to the weight loss plan.

, Rather than leaving food out all day for your cat to eat (which may be more convenient), you should feed her two to four small meals a day.This will make it easy for you to control her portion sizes and monitor how much she eats on any given day.


If you are gone most of the day, consider using a timed feeder that will release a small portion of food at designated times throughout the day.Talk with your veterinarian about what specific times would be best for your cat to eat.
Feeding multiple meals a day will also help you see if your cat is eating at all. Call your veterinarian if your cat does not eat for two or more days—not eating for several days could mean your is cat sick.Visit your local pet store to purchase a timed feeder.
Free-choice feeding is a major contributor to overeating and obesity in cats., Cats are carnivores, which require protein as the key ingredient in their diet.Your cat’s diet should be at least 35 to 45% protein.Unfortunately, many dry cat foods are low in protein.You may have heard that too much protein in your cat’s diet can lead to kidney problems. Provided your cat is healthy, her body will eliminate the excess protein in her urine and use the rest calories or conversion to fat.Previous studies in rodents suggested a concern for kidney disease with excess protein, but research in dogs and cats has alleviated this concern.Read the food labels to determine if the food has the recommended amount of protein. You should also check the protein source—chicken and lamb are good sources of protein. A good quality food will have these meats, or another form of meat, listed as the first ingredient.Be aware that a cat who overeats on a high-protein diet will still gain weight. To be effective, you must control your pet's portion sizes.

, Carbohydrates are not a necessary part of carnivore’s diet. Not only are cats not able to digest carbohydrates as well as dogs and people, but the excess carbohydrates get stored as fat.Dry cat foods are typically high in carbohydrates.


After a carbohydrate-rich meal, your cat’s blood glucose level stays high, which can put her at risk for developing diabetes.Your cat’s diet should be no more than about 25% carbohydrates,but your cat would probably be fine with an even smaller percentage.
Soft, meat-based foods are lower in carbohydrates than dry foods., Your cat probably won’t like it very much, but you will need to cut back on her intake of tasty treats and human food morsels. Cat treats are high in carbohydrates, and are purposely made to be so scrumptious that your cat will want to eat them even when she’s not hungry.If your cat has gotten used to getting treats if she howls enough, you will need to break her of this habit. You should not reward her with treats for vocalizing, especially when she needs to lose weight.Tasty table scraps are often high in fat and sugar,and are also off limits.
If you cannot resist giving her a little extra food, make it healthy. Examples of healthy treats are broccoli, cooked green beans, and air-popped popcorn (unbuttered and unsalted).Be aware that these treat options may not seem particularly delectable to your cat.

, Cutting back on your cat’s food intake means that her diet will have fewer nutrients overall. To compensate, you will need to add various supplements to her diet. For example, your cat will need a vitamin/mineral supplement and a fatty acid supplement.Speak with your veterinarian before adding these supplements to your cat’s diet. Your veterinarian will be able to recommend which supplements to purchase, and how to add them safely to the diet.
The fatty acid supplement is needed to keep your cat’s skin and coat healthy. Her coat may become dry and flaky without it.L-carnitine is another nutrient that you can to your cat’s diet. It helps your cat’s body convert fat to glucose and can aid in weight loss. The recommended amount of L-carnitine is 250 to 500 mg per day. Your veterinarian can recommend how much to give your cat., In addition to eating less, your cat will also need to become more active in order to lose weight. Schedule multiple daily playtimes with your cat to get her up and moving. One of those playtimes should be close to her bedtime to tire her out before going to sleep.Since cats like routine, play with her at the same time each day.

, In the wild, cats use a lot of energy hunting their prey. Indoor cats do not need to hunt for their food, so they are not using much energy during the day.When you are the pet store, look for interactive toys that look like the animals she would hunt in the wild (e.g, mice, birds, lizards).To get your cat to chase the toy, try moving it around on the ground as if it’s trying to get away. You could also hide behind some furniture so your cat could feel like she’s stalking the prey and getting ready to pounce.
Wand toys that look like birds are great toys for cats. When you use it, try to mimic natural bird movements.Keep in mind that cats stalk their prey for only about three to five minutes in the wild before moving on.Switch up the ‘hunting’ games every few minutes to keep your cat interested.
Laser pointers also stimulate your cat’s hunting instincts. Move the laser around and watch your cat run and try to pounce on the light on the floor.Do not point the laser at her eyes.A stick with an attached ball or feather will encourage your cat to leap and catch her ‘prey.’, If your cat is used to walking only a few steps to reach her food and water, move the bowls farther away to increase her physical activity.If you live in a multi-level house, consider moving the bowls to another level to encourage her to walk up and down the stairs.


It may take your cat a few days to adjust to the bowls being in a different location.

, At first, this may not seem like an obvious way to increase your cat’s physical activity. However, another cat could become your cat’s playmate. The other cat should be friendly and playful, thereby encouraging your cat to get up and play.Keep in mind that cats, especially older cats, are very set in their ways and may not take too kindly to having another cat in the house.
Kittens are usually a good choice as playmate,since they have lots of energy and like to play.

, Scratching posts give cats a good way to stretch and exercise their muscles. Posts are either horizontal or vertical and come in a variety of materials, such as sisal.The scratching post should be long or tall enough (about two feet) for your cat to stretch her entire body out when she scratches.If your cat already has a scratching post, entice her to use it more by placing some catnip by it.

, Walking your cat on a leash can be a good way to increase her activity. Plus, she may enjoy getting some fresh air and seeing some new sights. Keep in mind, though, that not all cats will actually walk when they go outside—some may spend more time sniffing things in the environment than walking.For some cats, being walked outside on a leash is mental exercise, not physical exercise."

Keep your own safety in mind as you do this—the dog may end up injuring you, too. If you have a leash (or are near your home where you can run quickly and get one), approach the dog quietly and wrap the leash around his back end.Aim for an area close to his hips.
Thread the free end of the leash through the leash’s handle and pull back forcefully to make the leash taut around the dog’s body.Back the dog away from the cat and tie the leash to the nearest sturdy structure, such as a telephone pole. Be mindful that the dog will still be in ‘fight’ mode.If you are uncomfortable breaking up the fight on your own, find someone nearby who can assist you.
Check the dog’s collar for an ID tag. If you see the owner’s information, contact the owner to come get the dog. If you don’t see identification, call your local animal control.;
, An injured cat is likely to lash out due to intense pain. In addition, she is probably extremely frightened. Approaching her carefully may lessen the likelihood of her biting or scratching you.Keep calm as you approach the cat.The cat is frightened enough from the attack. If you seem anxious or fearful, she may notice those feelings and become even more frightened.
Talking to the cat in a low and soothing voice may help her see you as non-threatening.

, Once you are able to approach the cat and get a general idea of her injuries, call your veterinarian. When you call, provide as many details about the situation,such as the location of the attack, a physical description of the dog, and visible injuries on the cat.


Be aware that the cat may have suffered internal injuries that would not be readily apparent.
Calling the veterinarian will give the veterinary team a good idea of the cat’s injuries, allowing them to prepare for your arrival accordingly.The veterinary team can also give you instruction on giving the cat first aid and transporting her safely to the veterinary hospital., The cat has just been in full-on ‘fight or flight mode.’ With her injuries, she should stay as calm as possible to avoid making her injuries worse. One way to calm her down is to muzzle her. Muzzling a cat can be challenging, though, and you may not have a cat muzzle on hand.You can create a makeshift muzzle by looping a piece of rope or pair of pantyhose around the cat’s head. Closing her mouth with the muzzle will keep her from biting you.Do not attempt to muzzle her if she is having trouble breathing or has injuries to her mouth. The muzzle could increase her suffering rather than calm her down.
If putting a muzzle on the cat is not feasible, drape a towel over her head. This will block her view and awareness of the outside world. Not seeing or hearing disturbing activity could help calm the cat’s nerves and prevent her from reacting aggressively.If the cat does not have bone or spinal injuries, you can wrap her in a towel or a bag. Leave her head exposed and give her room to breathe.A cat with bone or spinal injuries must lie flat on a firm surface, such as a sturdy board. Take care to keep her head and neck still.Wrapping rope or cords around her body and the board will minimize her movement.

, The cat may be in a state of shock after the attack. Keeping her warm is one of the best things you can do to keep her comfortable until you reach the veterinary hospital. Gently wrap the cat in some towels or a thick blanket. , If the cat is having trouble breathing, you will probably need to perform mouth-to-nose resuscitation before transporting her to the veterinary hospital. Attempt this only if the cat is not lashing out at you. To begin, gently pull her tongue out of her mouth and position her head and neck so they are in a straight line.Reach in her mouth and clear out any debris or saliva that may obstruct airflow to her lungs.Put your hand over the cat’s muzzle, close her mouth, and breathe into her nostrils. Watch for the rise and fall of her chest to indicate air going into her lungs.Give about 20 breaths per minute.If she is not breathing, reposition her neck and try again.If she does not start breathing on her own after multiple attempts, take her immediately to the veterinary hospital.
Use extreme caution if she has a spinal injury.

, The cat probably has some bleeding wounds following the attack. Your job is to make an initial attempt to stop the bleeding before taking the cat to the veterinary hospital. First, use your fingers or palm of your hands to press down on the wound, then wrap a piece of fabric (e.g., wash cloth, hand towel) or gauze around the bleeding area.Wrap the bandage firmly, but not tightly. Wrapping the bandage too tightly would cut off blood circulation.If the bleeding does not stop, place additional bandage material on top of what is already there and continue applying pressure. Do not take off the original bandage material.Do not prolong your first aid if you cannot control the bleeding. Bleeding wounds often require medical or surgical treatment.Do not delay treatment with your efforts to stop the bleeding completely on your own.

, Fractures are either open (bone has gone through the skin) or closed (skin remains intact). If you see an open fracture, cover it with a clean cloth to prevent debris from entering it and possibly causing an infection.Do not try to fix the fixture yourself! Not only would you make the injury worse, but the cat would likely bite you., Transporting the cat safely to the veterinary hospital requires that you minimize the motion of her head, neck, and spine.Any sudden movement of these body parts could make her injuries much worse.


If the cat has a fracture, do you best to provide extra support and stabilization to that injured area.Placing the cat in a large box can also restrict her movement. Cut several holes in the box so you can see her.Place the box in the front passenger seat, or on the floor in front of that seat, to keep an eye on her.

, Although you should get the cat to a veterinary hospital as soon as possible, you will need to drive carefully.This is not the time to use your lead foot or throw on the brakes! Erratic driving would increase the cat’s fear and bewilderment, and possibly make her injuries even worse.

, Depending on the severity of the cat’s injuries, the veterinary team may need to perform extensive care to save her. After giving the team a brief history of the attack, let them go to work on diagnosing and treating the cat’s injuries. Because of the emergency situation, they will make a quick assessment of the injuries, then work quickly to stabilize the cat (e.g., intravenous fluids, oxygen supplementation) and treat the most life-threatening injures.Part of that initial assessment will be evaluating the cat’s airway, breathing, circulation, and consciousness.In addition to a full physical exam, your veterinarian will perform other diagnostics, such as bloodwork, urinalysis, and chest x-rays.
Be aware that emergency veterinary care is expensive.

, After the cat has recovered enough to be released, you will need to continue treatment at home. Your veterinarian will likely recommend several treatments, including pain medication and antibiotics. You may also be responsible for changing bandages and checking wounds for signs of inflammation (e.g., redness, swelling) or infection (discharge).You will also need to restrict the cat’s activity and prevent her from jumping from furniture.The specific type of at-home care will depend on the extent of the cat’s injuries. Be sure you fully understand the at-home care instructions before taking the cat home.You may need to schedule a follow-up appointment so the veterinarian can assess your cat’s recovery."

Get blood tests.",How to Treat Fight Wounds on a Cat," You may notice bleeding or sores on your cat if it has been in a fight. You may also check its body to look for scabs since bite wounds heal over quickly. You can also run your hands over the body to check for any tender areas that cause the cat pain., If a cat gets into a fight, you may not know about it. The puncture wounds will close over and trap bacteria in the skin. This will lead to swelling where the cat was bitten. Check the cat’s body for any swelling.The most common places a cat will get bitten is the head, forelimbs, and the base of the tail.

, Cats who are developing an infection and abscess will have skin that is hot around the infection site. The cat may also develop a fever. This will cause the cat to be lethargic and have an overall sickly disposition., Your cat may show others signs that let you know it has been in a fight. In cats with leg bites, the infection makes walking painful so it may start limping. Sometimes, the cat will groom and lick the area of the bite excessively.In rare cases, you may notice that your cat has problems breathing.

, If it is after hours and you can’t get your cat to the vet immediately, try to administer some first aid on the wound. Look at your cat’s entire body to determine where it has sustained damage. If there is matted hair, clip it so you can get a better look at the wound.You can also try to place a warm compress on the injured site. Hold the cloth on the wound for a few minutes to help loosen fur and clean some of the blood.
Be careful not to get bitten. Your cat may not let you do this because it is in too much pain.

, If your cat has a surface bite, clean it with hydrogen peroxide or Betadine. Then rinse the area with warm water. Don’t use rubbing alcohol. If your cat won’t let you use hydrogen peroxide, try to clean the area with just warm water.Only use hydrogen peroxide on shallow, surface wounds. If it is a deep wound or already infected, don’t use it.

, When you have cleaned the wound, assess the damage. Many fight wounds are superficial and can be dealt with during regular business hours. If the wound is bleeding profusely or damaged part of the body like the throat or eye, you should get your cat help immediately.If your cat acts okay, if it is eating, and if it doesn’t seem like it has sustained nerve damage, it should be okay until you can get it to the vet.

, When cats get in a fight, the teeth and claws puncture the skin, which traps bacteria under the skin when it closes over. If the infection doesn’t get treated soon, it can lead to more serious symptoms. Some bite wounds can lead to blood loss, nerve damage, and trauma to organs.As soon as you discover your cat has gotten into a fight, take it to the vet. Getting the cat treatment as soon as possible can save it from developing infections and unnecessary pain.

, The vet will give you antibiotics to give to your cat. If the antibiotics are given within 24 hours, this will help stop the infection from spreading. Giving the cat antibiotics early can prevent more serious problems, like an abscess, from occurring.Make sure to give your cat all the antibiotics the vet gives you.

, If the infection has turned into an abscess, the vet will have to drain the infection and flush it out with a saline solution. In some cases, the vet can do this by removing the scabs. However, the most common way to drain the abscess is to lance the skin.Your cat may need to be sedated or put under anesthesia for this procedure.

, If your cat has a large abscess, the vet may remove the tissues that have been affected by the abscess, including any inflamed tissues surrounding the infection. Some abscesses lead to dead tissue around the infection site.After this, the vet will close the area with sutures.

, Some fight wounds may require a surgical drain placed in the wound. This helps any pus or discharge drain from the wound. If the vet places this into the wound, you will have to clean the hole multiple times a day for up to five days., After your vet drains the abscess, the wound may be left open to continue draining and healing. You will have to clean this area twice each day for a few days. To clean it, you will use cotton balls or gauze and warm water.Some cats may be prescribed a surgical soap by the vet. Only use cleansers or soap prescribed by the vet. Human products or other disinfectants can be toxic to cats.
Hydrogen peroxide should never be used on an abscess. It can make the area worse.

, It is a good idea to get your cat tested after it gets into a fight. Cats can transmit infections through bite wounds. Common infections they can transmit include the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Ask your vet to test your cat’s blood to be safe.Blood tests are often recommended for cats who do not get better after treatment.

Reluctance to put weight on the leg
Limping
Swelling
Pain or tenderness
Limb deformity or unusual bends in the leg
Rapid breathing
Broken skin and/ or a visible boneNot eating or grooming
Crying, howling, moaning, or growling;
, No matter how sweet your kitten is, it may bite or scratch you because of the injury. Take great care when examining your kitten’s leg to minimize the risk of biting or scratching.Maintain a safe distance between the kitten’s mouth and your face. Avoid attempting to hug it.
Examine the leg slowly, carefully, and as gently as possible. Reassure your kitten in a soft voice. Stop looking for signs if your kitten becomes agitated.

, Once you’ve checked your kitten’s leg, call your vet’s office. Explain to the office staff that your kitten may have a broken leg to get an appointment as soon as possible. If your vet isn’t available, take your kitten to an emergency clinic to ensure it gets prompt care.Calling ahead can also alert the vet that you are coming so they can prepare to treat your kitten as quickly as possible.


Give as much information as possible about your kitten’s symptoms. Ask any questions you have, such as what type of first aid to provide and the best way to transport kitten to the office.

, Before you take your kitten to the vet, stabilize its leg with a splint or bandage. This can reduce the risk of further injury or pain. Only stabilize the leg if your kitten allows it.Place a towel or blanket gently over your kitten’s head to prevent it from biting.
Make a splint with items such as the cardboard center of paper towel or toilet rolls, rolled up newspaper, or towels.Put the splint next to the broken area. Use a bandage, pantyhose, or surgical tape to keep the splint in place. Add padding around the splint to reduce your kitten’s discomfort.
Avoid pushing any exposed bone back through the broken skin. In this case, place some sterile gauze or a sanitary napkin over the area and then splint it.

, The only way to safely treat a kitten’s broken leg is with veterinary care. After you’ve stabilized the leg and informed the vet that you are coming, take your kitten to the office for treatment.Wrap your kitten in a thick towel or place it on a rigid surface for the car ride.This can minimize your kitten’s discomfort the risk of further injury.Place your kitten in a crate, carrier, or open box to keep it from moving around the car. Put it in the back passenger side seat so that you can watch your kitten through your rearview mirror. Use a seat belt around the front of the crate or carrier to secure it., You’ll need to seek prompt veterinary care if your kitten’s leg is broken. Veterinary care is the only way to confirm a broken leg. It also ensures that your kitten gets proper treatment to heal the leg.Let the vet know any symptoms your kitten has and how the injury occurred. For example, say, “Snowball has been limping for a couple of days. I’m not sure how she got hurt. She limps and holds her right leg up when she walks.”Answer any questions your vet may have about the injury or your kitten.

, Your vet will perform an examination of your kitten. This may include further testing such as X-rays. The exam and tests help the vet figure out exactly where the break is and develop the best treatment plan.Recognize that the vet may touch or press certain points of your kitten’s leg to feel if they’re swollen, sore, warm, or out of place. The vet may also place your kitten on the ground to see it walk. Your kitten may also undergo an X-ray or have an ultrasound or MRI to detect internal damage.

, Your vet will suggest a course of treatment for your kitten’s broken leg. The type of treatment will depend on the break’s severity and your kitten’s overall health. Follow any instructions your vet provides for the kitten’s treatment, including giving your kitten antibiotics. Your vet may consider treating your kitten with:A cast or splint
Surgery, especially if the surrounding tissue is damaged
Amputation for very severe breaks

, Simple breaks in one spot on your kitten’s leg or breaks that haven’t torn tissue often require immobilization with a cast or splint.Most immobilization treatments take 4-6 weeks to heal.Observe if the vet uses a rigid cast or more secure splint on your kitten’s leg.Casts are constructed with plaster and splints may be plastic, plaster or aluminum.
Ask your vet if extra padding can make your kitten more comfortable.
Put a sling around the leg for up to 10 days if your kitten’s vet prescribes it. This can keep your kitten from moving and walking.
Avoid getting the cast or splint wet to allow the break to heal.
Leave any casts or splints in place until the vet removes them.

, If your kitten has a very severe break, your vet may suggest surgery. This can stabilize the bone, joints, and surrounding tissues, which will help your kitten heal properly. In especially severe breaks, amputation may be necessary.Authorize any recommended pre-surgical tests to make sure your kitten is healthy enough for surgery.
Ask the vet what type of surgery is best for your kitten. It may be using pins, wires, or screws to stabilize the leg. It may also be amputation.
Follow any post-operative instructions from the vet. This includes restricting activity for 2-4 weeks, a course of antibiotics or pain medication, and having pins and screws removed.

, A broken leg can be very traumatic for your kitten. Give your kitten as much rest as possible while it is injured. Rest aids healing and minimizes pain or discomfort.Restrict your kitten’s movement, especially jumping, as much as possible.

, One way to help restrict movement and comfort your kitten is creating one area in which to sleep, eat, and use the litter box. It can be an entire room or in a crate. This can ensure your kitten doesn’t need to move often and doesn’t waste energy that is better spent on healing.Place a warm blanket in the area, which can provide warmth and comfort to your kitten. Consider putting it in a space that allows you to lay down with your kitten. This can give your kitten extra comfort.
Make sure your kitten has clean food and water in the area. Your kitten may not want to eat or drink much until it starts feeling better.
Put a small litter box or bathroom pad in the area. Take your kitten to it every hour so that it doesn’t have to put any weight on the leg.

, Your kitten may be scared or cry because of the break or treatment. Pick up your kitten or sit by the blanket and gently pet it. This can calm your kitten and provide reassurance.Stroke your kitten’s head, neck, and under the chin. Avoid the broken leg and any spots that are sensitive. Your kitten may also not want to be pet. If this is the case, give it some space until it is ready for contact again.

, In addition to touch, talking can also provide your kitten comfort and reassurance. Any you’re your are with your kitten or checking in on it, give a few comforting words.Maintain a soft voice so you don’t scare your kitten.
Include your kitten’s name and offer praise while you talk. For example, “I know you’re hurting and scared, Sam? You’re being such a good kitten.” Consider gently stroking your kitten when you talk to it.

Keep your cat in a small space.",How to Splint a Cat's Broken Leg," While this may seem like a straightforward step, it's an important one. It's a lot harder to open cellophane-wrapped bandages when holding down an injured and very angry feline. When they are all open, lay them out on the table, or at a work station near your table, so that you can quickly grab them when wrapping up your kitty’s leg.


It's a good idea to lay your materials out in the order that you will use them. If you are right-handed, you will lay the materials out from left to right as: cotton wool, gauze bandage, splint, Primapore (adhesive dressing tape), cotton wadding, a final bandage, and then Elastoplast (wide adhesive dressing).;
, The table should be a comfortable height for you to work at and large enough to hold all of the materials listed above, as well as the cat itself. You should also make sure the table is sturdy; if it wobbles or tips at all, your cat may become even more scared and angry, leading to a higher-tension situation.

, Yes, this is the medical term. Cotton wool sausages are little rolls of wool that you will stick between your cat’s toes later in the process. To make one sausage, tear off a quarter of the cotton wool ball and roll it between your fingers and thumb until it gets thinner and, as you might have guessed, looks like a sausage.Make four of these so that you can keep your cat’s claws from digging into their neighboring toes.

, Doing this will make the splinting process a lot easier. Each strip should be long enough that it can wrap twice around your kitty’s leg and the splint. Make four of these strips and then stick the ends of each on to the table so that you can quickly grab them when you are working.

, Having someone to help hold your cat down will make the splinting process a lot easier and a lot less painful. If someone else holds the cat, you will have both hands free to wrap the splint.

, Once you have found someone to help you, gently pick your injured cat up. Lay her on the table so that her injured leg is facing up. For example, if you cat has broken her front left leg, you would lie her down so that she is lying on her right side.

, Don’t take offense if your cat tries to swipe at you or bite. She is in a lot of pain and will not be her normal affectionate self. Because of this, it is important to take extra precaution to make sure that you and your assistant don’t get hurt. Have your assistant hold your cat by the scruff (the folds of skin on the back of her neck). This is make sure that she can’t bite anyone, and will keep her from moving around. It is also a painless way to hold your cat — and her mother held her when she was a kitten.


If your cat is really aggressive and doesn’t calm down when held by her scruff, gently place a towel over her head. Doing this may soothe the cat and protect your assistant from bites.

, Your assistant should hold your cat’s scruff with one hand, while gently extending the broken leg with the other. How she does this will depend on which leg is broken.If the foreleg is broken, the assistant should place her forefinger behind the elbow and gently push the hand forward towards the cat’s head, so as to extend the leg.
If the back leg is injured, the assistant should hook her forefinger in front of the thigh bone, as close to the hip joint as possible. With gentle traction, pulling towards the cat’s tail, the hind leg will extend.

, To do this, pick up a pre-prepared cotton wool sausage and slide it in the gap between a toe and its immediate neighbor. Repeat this until all the toes have cotton wool separating them. Your cat’s foot will look a little crazy, but doing this will help to keep the claw on one toe from digging into the next toe over when you wrap her leg.

, You should apply the first layer of bandage directly to your cat’s leg to create some padding between her leg and the splint so that she will be more comfortable. Use your dominant hand to wrap the bandage. Start at the tip of the toes, to work upward towards the body. Place the free end of the bandage over your cat’s toes and hold it in place with your other hand. Wind the bandage in a circle around the paw and pull it tight enough that it will stay in place without you holding it. Continue to wind the bandage around the leg, traveling in a spiral manner towards the body.Each layer should overlap the previous by half a bandage width.

, The tension on the dressing is important. The dressing needs to be firm, but not too tight. If it is too loose it will slip off the leg, but too tight and the circulation to the limb could be impaired. You are aiming for something similar to the feel of a firm sock on your leg, or the grip of a woman’s stocking.

, Once you've adjusted the tightness correctly and have reached the top of your kitty’s leg, cut the bandage with some scissors and tuck the end into a previous turn of the bandage so that it stays in place.

, The ideal splint is rigid, yet light. You can purchase plastic splints, but in an emergency you can improvise with wooden dowels, or similar rigid objects. The splint should be the same length as the broken bone, plus the length of the paw.For example, if your cat’s forearm is broken, you measure the splint from the elbow to the tip of the toes.

, Hold the splint against the underside of the bandaged limb. Line up one end of the splint with the end of your cat’s toes. To secure the splint to your cat’s leg, take a piece of pre-cut Primapore (dressing tape) and stick one end to the middle of the splint, perpendicular to the length of the bone. Applying firm tension, wind the Primapore over the bandage and around the limb, so that the splint is attached to the leg. Repeat this process and place tape at either end of the splint.


Use the final piece of tape to add extra security anywhere it is needed.

, Its important that your cat be as comfortable as possible after the ordeal she has been through. To pad the splint, pick up a roll of wadding and, just as you did with the bandage, start at the cat’s toes and work in an overlapping spiral up towards the body. You can pull firmly on the cotton wadding without injuring the cat, since it will tear apart if you wrap your cat’s leg too tightly., When you reach your cat’s hip (or the elbow, depending on which leg is broken) use the scissors to cut the end of the roll free. Start again at the toes and repeat this process, until you have built up at least three layers of padding.

, After you have added the layers of padding, you should add another layer of bandage, and a final layer of Elastoplast, or wide adhesive dressing. Apply both of these layers in the same way as every other layer: start at your cat’s toes and spiral upwards until you reach her hip or elbow. Cut the end of the bandage and secure it by tucking it into the previous layer of bandage.

, The point of the splint you have applied is to make sure that the broken bone stays immobilized so that it can heal. However, even with the splint, when your cat walks or jumps, she may move the broken bone and delay, or even stop, the healing process. Because of this, you should keep her in a small room or a puppy crate.

Recognize the symptoms of fever in cats.,
Take your cat’s temperature.,
Examine your cat’s body.,
Help your cat cool down.,
Provide plenty of water.,
Make sure she’s eating.,
Give your cat vitamin B and energy supplements.",How to Reduce Fever in Cats1," The normal range of rectal temperature for cats is from 38.1 C to 39.4 C (100 to 102.5°F).If you can't easily take your cat's temperature, the following symptoms could indicate a fever:Poor appetite
Lethargy
Inactivity
Weakness
Excessive shedding
Withdrawing away from other cats
Rapid or shallow breathing
Shivering
Decreased grooming activities
Because most fevers are caused by an underlying condition, be on the alert for other symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, sneezing or skin swellings. These could point to a reason for your cat’s illness.;
, Symptoms are a good sign that your cat has a fever, but the only way to know for sure is to take her temperature with a thermometer. You can take your cat’s temperature rectally or in its ear.Gather your supplies. You will need a thermometer, lubricant (e.g., petroleum jelly or K-Y), alcohol and paper towels, and a cat treat.
If using a glass thermometer, shake it until the mercury is below the 96F (35C) line. Simply switch on a digital thermometer. Use a special thermometer designed for pets to measure temperature in the ear.
If measuring your cat’s temperature rectally, lubricate the thermometer.
Cradle your cat under one arm, or ask someone else to hold her. Raise her tail.
Insert the thermometer into your cat’s anus about one inch. Hold a glass thermometer in place for 2 minutes. Remove a digital thermometer when it beeps.
Clean the thermometer with rubbing alcohol and paper towels.
Give your cat a treat to comfort her.
If your cat’s fever is over 102F (39C), take her to see a vet immediately. High fevers can cause organ damage., Gently press your cat’s body with your fingers.Determine whether you can feel any injuries like bone fracture, swollen lymph nodes, abscess, wound infection or tumors. All of these instances can cause fever.You may or may not be able to feel a bone fracture in your cat. Fractures or breaks in bones can cause swelling or bruising in the break area. If you apply pressure to the injured area your cat will respond with pain. Be gentle as you examine your cat.You should be able to feel swollen lymph nodes under your cat’s jaw area and around her shoulders. Swelling at the back of the legs or near the groin is also possible.Immediately take your cat to the vet if you notice any of these symptoms. These conditions require prompt medical attention.
If you do not notice any of these symptoms, the fever is likely a normal immune response. If possible get your cat examined by a vet who will try to identify the source of the infection. Follow the steps below as directed unless your cat's fever has been present for over 24 hours.
If your cat has had a fever for more than 24 hours, seek veterinary advice and treatment as soon as possible.

, Cats lose heat through sweat glands in their paws and by panting. Help your feverish cat cool off so you can reduce her body temperature. Find a cool, dark, room, preferably with a slate or tile floor so that she can stretch out and transfer her body heat to the tiles. You can also try these ways to help your cat cool off:Position a fan on the floor so that it blows cool air over her body.
If your cat will tolerate it, gently wet her coat with water. You can use a damp cloth or a spray bottle to dampen her coat. The evaporation will help to cool her body.

, Fever can be caused by dehydration, and can also cause dehydration. It is important that you provide fresh water at all times to your cat. If your cat is having trouble drinking, provide your cat with water via syringe (without a needle).Rehydrating your cat can reduce fever (this is the reason why cats are given IV fluids at the vet’s clinic).A feverish cat will not want to get up and walk about, so make sure she has drinking water within reach. You can sponge her gums with tepid water.
In addition to water, you can also give Gatorade or children’s electrolyte solutions to cats with fever. These may help restore your cat’s electrolyte balance, especially if she has been vomiting or had diarrhea.You can use a syringe to get your cat to drink Gatorade.
If your cat is resistant to syringe hydration, try freezing some water or Gatorade into cubes. Your cat may be more interested in licking an ice cube than drinking (and the cold will help her cool down).

Never give your cat milk! Cats are very sensitive to lactose. Milk can make your cat ill and cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea., Fever requires huge amounts of energy and can leave your cat very weak. Your cat may not feel up to eating solid food. You can supplement her diet by providing soft foods. Soft scrambled eggsor canned tuna run through a food processorcan be good options.


If your cat refuses solid or soft food, try using a syringe to feed your cat milk replacer (sold at pet stores). This is a food that’s designed for feeding sick cats or nursing motherless kittens. Use a syringe (no needle) with 5cc to 10 cc capacity.
Insert the tip of the syringe on the insides of corners of the mouth, closest to the cheek. Cats and dogs will swallow by reflex anything that has passed in this area inside the mouth.
If your cat cannot eat, ask your vet about high-calorie liquid supplements. Your cat can consume these until she is well enough to eat solid food again., It’s a good idea to ensure your cat’s nutrition by boosting her appetite. Vitamin B-complex and energy supplements added to her diet can accomplish this.A vitamin and energy supplement like Nutri-Plus Gel (at 5ml daily for 5 days) can be given to battle fatigue and a lack of nutrients.
An example of a very good B-complex vitamin is Coforta. It has a high concentration of cyanocoblamin (3), which is needed in energy metabolism. It is injected at 0.5ml to 2.5 ml per cat once a day for 5 days Subcutaneously (SQ) or Intramuscularly (IM):

For small cats less than or equal to 1 kg (2.2 lb), 0.5 ml
For cats 2 to 6 kg (4.4 to 13.2 lb), 1 ml
For large cats, 7 to 9 kg (15.4 to 19.8 lb), 2.5 ml
For cats between these weight ranges, estimate a dose between these or follow vet advice, erring toward a lower dose.


Never give your cat supplements with the following ingredients. They can be toxic to cats:Garlic or onion
Calcium
Vitamin D
Vitamin C

Take your cat to the vet.,
Use antibiotics if vet-recommended.,
Ask about Meloxicam.,
Ask about tolfenamic acid.,
Use aspirin only with vet supervision.,
Know that cats cannot handle certain human medications.",How to Reduce Fever in Cats2," If your cat seemed well but was running a fever, after 24 hours take her to the vet. If she was off-color and running a fever, don't wait that long. Extended high-grade fevers can be a sign of more serious health issues. Your vet can perform examinations and tests to help determine the cause of the fever.Be sure to tell your vet your cat’s recent history. Information to provide could include travel history, contact with other animals, recent vaccinations or other treatments, allergies, and anything else that you believe may be the cause of your cat’s fever.A fever can happen for a number of reasons, including:Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections
Physical trauma
Auto-immune disease
Necrotic tissue
Tumors or cancers


The cause of the fever will determine the treatment. Your veterinarian will need to perform tests to determine the cause of your cat’s fever. Common tests include bloodwork and urinalysis., If your cat’s fever is caused by a bacterial infection, the underlying infection must be treated. Usually giving antibiotics would be enough to reduce a fever. While antibiotics are generally safe for a cat with a fever, do not self medicate. Always ensure that the vet has checked and prescribed antibiotics for your cat. Antibiotics are often specific to one strain of bacteria and may not be effective for others. Your vet can recommend the best treatment for your cat.The most common and safe antibiotics usually prescribed by vets are:Ampicillin and Amoxicillin (20mg/kg body weight). Both are available in suspension form and can be bought in ""human"" pharmacies.
Marbofloxacin (2 mg/kg) is available in tablet form; however, it can be very hard to dose because of its small tablet size.
Doxycycline (5 mg/kg) is available in paste form, and a preparation made for pets can be bought upon prescription of a veterinarian. This preparation is Vibravet, and it comes with a plastic syringe doser to ensure correct administration.
In giving antibiotics the duration of medication should always be one week (seven days). Always give the full course of antibiotics, even if your cat appears to be feeling better. Shortening it may cause re-infection and antibiotic resistance., Also known as Metacam, this is a useful anti-fever drug that is safe for cats. It is approved for use in many countries. It should not be used except under veterinary direction. The recommended maintenance dose is 0.05 mg/kg daily of feline meloxicam, with or after food. A 5 kg (11 lb) cat will need 0.5 ml of cat Metacam.It should be noted that meloxicam is formulated in two strengths: for dogs (1.5 mg/ml) and for cats (0.5 mg/ml). It's imperative you give your cat the proper form of this medication to avoid an overdose.
Meloxicam should only be used in well-hydrated cats. Dehydrated cats may well have impaired renal function. The additional decrease in blood supply to the kidney may cause kidney failure.

, Tolfenamic acid, or Tolfedine, is an NSAID anti-fever drug. Tolfenamic acid comes in 6 mg tablets. The correct dose for Tolfedine is one tablet (6 mg tablet) for three to five days for every 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) bodyweight once a day.Tolfenamic acid is not FDA registered and is not a first choice pain killer for cats. It is therefore used relatively rarely and only under veterinary supervision when other drugs have failed to work.
An average cat with a bodyweight of 4.5 kilograms (9.9 lb) would need around three tablets of this medication to be given in a day.

, Aspirin is not the anti-fever drug of choice for cats. It can cause dehydration, vomiting, and other severe symptoms. Aspirin can be used in a cat with extreme caution if recommended by your vet. Give only the recommended dosage.The recommended dose for a cat is 2.5 mg/kg (5 mg/lb) every 48 – 72 hours. Use pediatric aspirin, which usually is available in 50mg or 75mg tablets. This will facilitate smaller doses.
Give your cat food and water with aspirin. Giving your cat aspirin on an empty stomach may make your cat feel ill.
Once absorbed across the stomach lining, aspirin is broken down to salicylic acid. However, cats lack the enzyme necessary to break down salicylic acid. Salicylic acid levels in your cat’s body will remain high for prolonged periods. High and/or additional doses rapidly lead to toxicity. Thus it is incredibly important to monitor the dosages you're administering.

, Reducing fever in cats is different from other animals because of their physiology. Cats lack an enzyme in the liver called glucuronyl transferase. This means that they cannot break down many medicines that are safe for humans. In many cases, even medicines that are safe for dogs are not safe for cats.Do not give your cat any medications intended for humans unless they have been specifically prescribed by your veterinarian. Doing so can harm or even kill your cat."

To prevent your cat from escaping, choose a small enclosed space like a bathroom.This area should be free of distractions and away from children and other pets., To give subcutaneous fluids, you will need a fluid bag, fluid line, and a needle. Your vet will probably provide you with these supplies. The fluid bag and fluid line will be sealed in their own plastic protective coverings.Carefully remove this covering.


Look at the color of the fluid. It should be clear. If it’s discolored and cloudy, do not use the bag. Discolored fluid could indicate contamination.The fluid line will have a roller clamp. Roll the clamp so the fluid line is squeezed together at the clamp.This will keep fluid from flowing through the line when you don’t want it to.

, The top end of the fluid line will have a large spike that will go into the fluid bag’s bottom opening. Remove the spike’s rubber covering and insert the spike into the fluid bag. Do not let the spike touch anything before you insert it.Give the spike a twist to ensure it fits snugly in the fluid bag., The top of the fluid line has a drip chamber that allows you to see how fast the fluid is flowing. Squeeze the fluid bag until the chamber is about halfway full., The fluid will flow more easily when it's free of air bubbles. To run fluid through the line, remove the protective cover off the bottom of the fluid line. Loosen the roller clamp and watch the fluid run through the line and out the bottom opening.Do not allow anything to touch the fluid line's bottom opening. This is where the needle will go.Position the fluid line by a sink or trash can so the fluid doesn’t get on the floor.
Close the roller clamp after a few seconds so you don’t waste too much fluid.Fortunately, air bubbles won’t hurt your cat.Don’t worry if you don’t get all the air bubbles out.

, The bottom of the needle will have a plastic covering. Remove this covering and fit the metal part of the needle into the bottom opening of the fluid line.The needle will have another covering protecting its top end. Do not remove this covering until you’re ready to start giving the fluids.

, The fluid bag will need to hang about three feet above your cat. If you do not have an IV pole, you can slide the top hole of the fluid bag onto a coat hanger. Hang the coat hanger over the top of a door or, if you’re in a bathroom, the shower curtain rod., Keeping your cat comfortable will help you give it subcutaneous fluids more easily. Position your cat in your lap or on a smooth, flat surface (table, top of washer or dryer). If your cat gets squirmy, considering asking someone else to gently position and hold your cat.Whoever is holding your cat should use gentle restraint. Too much restraint can make a cat want to get away.Make sure the cat is positioned so that it will be comfortable for 10 to 15 minutes.Quietly talking to your cat and petting it will help it feel comfortable after it’s in position to receive fluids., To ensure the fluids go under the skin, you will make a skin tent. Choose an area that has a lot of loose skin, such as the shoulders or hips.Using your thumb and another finger, pull up some skin to create the tent.Make the skin tent with your nondominant hand (the hand you don’t write with) so your dominant hand can guide the needle., Take the plastic covering off the needle. Position the needle so its sharp end is parallel to your cat’s back and facing the skin tent. Make sure the needle’s hole is facing up.Rest the hand holding the needle on your cat’s back., In one swift motion, move the needle forward until most of the needle is in the tent. When the needle is in, release the skin tent.Because the needle is small and sharp, your cat probably won’t even feel it as it enters the skin tent.As you slide the needle in, make sure you don’t poke the needle in so far that it comes out the other side of the tent.

, With the needle in the tent, open the roller clamp to allow the fluid to flow.Keep watch on the fluid bag so you administer only as much as your vet prescribed.


Before you start the fluids, it may help to mark the bag with a marker so you know when to stop the flow. Each line on the bag represents 100 milliliters of fluid.

, As the fluid flows under the skin, a lump will form. This is normal. The lump will go down as your cat’s body absorbs the fluid.The lump will eventually get tight with fluid. If you notice the lump is tight but you haven’t given the full amount of fluids, you’ll need to give the rest of the fluids in a different skin tent.Use a new needle if you have to do this.

, Keep an eye on the drip chamber. If you notice the fluid isn’t moving into it, the needle might have moved against the skin, blocking the flow. Gently reposition the needle under the skin without removing it from the tent. You may need to do this a few times to ensure your cat gets all the fluid it needs.You can also try slightly rotating the needle in the skin., Once you’ve given all the fluids, close the roller clamp to stop the flow of fluids.Slowly remove the needle by backing it out of the tent. Next, pinch the skin for a few seconds to make sure fluid doesn’t leak out of the tent.You may see a little blood when you remove the needle. This is normal.Take the old needle off and replace it with a new one on the fluid line.Do not discard the old needle in your regular trash. Place it in an area that other pets and children can’t access. Your vet will tell you where to discard the used needles."

Alternatively, you could use a cat restraint bag, which you can buy in any pet supply store. Place the bag on the floor or other flat surface. Put your cat in the middle of the bag and begin to pull the sides up around them. Make sure their tail and all paws are securely inside the bag. Close the zipper and secure the neck hole.If your cat fights back or runs away from you, don't make any further attempts to remove the hook. Wait for them to calm down and take them to the vet.;
, If the hook is stuck in the lip and if the barb of the hook is visible, you may proceed with removal. If you can't see the barb or if the hook is stuck inside the mouth or throat, take your cat to the vet immediately. In these more severe instances, you could make a dangerous situation worse if you attempt to remove the hook yourself., Only wire cutters will work to remove a hook. If you don't have wire cutters, leave the removal to your vet. Never use scissors, a knife or any other sharp object. They could make the injury worse., Pour some rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on a cotton ball or sheet of toilet paper. Wipe the blade of the wire cutters completely. Allow the antiseptic to evaporate to avoid poisoning your cat or damaging the injured tissue., Use the wire cutters to snip the hook on the outside of the mouth. Remove each piece. DO NOT attempt to pull the hook in the opposite direction of where the barb is pointing. You could deepen the wound and risk infection., If you have povidone, dilute it until it's the color of weak tea. If you have chlorhexidine, dilute it until it's pale blue.You could also use sterile saline if you have access to that. Soak a cotton ball or toilet paper with the solution and gently blot the wound. You can buy these antiseptics over the counter at any drug store.

If you don't have these antiseptics, keep the wound clean with warm water and wait for the vet to sterilize it.
Avoid hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol. They can damage the injured skin even further., Do this after you have removed the hook. Don't wait to schedule an appointment. Inform your vet of the emergency situation and ask if they can squeeze you in as soon as possible. If it's after hours, call your vet's answering service. If your vet doesn't operate after hours, take your cat to the nearest animal hospital immediately., Crunchy morsels of dry food can irritate open wounds in a cat's mouth. An injured cat might also have trouble swallowing because the hook is obstructing access to their throat. Because hook injuries happen suddenly, these symptoms arise out of the blue., Your cat might attempt to remove the hook or scratch the source of irritation. Sometimes they'll use one or both front paws. At other times, they might rub their lips or gums on the floor., Drooling in cats is always a sign of illness or injury. When a foreign object like a hook gets stuck in the mouth, the body tries to remove it by producing excess saliva. You can spot drooling by wet fur around your cat's mouth., Check the wound after each meal. Gently brush or wipe away any remnants of food near it. Monitor your cat's behavior and stop them if they try to paw at the wound or rub it on the floor. Don't let your cat go outside until the wound is completely healed.

Foul odors, chafing, and excess bleeding are signs of infection or other abnormality. If you notice any of these, contact your vet immediately., Your vet will prescribe antibiotics either to fight an existing infection or to prevent one from developing. Follow the dosing instructions on the package. Don't stop giving your cat their medicine at the first sign of improvement. If the vet gives you a 10-day dosage, give the cat the medicine for the full 10 days., If the hook punctured your cat's gums or other areas inside the mouth, you'll probably have to avoid giving them dry food until the wound is completely healed. Chewed food particles can tear stitches. Your vet might prescribe prescription food for the healing period. Make sure you follow the instructions to the letter."

Continue with maintenance doses.",How to Give Your Cat a Joint Supplement," It is okay, and probably even best, to give your cat a joint supplement before they show signs of pain or arthritis. Supplements will keep your cat's joints healthy and help slow the process of deterioration as they age. If your cat is showing signs of arthritis and you haven't been giving them supplements, keep in mind that they take about four to six weeks to work and increase your cat's mobility. Signs of arthritis can be difficult to spot since arthritis shows itself differently in cats. Signs of arthritis include:Hiding more than usual (avoiding people)
Crying if you pick them up
Aggressive behavior
Running from people
Difficulty or a change in walking
Stiffness or difficulty jumping up or climbing
Remember that if your cat is in pain, you should take them to the vet. A joint supplement will not help ease their pain.;
, Before you give your cat a joint supplement, ask your doctor to recommend a joint supplement specific to your cat. If you think your cat has joint pain, your doctor will need to make a diagnosis. The vet will do a basic physical exam and will x-ray the joints that you think are affected by arthritis (like the elbow or hip). The vet will use the diagnosis to help you choose a joint supplement.Your cat will probably need to be deeply sedated before the x-ray. This will help the vet move your cat into the right position for the x-ray.

, Glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate are naturally occurring substances that can help your cat's joints. They heal the cartilage along the bones which improves your cat's joint mobility. Supplements that contain glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate come in a variety of forms and they're safe to give to cats. For example, you can buy gummy, powdered, or liquid supplements.You may need to give a glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate supplement for the long term. Discuss a long term treatment plan with the vet when choosing the supplement.

, Since most joint supplements contain the ingredients needed to heal your cat's joints, you should focus on selecting a joint supplement that meets other health needs of your cat. You'll need to pick a supplement that gives your cat its daily required vitamins and minerals. For example, you can find joint supplements for:Senior cats
Cats with other underlying health conditions (like diabetes or kidney disease)
Obese cats

, If you don't like the idea of giving your cat a joint supplement for an extended period of time, consider giving it a cat food that contains an anti-inflammatory supplement. Look for a cat food that's marketed as being anti-inflammatory. It should contain fish oils (Omega 6 and Omega 3 fatty acids).If your cat is trying to lose weight, look for an anti-inflammatory food that's also low in calories.

, Many joint supplements are available as powder in capsule form. To give your cat a capsule, simply twist it open and sprinkle the supplement powder over your cat's food. The supplement powder is easiest to eat if your cat's food is moist or wet. If you feed your cat dry food, try moistening the powder in one tablespoon of wet food and add it to your cat's meals.Follow the packaged dosing recommendations. For most joint supplements, you'll need to give one capsule a day (if your cat is under 12 pounds) or two or three capsules a day (if your cat is over 12 pounds)., Most soft chew supplements look like large pieces of kibble, but they're soft enough for your cat to easily chew. It may come in a flavor like chicken or beef to encourage your cat to eat it. You can give your cat the soft chew after a meal or just place it on top of their food dish at meal time.


Follow the packaged dosing recommendations based on the weight of your cat. For example, if your cat is under 10 pounds, you may only need to give one soft chew a day. If your cat weighs more, you'll probably need to give two or three soft chews a day., A liquid supplement contains the same joint improving ingredients as other supplements, but it may be easier to administer to picky cats. To use a liquid supplement, shake the bottle well and squirt it onto your cat's food. If your cat doesn't like it mixed into their food, you can also offer it directly to your cat to lap up.You'll need to give the liquid supplement according to your cat's weight. For example, if your cat weighs under 10 pounds, you'll probably need to give 1/2 teaspoon (one pump) of the liquid supplement.

, Read the manufacturer's instructions carefully regarding dosing. Many supplements want you to give a high dose during the first few weeks of supplementing and then you can reduce the amount of the supplement once your cat shows improvement.


Always talk with the vet before doubling any doses during the initial weeks, even if the manufacturer recommends doing so.

This can lead to more bleeding. On the other hand, keeping a cool head will allow your cat to calm down and cooperate with you., First, talk to your cat in a soothing tone and pet them as you normally would. This will work with your calmness to help your cat settle down. Then, secure them in a comfort bag. Make sure it's not too tight around the cat's neck.


If you don't have a comfort bag, you can wrap them in a towel and secure it with a clothespin. This will allow you to start taking measures to stop the bleeding., Readymade ice packs are usually too large for small feline noses. Take one or two ice cubes from your freezer. Place them in a plastic bag. Then, wrap the bag in a clean towel.

, Place the ice pack on the bridge of your cat's nose. Make sure you don't cover your cat's nostrils. The cold temperature should cause the blood vessels to constrict and stop the bleeding., A nosebleed can stem from a number of illnesses or injuries. Medication could worsen your cat's condition. The only exception to this rule is if your vet has prescribed medication specifically for the nosebleed or its underlying cause., Find a clean and dry paper towel. Wipe away any blood from your cat's face. This will keep their airways clear and prevent them from swallowing blood. Make sure you use gentle strokes. If the nosebleed was caused by a cut in the nose, forceful strokes could trigger more bleeding., Nosebleeds in cats occur due to an underlying illness (such as an infection or leukemia) or injury (such as head trauma or a foreign body in the nose). Only your vet can make the proper diagnosis and take measures to cure the condition or keep it under control.


Depending on what's causing the nosebleed, treatments can range from simple antibiotics to surgery or a blood transfusion."

For their recovery, they'll need to see familiar faces and hear familiar voices. Talk to your cat and pet them often to reduce their stress., Heightened activity or emotions could trigger another nosebleed. Follow your vet's advice on keeping your cat calm for the recovery period. This might include crating, relocation to a small room, or medication., If your cat's nosebleed was the result of kidney failure, high blood pressure, or related condition, they'll have to go on a special diet. Give your cat only the foods that the vet deems safe. Sometimes, the diet will only be temporary. However, you should be prepared to keep your cat on the diet for the rest of their life., Cats suffering from respiratory infections or recovering from surgery will need antibiotics. Some nosebleed-related conditions, such as poisoning or blood clotting disorders, require dietary supplements and/or long-term medications.


Stick to the dosing schedule your vet prescribes. You'll usually only have to give your cat antibiotics for two weeks or less. However, if your cat has cancer or other chronic condition, you should be prepared to stick to the dosing schedule for the rest of their life., Cats whose nosebleeds were caused by foreign bodies, abscesses, or cancer will likely have to undergo surgery. Change the surgical dressing as prescribed. Look for swelling, redness, blood, discharge, or foul odor in the stitched area. These usually indicate infection. Call your vet if you notice any of these abnormalities., Your vet will give you a list of symptoms to look out for as your cat recovers. These usually include blood loss, pale gums, weakness, or collapse. Don't try to improvise on any instructions. If your vet tells you to bring your cat to the office for certain symptoms, do exactly that. Your cat's life could depend on it., Your vet will need to check your cat's prognosis. Work out a schedule for follow-up visits and keep each appointment. The vet will let you know when your cat has a clean bill of health.

Their energy level could range from low to non-existent. They won't respond if you try to play with them or open a can of food., The normal heart rate for adult cats is 110-130 beats per minute (bpm). For kittens, it's 180-220 bpm.Cats in the early stages of shock might have an abnormally high heart rate. It might then slow to a weak, slow rate. If your cat has no pulse, administer CPR immediately.To check your cat's pulse, place your hand on their chest just behind the left elbow. Count each heartbeat for 15 seconds. Multiply that number by four., On average, healthy cats take 16 to 40 breaths per minute. A cat in shock will take more than 40 breaths per minute. However, the breaths will be shallow. If your cat stops breathing, perform CPR immediately.To calculate your cat's breathing rate, count the number of times your cat's chest rises (inhaling) or falls (exhaling) in 15 seconds. Multiply that number by four. Don't count both rising and falling, as this will give you an inaccurate rate., Cats in shock experience a drop in body temperature. Feel your cat's limbs and the underside of their paws. If they feel cold to the touch, wrap your cat in a towel or blanket. Call the vet immediately., When a cat is in shock, blood will be drawn away from their nose and tongue. This causes both sources of exposed skin to become pale. Their gums will darken to a dark pink at first. As blood withdraws from the area, the gums will turn gray or white., Press your finger against your cat's gums for a second. When you remove it, you should see a white patch where your finger was. If it takes more than two seconds to become pink again, your cat's blood circulation is abnormally low. Call your vet immediately., If your cat has experienced prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, they might be dehydrated. Gently take the skin between your cat's shoulder blades and pull it upward. The skin should fall back into place after you release it. If it fails to fall back after two seconds, your cat is likely dehydrated and needs immediate veterinary attention., Shock can kill quickly. Immediately after your cat has sustained a major injury, such as being hit by a car or receiving a deep cut, take them to your vet or local animal hospital. Do this even if your cat seems okay following the incident.

If shock comes about as the result of heat exhaustion or allergies, seek out your vet as soon as your cat starts to act lethargic or confused. When shock is caught in its early stages, your cat will have a better chance of survival., If your cat has sustained a wound, apply direct pressure to slow or stop the bleeding. Wrap the wound in sterile gauze. If you don't have access to gauze, use a clean towel to wrap the wound.Avoid hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol. These substances can damage the injured skin even further.If you think your cat might have a fractured bone, cover it with a towel., Cover them with a blanket. This will keep them warm en route to the vet's office or animal hospital. Keep their head at a lower level than their heart by placing towels under their torso. This will direct blood flow to their brain., Check for a build-up of secretions around your cat's nose and mouth. Clear them away with your hand or a towel. Make sure nothing covers their mouth or nose., If your cat is lethargic or losing consciousness, they can choke on food or water. Even if they're still fully alert, they could still start vomiting, which could speed up dehydration. Your vet will administer food and water once your cat is stabilized., Cats recovering from shock usually have to stay at the vet's office or animal hospital for several days. However, it's important to their recovery that they see familiar faces and hear familiar voices. Talk to your cat and pet them often to reduce their stress., If your cat is recovering from a fracture or surgery, you'll have to reduce the likelihood of a relapse after they come home. Keep them in the smallest room you have. Clear away any furniture and block access to window sills that your cat would like to jump on., Follow the dosing instructions on the package. Don't stop giving your cat their medicine at the first sign of improvement. If the vet gives you a 14-day dosage, give the cat the medicine for the full 14 days., Change the dressing as directed by your vet. Administer any topical medications that your vet prescribes. Check the wound and/or stitched area for redness, swelling, bleeding, discharge, or a foul odor. These could indicate infection. If you notice any of these side effects, call your vet immediately., Any injury from a burn to a broken bone to a hit-and-run can throw your cat into a state of shock. Injured cats might seem okay at first, but shock can set in quickly and cause rapid deterioration in your cat's health. Don't leave anything to chance. When in doubt, get your cat to your vet or nearest animal hospital., Poisoning is another trauma that can trigger shock. Various plants, foods, and medications can poison your cat. The American Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) has developed an exhaustive list of these potential toxins.Replace any toxic plants with non-toxic alternatives. Keep medications in child-safe bottles or securely sealed in pill sorters. Store toxic foods like chocolate, citrus fruits, and avocados in the fridge., Dehydration can bring on shock. Make sure your cat has a constant supply of water throughout the day. Top off the water bowl before you leave for work and go to bed.

If your cat experiences heavy vomiting or diarrhea, they could become dehydrated. Contact your vet if vomiting doesn't clear up after 24 hours or if diarrhea doesn't stop after 48 hours., Heat stroke and car accidents are common incidents that can trigger shock. Cats who live indoors don't face these dangers. If you must take your cat outside, keep them in a cat crate or securely wrapped in a towel."

Oral thermometers can be bitten or swallowed, and do not offer as close of a reading of your pet’s temperature. For safety purposes, buy a plastic thermometer, which will not pose the risk of breaking that a glass model would., Lubricate the tip of the thermometer so that you can insert it easily without pain or discomfort to your cat. Use Vaseline or KY jelly, which you can find at most pharmacies. Avoid using the thermometer without lubrication, which could be painful for your cat and create negative associations with having its temperature taken., Have your cat lie on its side and gently move its tail aside. Gently insert the thermometer into the anus, about the length of your cat’s foot (approximately 1-1.5 inches). Brace your cat while waiting for the digital thermometer to beep, indicating that your cat’s temperature has been reached.Note that a normal temperature for your cat should be between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 38-39 degrees Celsius). If your cat’s temperature is higher, contact your veterinarian., After using a rectal thermometer, clean it thoroughly before putting it away. Be sure to remove any traces of fecal matter and wipe the thermometer down thoroughly with a paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol to disinfect it. Note that 50-70% rubbing alcohol will disinfect better than 90% alcohol., Start practicing how to check your cat’s heart and respiratory rates when it is calm and in good health, so that you know what you are doing in case of an emergency. This will also provide you with a good picture of your cat’s normal vital signs to use as a comparison when it might be sick or unwell. , Use your smart phone or a stopwatch to monitor the time. Place your left hand over your cat’s left side, underneath its front leg. Count the number of beats over fifteen seconds, then multiply the number by four to get the reading.A normal range for your cat’s heart rate would be between 150 and 220 beats per minute. If you get a reading much higher or lower than this, consult your veterinarian., Position yourself in front of your cat with a clear view of its chest while it is sitting up. Watch your cat’s chest moving up and down, and count either inhalations or exhalations for 15 seconds. Multiply by four to get your cat’s respiratory rate, which should fall between 15-30 breaths per minute.Regardless of the respiratory values, contact your veterinarian if your cat’s breathing is labored, shallow, rapid, or irregular.

, If you are unsure about how to take an accurate reading, ask your veterinarian if they can show you how to check your cat’s heart rate and respiratory rate at your cat’s next appointment. Ask any questions you might have (e.g. “Where exactly should I position my hand to feel my cat’s heart rate?”). In addition, ask your vet what values fall within the normal range for your cat., To make the process of checking your cat’s vital signs easier, calm it by applying constant, gentle pressure to its torso. Grasp your cat’s torso firmly with one arm while checking its vitals with the opposite hand, or have a friend or family member assist you. You can also purchase a pressure shirt for your cat, a weighted pet garment designed to reduce your cat’s anxiety during trips to the veterinarian and other stressful situations., Ask your veterinarian if a pheromone spray would be a suitable way to relax your cat. Synthetic pheromone sprays mimic a cheek pheromone that cats release when bonding with each other and their owners. Popular brands like Feliway are available online or through veterinary clinics., There are many herbs that have a calming effect on cats and can make them more amenable to having their vital signs checked. These non-toxic plants are best given to cats in loose, dried form, either sprinkled in their play area or inserted into a refillable toy (approximately 1 tsp or 0.5 oz.). Visit a pet store or natural health store to purchase:Catnip, which can make your cat excitable for a brief period of time and eventually relax it.
Valerian, which can induce relaxation and sleep after a short period of heightened energy.
Chamomile, which reduces stress and anxiety.

Begin with a small dosage.,
Sprinkle the powder onto your cat’s food.,
Weigh the pros and cons of powdered enzymes.",How to Give Supplemental Enzymes to a Cat1," When you begin supplementing your cat’s food with enzymes, start with a dosage that is smaller than the recommended amount. Over the course of one to two weeks, gradually increase the dosage to the proper amount. This way you can monitor the effects of the supplements on your cat’s health.For example, if you feed your cat one cup of food per day, then sprinkle less than ¼ teaspoon of powder onto your cat’s food for the first five to seven days.;
, Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of powder for every cup of food, or sprinkle an appropriate amount of powder per the instructions on the bottle. You can mix the powder into your cat's dry or wet food, or leave it on top.For example, if you feed your cat two cups of food per day, then sprinkle ½ teaspoon of enzyme powder over your cat’s food.
Some products may advise you to mix the powder with water. If this is the case, then mix the powder with an appropriate amount of water per the instructions on the bottle.

, Because dosing is easier to control with powders, you may want to choose the powder form over the tablet. However, the powder may make your cat's food soupy and unappetizing.If your cat refuses to eat its food because the enzymes make it unappetizing, then opt for the chewable tablets instead.

This way you can monitor the effects of the supplements on your cat’s health. After the first week, discuss any positive or negative outcomes you observed on your cat's health with your veterinarian.You may also want to break the tablets in half if you feed your cat less than the recommended amount of food for the dosage. For example, if the instructions tell you to give your cat one tablet for every two cups of food, but you only feed your cat one cup of food, then break the tablet in half to adjust the dosing.

, Some products require you to give your cat the tablet before its meal, while others require you to give it after. Just make sure to administer the tablet per the instructions on the bottle.If the instructions do not specify when to give your cat the tablet, then it is safe to give it either before or after its meal.

, Do this if your cat will not take the tablet by itself. A pill pocket is similar to a treat. However, a pill pocket has a small space for you to place the tablet inside.

Gently check the gums by lifting up the cat’s cheeks with your finger or thumb and examining the top of the teeth for a yellowed color.If your cat drools regularly, this alone may not be a symptom. Look for excessive amounts of drool as an indicator of a problem.

, Some toxic substances can impact the functionality of your cat’s brain, and may cause seizures, incoordination, or a coma. If you notice any neurological symptoms, it is imperative to get your cat to an animal hospital as soon as possible to avoid sustained damage.Neurological symptoms can also include changes in personality such as sudden bursts of excitement or severe lethargy and depression.

, Heavy breathing, difficulty inhaling, coughing, and sneezing could all be indicators that your cat has ingested something bad for its health. Closely monitor the rise and fall of your cat’s chest, and listen for coughing, hacking, wheezing, and sneezing.Respiratory problems can become fatal quickly. If your cat struggles to breathe, get it to an animal hospital immediately.

, While one person calls for help, have another person check the area for potentially toxic substances, if possible. Many common human foods are toxic to cats. Check areas where you store food for signs that your cat may have eaten something they were not supposed to, including:Any alcohols
Products with caffeine including food and beverages
Chocolate
Vegetables from the onion family including common onions, garlic, and chives
Grapes or raisins
Xylitol, an artificial sweetener found in candies, diet foods, and toothpaste
Unbaked bread dough

, Both plants and pest control ingestibles found in gardens can be toxic to cats. Check to make sure that no rat, gopher, insect, or other pest control poison has been disturbed, and look for bite or chew marks on plants like:Aloe
Amaryllis
Azaleas
Caladium
Lilies
Ivy
Mistletoe
Philodendron
Poinsettia

, Medications and household chemicals are some of the most common offenders when it comes to accidental poisoning for household pets. Check the areas where you store medications, cleaning supplies, and other chemicals and check for chew or tamper marks on items like:Antifreeze and motor oil
Fertilizers
Any household cleaning agent
Insecticides, including flea and tick treatment
Painkillers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin
Cold, Flu, or cough medication
Moth balls
Batteries
Zinc

, If you know or can reasonably guess what your cat got into, take the container or a sample of the product to provide for your vet. If no container or sample remains, let the vet know in as much detail as possible what you think your cat consumed.If they eat a small aloe plant, for example, let your vet know, “My cat ate an aloe plant that was about two inches tall and had just been recently planted in a pot with potting soil.”

, If your cat is experiencing life-threatening symptoms, such as struggling to breathe or losing consciousness, immediately take them to an animal hospital. If symptoms are not imminently life-threatening, call your vet or an animal hospital right away for further advice.Let your vet know what you think your cat consumed, as well as what symptoms it is exhibiting. Be exhaustive in your descriptions.
Follow your vet’s advice carefully. They may recommend taking your cat in for an emergency visit, or they may advise a home treatment such as inducing vomiting.
Only perform home treatments such as inducing vomiting with your vet’s permission and using their careful instructions.

, If your cat is exhibiting life-threatening symptoms such as difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, tremors, seizures, or other critical problems, take them to a 24 hour small pet hospital immediately. Check online or call your local Information Services to locate the nearest facility.Symptoms of neurological trauma often require hospitalization to stop. Skip the vet visit and go straight to the hospital if your cat is exhibiting signs of neurological problems.

, Once you and your cat return home, move those things that you don’t want your cat getting into to locked areas or closed-off spaces. Place child safety locks on cabinets where you keep chemicals, and move all food behind a closed door.If your cat got into a plant that made it sick, consider moving houseplants outside to a yard or patio. If your cat is allowed outside, you may want to put fencing and a cover over the planted areas.

If the cat has lost consciousness, check the animal’s breathing. Check whether the cat responds to the sound of your voice. Note any shaking or spasms., A cat that has had a stroke may exhibit symptoms close to what humans usually call depression. The cat may seem unusually quiet and stop responding in the usual ways.


This behavior may occur because the cat may feel disoriented, woozy, nauseous, and/or suffer from a thumping headache., You may notice that the cat holds its head at a strange angle with one ear lower than the other. He may exhibit this symptom as a tilting, turning, or twisting of the head. If due to a stroke, the symptom usually means pressure on a specific part of the brain.This symptom may also signify another problem, such as vestibular disease, which leads to damage of the vestibular apparatus in the cat’s inner ear. Vestibular disease affects the cat’s sense of balance and orientation in a manner similar to signs of stroke. The symptom is cause for concern and an immediate trip to the veterinarian regardless whether a stroke or vestibular disease causes it.

, You may notice that your cat cannot walk in a straight line. The cat might stagger as if drunk, fall to one side, or walk in circles. Again, when caused by a stroke, this symptom usually results from pressure on a portion of the brain.These symptoms may also present as weakness on one side of the body or postural defects. The cat might measure steps wrong or show signs of weakness in all legs as well.As with other symptoms due to pressure on the cat’s brain, unstable walking and/or circling can also be signs of vestibular disease.
If your cat has tremors or moves its limbs wildly and rhythmically, this likely means a seizure. In some cases, you may not see the actual seizures. You may come across the disoriented cat afterward. This is called a post octal phase of a seizure and may last for a few minutes to a few hours.Though an isolated seizure is less cause for immediate concern, you should still take the cat to the veterinarian as soon as possible.

, Look closely at your cat's eyes. If he has had a stroke, his pupils may be different-sized or his eyes may flick from side to side. This is called nystagmus and it is due to a lack of blood supply to the nerves that feed the eyes.If your cat's pupils are unequal in size, the third eyelids are prominent, and if there is a head tilt, then this is more indicative of vestibular disease than a stroke.
As a side effect of the nystagmus, the cat may be nauseous from motion sickness.

, Though less common than the other symptoms related to the cat’s eyes, some cats may also exhibit blindness due to stroke.Even in cases where the blindness isn’t from a stroke, the symptom is a telltale sign of high blood pressure in a cat, which often precedes a stroke., It should be pink.If the tongue is blue, purple, or white, that is serious. Your cat needs to be taken to the veterinary hospital immediately.

, The most classic signs of stroke in humans include partial paralysis and a droop to one side of the face. Cats do not experience strokes the same way humans do. These symptoms tend not to present themselves when a cat has a stroke., Since the loss of blood supply to the part of the brain happens quickly, the effects of a stroke happen suddenly as well. If your cat develops worsening balance issues over several weeks, for instance, then a stroke is not the likely cause. However, you should still take your cat to the veterinarian for any recurring or worsening symptoms.

, Stroke symptoms usually last at least twenty-four hours in a cat. You should take your cat to the veterinarian as soon as you observe symptoms, but that might not always be possible. Like humans, cats can have a mini-stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This means that the symptoms may begin to subside after a day; however, you should still take your cat to the veterinarian even if symptoms decrease in severity.


These temporary signs are a strong indication that there is a problem requiring further medical investigation to prevent the cat from having a full-blown stroke in the near future.

, Though not an immediate, observable sign, strokes are more likely in cats when they have underlying health conditions.If you regularly take your cat to the veterinarian, look at your cat’s records. If the veterinarian has previously diagnosed your cat with kidney disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, or overactive thyroid glands, then the chance of a stroke is much higher.

, The sooner the cat sees a veterinarian, the better care the animal will receive, meaning a better chance for recovery. Strokes in cats are not always as devastating to the animal as strokes tend to be in humans; however, the event is still serious and requires immediate attention.


You may want to call ahead as you place the cat in its carrier to tell the veterinarian the symptoms you’ve seen as well.
If it is at night, you may need to take him to the emergency veterinary hospital.

, Your vet will ask you some questions to help determine a course of action. They will ask questions about many things involving your cat's behavior, so make sure you pay close attention to your cat. They will ask if your cat could have ingested anything like a plant, a medication, or a poison to cause the symptoms. They might also ask if there was any known trauma like a fall prior to the symptoms. They will ask about any changes in his water or food intake. They will also likely ask if there has been any vomiting, diarrhea, or general lethargy.


You will need to know if your cat has had his rabies vaccination recently as well.

, Your veterinarian may order a blood panel, urinalysis, x-rays, or an ultrasound. These tests can help determining stroke or the underlying conditions that often accompany a stroke in cats (discussed in Part 1). If your vet thinks there might be a serious neurological problem, a veterinarian specializing in neurology may be needed for a consult. The specialist may ask for additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan, which can identify a blood clot or area of damage to the brain.


These test are done for animals in a similar way to how they are done for humans.

, In many cases, your cat’s symptoms may resolve after a few days of TLC at home. In some cases, the cat may require hospitalization with the veterinarian. Neurological outcomes can be very difficult to determine. You and your veterinarian will need time to tell exactly what the long lasting effects or conditions might be.


If your cat has motion sickness as a symptom, a medication such as Cerenia is available to manage that.
If your cat’s appetite is down, there may be options that increase the appetite such as Mirtazapine.
If your cat is having seizures, your veterinarian will likely discuss medical management with anti-seizure medications such as phenobarbital., If the symptoms were actually vestibular disease, the cat may spontaneously recover in a few days. In other situations, the cat may have a sustained head tilt. That may be the only lasting effect while he is otherwise fine. Other cats may continue to have some balance problems. Since the brain is complicated, the full outcome of a neurological event cannot be completely predicted.


It may be tough to watch your pet stumble around. Don't worry because they are likely not in pain., Any cat that has had neurological problems should be kept indoors for its safety. You may need to confine the cat to one room for a while after the cat comes home. This is for the cat’s safety, especially if you have other pets in the household that may attack the cat for behaving abnormally.

, While recovering, you may need to help the cat eat, drink, or go to the litter box. This will depend on the severity of the condition. You may need to pick them up and carry him to the food bowl, to the water dish, or to the litter box. Watch for signs that he is hungry or needs to go to the litter box, such as meowing or general discontent.


It will take time to know if if this will be a temporary or a permanent necessity for your cat.

, While monitoring the cat and noting symptoms, be careful with any children around the cat. If your cat is confused, disoriented, or seizing, then the cat may bite or scratch unintentionally. Keeping children away is the best way to avoid potential injury.

, With proper nursing and care, some cats recover very well. Even in these situations, the recovery can take anywhere from 2-4 months. Stay patient with the process and remember how much your cat needs you while recovering.

Give your cat the medication.,
Follow the directions when giving the medication.,
Treat underlying conditions.,
Manage short-term side effects.,
Assess any developing long-term side effects.,
Identify signs of chronic pain.,
Pay attention to signs of other inflammatory diseases.,
Look for areas of external inflammation.",How to Give Steroids to Cats with Inflammation," If your cat has any of the symptoms of inflammatory disease, you should have it seen by a veterinarian. Tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms and allow them to do a thorough examination of your cat. They will give you a diagnosis and they will discuss treatment options.

If your veterinarian suspects that your cat has inflammation that needs treatment, they may suggest a round of steroids to reduce it.;
, Once you and your veterinarian agree on a treatment plan for your cat, they will prescribe your cat steroids or they will inject steroids in the cat themselves. The steroids that are most often prescribed for cats are in pill form and include:Prednisolone
Dexamethasone
Triamcinolone
Budesonide

, Getting a cat to take medication can be difficult. You can try to hide it in their food and hope that they will eat it when they are eating. If that doesn't work, you may need to restrain the cat and force it to swallow the medication.

Restraint may be uncomfortable for the cat but it should never injure the cat or cause pain. Using a towel to wrap up the cat is usually the easiest, and least traumatic, way of restraining a cat.

, When you give your cat medication you should be sure to read and follow the directions included. This will include how often the medication should be given, whether is should be given with food, what the daily dosage should be, and how long the medication should be given.If you are unsure about any of the directions on the packaging, as your veterinarian to clarify.
It is very important to give your cat the right amount of medication for the right amount of time. Giving a cat too many steroids can cause health problems.

, While steroids can help to alleviate inflammation temporarily, they will not cure underlying conditions that cause inflammation. Because of this, you should put some effort into figuring out what is causing your cat's inflammation.Some common causes of inflammation in cats include osteoarthritis, soft tissue injuries, allergies, and gingivitis. These medical issues are typically diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian after the general symptoms of pain and discomfort or skin irritation are spotted by a cat's owner.Because long-term steroid use can cause a variety of health problems, finding the cause of your cat's inflammation, and treating that, will help your cat avoid these problems in addition to solving the underlying problem.

, Steroids can cause a variety side effects that can negatively impact your cat's life. If your cat has any of these short-term side effects you should discuss solutions with your veterinarian:Increased hunger
Increased thirst
Increased urination
Lethargy
Gastrointestinal problems
Hair loss

, It is important to keep an eye out for the development of long-term side effects due to steroid treatments. If your cat begins to develop any of these problems, you should seek out veterinary care right away:A pot belly (which often signals the presence of Cushing’s disease)
Blood clots
Diabetes
Pancreatitis
Secondary infections

, Inflammation in the bones and joints that goes untreated can often lead to chronic pain. Your cat may become listless, unable to move easily, sensitive to touch, or ill-tempered if it is dealing with chronic pain. If your cat has these symptoms, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian.

Steroids can be very helpful for treating the pain associated with several conditions that cause chronic pain, including osteoarthritis and soft tissue injuries., There are a variety of other inflammatory diseases that your veterinarian may want to treat with steroids. For example, the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease are commonly treated with steroids. Signs that your cat has inflammatory bowel disease include:Vomiting
Diarrhea
Lethargy
Weight loss

, In addition to treating internal inflammation, steroids can help with areas of inflammation on the outside of your cat's body. Inflammation of the skin, called dermatitis, inflammation of the eyes, and inflammation of the gums can all usually be treated with steroids.Allergies are a common cause of inflammation on the outside of the body. Steroids can minimize this type of inflammation, although they do not solve the problem permanently.

Mark down all core vaccines.,
Mark down all non-core vaccines.,
Ask about the brand of vaccine.,
Stick to the schedule.",How to Make Sure Your Cat's Vaccinations Are Up to Date1," Make an appointment to have your cat examined. After the examination, talk with your vet about the vaccinations that your cat currently has or needs. Ask them about their approach to vaccinations and boosters. Do they believe in spreading them out or lumping them together in combo shots?If you move to a new area, make an appointment with the new vet as soon as possible. They will be able to help you to register your cat with local officials. They can also provide advice regarding that vaccinations that your cat is required to get.;
, Vets will usually hand you a card showing the vaccinations completed as well as those that will need to be done in the future. Make sure to place this card in a secure area where you keep your pet’s other records. If your vet does not give you a card, you can go online and search for a “printable cat vaccination card.”Many boarding facilities require that your vet provides a signature for each vaccine update. Your card should have a place for signatures on the back or bottom.

, These are the vaccines that all cats should get, unless their health prevents them from doing so. The vaccines for the Feline Panleukopenia Virus, Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus and Panleukopenia (FVRCP, and Rabies virus will protect your cat from these more commonly spread illnesses.These vaccines are often suggested because the illnesses that they prevent can be life-threatening to cats. For example, a cat infected with rabies may suffer from brain swelling and hemorrhaging.

, Depending on your cat’s age and lifestyle, your vet may suggest that you add extra vaccinations into the core schedule. These vaccinations are optional, but can protect your cat from certain commonly spread diseases. The vaccines for chlamydia, leukemia, Bordetella, and FIV, can save your cat a great deal of pain in the long run.These non-core vaccines are particularly important for cats who will have contact with a wide variety of other animals, such as in a boarding facility.

, Not all vaccines are the same, even for the same illness. Talk to your vet about the exact brand and type of vaccine that your cat is getting. Some vaccines are single-shot, but include coverage for a combination of illnesses. The type of vaccine will also determine how often your cat will need a booster shot, whether in a year, three years, or not at all., Once the vaccination schedule is set, do your best to stick to it. Make a mark down on your calendar or create a note on your phone indicating when your cat needs another vet visit. This is especially important to do with the first round of vaccines, when your cat will require a shot every few weeks."

Follow the local laws.,
Vaccinate your cat as early as possible.,
Get all required boosters.,
Get the records for a new animal.,
Schedule vaccinations well prior to travelling or boarding.,
Follow all travel restrictions.,
Contact for local authorities about any disease outbreaks.",How to Make Sure Your Cat's Vaccinations Are Up to Date2," Each jurisdiction sets their own regulations regarding animal vaccinations. Your vet will be familiar with these rules. But, you can also contact local government authorities for more information. It is possible that you will need to send in a copy of your cat’s rabies vaccination every year, every three years, or less frequently depending on the area., The vaccination schedule should start as soon as your kitten is starting to less frequently nurse from their mother, usually around 6-8 weeks of wage. This means that the antibodies from the mother’s milk will coincide with the protections provided by the vaccines, providing overlapping protections. If you didn’t take your kitten to the vet early on, it is possible to catch them up via later boosters., If you’ve started the sequence, don’t try to space out or remove booster shots, otherwise your cat will only be partially protected, if at all. This means that you will need to get one initial shot and then expect a series to follow. There are guidelines regarding how far apart these boosters must be placed in time., If you’ve decided to adopt or purchase a new cat, make sure to get all of their personal records as part of that transaction. Look over the records with your vet to see if there are any gaps in coverage. Particularly with adoption, you may need to start from ground zero., Because a cat is not fully covered until they’ve received the full vaccination sequence, which can take weeks, make sure to plan well in advance before you attempt to board or travel with your cat. Many boarding facilities will require that your cat has completed a full course of yearly vaccinations. And some require that this occurs weeks prior to boarding., Each country has a list of restrictions regarding the conditions of animals allowed in from elsewhere. Make sure to look at that government’s website to determine the exact requirements that your cat must meet for entry.


For example, in the UK, a pet cat must be microchipped with a vet certificate showing proof of a rabies vaccination., You may want to get extra vaccine coverage for your cat if there is an outbreak of a particular illness if your area. Leukemia, for example, often occurs in waves in communities, leading cat owners to seek out their vets. For information on outbreaks, contact your local Department of Agriculture in the U.S."

Limit your cat’s exposure to health dangers.",How to Make Sure Your Cat's Vaccinations Are Up to Date3," If you are rather busy and afraid that you’ll miss an important vaccination appointment, request that your vet email you or text you an appointment reminder. They usually do this routinely anyway, so it is not a problem.

, There is a great deal of information available online, both positive and negative, about vaccinations. All vaccines carry some type of risk, although it is usually quite minimal. Talk with your vet about possible reactions and be prepared to talk your cat to an emergency clinic if they exhibit serious signs of breathing difficulties., Multiple vaccinations and office visits can become costly over time. To save yourself some money, look into low-cost or free vaccination clinics available in your area. These, often mobile, clinics can give your cat a yearly exam or just a series of vaccinations. Be aware that these clinics are often quite busy, so give yourself plenty of time.As these clinics are attempting to vaccinate cats en masse, be aware that many of them will not treat an animal that has any underlying health issues. You will need to go to your vet if this is the case.

, Recognizing the burdens of payment, many vets will now accept various payment plans or even vet-specific credit cards. Discuss this with your vet’s office staff and see what your options are before your cat’s visit. They may also suggest that you investigate getting pet insurance, which may cover some of the core vaccination boosters., Even though your cat is fully vaccinated, avoid putting them in situations that can lead to illness. If you know that another neighborhood cat is ill, try to keep your cat indoors. Make sure that your cat eats a proper diet and is not overly stressed as well."

Assemble this list of vital medicines, nutritional supports, bandaging materials and equipment and supplies.,
Place your first aid kit in a safe, secure, place within easy reach for you in case of emergency.",How to Make a First Aid Kit for Your Cat," The container should be airtight, waterproof, and sunlight proof so the effectiveness of the materials inside aren't affected. Sunlight can cause iodine and some medicines to lose potency. Heat can cause plastic gloves to become brittle.


You can purchase first aid kits for cats at a veterinary store or in a pet store already assembled. However the contents may or may not be sufficient to carry out one procedure and some items might be missing or not included. Some tools also may be of low quality and fall apart easily.
Take into consideration rather your cat is an indoor or outdoor cat. Remember outdoor cats can be more prone to injury and sickness than indoor cats being outside in the elements. Which means you should probably need a higher quantity of certain things than with an indoor cat.;
, Make a copy of it on a disk or flash drive and/or written and laminated/protected. Keep this list of important numbers and directions to animal health care clinics in case you are unable to take care of your cat, need assistance, or do not know how to handle the situation. This list of numbers will make it quick to contact the appropriate authorities. The vital numbers you should have are those of the veterinarian clinic, emergency clinic, and poison control center.


Keep your pets medical records and insurance (if applicable) safe and secure so you don't have to look and fumble around for it in case of emergency. Also keep specific instructions for a medical instrument, vet instructions or your cats specific medications in this same spot.

, These may or may not be included in a purchases first aid kit. Get to know how to do basic procedures like removing a tick or using the vomit technique in case of toxins being ingested.

, In order to have a valid first aid kit for your cat you should have the following list of needed supplies. You can purchase these items at a medical section in your local department store, a pet store or online at a veterinary supply store.


Equipment for Transporting to the clinic: Muzzle, pet carrier, towel or blanket to keep your cat warm during transport (some pharmacies and camping outlets carry a thermal blanket), cold packs and heat packs (wrap in towel before using).
Tools used to examine: Magnifying glass, penlight/ flashlight, rectal thermometer, lubricant such as mineral oil or lubrication jelly (without spermicide), disposable gloves, thermostats, stethoscope.
Tools for carrying out medical procedures/clean up: Styptic powder sticks (stops bleeding such as Kwik Stop) or cornstarch, cotton swabs, cotton balls, clean towels, cloth and paper (cleaning up fluids and blood), feeding tubes of various sizes if you are trained in how to use them, tweezers, nail clippers and metal nail file, scissors, syringes of various sizes,eye dropper or oral syringe, needle-nose pliers and grease-cutting but mild dish soap.
Bandaging materials: Square gauze of various sizes, some sterile-non stick pads, first aid tape both paper (easily comes off of skin) and adhesive types, bandage rolls, gauze, and vet wrap, bandages (for humans).
Nutritional Support: Rehydrating solution, nutritional supplement etc. Some sites say sports drinks are safe but check with a vet before giving any of these drinks and/or other food/nutrient products to a cat. Extra water and cat food is good to have in case of a natural disaster or major emergency that involved staying locked in your home.
Medicines: Products to discourage licking, wound disinfectant, ophthalmic antibiotic ointment (for eyes), sterile saline, antidiarrheal medicine, cat laxative in paste form, anti-allergic agents for allergic reactions (obtain dose from your veterinarian), cortisone spray or cream, ear cleaning solution, hydrogen peroxide (used to make a cat vomit; use only as directed by a veterinarian), activated charcoal to absorb ingested poisons, (consult your veterinarian before using).

, Make sure children or the pets themselves aren't allowed to get in the case as even medicine can be harmful if used incorrectly. Make sure your cat doesn't nibble on the containers or tools and choke on small parts.


Keep your first aid kit organized. Procedures are easier mentally and physically to complete correctly if the tools and supplies are easy to locate in a kit that is organized and neat.

Put feline sunblock on your cat.,
Avoid shaving your cat.,
Check for signs of sunburn.,
Assess your cat’s risk.",How to Protect an Outdoor Cat from Excess Sunlight1," You can find a waterproof, cat-friendly sunscreen to prevent sunburn. Use one that has an SPF of 15 or 30. Apply it on areas where the fur is thin, and especially on the extremities of white cats such as the ears and nose.You can buy one at the pet store or ask your vet for a recommendation.


The cat might lick or otherwise ingest the sunscreen that you put on them. For this reason, it is important to only buy a sunscreen made for cats. Sunscreen made for humans may not be safe for your cat to consume.Some baby sunscreens may be safe for cats.Read the ingredients to make sure that the sunscreen does not contain salicylate (such as octyl salicylate) or zinc oxide, as these are toxic to cats.;
, Even if you have a long-haired cat, you should not shave them if they live outdoors. This is because their coat actually gives them protection from the sun. It can even provide some relief from the heat. Trim their long fur instead., Cats typically become sunburned around their nose, ears, lips, groin, and stomach. Their skin below their coat may have turned red or started flaking. They may also be losing hair around the affected area.You may also notice them scratching the area of the burn.If you think that the cat is sunburned, move them to a shaded area, and apply cool compresses to soothe their skin.


If the burn appears severe, you should contact a vet.
Once a cat has been sunburned, they are more vulnerable in the future to sun damage. You may want to consider providing extra protection to the cat or moving them indoors.
If you find dark tumors, skin lesions, or eruptions around the cat’s face, they may have squamous cell carcinoma. This is the most common form of skin cancer in cats. Take the cat to a vet. If caught early, it can be treated. If left untreated, it can be deadly., Certain cats are at higher risk of sun damage. While some cats will be fine without any protection in the sun, others need special precautions to prevent heat stroke, skin cancer, and sunburn.


Cats with light-colored or thin coats and hairless cats are at higher risk of sunburn and skin cancer. The head is the most vulnerable area, especially the area around the nose, ears, temples, and eyes.If you live in a sunny, hot, or tropical area, your cat might be at higher risk of sunburn and heatstroke.
If the cat has a scar from surgery, an autoimmune disease, or a parasite, they are more susceptible to sun damage."

Wrap the cat in a towel.,
Use muzzles with caution.,
Put the cat in a large box or pet carrier.,
Use food to lure an unwilling or scared cat into a carrier or box.",How to Immobilize an Injured or Frightened Cat1," One of the safest and easiest ways to immobilize a cat is by wrapping its body in a towel. Place your cat on top of a towel lying on a flat surface, several inches from the edge of the towel. Cover the cat’s body with the short side of the towel, leaving its head out. Grab the other end of the towel and pull it over the cat’s body.Make sure you do not restrict the cat’s airway.;
, Muzzles can be challenging to put on a cat, due to the shape of most cats’ faces and their propensity to use their teeth as a defense. You can purchase muzzles made specifically for cats, or you can loop a pair of pantyhose around a cat’s mouth to prevent it from biting., If you are unsuccessful immobilizing the cat with a towel or muzzle, you can try placing the cat in a box or pet carrier. If necessary, you can immobilize the cat inside the box by gently tying the cat down with straps or rope., If your cat is hesitant to enter a box or pet carrier, try using food to lure them inside. For example, you can leave a trail of cat treats starting near the opening of the carrier or box. You could also try placing a can of tuna in the box.

Avoid leaving the cat in a hot car.,
Provide shaded areas outside.,
Keep the house cool.,
Provide water for your cat.,
Recognize which cats are at a higher risk for heatstroke.",How to Prevent Heatstroke in Cats1," One way to prevent heatstroke in a cat is to never leave them in a car. This is true during the summer or winter. A closed car in winter months can get too warm for a cat. If you will have to leave your cat in a car, leave it at home instead.If you are travelling with a cat in your vehicle, make sure it is cool inside. Make sure there is plenty of air moving and your cat is not in direct sunlight the entire time.;
, If your cat spends time outside, make sure there is a place for your cat to get out of the sun or heat. This can include trees that provide shade, a porch, under a building or carport, or an area you build specifically for your cat.During the hottest months and the heat of the day, consider limiting the amount of time that you allow your cat outside. Even in the shade, your cat may get too hot and be unable to cool down.

, If your cat lives indoors, you should make sure your cat is able to get to a cool area inside the house. Close blinds and curtains during the day to help reduce the heat in the house. Use air conditioning or a fan to keep cool air circulating.Never leave your cat in a hot room, such as an upstairs room with limited air flow, a hot attic, or a sunroom.

, Another way to help prevent heatstroke in your cat is to make sure they have plenty of water. Make sure the water is fresh and cool. This is important if your cat is inside or outside. Proper hydration can help your cat stay cool and help prevent heatstroke.Keep the water bowl out of the direct sunlight so it doesn’t get hot. Consider keeping the water in a cool, shaded place.
On very hot days, place ice cubes in the water to help cool it down.

, Some cats may be more prone to heat strokes. Cats with a shorter face and nose, such as Persians or Himalayans, may have trouble breathing and cooling their bodies. Old, young, or obese cats may also have more trouble in the heat. If you have any of these kinds of cats, you should make sure to take extra precautions to protect them from heatstroke.Cats with medical conditions may also be at greater risk for heatstroke. Cats who are sick, who have heart conditions, or who have trouble breathing can be more vulnerable.

Plant trees and bushes.,
Provide an outdoor cat shelter.,
Keep your cat indoors during the day.,
Cover the ground.",How to Protect an Outdoor Cat from Excess Sunlight2," If you have a yard where your outdoor cat lives, you should provide as much as shade as possible. The best way to do this is to give the cat plenty of green plants that they can hide away from the sun in. The cat will naturally rest in the shade if they become too hot or sunny.Avoid planting azaleas, lilies, yew trees, aloe, wisteria, elderberry bushes, or nightshade. These could poison your cat if eaten.If the outdoor cat wears a collar, you should make sure it is a breakaway collar so that it does not catch and strangle the cat on the plants.

, Outdoor cat shelters are great in the summer for protecting the cat from harmful UV rays, and they can also keep the cat warm in winter. These shelters can be bought premade online or at a petstore. You may also consider building one yourself.


Make sure that the shelter is well-ventilated so that the cat can breathe in summer time. You may want to choose one with mesh or wire sides so that plenty of air gets in. This is important because the cat can overheat in summer time if it is too hot inside the shelter.
For a simple, cost effective design, you can cut a cat-sized door out of a plastic storage bin. Keep the lid on to protect the cat from the sun, and remove the lid if you need to clean the shelter., If your cat lives both inside and outside, you may want to keep them out of the sun during the brightest parts of the day. This is usually between 10 AM and 4 PM. This will protect them from sunburn while making sure that they do not get heatstroke.You may still let them outside in the early morning or evening.

, On a bright day, direct sunlight is not the only risk they face. Surfaces covered in asphalt or concrete can quickly heat up, burning your cat’s paws and skin. If you live in area with large spaces of asphalt, concrete, or sidewalk, you may consider covering an area with a blanket, plant, wooden pallet, or dirt. This will allow the cat to lay outside without burning their skin from the hot ground."

Weigh your cat’s risk.,
Provide an outdoor water bowl.,
Watch for the symptoms.,
Pour cool water over the cat.,
Take the cat to the vet.",How to Protect an Outdoor Cat from Excess Sunlight3," Cats with flat faces, such as Persians or other exotics, are vulnerable to heatstroke because they cannot pant properly. Young, old, and overweight cats are also at risk.If you are worried about sunlight or heat with an at-risk cat, you may consider moving them inside for the summer, when they are most susceptible to heatstroke.

, Cats can become dehydrated in the heat. This is especially true if they have been out in direct sunlight for a long time. Put out a bowl of water for the cat. Change this water daily so that it is clean. This will help the cat hydrate throughout the day., Heatstroke can happen if the cat’s body temperature is above 104 degrees F (40° C). Cats can get overheated if they spend too long in the sun and heat. It is important to understand the signs of overheating so that you can save the cat before it is too late. These symptoms include:


Panting.
Wheezing.
Drooling.
Stumbling.
Collapsing.
Seizures.
Vomiting., If you notice symptoms of heat stroke in the cat, take the cat into a shaded area. Pour cool, but not cold, water over the cat. You can do this from a garden hose, a watering can, a sink, or a bathtub. Make sure that the water pressure is gentle and light. This will slowly bring the cat’s temperature down. Take their temperature every fifteen minutes until their body has returned to a safe range of 100.5 to 102.5 degrees F (38-39 C).You can take the cat’s temperature from their anus. It may take up to two minutes to get a reading.

, If the cat has signs of heatstroke, take them to a vet. Even if you have returned the cat’s body temperature to normal, you may want to check to make sure that they do not have permanent damage.On the way to the vet, you can stick towels soaked in cool (but not cold) water to their feet and belly area. This will help cool the pet while you are getting them help.

Place your fingers on top of the cat’s head.,
Place a pinkie finger and thumb under each ear.,
Apply firm pressure to restrain the cat.,
Scruff the cat as a last resort.",How to Immobilize an Injured or Frightened Cat2," Take the three middle fingers of your left hand and put them on top of the cat’s head. Rest these fingers gently on the cat’s head. Apply light pressure with the fingers., After you place your left middle three fingers on the cat’s head, place your left thumb and little finger directly under the cat’s ear. Then place your right thumb and little finger under the cat’s other ear., Once you have positioned your fingers on the top of the cat’s head and under each ear, apply firm pressure with your fingers. The pressure will help the cat relax, aiding your efforts to immobilize it., Scruffing replicates a mother cat picking up a kitten by grasping the skin on the back of a cat’s neck. This can immobilize a cat, but should only be used in certain circumstances and after other methods fail. For example, you can scruff a cat to trim its nail, administer medications, or to administer minor first aid.Never scruff a cat if you suspect a spinal injury.
Always make sure you support the cat’s weight with your other hand when you scruff a cat.

"
"
Splint injured limbs.,
Tape a cat with suspected spinal injuries to a board.,
Wrap a cat with a head injury in a towel.",How to Immobilize an Injured or Frightened Cat3," If your cat has a broken or injured limb, you should splint it before attempting to move or further immobilize the cat. Once you splint the limb, you should take your cat to the veterinarian for treatment. Keep the cat in a small room or puppy crate until the injury heals.

, If you think your cat has a spinal injury, you must seek veterinary care immediately. Find a sturdy board and gently lay the cat on its side on the board. Then use duct tape to secure the cat to the board., If your cat has a head injury, you should take it to the vet for a thorough examination. Use a towel to immobilize the cat prior to transporting it to the veterinarian."
"
Check for restless behavior.,
Look for cooling behavior.,
Notice symptoms of heat exhaustion.",How to Prevent Heatstroke in Cats2," If your cat is starting to suffer from heatstroke, they may start to act restless. This is because they are trying to find a cool spot to lay down. Watch your cat to see if they are moving around the house, unable to find a spot to settle.Your cat may try to find places by vents, under furniture, or in the shade.

, Your cat may exhibit behaviors that show they are trying to cool themselves. You cat may be panting or drooling. The cat may also have sweaty feet. The cat may excessively groom themselves to try to cool off.Cats only pet or sweat through their feet if they are trying to get rid of excess body heat.

, As your cat’s body temperature rises, they may start showing signs of heat exhaustion. This might include redness of the tongue or mouth, or a rapid pulse and fast breathing. They might also start stumbling or staggering as they walk.Your cat may start getting lethargic.
The cat may start vomiting or have diarrhea. Either may contain blood.

"
"
Move the cat to a cooler area.,
Try to lower the cat’s temperature.,
Take your cat to the vet.",How to Prevent Heatstroke in Cats3," If you suspect that your cat has heatstroke or heat exhaustion, you should try to lower the cat’s temperature. Immediately take your pet to a cool area. This might be inside in a cool house or car or in the shade. Remove the cat from the heat source or the sun.If you can, try to get air flowing onto the cat with a fan or an air conditioning duct.

, After your have removed your cat to a cooler area, you should try to lower the cat’s temperature. You can soak your cat with lukewarm or cool water. You can put them in a tub, sink, or pool full of water. You may also pour water over your cat’s body. Another measure you can try is to place cool towels on your cat’s stomach, head, and feet.Give your cat cold water to drink. If the cat won’t drink it, use a syringe to gently place water into the cat’s mouth. Make sure to only put a little water in the cat's mouth at a time. Angle the syringe to the side of the mouth instead of directly into the back of the mouth. If you squirt the water into the back of the mouth, the cat may choke.Place a bag of ice around the cat’s head and anus.Make sure not to use cold water on your cat’s body because it could cool their body too fast and lead to additional problems.If your cat’s temperature gets below 103 degrees Fahrenheit, they may be too cold. Watch the cat to make sure they don’t start showing symptoms of being too cold, like shivering.

, If your cat has suffered heatstroke, you should take them to the vet. The vet can take the cat’s temperature to get an accurate reading, and then they will help cool the cat down if they are not cool enough. The cat may also be given an IV of fluids.Even if you have lowered your cat’s temperature, it’s a good idea to take your cat to the vet to make sure they are fine and not in danger.

"
Make a plan.,
Inform all family members.,
Always bring your cat with you.,
Know how to find a scared cat.",How to Include Your Cat in a Disaster Preparedness Plan1," Think about what you will need to do and where you will need to go if you have to leave your home for any reason. Create a chain of command where one person is in charge of getting the cat, but others will be sure to check in case the appointed person is unable to complete the task.You should include a meeting spot outside the home in your evacuation plan. This will ensure that everyone knows what to do and where to go to keep everyone safe (including your cat).;
, Once you have your emergency evacuation plan in place, make sure all of your family members know what the plan is and what needs to be done to ensure your cat’s safety. Even the children in your home should be made aware of the plan.Everyone needs to be reminded from time to time about the emergency evacuation plan so that people (including children) can recall the information easily, even in the heat of the moment.

, If you are forced to evacuate your home, never leave your pets behind. This could be incredibly dangerous for your pets. Pets are unlikely to survive if they are left behind in a disaster situation.You may need to consider boarding your pets in emergency situations.
If you have absolutely no other recourse and must leave your pets at home, make sure they have access to drinking water. You can take the lid off the toilet tank and lift up the toilet seat.
Never leave your pet chained outside if you evacuate your home.

, It’s important to remember that your cat may run and hide in an emergency situation. This means your cat might not be very easy to find when you are trying to evacuate. Try looking under and behind pieces of furniture. If you can’t find the cat, try to lure it out with some of its favorite treats.

Pay attention to how your cat acts when it is scared at other times. Then you will have an idea about its go-to hiding spots in your home, which could speed up your search during an emergency.
If your cat hides under your bed when guests come over, it’s likely that your cat will also dart under the bed when it is scared during a disaster.

Watch for signs that your cat is in pain.,
Look for signs of lameness.,
Examine the injured shoulder and limb.,
Check to be sure your cat has not been bitten.,
Take your cat to the vet as quickly as possible.,
Place your cat in a box or crate to limit her movement until you can take her to the vet.,
Keep your cat in the small box or carrier for the trip to the vet.,
Do not attempt to bandage your cat’s shoulder.,
Dress your cat’s compound fracture with a clean bandage before taking her to the vet.,
Make sure the wound is healing well.,
Check the surgical site daily to be sure your cat is not scratching or chewing at the sutures or bandage.,
Give your cat vet-prescribed pain medications.,
Use cold therapy to reduce swelling for the first week.,
Confine your cat as directed.,
Buy an appropriately sized cage for your cat if cage rest is needed.,
Change your cat’s diet.,
Perform physical therapy with your cat.,
Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments with your vet.",How to Help a Cat with a Broken Shoulder," Pain is the first indication that something is wrong with your cat. Cats will try to hide their pain, but you can tell your cat is hurting if you know what to look for:Crying, howling, moaning or growling, particularly when touched
Failure to eat
Failure to groom
Pale gums or rapid breathing (may indicate you cat is in shock);
, When your cat sits, stands, or walks, she transfers her weight from the forelimb up through the shoulder. A cat with a broken shoulder is going to be very lame because her weight pushes up through the fracture site as she walks. Look for:Limping
Holding up the affected limb
Abnormal movement

, If you see bone sticking through the skin, your cat has suffered a compound fracture and should be taken to the vet immediately to prevent infection of the bone. Other signs of injury to look for are:Bruises or abrasions around the injured shoulder (especially common after a car collision)
Scuffed nails (suggests trauma may have occurred)
Swelling of the shoulder and leg
Your cat holding her leg at a strange angle (may indicate a leg or shoulder injury)

, A bite to part of your cat’s leg can cause lameness and tissue swelling — similar symptoms to those that occur with a broken shoulder. Always check your cat for bite marks before determining that the shoulder is broken.


If you find a bite wound, wash it with saline water and disinfect it before putting a bandage over it. Take your cat to the vet after you have found the bite mark.

, Shoulder injuries need urgent attention. While not life-threatening, your cat will be in severe pain and need relief. A shock powerful enough to break bones may have caused other damage that is not immediately obvious, such as internal bleeding, which can be fatal. Most shoulder breaks will require surgery to repair and immobilize the joint. Your goal should be to stabilize your cat so that you can take her to the vet as soon as possible.Compound fractures require surgery within eight hours. If there is bone sticking out from your cat’s fur, then she has sustained a compound, or open, fracture.This is relatively rare.
Most closed fractures should be treated within two to four days, but as shoulder fractures are rare without associated trauma, you should try to get your cat in sooner.Treatment will depend on where the fracture is located. If the joint is fractured, it will need to be repaired to prevent poor healing and early arthritis. This may be done with orthopedic wire, screws, or a combination of both. If the shoulder blade is fractured, then your cat may need only to rest for one to two months.
If you cannot immediately take your cat to the vet, you should call to receive instructions., Whether it is an open or closed fracture, movement will cause your cat pain and can aggravate the damage. You want to keep her as immobile as possible until you can get her to the vet., Again, the goal is to keep your cat as immobile as possible. Put a towel in the box or carrier to help keep you cat comfortable during transport.

, Dressing (covering with a clean cloth or gauze) is necessary for a compound fracture, but you should not try to bandage your cat’s shoulder in order to immobilize it, whether the fracture is open or closed. Immobilizing shoulders is very difficult, and your injured cat is unlikely to be in a cooperative mood. The struggles during bandaging will likely do more harm than any good the bandage might do., In the unlikely event that your cat's shoulder has a compound fracture, the goal is to cover the exposed end of the bone to prevent infection, not to create a perfect bandage. You can loosely wind sterile gauze around your cat to cover the bone, or simply drape the gauze or a clean cloth over it. Try to disturb the bone as little as possible.Do not try to push the bone back under the skin.
Take your cat to the vet immediately after covering the wound. The bone and wound will need to be sterilized, surgically realigned, and stitched up.

, An infection at the surgical site can be more dangerous than the break itself. Even if your cat does not undergo surgery, you still need to pay careful attention to her. If she seems unusually tired, strangely agitated, or fails to eat or drink, contact your vet. Also call your vet within four to six hours if you find:Swelling of the limb or the surgical site
A skin rash near the site of injury
Leakage or a bad smell at the surgical site
The bandage over the surgical site gets wet
The bandage is slipping from its location

, Chewing or scratching at the wound may reopen or lead to infection. If your cat is disturbing the surgical site, talk to your vet about getting an Elizabethan collar (cone) to prevent her from reaching the area., Your vet will likely prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug like meloxicam to deal with your cat’s pain, as well as perhaps an opioid for the immediate post-surgery period. Give the drugs as prescribed.WARNING: Never give human drugs to your cat, as many, such as Tylenol, are toxic to cats and may prove fatal., Apply cold packs or bags of ice wrapped in cloth to the injured shoulder for the first week after the injury to reduce inflammation, swelling and pain., Usually, this means “cage rest” – confining your cat to a crate with food and litter until the bone heals. Most shoulder breaks will take at least eight weeks to heal, though young cats may heal more quickly. Your cat will likely need to be confined to cage rest for at least a month, and usually for the full eight weeks.To keep your cat entertained, giver her plenty of toys and the occasional low-calorie treat. You can also take her out of the cage for daily grooming.Your cat will want to leave the cage to walk around before the time is up. You will want to let her. Don’t. Letting your cat use her injured limb before it is fully healed can delay healing, cause re-injury, or lead to a permanent limp. Continue to confine your cat as directed until healing is confirmed by x-ray.

, The cage you choose should be large enough that you cat has three to four inches above her head, and should be three to four inches longer than the cat when she is stretched out to her full length. These measurements will help to keep your cat comfortable while she recovers. However, the cage must not be so large that you cat can walk around, as this would defeat the purpose of the cage.The cage should also have enough space for a small litter tray, as well as food and water bowls.

, If your cat was sedated for surgery, you should feed her bland meat — fresh cooked chicken or white fish — for her next three meals. After that, choose tinned meats rich in protein to promote faster healing. Avoid jelly and gravy based cat foods, which are lower in protein, and which may upset your cat’s stomach.Also be sure to cut back the amount of food your cat gets each day to prevent weight gain during cage rest. Giving her the same amount of food may cause her to gain weight.

, If your cat does not use her injured limb for several weeks, the muscles will atrophy and healing will be delayed. To optimize recovery, your cat will need physical therapy both with a veterinary therapist and at home. Some exercises you can do at home include:Range of motion therapy — For the first month after injury, you will want to flex and extend the joints of the injured leg to maintain joint health. Ask your vet to show you how. The goal is to exercise the joint without pain, so at first, these movements will be small. As your cat heals, you will be able to move the injured limb more and more.
Massage therapy — After the first week, when most of the inflammation has subsided, massage the skin and muscles around the injured bone to prevent the build-up of scar tissue and to reduce pain. Your vet will recommend how frequently to massage your cat.

, If your cat has had surgery, the vet may need to remove the sutures. At the very least, he or she will want to take x-rays to assess healing so that you will know when your cat can safely return to normal activities."

Move any objects that your cat could knock against while seizing.,
Avoid touching the cat while he is seizing.,
Eliminate any outside stimulation.,
Move the cat to a safe location if he is in danger of falling.,
Contact your vet following the seizure.",How to Help a Cat with Epileptic Seizures1," To decrease the chance of the cat injuring himself during the seizure, look around for objects that he might thrash against. Try to move objects out of the cat's way rather than pick your cat up and remove him from danger. Touching your cat stimulates him, and in his neurologically sensitized state this could worsen the fit or extend its duration.


For example, if your cat experiences a seizure near a sharp table leg, put a cushion between him and the table to act as padding, rather than picking your cat up.;
, A seizuring cat is not conscious of what goes on around him. He lies on his side, his legs paddle and thrash, his jaw chomps, and he may lose control of his bladder and bowels. In this state the cat has no conscious control of his actions and could easily bite or scratch anyone who touches him.The only is exception is if the cat is in danger of falling, which is covered in Step 4 of this section.


Do not put your fingers near or in his mouth because the cat will bite down and not be able to let go until he recovers consciousness.

, Get everyone else to leave the room. It is normal to cry out when witnessing a beloved cat in the grip of a seizure, but this does not help the pet. To reduce the stimulation around your cat:


Turn off the television or radio.
Switch off electric lights.
Close the curtains.
Avoid the temptation to talk to and soothe the pet. Sadly, this is another form of stimulation and you are likely to do more harm than good, unless he is in danger of falling (which is described in the next step).

, While you should try to avoid moving or touching your cat during a seizure, the exception is if he is in danger of injuring himself.For instance, if your cat has a seizure whilst on a high window ledge use either a duvet cover, or a large, thick towel to cover and then pick up the cat. Doing this will hopefully protect you from accidental bites and scratches.
With the cat still inside the towel carry him to a safe place, such as a flat, open space, and gently put him down. Make sure his head is uncovered so he can breathe, and then step away.

, The average seizure lasts two or three minutes, and your priority during this time should be to keep your cat safe. Once the cat comes round, keep him indoors so that he does not wander off, and phone your veterinarian for further advice. If this is your cat's first seizure he will need to be checked over, and have blood work run to investigate any underlying reason for the seizure.


It will help your veterinarian to have a full description of the seizure. With this aim, try to note the start and end time of the fit.
If you have a phone handy, take a video of the fit so that the veterinarian can witness the event first hand.

Pack all the essentials.,
Bring a photo of your cat.,
Include a list of accommodations that allow pets.,
Know how to get your cat into its carrier.",How to Include Your Cat in a Disaster Preparedness Plan2," In case you have to evacuate your home for any reason, you should have an emergency kit packed with the necessities for your cat. This way, you can just grab it and be ready to go with your cat.You should include things like travel water and food bowls, a supply of your cat’s food, a bottle of potable water, any medications your cat may need, medical records, and a small litter pan with litter.
You will also need a pet carrier to transport your pet. You might want to consider putting all of the supplies in a box inside the pet carrier when you are not using it. That way, all of the things will be together and you’ll know where to find it when you need it.

, In case your cat gets lost, you’ll need a current photo of it. Even if you have quite a few examples on your cell phone, it will still be helpful to have an actual printed copy that you can show to rescue workers.Try to bring several copies of several different pictures.
Make sure the photos are current and accurately reflect what your cat looks like.

, In case you have to evacuate your home, you’ll need to go to a place that allows all members of your family – including your pets. It would be helpful to call some of the motels and hotels in your local area ahead of time to see what their pet policies are.Keep a list of hotels that allow cats with your emergency kit so that you’ll already be prepared and know where to go if an emergency were to actually happen.

, Most cats will not go willingly into a cat carrier, especially not when they are already stressed out. The best way to get a reluctant cat into a carrier is to place the pet carrier on its end with the opening facing the ceiling. Hold your cat gently underneath its front legs, with your other hand under the cat’s bottom. Then slowly lower the cat into the carrier.This method should help keep your cat’s legs and claws away from the edges of the carrier, which they often use to prevent you from pushing them inside.
After you have lowered the cat in, lock the door and lower the carrier into its correct position.

Prepare a safe room.,
Pack supplies.,
Bring your cat to the safe location.,
Look for your cat outside.",How to Include Your Cat in a Disaster Preparedness Plan3," If you need to stay home during a disaster, like a hurricane or tornado, you should prepare a safe space in your house for all of your family members to gather. This includes your pets. In most emergency situations, you should choose a location that is in the most central part of your home, away from any windows that could break and harm you. You should also go underground if possible – if you have a storm shelter or basement.If you can’t go underground, try to bring a heavy mattress down to your safe room that you can huddle under.

, Think about the things that you may need once the disaster is over and put those in the safe room. You should bring some lanterns and flashlights – all with fresh batteries. You should also pack some bottled water and food supplies. Additionally, bring all of the things that your cat will need to survive, such as cat food, medication, leash, and collar.Ideally, you can just grab your cat’s emergency supply kit and bring it with you to the safe location.

, When it’s time for your family to go to the safe location in your home, it’s also time to bring your cat to the safe spot. Put your cat in its pet carrier and take it with you to your chosen place.

Never just try to hold your cat during an emergency situation. You can pet the cat inside the carrier to soothe it, but you need to keep the cat inside the carrier so it doesn’t escape outside in case a window breaks.

, If your home is damaged in a disaster and your cat has escaped outside, you need to go look for the cat as soon as it is safe for you to do so. Once the danger has passed, go outside and begin searching the perimeter of your home. It is likely that your cat stayed nearby.Bring some treats with you so that your cat can smell its favorite food.
Call your kitty’s name gently around your home so that your cat can respond to your voice.
Try looking in nooks and crannies of any rubble that may be around outside. Cats like small tight spaces that make them feel more secure.

Place a rescue alert sticker in your front window.,
Provide your cat with an identification tag.,
Get a pet tracker.",How to Include Your Cat in a Disaster Preparedness Plan4," Rescue alert stickers inform rescue workers about any pets living in the home. Simply fill out the sticker with the number of animals in your home and place it on or near your front door.They are usually static-cling stickers that list several different species of animal (dogs, cats, birds, or other) and allow you to indicate how many of each you have inside the home.
You should be able to acquire a rescue alert sticker at your local pet store or veterinarian’s office.
If you can’t find one in person, you can definitely order these stickers online., For your cat’s safety, it is essential that you make it wear an identification tag at all times. That way, if there ever is an emergency, your cat will be easily identifiable by its collar tag.You should include your cat’s name and your phone number on the tag. You may also consider adding your home address.
You should also consider microchipping your cat as an additional form of identification. If your cat gets stuck and breaks out of its collar, the microchip will still be in place.

, There are many varieties of devices that attach to your pet’s collar and use GPS technology to track their location. Consider using one of these devices so that you can find your cat if you get separated during an emergency or disaster situation.Even if you don’t use the tracker all the time, consider attaching it to your cat’s collar when inclement weather is approaching.

Use phenobarbital to prevent seizures.,
Give your cat diazepam to prevent seizure clusters.,
Understand the side effects and risks associated with these medications.,
Do not give these medications to cats with liver conditions.",How to Help a Cat with Epileptic Seizures2," Most of the anticonvulsants used in dogs are either ineffective, or toxic, to cats. However, phenobarbital has been shown to be effective and safe. The medication works to keep your cat from experiencing seizures.Phenobarbital is available as a tablet or syrup, and is generally administered two, or in some cases three, times a day.
The starting dose of phenobarbital is 1 to 2mg per kg, twice a day. Thus, an average-sized cat requires 1.7 milliliters (0.06  fl oz) of 15 mg/ml phenobarbital elixir twice a day.
Some cats seem to break phenobarbital down unusually quickly, in which case dosing three times a day is advised.

, Clusters, or groups of seizures, come about because the first seizure creates a pathway in the brain that makes it easier for another one to follow along behind the first. Diazepam works by slowing down brain activity so that it is less reactive, making it more difficult for the electrical activity associated with a seizure to build.After a seizure, the easiest way to administer diazepam is as a rectal suppository, or insertion, where it is rapidly absorbed across your cat’s rectal mucosa. The dose per cat is one 5 mg dosing syringe.

, The immediate side effects include sedation, and increased appetite and thirst. The sedation should wear off after a few days as your cat’s body acclimatizes to the new medication.


If the sedation does not wear off in a few days time, call your vet right away.

, Phenobarbital is deactivated by the liver and should never be given to cats with liver disease. This is because if your cat’s body has a reduced capacity to metabolize phenobarbital, the drug could build up in your cat’s system and become toxic. If your cat is experiencing this, he may seem overly sedated, have difficulty walking, or act like he has been drugged.Diazepam is considered controversial because in rare cases the drug can trigger fatal liver failure. This is an idiosyncratic reaction, which is another way of saying scientists haven't got to the bottom of why it happens.

Consider keeping the cat indoors.,
Switch the cat to a gluten-free diet if you think it may help.,
Schedule veterinary appointments for your cat every three months.",How to Help a Cat with Epileptic Seizures3," An epileptic cat that climbs trees or patrols his territory is potentially vulnerable to seizures at inopportune times. If he lost consciousness and fell from a high branch, he could seriously injure himself. In the same way, if he was to become incapacitated during a territory dispute, he would be rendered defenseless. With this in mind it is wiser to keep the cat indoors.

, There is no scientific evidence that diet plays a role in causing epilepsy in the cat. However, there are anecdotal accounts of cats that stopped having seizures when they were fed a gluten free diet. One theory is that anti-gluten antibodies act directly on and are uniquely toxic to the brain. In human medicine, wheat gluten receptors have been shown to trigger opioid receptors in the brain, which in turn triggers seizures.


Since cats are carnivores it can be argued that they are not equipped to deal with wheat in their diet, and thus more likely to form gluten antibodies. If the cat is otherwise healthy, it would do no harm to put your cat on a complete, balanced diet that is gluten free, low in carbohydrate, and high in protein.

, If your cat experiences seizures and is put on medication, you should consider getting him assessed by a vet more frequently than you would a healthy cat. In particular, it is important that you vet runs blood tests to check and make sure that the liver handling the medication alright.

No matter what, it is important for you to stay calm while tending to her.Animals can notice a person’s fear or anxiety. Since the cat may already be distressed and in pain, you do not want her picking up on any anxiety or panic that you may have.;
, Even if it is your own cat, you should still be on guard to protect yourself from getting bitten or scratched. Animals that are afraid or in pain can be unpredictable and even dangerous,so even the sweetest cat in the world could lash out when in pain. If the cat is conscious, it may help to talk to her in a soft and soothing voice as you walk towards her.

, As much as the cat will allow, look her over to determine what kind of care she will need. Be gentle when you examine her, since she may be in a lot of pain, or just very uncomfortable. If she seems particularly agitated or aggressive, stop your examination.Some injuries will be obvious, such as leg fractures, bleeding wounds, or burn marks.
If the cat has swallowed something poisonous, she may be drooling, panting heavily, or vomiting.In some serious cases, the cat may not be breathing due to choking or shock.
Your examination does not have be extensive or take very long. The quicker you can look her over, the quicker you can help her and call for more help.

, Even if a veterinarian is not nearby, or the veterinary office is closed, you still have the option to call an emergency veterinary clinic. Although your main responsibility is to give the cat first aid, you will still need to get her to a veterinarian as soon as possible. First aid should not take the place of veterinary care.Calling an emergency veterinary clinic will let the staff know what kind of care the cat will need and allow them to prepare accordingly.When you call for help, try to provide as much information as you can about the situation, including the cat’s breed and age and the nature of her injuries or illness.
If the cat has ingested something poisonous, call the Animal Poison Control Center., Before helping the cat, gather some basic supplies, such as 2x2 gauze, clean towels, and some mild soap. Other supplies include a pet carrier (or strong cardboard box), blanket, and a muzzle.You can find many of the cleaning supplies at your local pharmacy. If you are not able to go to a store, you will need to work with what you have on hand.
If you do not have an actual cat muzzle, you can use a necktie or a pair of nylon stockings., One of the best things you can do to help a cat when no veterinarian is around is to keep her warm, calm, and comfortable. Restraining her is a good way to do this. You can wrap the cat in a bag or warm towel, but only if you do not think she has a fractured limb or spinal injury.If you wrap the cat in a bag or towel, make sure she has room to keep her head out and breathe comfortably.Place the muzzle (or makeshift muzzle) around her mouth to keep her from biting you. Do not use a muzzle if the cat is vomiting.You could also just drape a towel over head to keep her calm.If she has a fractured limb or potential spinal injury, lay her on a flat surface, such as a sturdy and flattened cardboard box.

, If the cat has a minor bleeding wound, there are a few things you can do on your own to slow the bleeding. Apply direct pressure to the bleeding wound with a few pieces of clean 2x2 gauze (or a towel if you do not have gauze). Apply this pressure for about 10 minutes.Do not lift the gauze to check to see if the bleeding has stopped. This could disrupt the blood clots and start the bleeding all over again.If the blood soaks through the initial set of gauze, add more gauze on top.Lifting up the original gauze would dislodge the clot.
Do not spend a lot of time trying to slow or stop the bleeding.If the blood is coming from a major wound and is continually soaking through the gauze, get the cat to an emergency veterinary clinic as soon as you can.

, If the cat has wounds, you can probably determine whether the wounds are superficial (minor cuts or scrapes) or major (visible bone or muscle). You can clean superficial wounds on your own with some mild soap and water. Dampen a clean towel with lukewarm water and soap and gently clean the wound.Do not use hydrogen peroxide to clean a wound, since it can cause tissue damage. Even worse, hydrogen peroxide can enter the bloodstream and cause fatal internal blood clots.Try to clean out any debris from the wound.
Do not try to clean a major wound.This type of wound requires immediate veterinary care.

, Burns are typically very painful. Unfortunately, they usually get worse before getting better and can make a cat susceptible to infection. Sources of burns include fire, caustic chemicals, and electricity.Burns are treated differently according to the source of the burn. For example, chemical burns are treated by flushing the wound with lukewarm water for 15 minutes. Thermal or electrical burns require the use of a cool water compress.If you are not sure what caused the burn, do your best to keep the cat calm and comfortable in general and transport her to an emergency veterinary clinic as soon as you can.
Even if you cannot identify the burn source, there are certain things you should not apply to a burn wound: ice, butter, or ointments.If the burn wound has blisters, do not pop them. Also, do not try to remove any skin or hair that has gotten in the wound., Just like in people, choking can be a very serious situation in cats. If a veterinarian is not immediately available, you will need to help the cat stop choking. If the cat is still conscious, try to find and remove the object causing the choking. Remember that a choking cat is probably panicking and may bite you.Use tweezers or pliers to remove the object if you can see it. However, doing this can actually push the object further down. If you are not able to remove the object, get the cat to an emergency veterinary clinic immediately.If the cat is unconscious, perform the kitty Heimlich: place your hands on each side of her rib cage and apply firm, quick pressure to her rib cage three to four times to force the object out of her throat.Repeat this until the object comes out.If you can successfully perform the Heimlich, you will need to resuscitate your cat to get her breathing again after the choking incident.If you are not able to get the foreign object out, whether the cat is conscious or unconscious, get her to an emergency veterinary clinic as soon as possible.

, In emergencies when there is no veterinarian around, you may need to breathe for the cat, known as rescue breathing. She may not be breathing because due to choking or a serious injury that has put her into a state of shock (e.g., weak pulse, pale gums, cool extremities).Breathing for the cat will help stabilize her before getting her to a veterinarian.


Breathing for your cat is also called ‘mouth to nose resuscitation.’
Reach into the cat’s mouth to remove anything that could be blocking her airway (e.g., saliva, foreign object), and pull her tongue out of her mouth.To perform rescue breathing, hold the cat’s mouth closed, blow into her nose, and watch her chest to rise and fall with each of your breaths.Breathe into the cat’s nose at a rate of 20 times per minute., If the cat is still not responsive after you have cleared her airway and performed rescue breathing, you may want to try CPR on her. To do this, lay the cat on her right side. With one hand, place your fingers on one side of her chest and your thumb on the other.Squeeze your thumb and fingers together to compress her chest about one-half to one inch.Compress her chest about 100 to 150 times per minute.Give the cat one breath per four to five seconds of chest compressions.Remember that your attempts at resuscitating the cat are only a stop gap until you can get her to an emergency veterinary clinic.

, If you know the cat has swallowed something poisonous, your first thought may be to get her to vomit. This may be a good idea in some cases, but some poisons can do more damage on the way back up the throat. Your best bet is to call the Animal Poison Control Center before inducing vomiting in the cat.Do not use syrup of ipecac or hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting.When you call the animal poison control center, provide information about what you think the cat may have ingested and the symptoms she is showing. If you can, provide details about how long it has been since she ingested the poison and how much she ingested.Follow the instructions you receive about how to treat the cat at home. Ultimately, you should take her to an emergency veterinary clinic for further examination and treatment.

Observe symptoms.,
Avoid inducing vomiting.,
Take your cat to the vet immediately.",How to Handle Nicotine Poisoning in Cats1," Early symptoms of nicotine poisoning are hyperactivity/acting overexcited, agitation/restlessness, disorientation, constricted pupils, excessive drooling/salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and panting or having trouble breathing. This may occur within 15 to 20 minutes of ingesting a tobacco product.More advanced symptoms include twitching, tremors, seizures, muscle weakness, coma, collapse, increased heart rate and cardiac arrest. These symptoms can occur within 15 to 90 minutes of ingesting a tobacco product.;
, Try to avoid doing this, especially if you think the poisoning is due to the ingestion of e-juice from e-cigarettes. Since the e-juice is absorbed through the mucous membranes in your cat’s mouth, inducing vomiting is ineffective., Do this once you are aware that your cat has been poisoned. Do not try to treat your cat at home first. The successful recovery of your cat depends on rapid medical treatment. Therefore, the sooner your cat can get professional medical treatment, the better.If you do not have a vet, then take your cat to the nearest veterinary hospital, or call the Pet Poison Helpline at 1-800-213-6680 (U.S.) or 01202-509-000 (UK).

The vet may do this if you think your cat has been poisoned by ingesting a tobacco product like cigarette/cigar butts or nicotine gum/candy., Activated charcoal helps absorb traces of nicotine in your cat’s gastrointestinal tract. This aids in the elimination of nicotine from your cat’s system., To help flush out the nicotine in your cat’s system, the vet will place your cat on an IV. This is a routine procedure no matter how your cat has been poisoned, whether it was through ingestion or absorption., If your cat is having trouble breathing, then the vet will give it oxygen. An oxygen mask will be placed on your cat’s face to aid in breathing., The vet will give your cat medications to decrease its blood pressure and slow its heart rate. If your cat is experiencing tremors or seizures, then medications will be given to help manage and control these as well., The vet will want to monitor your cat for at least four hours. The vet will monitor your cat's blood work to ensure that damage to its internal organs, like its liver, has not occurred.If damage to your cat's internal organs has occurred, it may have to undergo surgery to ameliorate the damage.
After 16 hours, your cat’s body should be free of nicotine.

Notice if your cat gets lost.,
Watch for aimless walking.,
Monitor for blank staring.,
Watch for any difficulty getting through the house.,
Notice any other signs of disorientation.,
Determine if your cat's medication causes disorientation.",How to Help a Disoriented Cat1," Aging cats or cats with medical problems may get confused and disoriented in familiar places. They may look around like they’re not sure where they are, or not know where they are going, even though the place is very familiar to them., Another symptom of disorientation in cats is walking without a purpose. Your cat may wander around the house or yard without any direction. You may find them pacing around rooms., Cats who are disoriented may stare off into space without really looking at anything. This is different than actively watching out the window. The cat may also just stare at an object without moving., Cats who are disoriented may end up being unable to navigate their way past things in their way. They may stand in front of a chair or wall and not be able to figure out how to move past or over it., Your cat may also become disoriented in other ways. They may not be able to do normal tasks, like find their food bowl and eat or use the litter box. They may eliminate in the wrong area.Some disoriented cats may start meowing more than usual or at unusual times.

, Some medications may cause disorientation in your cat. Some antibiotics used to treat ear infections may lead to disorientation.Some anti-vomiting medications may cause dizziness and disorientation.Some anxiety medications can also lead to confusion in cats.If your cat takes any medication, read the side effects to check if disorientation is a side effect. If your cat is experiencing side effects, contact your vet immediately to see if another medication is available, or if they have suggestions for symptom management.

Veterinary care is important for both solving and diagnosing essential oil poisoning, since there are a number of other conditions that could produce similar or identical symptoms., In the event that your vet’s office is closed or your vet is unavailable, contact your local pet poison hotline. This service is available 24 hours each day and is used by pet owners and vets alike. The hotline will be able to give you advice and directions that could help you save your cat.To contact the pet poison helpline in your area, run a search like “pet poison helpline” for the number in your preferred search engine.
The pet poison helpline may have a different name in your area. For instance, in the U.S., the helpline is called the Animal Poison Control Center Phone Number. In the U.K., the helpline is called the Animal PoisonLine.
The personnel of the poison helpline may wish to know the type of essential oil your cat ingested (if known).

, Unless otherwise directed, do not use activated charcoal or attempt to induce vomiting in any other way. Doing so might actually harm your cat., Your vet will probably need to analyze your cat’s blood before making a decision about what to do next. This involves drawing your cat’s blood, then checking it for enzymes produced by the liver and kidneys. The degree to which enzymes from these organs are present or absent will allow your vet to identify how compromised your cat’s health is, and select the best course of action., Depending on which oil your cat ingested and the quantity that was consumed, your vet might recommend anti-vomiting medication, medications to protect the stomach, pain medication, and/or medication to protect the liver. If your cat has ingested essential oils or had them applied to their skin, medicine to relieve inflammation and irritation may be necessary.Your doctor will advise you regarding which medicine to give your cat, and in what quantity.

, If your cat came into direct contact with essential oils, you or your vet might wash the cat to remove any residual essential oil from its skin. Using a medicated anti-inflammatory shampoo or skin treatment might also be in order.Medicated shampoos generally work the same as regular ones do. Simple wet your cat in a tub, apply a small dab of shampoo to its fur, and gently scrub it into a lather. Rinse the cat off, then pat dry with a soft towel.

Keep a constant routine.",How to Help a Disoriented Cat2," Disorientation can be a sign of a potential medical problem. If your cat appears more disoriented than usual, they should be evaluated by a vet as soon as possible. The vet will give your cat a physical examination to check for any conditions, such as blindness brought on by high blood pressure, that may affect their cognitive function.You will probably have to provide a detailed history, including information on how long this behavior has been going on. The vet may ask for specific examples of how your cat acts disoriented.

, If your cat gets disoriented and doesn’t know where you are, they may start meowing loudly. They may pace around a room or become confused. To help your cat, you can come into the room to let them know you are still there.You can also just talk to them from another room so they can hear you and know that you are near.

, Some cats may become disoriented in the dark. They may not know where they are, or become disoriented because everything is so quiet. To help your cat figure out where they are in the dark, quiet house, leave lights on or get some nightlights.Make sure to put nightlights near the litter box so your cat can easily find it. You may also want to put lights near the cat’s food and any cat furniture.

, Rearranging furniture can cause disorientation for cats that cannot see well and use touch and memory to navigate their environment. Keep furniture as consistent as possible. If it must be rearranged, do so while your cat is in another room. Then, introduce them to the rearranged room and help them navigate as they learn the new layout.

, If your cat gets really disoriented during the day, or especially at night, keep them near you. You can take the cat with you as move from room to room during the day. At night, take the cat into the bedroom and provide a comfortable place to sleep.If you put the cat in your room at night, make sure there is a litter box in there, too.

, Keeping your cat active can help their brains and may lessen some of the disorientation. Buy your cat new toys or try to engage them with their favorite toys. Play with them around the house by encouraging them to chase, climb, or move.Don’t change what you do too much. Extreme changes to your cat’s everyday life can cause them to become even more disoriented.

, You may be able to help your cat’s cognitive function by giving them different food. Foods that contain antioxidants, omega-3s, and certain vitamins may help improve your cat’s memory and brain function.Don’t change your cat’s diet without discussing it with your vet first. Get recommendations about new foods from them.

, Keeping your cat in a smaller area of the house can help if they are disoriented. Giving the cat a few rooms to roam around can help keep the areas familiar and keep them from getting confused.Block off stairs so the cat can’t go upstairs or into basements.
If you have a very large house, consider blocking hallways or doorways into other parts of the house.

, Some disoriented cats may get nights and days confused, especially when they are older. This can lead to disorientation for the cat because they are sleeping all day and staying awake at night. Help the cat by keeping them awake during the day.If you see the cat sleeping, gently wake them up. Interact with them throughout the day, carry them from room to room with you, and talk to them so they will stay awake during the day.

, Cats who get easily disoriented benefit from routine. This includes feeding and sleeping schedules, along with play times.

Determine if your cat has escaped outside.,
Look for your cat near to the house.,
Check in places the cat can hide.,
Use wildlife cameras and humane traps.,
Wait for a few days.,
Try to find the owner if you find a disoriented cat that isn't yours.",How to Help a Disoriented Cat3," Some cats become disoriented when they escape from their territory. This may be an indoor-only cat who has gotten outside, or an outdoor cat who has escaped from their owner when not in their territory. Being out of their territory can make them scared and disoriented., Cats who get out from their home generally are very close to their territory instead of far away. They generally find somewhere to hide as soon as they exit their territory. This means they may be very close to your home, but don’t realize it because they are disoriented.Start looking for your cat by making your search radius near to your home.

, Out of their territory, cats will hide in places where predators cannot find them. The disorientation will lead your cat to find somewhere safe to hide. Start by looking for the cat under decks, porches, houses, and cars.


You also may want to look in thick wooded areas or areas with plants that will conceal the cat.
Check any hole, corner, or crevice your cat can fit. The cat probably won’t meow to protect itself, so you will have to look for them.

, A good way to help your disoriented cat return home is to recapture them with a humane trap. Humane traps are tripped when the cat enters it, and a door closes that contains the cat so you can bring it home. You can place bait in the trap to entice the cat into the trap.Wildlife cameras can be purchased online, at outdoor retailers, or some pet stores.
Humane traps can be found online, through local shelters, or at pet stores.

, Some disoriented cats may come out of hiding after a few hours, but others may stay well hidden for days. If your cat is a skittish cat, it will take them longer to come out. This means that even if you set up a humane trap or wildlife cameras, you may not get any activity for a few days., You may come across a scared, disoriented cat in your yard. If this occurs, try asking around the neighborhood about any lost cats. Most cats stay close to their home when they have become disoriented.If no one in your neighborhood or a nearby neighborhood has lost a cat, contact the local Humane Society and animal shelters. Owners with missing pets often contact shelters to see if someone has reported any found pets.
Look for missing pet signs. Many people put up signs about their missing pets. Check around your area for any fliers or posters.
Post on social media. Most towns and communities have Facebook discussion pages, so check if your area has one where you can post the information about the found cat.

Understand what tapeworms are.,
Look for white, rice-like objects in the cat's fur.,
Bring a sample to the vet for testing.,
Know that a cat with a flea infestation is highly likely to have tapeworms.,
Understand that hunting cats are more likely to develop tapeworm.",How to Treat Tapeworm in Cats1," As the name suggests, tapeworms are long flat worms. They can reach up to 60cm in length, and are a creamy-white color with flat segments along their length.


The tapeworms attach firmly to the lining of the bowel wall, so it is unusual to see an adult worm unless the cat has had a worming treatment.
It's much more common to see tapeworm egg packets on the cat's fur, especially near the anus.;
, When a tapeworm reproduces it fills special segments, called proglottids, which contain thousands of tiny eggs.


The adult tapeworms shed these egg packets into the bowel lumen where they migrate out of the cat's anus.
The proglotids are about the size of a grain of rice and a similar shape. If you see a white rice-like object on the cat's fur then it is highly likely he has tapeworms.

, If in doubt, stick the egg packet to a piece of sellotape (tear of a 6 inch length of sticky tape, and touch the adhesive side to the object, then stick the tape to a piece of card) to show to your veterinarian.

, There are two types of tapeworm that commonly infect the cat, and these tapeworms have different intermediate hosts. Dipylidium caninum (the most common cat tapeworm) uses fleas as its go-between.


Cats with fleas are likely to develop tapeworm as immature fleas feed on tapeworm eggs in cat feces. The tapeworm hatches and develops inside the flea (the intermediate host), and when the cat grooms and swallows the flea, her digestive juices crack open the fleas body and release the larval form of the tapeworms.
Thus, regular flea control is essential to prevent and control tapeworm in the cat.

, The second most common tapeworm, Taenia taeniaeformis, develops its larval stage inside rodents such as rats and mice. Therefore, hunting cats are more likely to be infected with this type of tapeworm.


Rodents infect themselves with the larval form of tapeworm when they eat plants contaminated by cat feces containing tapeworm eggs. The tapeworm burrows into the rodents muscles and when the cat hunts and eats the infected rodent, she infects herself with tapeworm.
Thus, hunting cats need to be wormed regularly, ideally every month.

Look for a lack of coordination.,
Monitor your cat for tremors.,
Check your cat’s temperature.,
Look for skin irritation.,
Look for eating troubles.",How to Handle Essential Oil Poisoning in Cats2," If your cat has been poisoned by essential oils, it might not be able to walk properly. It might trace a crooked line across the floor, weaving this way and that as if inebriated. In less pronounced cases, you might notice a general slowness of motion or an apparent lack of energy., Your cat might shake or shiver in response to poisoning. In serious cases, essential oil poisoning in cats can cause seizures – an extremely violent case of uncontrollable shaking., When you observe tremors in your cat, they may or may not be linked to a reduction in its core body temperature. Use a pet thermometer to take your cat’s temperature if you notice it shaking.Your cat’s normal body temperature is about 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).

, Another symptom of essential oil poisoning in cats is redness and irritation of the skin. This is especially coming when the cat in question had essential oil applied to its skin. You might also note swelling, bumps, or redness on the lips, tongue, and gums., If your cat throws up, it could be due to essential oil poisoning. If the vomit stinks of the essential oil the cat was recently exposed to, odds are that you’re dealing with a case of essential oil poisoning.A less extreme symptom related to digestion might be a sudden disinterest in eating or a poor appetite."

Keep your essential oils out of your cat’s reach.,
Limit your pet’s exposure to essential oils.,
Avoid oils containing polyphenolic compounds.",How to Handle Essential Oil Poisoning in Cats3," Cats are natural explorers. But if your cat ingests, inhales, or otherwise comes in contact with concentrated essential oils, the poisoning that results will be swifter and more serious. Therefore, lock your essential oils away in a high, out-of-the-way cabinet that your furry friend is unlikely to get into.If your essential oil bottles exude a significant scent even without being sprayed, place them in a resealable plastic bag, then stash them in your locked cabinet.

, If you spray essential oils in a room, place your cat in another room and do not allow it to enter the space where you sprayed the essential oils until the scent has dissipated. To prevent the possibility of low-level buildup, do not use oils for more than two weeks at a time. Wait at least one week before resuming your use of essential oils.Use these same rules for liquid potpourri, hydrosols, scented cleaning products, and other concentrated sprays.
You can accelerate the dissipation of essential oils by opening a window or turning on a fan.

, Cats are especially sensitive to essential oils containing polyphenolic compounds (or “phenols”). These include oils like:Thyme
CitronellaClove
Eucalyptus
Birch
Cinnamon
Melaleuca
Wintergreen / peppermint
Tea tree
Lemon

Purchase a tapeworm product that contains the ingredient praziquantel.,
Understand how praziquantel works.,
Identify some products that contain praziquantel.,
Give the cat an appropriate dose of the tapeworm treatment.",How to Treat Tapeworm in Cats2," The most widely used pharmaceutical that is effective against tapeworm is praziquantel. This is the active ingredient in the majority of good tapeworm products.


Although praziquantel is the only ingredient that can kill tapeworms, several products are combined with another ingredient which works against roundworms, so the treatment covers the full range of worm infections.

, Praziquantel paralyzes the tapeworm, causing it to release its grip on the bowel wall. The dead worm is then passed out through the feces.


Praziquantel causes paralysis by making the phospholipid integument (skin) of the tapeworm permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions.
A massive influx of calcium ions paralyses the tapeworm's primitive nerve system, so the worm's suckers let go of the bowel wall and it is passed out., For many years the only products containing praziquantel were Drontal tablets and the Droncit injection. However, other products are now available including Milbemax tablets, and a spot-on product, Profender, which is applied to the skin on the back of the cat's neck. A summary of these products is listed below:



Droncit injection: Contains praziquantel and is solely effective against tapeworms (no efficacy against roundworms).

Drontal tablets: Contains praziquantel against tapeworm and pyrantel which is effective against roundworms

Milbemax tablets: Contains praziquantel against tapeworm and milbemycin against roundworms.

Profender spot-on: Contains praziquantel against tapeworm and emodepside against roundworms.

, The dose of praziquantel orally is 5mg/kg body weight. Tablet sizes are conveniently manufactured so that an average sized cat weighing 4-5kg requires a single tablet.


This dose kills the tapeworm present in the cat at the time of dosing, but has no lingering effect should the cat re-infect herself the following day.Approximately 2% of cats have mild side effects after oral dosing, which include sickness, diarrhea, or reduced appetite. However, all the products listed above have a wide safety margin.

"
Prevent the cat from hunting.,
Treat your cat for fleas.,
Treat your cat against tapeworm at least every three months.",How to Treat Tapeworm in Cats3," Hunting and eating vermin is a source of tapeworm infection, and stopping a cat from hunting is an excellent way of preventing infection with the taenia species of tapeworm.

, The other source of infection are fleas. The cat and all other animals in the household should be treated with an effective product as directed on the manufacturer's guidelines.


There are many products available, but those proven to be the most effective are those containing fipronil (Frontline, Frontline Plus, and Efipro) as well as selamectin (Revolutions US, Stronghold UK,).

, Tapeworm egg packets are a sign of active infection and any cat shedding egg packets must be wormed.


Likewise, if your cat acquires fleas, you should use a product effective against tapeworms at the same time as treating the fleas. Cats that hunt should be treated monthly.
Current veterinary advice is to worm all cats at least every 3 months with a product that is effective against both roundworms and tapeworms.

They are about the size of a sesame seed, with an elongated oval body, like a grain of rice but smaller, and have three pairs of tiny legs.The lice scavenge sloughed skin cells and like to anchor themselves to hair shafts near the skin’s surface so they should be easy to look for by moving your hands through your cat’s fur.

, The adult louse lays these along hair shafts. To the naked eye they look like tiny white glistening specks stuck to the hair. They can also look like white dust but if you try to comb them out you will find they are tightly glued onto the hair shaft., Look for the adult lice or their eggs which will be glued onto your cat’s hair and will be easier to see than adult lice as they don't move away., Fipronil is a pharmacy controlled product so you can buy it over the counter from certain pharmacies. Products containing fipronil include Frontline and Effipro. Fipronil works by interfering with an insect neurotransmitter that is not present in mammals, which causes paralysis and death of the louse.


Apply this product once every 30 days. Treat all cats that may have come into contact with lice so they do not act as a reservoir of infection., Selamectin is an active ingredient in Revolution (US) and Stronghold (UK). It works by interfering with the louse's neurotransmission, causing it to become paralyzed and die.This is a prescription product so a veterinary surgeon must prescribe this medication for your cat.
Though products containing fipronil and selamectin are not licensed to treat lice infections as there is no licensed product, they are widely acknowledged as being safe and effective at killing lice., The back of a cat’s neck would be a good option.


Part the cat’s fur with your fingertips so that you can see the skin and apply the product there.
Allow to dry for two to three hours before stroking the cat, otherwise you risk wiping the product off.

, Spot on products are designed to produce a micro-fine layer of active medication over the surface of the cat's skin, so don’t over apply it.


If you want to improve the appearance of the cat’s coat, wait two days after applying the product to give the adult lice a chance to die. Then, comb the cat’s coat to remove the dead lice.
The eggs need to hatch out before they will die, so repeat the combing weekly until the comb is clean for two consecutive weeks.

, Combing only works if you get right down to the skin, and if the cat is badly matted the tangles need removing. Cats most likely to pick up lice are those who live rough or live in unclean conditions, and these are the cats most likely to have knotted coats.


If the cat only has an occasional tangled knot of fur then try snipping the knots out with scissors. Always take care to only cut the cat’s fur and keep the scissor’s blades away from the skin so it doesn’t nick the cat’s skin.

, The cat may need to be sedated because the knots tug on the skin and are uncomfortable, and many cats will not tolerate having the mats touched.

, This is a drug free way of trying to eliminate a louse infestation. You can use a comb that is similar to those used on children to manage head lice.


This method takes extraordinary patience and dedication, and it is all too easy to miss a part of the cat where lice are hiding, such as their armpits or groin.
This is also a time consuming method as it takes hours to properly comb through a cat, not to mention that it is a rare cat who will not lose patience after a few minutes.

,, It helps to have a damp cloth or towel to hand to wipe the debris, nits and lice from the comb between swipes.

, If the cat is fidgety but not aggressive or overly anxious, then holding the scruff of their neck in one hand, or better having an assistant hold the cat's scruff will make it easier to comb them.


If the cat is acting aggressively, combing is probably not a good option. There's a good chance you will get injured, and also it is very unlikely you will be able to do a thorough enough job and get all of the lice.

, One major drawback of shampooing lice away is that once the cat’s coat is dry there is no residual action of the active ingredient. This means there is nothing on the coat to kill future lice that hop on, so if the cat goes back onto dirty bedding there is nothing to stop her becoming reinfected immediately.The use of shampoo has largely been superseded by products that are more effective and easier to use, such as spot-on treatments.
In the days before spot-on treatments, the shampoo commonly used against lice was seleen. Seleen is a thick green shampoo that contains selenium sulphide. This chemical decreases excess skin cell shedding and food for the lice. But it is not licensed for use in cats so use Seleen on your cat at your own risk., Most cats dislike baths and being shampooed. Cats that do like bathing are probably show cats and the least likely to pick up lice in the first place, by virtue of their pampered lifestyle., Gather the necessary materials, such as towels, medicated shampoo, and a jug to pour the water.

, The water should reach the cat's elbows or just below their elbows. Pour warm water over the entire cat, taking care not to get it into her ears or eyes.


If necessary, put cotton wool in her ears to protect them.

, Repeat this process until the whole cat is shampooed.


If possible, leave the shampoo in the cat’s coat for 10 minutes to allow for the maximum effect before rinsing.
Rinse the cat well with plenty of fresh warm water and then towel dry the cat.

, Wash the cat’s bedding as well as any other bedding in the room and spray any soft furnishing such as sofas and beds with an insecticidal spray suitable for killing flea eggs and larvae, such as RIP Fleas or Staykill.Always use these sprays in a well ventilated room and remove any reptiles, birds, or fish from the room to avoid toxicity.
Leave the room uninhabited for two hours after spraying to allow any lingering aerosol to settle out of the atmosphere so that it doesn’t get breathed in by you or by your pets.

Determine if the cat is dead.,
Do not attempt to move the cat.,
Call your local animal control agency.,
Contact your vet.,
Report the cat’s injuries to an animal shelter.,
Contact the owner.",How to Get Help for a Cat Hit by a Car1," When a cat is hit by a car, it might be rendered unconscious and in need of medical attention. However, it might also be dead. To determine the status of the cat, look for signs that it is breathing.For instance, you could monitor the cat’s flank. If the cat is lying on its side, its flank will slowly rise and fall as is breathes in and out.
Alternately, place a tissue in front of the cat’s nose. If the tissue moves forward and away from the cat’s nose, the cat is breathing in and out.
Finally, pinch one of the cat’s rear toes lightly. If the cat pulls away, it is alive.
If the cat’s body is stiff when you touch it, it is dead.;
, If the cat is rabid – and even if it is not – it might harm you, especially in its injured and fearful state. Instead, wait for qualified personnel to arrive.In some cases, qualified personnel might urge you to bring the cat to them, especially if the cat is unconscious. However, do not move the cat until contacting qualified personnel.

, The animal control agency can best determine how to help a cat hit by a car. If you can’t contact them (for instance, if you’ve encountered the injured cat outside of normal business hours), call the police. Explain the situation to the police calmly and clearly.For instance, you might say, “Hello. I’ve found a cat that has been hit by a car at . The animal is still alive and needs help. Please send an animal control officer to this location. I will remain here until help arrives.”

, If you can’t contact the animal control agency and the police will not help, contact your vet. Vets are specially trained to help cats that have been hit by cars or suffered similar traumatic injuries. Your vet will work hard to help your cat heal.Even if you are not a pet owner yourself (and therefore do not have a vet of your own), you might still know of veterinary clinics in your vicinity. Take the cat that was hit by a car to the nearest such clinic.

, If you don’t know of any vets in your vicinity, or if the animal shelter or rescue organization is closer to the location of the injured cat than the vet, report the cat’s injuries to the animal shelter first. Animal shelters or cat rescue organizations have the staff and facilities necessary to help a cat hit by a car. They might direct you to take the cat to them, or contact the cat’s owner., When a cat is his by a car, its owner will want to know. You might be able to contact the cat’s owner by checking for a collar. Cat collars often have tags with information about the cat, including its name, the name of its owner, and the number and address where the owner can be reached. Use this information to get in touch with the owner.Even if the cat does not have a collar and tags, it might still be possible to contact the owner if the cat has been microchipped. However, there are no visible signs differentiating a microchipped cat from one that is not microchipped. Take the cat to a rescue organization or animal shelter to determine if the cat has been microchipped.

Pay attention to your cat’s breathing.,
Pay attention to your cat's energy levels.,
Look for seizures.,
Watch your cat’s liquid intake.",How to Handle Mothball Poisoning in Cats1," One of the most common reactions to mothball poisoning is vomiting. All cats vomit from time to time, and you'll know your cat's behavior best. But if you notice your cat vomiting more than usual, take it to the vet immediately., If your cat is acting strange, check their breath. If you smell a mothball type scent - a sickly sweet smell - they’ve probably ingested mothballs. You should take your cat to the vet immediately if you smell this scent on your cat's breath., If you notice that your cat has pale or brown gums, they may have mothball poisoning. Discolored gums can also be a symptom of other illnesses, so you should take your cat to the vet if you notice this., If you notice your cat is having trouble breathing, they might have mothball poisoning. Signs of labored breathing include breathing with their neck fully extended or wheezing. These can also be symptoms of other serious illnesses and if you notice them, you should take your cat to the vet immediately., If your cat is lethargic - playing less than it usually does, for example - it might have mothball poisoning. Lethargy can also indicate something else is wrong, so take your cat to the vet if you notice it is lethargic., If your cat starts having seizures, take it to the vet immediately. It may be a sign of mothball poisoning, but it could also be a sign of serious neurological issues., If you notice that your cat is drinking a lot more water than usual, they might have mothball poisoning. It can cause your cat to become dehydrated, or to feel like they flush the toxins out."

Ensure your house is escape-proof.,
Discourage darting.,
Use a leash when taking your cat out.,
Make indoor life enjoyable.,
Neuter or spay your cat.",How to Get Help for a Cat Hit by a Car2," Cats are escape artists, and can easily slip through cracked windows or doors. Therefore, don’t leave windows and doors ajar. When you enter the house, close the door quickly and tightly behind you., If your cat tends to dart toward the door when you leave, get a friend or family member to hold the cat before you exit. Alternately, squirt your cat with water just before leaving. You might also choose to provide your cat with a puzzle feeder just before making an exit., Cats are fast and can easily end up far away when chasing other creatures they encounter outside. To prevent your cat from racing off, only take it out with a leash and collar., If your cat is comfortable indoors, it will have little motivation to go outside. Provide plenty of toys for your cat, and play with it regularly. Provide a cat house or perch for your cat to lounge in. Keep litterboxes clean. With a healthy, happy cat, you’ll discourage escape behavior., If your cat is neutered or spayed, it will have much lower urge to roam and find a mate. Plus, neutering and spaying makes cats less quarrelsome and can reduce their likelihood for certain diseases.Cats can be safely neutered or spayed at about six month of age.

Look for the signs of heartworm disease.,
Take your cat to a veterinarian.,
Understand the difficulty of diagnosing heartworms.,
Understand the limits of treatment.,
Control symptoms.,
Treat associated diseases.,
Prevent heartworm disease.,
Be especially diligent with prevention in warm, humid climates.,
Keep away from mosquito infested areas.",How to Treat Heartworm Disease in Cats," There is a full spectrum of symptoms, from no signs at all to sudden, unexpected death. Indeed, the signs of heartworm infection are quite general and can be attributed to many other causes, which makes diagnosis tricky.


Typical signs include: rapid breathing, coughing, lack of energy, poor appetite and weight loss.Some cats also develop fluid in the belly, and experience dizziness or fainting episodes when moving around.Asthma type symptoms are common, as is gagging, retching, vomiting and diarrhea.;
, If you suspect heartworms, or your cat is experiencing a combination of the general symptoms of the disease, get your cat looked at by a veterinarian. For a disease like heartworms, only a veterinarian's tests can give a specific diagnosis.


It's important to get your cat looked at, even if your suspicions turn out false. This will assure that if your cat is sick, it gets treatment.
The veterinarian confirms the diagnosis by looking for worms within the heart using a cardiac ultrasound. A skilled ultrasound operator can visualize the actual worms in the cat's heart and positively confirm the infection.

, Diagnosis can present a challenge in cats, for a number of reasons. Firstly, cats are resistant hosts, meaning it is unusual to detect large numbers of heartworms circulating in the blood stream. This means a negative result when looking at a slide of cat blood under the microscope does not necessary represent a clean cat.Secondly, the heartworm antigen blood test is specific to detecting female worms. If the cat has a population of adult male worms, or only one or two adult females are present, the test may show a false negative.
Thirdly, the blood tests looking at the body's immune response to the presence of heartworm can throw up false positives. These can occur if the cat was once infected but the worms have subsequently died. However, a positive test is an indicator of at least, previous infection, and so an antigen test for the presence of female heartworms should be run., There is no proven treatment for heartworms and there is no drug licensed as safe in this species to kill heartworms. In addition, dead or dying worms can cause anaphylactic shock reactions or sudden death due to obstruction of vital blood vessels. Unfortunately there is a big chance that your cat will not survive, and the drug that is used to treat dogs cannot be used for cats.


In Japan, the current treatment is surgical extraction of the heartworms from the major blood vessels. This technique is still being refined, and remains a high risk strategy for the time being., Controlling any symptoms of heart or lung disease with the use of diuretics and ACE inhibitors is the cat's best option. Diuretics decrease the amount of water in the body, which reduces pressure in the blood vessels and in the heart.ACE inhibitors also decrease blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels.Corticosteroids may also be used to reduce inflammation in the lungs and control allergic reactions to the worms that die naturally.
In the majority of cases it is a matter of sitting tight and controlling any symptoms arising due to compromised heart function.

, For example, in addition to heartworm disease, the worms harbor a bacteria called Wolbachia. This bacteria can cause blood poisoning and organ damage. This bacteria can be killed by long courses of antibiotics from the tetracycline family., Prevention is by far the most desirable option. There are a variety of effective products that are licensed for this purpose in cats. They should be given or applied to your cat year round.Giving the medicine to your cat year round will assure that you are in the habit of giving it in the months when the cat is most at risk.


These preventatives include: selamectin (Revolution), milbemycin (Interceptor or Sentinel), and ivermectin (Heartgard and Heartgard Plus).

, A preventative should be used all year round but is essential in warm, humid weather. This is because an unprotected cat can be infected through mosquito bites, and mosquitos are most prevalent in warm, humid climates., Prevention is important when the cat lives near standing bodies of water, which encourage mosquito reproduction.Eliminate standing water in your yard. The promotes mosquito breeding.
Don't let your cat outside when mosquitos are at their most active, in the early morning and in the early evening."

Watch for skin and ear twitching.,
See if the cat is drooling excessively or vomiting.,
Watch for muscle tremors and seizures.",How to Diagnose and Treat Pyrethrin Poisoning in Cats1," If your cat has gotten too much of a pyrethrin-containing insecticide on its skin and is suffering from a relatively mild case of pyrethrin poisoning, it will exhibit signs of twitching or muscle contractions. Specifically, these will likely take the form of: cats flicking or twitching their ears, shaking or flicking their paws, or contracting the muscles along their abdomen.Symptoms of pyrethrin poisoning typically begin to appear immediately after a cat has encountered the chemical. However, in some cases, symptoms can take up to 72 hours to emerge.;
, If the cat has ingested pyrethrin, it will not exhibit twitching symptoms, but you may notice the cat drooling heavily (this is known as hypersalivation). Depending on the amount of pyrethrin the cat has ingested, it may also vomit several times. Cats who have ingested pyrethrin can also have symptoms of diarrhea.It’s not uncommon for cats to have insecticide applied to their body or neck and, in the process of grooming themselves, ingest the pyrethrin.
In these cases, cats may exhibit symptoms both of twitching and vomiting.

, In severe cases of pyrethrin poisoning, cats will exhibit uncontrollable bodily muscle tremors, which may turn into seizures. If left untreated or prolonged, these seizures can cause severe brain damage in your cat.If you cat experiences a seizure as a symptom of pyrethrin poisoning, rush it to an animal hospital immediately.

Cats with severe cases of pyrethrin poisoning can also have trouble breathing.Some may show signs of temporary blindness.Severe pyrethrin poisoning in cats, if left untreated, can be fatal.

Take your cat to the vet immediately.,
Take the package or remaining mothballs with you to the vet.,
Order x-rays.,
Order blood work.,
Order a blood transfusion.,
Administer IV fluids to your cat.,
Administer other medications.,
Ask your vet to perform a gastric lavage.,
Schedule follow up blood work.",How to Handle Mothball Poisoning in Cats2," If you suspect your cat has mothball poisoning, don’t delay in getting it treatment. You should take your cat to the vet immediately., If you have the original packaging of the mothballs, take it with you to the vet. This can tell your vet if they are made out of naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene. While both types can harm your cat, they are treated differently. The packaging can help your vet decide which course of action to take.If you no longer have the packaging, take one of the mothballs with you instead. The vet can identify them by seeing if they float in salt water. Naphthalene balls will sink while paradichlorobenzene will float., Your vet might recommend an x-ray for your cat. This allows them to make sure there are no other mothballs anywhere else in your cat’s system., This allows your vet to check for any damage caused by the mothballs. This can include anemia, or liver or kidney damage. To fully cure your cat of mothball poisoning, your vet needs to know what other issues have been caused by it., In very serious cases, your cat might need a blood transfusion. This will more completely flush out the toxins in your cat’s system. Your vet will recommend this if they believe it’s necessary., If the mothballs have done damage to your cat’s kidneys, your vet might order a round of intravenous fluids. This treatment would need to take place in your vet’s office., Depending on the severity of your cat’s poisoning, and how long it’s been since it ingested the mothballs, your vet might prescribe medication. This can include anti-vomiting medication, anti-seizure medication, and medication to protect your cat’s liver., A gastric lavage is a medical procedure wherein your vet “washes” your cat’s stomach. Your cat will need to be placed under anesthesia for this procedure, and it can be expensive. This is usually used in cases where the poisoning is severe., After your cat has been treated, you might want to schedule additional blood work. This allows your vet to check that status of your cat’s liver and kidneys and make sure there isn’t lasting damage."

Rinse your cat with cool water.,
Wash your cat with grease-dissolving dish soap.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian immediately.,
Bring the insecticide packaging with you.",How to Diagnose and Treat Pyrethrin Poisoning in Cats2," If your cat is suffering from pyrethrin poisoning, pick it up and carry it to a nearby sink or bathtub. Immediately begin running cool water into the basin, and place the cat under the stream so it gets thoroughly wet.Although cats are notorious for their dislike of water, if a cat is going through pyrethrin poisoning, it will be too weak to struggle.

, Squirt some grease-dissolving dish soap onto your cat’s fur, and lather the cat with soap. Wash your cat’s fur and skin thoroughly, focusing most closely on the area where you applied the pyrethrin-containing insecticide.Bathing your cat will remove some of the pyrethrin from its body and reduce the risk of death. Then, rinse the soap and towel your cat dry.

A bath will only help your cat if it has had a dangerous amount of pyrethrin-containing insecticide applied to its skin. If your cat has ingested pyrethrin, and this is the cause of the pyrethrin poisoning, a bath will do no good.

, Once you’ve washed some of the insecticide off of your cat, take it to your veterinarian. They will be able to assess the extent of the neurological damage done to the cat. The vet will need to diagnose your cat, and will likely question you regarding when and if your cat had access to pyrethrin-containing insecticides. The vet will then recommend a course of treatment following the diagnosis.In some cases, your veterinarian may advise to take your cat straight to an animal hospital, rather than bring it to the vet first.
If your cat experiences pyrethrin poisoning after hours or on a weekend or holiday, you’ll need to take it directly to an animal hospital.

, To better assist your veterinarian in making their assessment and diagnosis of your cat’s pyrethrin poisoning, bring the box or bottle of insecticide medication with you. Without access to the medication and its packaging, your vet will not know the exact percentages of pyrethrin in the insecticide.Also tell your vet all pertinent information about how the cat became poisoned: if the cat ingested some of the medication, or if the cat had an excessive amount of the insecticide applied to its skin.

Give your cat only cat-specific pyrethrin products.,
Ask your veterinarian if an insecticide is safe for cats.,
Keep cats away from household pesticides.",How to Diagnose and Treat Pyrethrin Poisoning in Cats3," When looking for a pyrethrin-based insecticide to give your cat, make sure that you choose a medicine made for cats. This will have a lower level of pyrethrins than a medicine designed for dogs, due to cats’ higher sensitivity to the pyrethrin. These medications will have low enough levels of the chemical that your cat will not risk being poisoned.Dogs have a naturally higher tolerance for pyrethrins, and so their insecticides tend to have much higher percentages of the chemical. Insecticides for dogs can contain from 45 to 60% pyrethrins, while products for cats contain less than 0.01%., If you’re not sure whether or not a pyrethrin-based insecticide can safely be applied to your cat, ask your veterinarian. It would be wise to seek your vet’s recommendation for insecticides before you go shopping for them, to avoid potentially purchasing a pyrethrin-based product that is unsafe for your cat.The sales staff at your local pet-supply store may be able to help you as well, as they should have a good knowledge of which insecticide products are meant for dogs and which for cats.

, Because pyrethrin is so effective at killing all varieties of insects, it’s used in many organic pesticides. Check the informational label on any household pesticides that you may have. If they contain pyrethrins, be sure to shut them in a cabinet or cupboard that cats cannot access. Also avoid spraying these pesticides on indoor plants that cats have access to.If you’ve sprayed outdoor plants (e.g. part of your garden) with a pyrethrin-based insecticide, keep your cats from this area. Cats can lick the chemical off of plants and contract pyrethrin poisoning.
Pyrethrin can be found in many professional-grade insecticide sprays. If you’ve had a pest-control company spray your house to prevent insect infestation, contact the company and ask if their pesticide contains pyrethrins.

Bathe newborns in dish soap to remove fleas.,
Remove fleas manually.,
Ask your vet about safe products for older kittens.,
Comb kittens frequently with a flea comb.",How to Treat Fleas in Young Kittens and Nursing Mothers1," Topical flea medications are poisons that kill fleas when absorbed through your pet's skin. Usually, you would apply a topical medication between a cat's shoulder blades or on the back of the neck. Within a certain time frame, the medication would begin to kill fleas. These medications are usually safe to use on nursing mothers and should not affect your kittens. However, they can be very dangerous to young cats. Only use topical medications to treat fleas on the mother.Make sure to talk to your vet about a safe medication for a nursing mother. While many medications, such as Frontline Plus, are safe to use on nursing mothers, other brands may carry risks.
It may be necessary to separate the mother and kittens for a set time after administering the medication. Talk to your vet beforehand.;
, Harsh chemicals are not safe to use on young kittens, especially newborns. Instead, you can gently bathe newborns using a dish soap. Choose a mild dish soap that does not have antibacterial properties.Fill a sink with warm water and soap. Take your kitten and immerse it to its neck in the water. Use a cloth to gently wet the kitten's face, but make sure to stay away from the eyes.Remove the kitten from the water and massage the soap into its skin. Then, submerge the kitten up to its neck again to rinse it.
Make sure to dry your kitten with a warm towel when you're done. You should also keep the kitten in a warm environment until it's completely warm.

, After a bath, you should strive to remove fleas manually when you see them. Fleas may run to the kitten's head or neck during the bathing process, so remove these fleas with tweezers or your fingers while drying your kitten. Drop the fleas into a cup of hot water to kill them after removing them from your kitten., Kittens older than four weeks may be able to take oral medications to treat fleas. This can be helpful as such medications can kill fleas in several stages of their lifespan. However, you should never administer medication to a kitten without consulting your vet first. Kittens are more fragile than adult cats and even older kittens may react poorly to medication.Oral medications are usually given once a day to kill fleas and start to work fairly quickly.
Some kittens older than six weeks may be able to tolerate topical medications once a month. However, such medications can be very dangerous if your kitten is not healthy enough to tolerate them so talk to your vet before administering such medications.

, A flea comb can be an effective tool to treat fleas in young kittens, especially if your kittens are still too young for medication. Comb the the kittens each day with a flea comb. Remove fleas you see with your fingers or tweezers. Set these fleas aside in a bowl of hot water to kill them.Talk to a vet first to make sure you choose a healthy, safe flea comb for your kittens.

If possible, take fresh stool from your cat’s litter box on the day you are going to the vet. Wear gloves when you handle the stool and place it in a plastic bag with a seal. If there is litter in the stool, that’s okay. Try to get a sample that has as little litter on it as possible.Seal the stool sample in a plastic bag and carry it with you to the vet. Try to get the sample to the vet as soon as possible, as it is best to test it fresh.;
, If you cannot get a stool sample from your cat on the same day as your vet appointment, you can take a sample the night before. Use gloves to pick the stool out of your cat’s litter box. Then, place it in a sealed plastic bag and refrigerate it. Make sure you do not put the stool sample next to any open food containers or fresh foods.If you want to be extra careful, double bag the stool sample and put it on its own shelf in the refrigerator.
Make sure you label the bag “stool sample for vet” so anyone who finds it in the refrigerator knows what it is.

, Bring the stool sample in a plastic bag to your vet’s office for testing. Try not to keep the sample out of the refrigerator or in a warm car for too long as this can make it more difficult to test the sample properly.You may schedule a vet appointment in advance and collect the sample the night before or the same day as your appointment. Then, transport it to the vet’s office.

, Once you have transported the sample to the vet, allow the vet to take the sample for testing. Your vet may do a direct smear, where they smear some of the sample on a glass slide and examine it in a microscope. They may also do a flotation test, where they float the sample in a solution to determine if there are parasites present.Your vet may be able to do the testing in their office in a matter of a few minutes.
Sometimes, samples need to be sent to a laboratory for more elaborate screening for parasites. This could take days to weeks.

, The testing of your cat’s stool sample will help your vet determine if your cat has any parasites. The most common parasites found in cats are roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms. They live in your cat’s small or large intestine.Your vet may also notice giardia and coccidia, which are parasites that are found in water that is contaminated with bacteria. Your vet may require further testing on your cat if giardia is detected.
Your vet will also tell you if your cat’s sample came back negative, with no parasites or abnormal organisms found.

, If your cat tests positive for parasites, your vet will prescribe the appropriate treatment. Often parasites can be treated with a course of medication and lifestyle changes.Common medications given to cats for parasites include piperazine, fenbendazole, and pyrantel pamoate.
Your vet may also require a second sample for testing after your cat has been treated to make sure the parasite is gone. Schedule a follow up appointment with your vet to check that the medication worked and your cat is parasite free.

, To prevent your cat from contracting parasites, keep its litter box clean. Do a weekly cleaning of your cat’s litter box and replace the litter often. Remove any stool in their litter as soon as you can and dispose of it. Always wear gloves when touching your cat’s stool.Pay attention to how often your cat uses its litter box. Often, if the litter box becomes too dirty, cats may be less likely to use it. It may be time to clean the litter box if your cat is not using it often.

, To ensure your cat does not get exposed to parasites, try to keep it indoors as much as possible. Cats can contract parasites like giardia and coccidia from drinking contaminated water outdoors. They can also get roundworms or hookworms from coming in contact with objects that have these parasites or from other animals who have these parasites.If you are going to let your cat outside, supervise them at all times.
Keep your yard clean so it does not become a spot for parasites. Mow the lawn, trim all plants, and remove any clutter before you let your cat out into your yard.

, Have your vet perform tests on your cat’s stool several times a year to ensure it does not have any parasites. Schedule regular tests on your cat so any parasites are caught early and treated right away. Your vet may be able to recommend a testing schedule for your cat to ensure they remain healthy and parasite-free.

Fasten on a flea and tick collar.,
Feed or inject a long term product.,
Clean your environment thoroughly and often.,
Rinse your cat with a dip treatment once a month.",How to Protect Your Cat or Kitten from Parasites1," Use an effective, veterinarian recommended product that is appropriate for the age of your kitten. Be aware that different spot on products contain different active ingredients, not all of which are effective or safe.


Apply the product to the back of the cat’s neck where they can’t reach it to rub off. This is usually a good method for any cat, but if it proves ineffective or the cat manages to get it off, then you should consider using another product--the flea collar method, spray, or shampoo.This is a very common way to prevent flea infestations in your cat. These products usually last for a month. These products may kill combinations of external parasites like fleas and ticks or just one variety. Check the label to be sure.
Common ingredients in these products for cats include etofenprox, imidacloprid, selamectin, metaflumizone, or fipronil. Popular brands include Advantage II, Bio Spot-Spot On, Frontline, and Revolution. Avoid products containing permethrins.;
, You can use a spray can or pump bottle. Choose an effective product recommended by a vet that is safe for the age of your kitten. Keep in mind that these treatments contain different ingredients and they are not all safe or effective.


Do not spray the product on your cat's face. To apply the spray/pump product to the face you should spray the product first onto a standard cotton ball. Then dab the coated cotton ball around the cat’s eyes and ears.
Don’t soak the cat with the product, but make sure you coat all areas of the animal. This is a good method for cooperative cats, but if they don’t like it, you might try the collar or topical method.The pump bottle may be a better idea as the spray can has a hissing sound that may alarm the kitten or cat.
Make sure you’re in a well ventilated area.

, Choose your shampoo carefully. Some shampoos claim to kill external parasites but they do not actually do so - they just drown them! Also, some of the stronger shampoos may be toxic to young kittens or excessively drying on a cat's skin or coat.


To shampoo your cat, lather the shampoo over the entire body of the kitten or cat. Leave the shampoo to set for at least 10 minutes before rinsing it off. Avoid the eyes and ears of the cat.
Shampooing is good for cats that have a more extensive flea issue, and don’t mind bathing. If they resist, then you should try another method--the collar, shampoo, or topical treatment.Shampoos usually are designed to get rid of existing external parasites, but the shampoo will not continue to work after it dries and therefore the cat may quickly become reinfected.

, To know if the collar is fitting correctly you should be able to slip in two fingers between the collar and cat’s neck. Use scissors to cut off any excess portion of the collar once it’s fitted correctly so the kitten or cat doesn’t chew it. Look at the area under and around the collar periodically for signs of irritation. If you notice a problem then you probably need to use another product such as the topical or shampoo.These can be effective if your kitten or cat is cooperative and you can get the right fit. Usually these last several months.
Avoid collars with the following ingredients: amitraz; permethrin; organophosphates on cats.

, The Program product contain an inhibitor to insect development. There is a tablet that can be given once a month (for dogs or cats), and an injection for cats that is good for six months.Program is only a preventative measure. It will not kill fleas already present and it will not kill internal parasites.

, Eliminating fleas from the surrounding area is essential to stopping them from bugging you and your kitten or cat. Clean the carpets, cushioned furniture, and cracks and crevices in the floor to suck up any eggs and live fleas. Throw away the vacuum’s bag and/or wash out its canister. Use cat-safe insecticides around the house, on furniture, and anywhere your cat may wander. Keep your cat away from sensitive areas like food preparation locations in the kitchen, baby cribs, and the outdoors.You need to do this in conjunction with any of the other preventative methods you may be trying.

, Apply the rinse in a well ventilated area and according to the specific directions given by the manufacturer and your veterinarian. These are a little less common and will involve soaking the entire cat. If your cat isn’t cooperative with bathing, then you probably want to avoid this method and try the collar or topical method.Avoid getting the flea and tick rinse in the cat’s eyes or ears. You may want to put cotton balls in the cat’s ears and ophthalmic ointment (eye ointment) in the eyes for irritation just in case.
There may be excess residue from the rinse so clean your hands and surrounding area thoroughly.

Feed your cat commercial cat food.,
Apply or feed heartworm medication to your cat.,
Test your kitten’s or cat’s feces at a veterinarian’s office.,
Clean litter boxes often.,
Protect your kitten or cat from toxoplasmosis by avoiding raw food.,
Keep your pet inside.",How to Protect Your Cat or Kitten from Parasites2," This will cut down on the chances of parasites getting into the diet.Most commercially prepared kitten or cat food will be balanced for nutrition to help the cat’s natural health. These foods are also more likely to be screened against parasite eggs in the mix. Using raw food, making the cat food yourself, or introducing foreign additives risks parasites or parasitic eggs being ingested. Raw food as a high risk of exposing the cat to intestinal parasites and toxoplasmosis.

, Testing and preventative medicine are the only way to eliminate heartworms from occurring in cats. Have your veterinarian test your kitten or cat first to make sure they are not already infected before putting them on a preventative measure.Once a heartworm infection occurs there is currently no way to eliminate their presence completely with treatment. There are a number of preventative medicines you can give to your cat orally or topically.
Invermectin (Heartgard) is given monthly by mouth to a cat starting at minimum aged 6 weeks. This medicine also treats some intestinal parasites. Milbemycin oxime (Interceptor) is also given monthly by mouth to a cat at least 6 weeks old and weighing at least 1.5 pounds. This medicine also treats some intestinal parasites. Selamectin (Revolution) can be applied topically once a month to the cat’s skin starting at age 8 weeks. This medicine also treats some intestinal parasites, and external parasites like fleas and ear mites. Moxidectin with Imidacloprid (Advantage) is applied once a month topically to a cat’s skin once the cat reaches 9 weeks of age and weighs at least 2 pounds. This medicine also treats some problems with intestinal parasites, and fleas and ear mites.

, A fecal test can determine if intestinal parasites like roundworm, cryptosporidium, or coccidia are present.Testing and medication can help control the spread of intestinal parasites like roundworms. But once they are present then treatment and isolation can take several courses to prevent spreading. If you have multiple cats or other pets then the infected kitten or cat needs to be completely isolated until the veterinarian tells you they are clear. Even then it can take several prescription treatments to thoroughly de-worm the kitten or cat. Quarantine should include the infected pet’s food, water, and litter box. Humans can be infected by these parasites so use caution and extreme care with cleanliness. The best prevention is to keep a clean environment for your kitten or cat. Check the cat’s water for cleanliness, inspect food for signs of spoiling, and make sure the cat isn’t eating fecal matter.
Many of the medicines in the previous step used for heartworms also may help control intestinal parasite infections. Check their packaging. There is no known prevention medication for intestinal parasites at this time.

, In addition to regular changing of litter material in boxes you want to make sure the fecal matter Is properly disposed of. Have the discarded litter material incinerated, flushed, or removed from the house quickly. Don’t let other pets use the litter box. Use boiling water to clean the litter box itself.Toxoplasma gondii (t. gondii) is mostly found in North America. It can infect almost any warm-blooded animal, birds, and even humans. Toxoplasmosis can be passed from a pregnant woman to her unborn child and result in a miscarriage or birth defects. Cats are the primary hosts of t. gondii. It tends to be transmitted through contact with the feces. The oocysts (immature eggs) of t. gondii can survive for years outside the body and resist many disinfectants. Initial infection of t. gondii in cats occurs often with ingestion of infected raw meat or prey (uncooked pork or a mouse). Kittens can be infected at birth or by drinking the milk of an infected mother.
This will help avoid exposure to toxoplasmosis and intestinal parasites.

, Feed it commercial cat food instead of raw ingredients or bones. Don’t let your cat scavenge in garbage, roam outside where they could eat or hunt items unsupervised, and/or drink unpasteurized milk.This also helps protect against intestinal parasites.

, This is an overall protective measure for your kitten or cat to reduce the chances for internal parasitic infections.


Keeping your cat an indoor cat will make it less likely your pet will hunt wild prey or eat something raw out of your supervision. Indoor kittens and cats can also be more easily kept away from other infected animals. If your cat needs treatment then they will be more used to staying inside. This will make treatment easier.

Adult fleas are very small, less than 1/8 inch long. They're reddish-brown insects and they don't have wings, but they can still jump very high.Fleas' bodies are laterally compressed, so their bodies are wider from back-to-belly than they are from side-to-side.;
, Take a fine-toothed comb and comb your cat's hair from back to front. Look at the skin for flea bites. Since fleas must bite in order to feed on blood, their bites will leave behind red, broken skin. You should also look for flea dirt, or poop. Once you've combed your cat, shake the flakes and specks of dirt out of the comb onto a white paper towel and add water. The flea dirt will become reddish brown, because it's made of digested blood. This is another sign that your cat has fleas.If you are unsure if your cat has fleas, take her to your veterinarian. The veterinarian can identify the fleas and prescribe treatments to get rid of the parasites.
Check your cat closely if she's been outside or somewhere where she may have been exposed to fleas (boarding facility, groomers, friend's house, motel, etc).

, The vet will make sure that you choose a safe and effective product. You should also purchase flea treatments directly from your vet, since some of the medications sold at pet stores can be dangerous for cats. Topical ""spot-on"" products are available to treat fleas, as well as oral medications.Let the vet know if there are any small children or pregnant women in the home. This is an important factor in determining the safest course of medication for both you and your pet.

, You may have several options when it comes to choosing a topical flea treatment. Many of these monthly treatments should be used year round as a preventative treatment. Make sure that the product you choose is labeled for cats and not dogs. Cats can get very sick (or even die) if they are treated with a flea medication that is meant for dogs. “Spot-on” treatments are applied directly to your cat’s skin to kill fleas quickly. Some common flea medications include:Dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen (known as Vectra): This product only kills fleas. Be sure not to get a similarly named product, Vectra 3D, which is a product for dogs. Vectra 3D contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats.Fipronil and (S)-methoprene (known as Frontline Plus for Cats): This product kills flea larvae, eggs, and adult fleas. It also kills ticks and chewing lice.Imidacloprid and pyriproxyfen (known as Advantage II): This product kills fleas of all life stages. Be sure not to get a similarly named product, Advantix II, which is a product for dogs. It contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats.Selamectin (known as Revolution): Apply this once a month to kill adult fleas and their eggs. It also kills ticks, heartworms, ear mites, and sarcoptic mites. Be aware that Selamectin is not licensed as a product to kill ticks. It only has partial success with some ticks, and is not effective against Ixodes, which is the species which carries Lyme disease. If ticks are your main concern then speak to your veterinarian about more effective methods of control, such as a Seresto collar or Frontline., If you're only trying to treat fleas and not ticks, you might think about giving your cat oral treatments, which may come as liquid suspensions or tablets. Oral products usually act quickly and don't leave any residue on your cat's fur. They're only available through your vet, who can recommend the best product for your cat. Many of these monthly treatments should be used year round as a preventative treatment. These medications may include:Lufenuron (known as Program): This comes as tablets, an oral suspension liquid, or injections. Give this medication with food once a month to kill flea eggs and larvae.Nitenpyram (known as Capstar): This comes as a pill. Give it to your cat according to your veterinarian's directions to kill adult fleas and their eggs.Spinosad (known as Comfortis): This comes as chewable tablets, which you should give your cat with food once a month to kill fleas., Generally, you'll need to hold the applicator upright to keep it from spilling and open it according to the instructions. Spread the fur on your cat's neck (at the base of the skull or between the shoulder blades) to expose the skin. This way, your cat won't be able to lick the medication off when grooming. Turn the applicator upside down and squeeze all of the medication into a single spot directly on the skin. Make sure to get it on the skin and not just the fur. Check the applicator to make sure it's empty.Always read the product label for complete instructions, since they are different for each medication.

, Although different tick species have different characteristics, most ticks have an oval-shaped body with a small head. They're usually reddish brown, dark brown, black, or grey in color. Ticks are generally no bigger than 1/4 inch long and some species may be much smaller. Note that fully fed females can dramatically swell up to 1/2 inch in size when they're full of blood.Unlike fleas, ticks aren't insects. They're arachnids, like spiders, so the adults have 8 legs. The younger or smallest ticks (larvae) have 6 legs.

, Ticks can't jump or fly, so they crawl onto the host's body. When the tick bites your cat, it will stay firmly attached until it's done feeding. You won't be able to see the tick's head while it's feeding, which might make it hard to tell if you're looking at a tick or dark skin growth. To tell the difference, look for the tick's legs. Ticks also tend to accumulate in warm, protected areas of the body, like between the paw pads, in the ears, and armpits. However, they can be found anywhere on your cat’s body.If you are not sure whether the insect is a tick, you can place it in a completely sealed plastic bag and bring it to your cat’s veterinarian.
Check your cat closely if she's been outside or somewhere where she may have been exposed to ticks (tall grassy fields, barns, farm, etc).

, If you notice a tick on your cat, make sure that the object is in fact a tick. Look for the legs to be sure it's a tick and not just growth on your cat's skin. If it is a tick, put on gloves and grasp the tick with fine-tipped tweezers, as close to the skin as possible. Pull back slowly, taking care not to twist your hand. You need to remove the tick's head along with the body. If not, the head could cause infection. Put the tick into a small container filled with rubbing alcohol to kill and preserve it, in case you want to show it to the vet.You should check your cat every day from head to tail for ticks if there's a tick infestation or your cat's been exploring areas where ticks live (like tall grassy fields).

, The vet will make sure that you choose a safe and effective product. You should also purchase tick treatments directly from your vet, since some of the medications sold at pet stores can be dangerous for cats. Topical ""spot-on"" treatments are available to treat fleas and ticks, while there are no oral products for treating ticks.Let the vet know if there are any small children or pregnant women in the home.

Check the applicator to make sure it's empty.


Always read the product label for complete instructions, since they are different for each medication.

, Your vet may be able to recommend other options to keep ticks off your cat. One popular option is the Seresto collar, manufactured by Bayer. This collar can be used on kittens older than 10 weeks and adult cats. It repels and kills ticks for up to 8 months.Other brands of tick collar exist. You should consult with your veterinarian to see what is recommended for your cat.

, Ticks thrive in moist, shady areas and tall grassy spaces. Cut your grass frequently to keep them from infesting your yard. You should also trim any low-lying bushes and rake up any decomposing leaves. This will remove shady and damp sections of your yard, which fleas and ticks love.Making the environment (your yard) uninhabitable for them is key to preventing them from attaching to your pet.
Keep moist compost piles away from the house and outdoor play areas, like sandboxes and decks.

, Ticks do not like crossing paths lined with wood chips, mulch, or gravel. Place these path materials around the edges of your yard to prevent ticks from approaching your yard and home. The barrier should be 3 feet wide.Don't be tempted to leave wood piles along the edge of your house. Instead, keep them stacked in the sun since messy wooded areas can actually attract ticks., Don't let animals like stray cats, rodents, and deer gain access to your yard. These animals may bring fleas and ticks into your yard. To keep them out, place bird feeders and wood piles away from your house, set up fencing, block crawl spaces, and plant trees and plants that discourage deer.Plants that discourage deer include: boxwood, butterfly bush, ginkgo, and jasmine.Consult your local nursery for more planting ideas.

, These treatments disrupt the fleas’ life cycle and keep them from reproducing. IGRs are considered safe for people and pets, but they are harmful to fish. Be careful if you're applying the regulator near a water source., This natural product can be used in your garden to kill fleas, ticks, or insects. It works by dehydrating and shredding their bodies after they ingest the powder. Be cautious when applying it. Always wear gloves and purchase food grade diatomaceous earth. Sprinkle it around the yard where you've seen fleas or ticks.Avoid touching diatomaceous earth with your hands, ingesting, or breathing it in. The very fine powder is actually very sharp and can irritate your skin or lungs, if you breathe it. When used correctly outdoors, it won't harm humans or pets.

, To determine if you have fleas in your yard, you can walk around your yard in white socks that are pulled up to your knee. If there are fleas, you will be able to see them on your socks. You can call an experienced professional exterminator or talk to your vet about less expensive environmental pesticides you can buy. For fleas, you'll need to spray areas of the yard where your pet usually rests (such as a kennel or dog house), under decks, and next to the foundation. For ticks, spray moist and shady areas of the yard.If you do a good job of treating your pets and protecting your yard from fleas and ticks, you may not need to treat your yard with pesticides.

Never use Pyrethroid-, Permethrin-, or Amitraz-containing products on cats or in your yard. These products can cause severe side effects in cats, including death.

, Vacuum carpets, rugs, and upholstered furniture daily to eliminate adult fleas, eggs and larvae. Don’t forget to vacuum the carpet under your furniture. When vacuuming upholstered furniture, remove the cushions and vacuum all areas of the furniture, including all crevices. Afterwards, place the used vacuum bag in a sealed plastic bag and throw it away in an outdoor trash can.The majority of the fleas in your house will be in the places where your pets sleep and rest. Concentrate your cleaning efforts in these areas. You should also clean the cracks and crevices around cabinets and baseboards every 1 to 2 days.

, Wash your pet’s bedding and small rugs weekly in hot, soapy water. You may also want to wash any pillow covers, pet bedding, human bedding, and other home fabrics as well. Washing in the hottest water will kill the flea eggs.

, Choose from baking soda, borax, or silica gel and sprinkle the powder over any rugs or carpeting in your house. Work the powder deep into the fibers of the carpet and let it sit overnight. The powder will dehydrate fleas that live in the fibers. Vacuum the powder up the next day and be sure to empty the vacuum canister or bag to an outside dumpster.Keep any pets off of the rugs and carpets while there's powder spread on them. Only let them back on once the rugs are completely vacuumed and all the powder is removed.

, Look for insecticides that contain insect growth regulators, like methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Check the label to make sure that the product can be used in households with cats. If you're not sure, ask a veterinarian before using it. Realize that insecticide sprays don't kill all stages of the flea's life cycle, so you may continue to see fleas for 2 weeks after you treat. Keep vacuuming during this time to keep flea numbers down.Never use products that contain pyrethroid, permethrin, or amitraz. These can be lethal for cats.

, Remove all people and pets from the room (including your cat, birds, or reptiles). Cover any fish tanks with plastic wrap and turn off tank aerators. Spray the insecticide directly onto areas where your pet sleeps. You can also spray carpets, rugs, furniture, baseboards, and windowsills. Don’t forget to spray the carpet under your furniture too.


Keep all household members (including your pets) away from sprayed areas until the insecticide dries (usually within 24 hours). Opening your windows or turning on your air conditioning can improve ventilation and the drying time.
Make sure to follow the instructions on the label of the insecticide for additional tips.

Take note if your cat develops a potbelly.,
Check your cat’s body for fat pads.,
Look at the condition of your cat’s coat.,
Pay attention if your cat experiences vomiting or diarrhea.,
Look at your cat’s gum color.,
Pay attention to signs of worms in kittens.,
Check your cat for fleas.",How to Identify Worms in a Cat1," A cat with a heavy worm burden (which means that they have a lot of worms), tends to have a potbelly but little fat cover over the spine or pelvis. A typical potbelly looks like a swollen tummy, round and full, and often the swelling is carried down low on the cat's body (the cat may even look pregnant).The difference between a potbelly and a fat cat is the rest of the cat’s body is also in poor condition.


Roundworms are the most common cause of a potbelly, though other worms can also cause this symptom.;
, When you run your fingers over a healthy cat’s backbone, you will most likely be able to feel bumps along the spine, but should not be able to feel sharp, angular bones. This is because there is a fat padding over the cat’s bones. Cats that have a lot of worms will not have these fat pads. When you stroke the cat’s back and pelvis, you may find that you can feel each sharp, angular bone.


Body ""condition"" is a matter of assessing the fat cover over the cat’s bones. Landmarks such as the spine, hips, and pelvis are especially useful for this.

, Intestinal parasites steal much of the nutrition out of the cat's diet. This means that your cat does not get the vitamins, minerals, and proteins that they need to maintain a healthy coat. Check your cat for:


A dull coat.
A coat that lacks any sort of gloss.
A matted coat.

, Worms can physically irritate the stomach and intestinal lining, causing diarrhea and vomiting. A very high worm burden can physically obstruct the bowel and cause profound vomiting that is potentially life threatening. Cats can even vomit up a bundle of worms which look like squirming spaghetti.If your cat begins vomiting uncontrollably, bring him or her to the veterinary clinic immediately.

, Some worms, especially hookworms, can make your cat’s gut bleed, which can result in slow but steady blood loss. This blood loss can lead to anemia, making your cat sluggish and weak if it is severe enough. In kittens it can be deadly.You can recognize anemia by lifting you cat’s lip and looking at her gums. If your cat’s gums are healthy, they should be pink in color. If the cat is anemic, the gums will be white, grey, or a washed-out pink.

, Kittens with worm infections tend to be lethargic and fail to thrive. This means that they do not grow as well as their other litter mates. They are smaller, less vigorous, have dull coats, potbellies, and less fat over their ribs and backbone.


If you do not have other kittens for comparison, this can be difficult to assess but a fit, healthy kitten should be bright, playful, plump, and should have a soft, glossy coat.
Heavy worm burdens in a kitten can have life-long ramifications causing ill health throughout its life.

, This is relevant because fleas carry tapeworm eggs. When a cat grooms itself, it may eat fleas infesting its coat, which allows the tapeworm eggs to enter into the cat's system.

It may be easier to look for flea dirt, rather than the fleas themselves. Flea dirt is dried blood excreted by the flea and is often present in the coat of infested animals.
To look for flea dirt brush a section of the coat in the wrong direction and look for small dark dots near the base of your cat's hairs.
To check that the specks you find are flea dirt rather than just dust or dander, take a damp piece of white tissue and place the dirt on it. Because flea dirt is dried blood, when it comes into contact with the moisture the dirt will leave a red or orange stain.
If you find fleas or flea dirt you need to treat the cat for the fleas and the environment (ie the house and bedding material) to rid the cat and home of fleas.

Prevent future flea bites.",How to Treat Flea Bites in Cats," Flea bites are likely to raise small red lumps on the cat's skin, but these can be difficult to see because of the cat's fur. However, if a cat has a flea bite allergy these lumps tend to scab over.


Typically, a cat has many pinhead sized scabs scattered over the skins surface. Use your fingertips to stroke the cat, and look for spots with a gritty feel.
If you push the fur against the lie of the coat to see the skin, the tiny scabs will become evident.;
, If the cat has a heavy flea infestation you may see fleas. However, fleas do not live on the pet but only hop on to feed. This means that it can be difficult to find the culprit, unless it is a heavy infestation. You are however, quite likely to spot evidence of their presence in the form of flea dirt.

, Flea dirt is actually flea excrement, and is composed of dried blood that gets trapped between the hairs. To the naked eye it looks like black grit.


If in doubt, place a piece of the suspected flea dirt onto a piece of damp cotton wool. The moisture in the cotton wool reconstitutes the blood and an orange halo will spread around the sample.

, Irritation is caused when the flea bites and injects saliva into the cat's skin. Flea saliva is a potent allergen which sets up an allergic reaction in sensitive animals.


It is pointless to bathe or shampoo the cat because the irritation is happening within the skin rather than on the surface. Also topical creams tend not to be effective because the allergic reaction is usually widespread over the body and it is not practical to cover the entire cat in ointment.
If the cat is very itchy then she will scratch and traumatize the skin. The flea infection should be dealt with (more of this later) and the cat given short term relief in the form of an anti-inflammatory medication.

, Steroids are sometimes used if the cat is distressed by the level of itchiness. Controlling the itch can help reduce the risk of self-trauma to the skin, in that it reduces the chance of the cat scratching and her claws lacerating the skin.


Corticosteroids work in several ways to decrease inflammation and irritation. Firstly, they decrease the sensitivity of cells to chemicals that mediate inflammation, thus making those cells less reactive. They also inhibit the production of those same chemicals which cause the inflammation in the first place.
Importantly, steroids discourage the mast cells that contain histamine from flooding the area, and for those mast cells that are present, steroids inhibit them from releasing their histamine load (histamine is a potent source of itchiness).

, The benefit of using steroids for a cat with flea bites is two-fold. Steroids decrease skin inflammation and irritation, thereby reducing the risk of the cat damaging herself scratching.


The other benefit is that they help to switch off the allergic reaction associated with flea bite saliva sensitivity.
They do this by down-regulating the immune system such that the production of antibodies associated with the presence of foreign antigen (in this case flea saliva) is reduced.

, The depot injection is the most commonly used. It is given by intramuscular injection and works for 5 to 7 days at a time. A single injection is often enough to give the owner time to institute flea control and thus remove the source of irritation.


The preferred injection is dexamethasone, in a dose of 0.25ml for an average 5kg cat, possibly repeated 7 days later if the cat is still itchy.
Oral steroids are another option, although less popular than the injection because of a cat's natural disinclination to take pills. The dose is 1mg/kg, so a 5kg cat requires a single 5 mg tablet once a day, with or after food, for 5 to 7 days.
The third option is Cortavance spray, which is applied to the cat's skin from a pump bottle. This is absorbed into the skin where it has an anti-inflammatory action identical to that of systemic steroid treatments. The advantage with this treatment option is that the steroid molecule is destroyed in the skin so no, or very little, active steroids make it into the cat's circulation.

, Although there are no contraindications for using steroids alongside antibiotics or anti-histamines, steroids must never be used at the same time as NSAID pain relief, such as meloxicam. The combination of steroids and NSAIDs is likely to lead to severe gastric ulceration, hemorrhage, and possibly death.

, If the skin is infected, it may feel sticky or there may be some oozing from the spots. Also, the cat may lick their skin as a result of itchiness, resulting in inflamed, sticky sores. The stickiness is a sign of infection and antibiotics are needed.


This is especially true if the cat is given steroids, because this suppresses the cat's immune system and makes it more difficult for the cat to fight off the infection.
The most commonly prescribed are broad spectrum antibiotics from the penicillin family. Potentiated amoxicillin works by disrupting the bacteria's cell wall. An averaged size cat is usually prescribed 50 mg by mouth twice a day for 5 to 7 days.

, Antihistamines are widely used to reduce allergic itchiness in people, but unfortunately the results in cats are very disappointing. As the name of the drug suggests, antihistamines work by inhibiting histamine release from sensitized cells (histamine causes itchiness). Quite why this group of drugs are less effective in the cat is not certain.


If you want to try antihistamines, they are unlikely to be detrimental to the cat and a safe dosage of chlorpheniramine (Piriton) is 2-4 mg by mouth twice daily per cat. The tablets are commonly 4mg so this is equivalent to half or one tablet, twice daily.
There are no contra-indications to using anti-histamines at the same time as steroids or antibiotics.

, Killing off the fleas is a crucial part of successfully treating flea bites. There are a number of excellent products available that are highly effective at killing fleas.


In order to be effective it is necessary to treat all the animals in the house. This is because untreated animals act as a reservoir of infection and make it completely impossible to eliminate the flea population.

, Fipronil is available as a spray and a spot-on product. It works by blocking the passage of calcium through the nerve cells of the fleas' nervous system, causing paralysis and death.


The fipronil is taken up by the oil glands in the cat's skin and slowly released over time to provide protection for 4 weeks.
Repeat application is necessary every 4 weeks to continue protection.

, The spray form come in a pump bottle (available in 100ml, 250ml, and 500ml bottles). The concentration of fipronil varies depending on the bottle size and hence the dose varies.


A 100ml bottle is appropriate for use in cats (the larger sizes are designed for dogs) and the dose is 6-12 pumps per kg of body weight. Thus a 3 kg cat requires 18-36 pumps spread evenly over the entire body.
The minimum interval between treatments is 4 weeks.

, The spot-on form comes in 50mg pipettes designed for use in the cat. The dose is one 50mg pipette applied to the skin on the back of the neck (where the cat won't lick it off), used monthly. This treats current infections and prevents re-infection.

, Selamectin belongs to a family of insecticides called the avermectins. It is available in the US as a spot-on, Revolution, and in the UK as Stronghold. Selamectin works by blocking nerve transmission in the flea, paralyzing it and causing death.


The selamectin is applied once a month to the skin on the back of the neck. It has a persistent activity that lasts for 4 weeks, meaning the pet if fully protected from fleas for that month. Regular flea control and treatment of all in-contact animals should prevent reinfection and thus remove the need to treat flea bites.
Selamectin is only available as a spot-on product. An average sized cat requires one 45mg pipette (blue top) applied to the skin on the back of the neck once a month. This should be continued on a permanent basis so as to prevent reinfection with fleas.

, The key to preventing future flare ups is controlling the flea population. Thus, all cats should be treated monthly with an effective flea control product (such as those containing fipronil or selamectin).


Other animals in the household may harbor fleas and they should also be treated, in addition to the allergic animal.

Understand why you should try to identify the worms.,
Look for migrating tapeworm egg packs.,
Check your cat's feces for tapeworms.,
Recognize roundworms.,
Identify hookworms.,
Ask your vet to check your cat for heartworms.,
Have your vet take a fecal sample for analysis.",How to Identify Worms in a Cat2," If you suspect your cat has worms, the next step is to try to identify the type of worm. This helps you to know what sort of medication is going to be effective in getting rid of the infestation.

, Look under your cat's tail. Tapeworm egg packets migrate out of the cat's anus and get stuck around the fur near the rectum. The egg packets are a creamy-white color and are variously described as looking like rice grains, cucumber pips, or sesame seeds.The egg packets may also get stuck to the cat's bedding, so have a quick look at your cat’s bedding as well.
If you find these, take your cat to its veterinarian to get treated for tapeworm.

, This is much easier to do if your cat uses a litter tray. Examine the feces for the presence of worms. Sometimes these are visible on the surface of the stool, but more likely you will need to put on plastic gloves and use a disposable tool to break the pellet open and look for worms inside.


Tapeworms are a creamy white color, flat, and segmented. They average around 4 to 28 inches in length.Dipylidium caninum: The cat can get this type of tapeworm by eating fleas infected with tapeworm eggs.Taenia taeniaeformis: Cats can get this type of tapeworm when they hunt, catch and eat rodents infected with this kind of tapeworm., Roundworms are very common and look like spaghetti or noodles. On average they are two to four inches long, but can grow up to five inches in length.There are two different kinds of roundworms, both of which can be picked up in different ways:



Toxocara cati: These worms can be picked up via the mother's milk, and most kittens are infected at birth. These are commonly responsible for pot-bellied kittens, and cause vomiting and diarrhea.

Toxascaris leonine: These roundworms are acquired from contact with infected cat or rodent feces. The worm is sometimes vomited up whole, or passed out in the stool.

, Hookworms are small (0.5 to 1 centimeter), curly worms that have a hook-like mouth. They are very hard to see with the naked eye. Ancylostoma duodenalis can be found in a mother cat’s milk, though kittens can also be infected by this kind of worm by walking on soiled, infected bedding.


The tooth-like mouth parts attach to the lining of the small intestine and release an anticoagulant that causes blood seepage into the gut. Infected kittens tend to be anemic, lacking in energy, and grow poorly.

, Heartworms are much more common in dogs than in cats. That said, it is still possible for cats to become infected. This sort of worm is found in blood vessels rather than in the intestine, which means that you will have to get a vet to check your cat for these types of worms.



Dirofilaria immitis: Infected mosquitoes can transfer dirofilaria eggs into your cat’s bloodstream. The signs are nonspecific such as lack of energy, weight loss, and a cough. Sadly, some cats show no symptoms and die suddenly, because of a blockage in a main blood vessel to the heart.

, The best way to check for worms (excluding heartworms) before they become a huge health liability is to take a fresh fecal (stool) sample to your veterinarian’s office. Adult worm will lay eggs while living in the cat’s intestinal tract. These eggs will frequently (but not always) be passed in the stool and can be seen after special preparation and examination under a microscope.The eggs of different worms have a different physical appearance which aids in their identification.
If the examination of your cat and its feces proves fruitless, this does not mean that your cat does not have worms. It merely means that no worms were passed out of its body. Some cats can harbor large amounts of worms and not pass any out. The only way to be certain is to collect a fecal sample to take to your vet for analysis."

Apply the flea remedy to your cats.,
Do not rinse the mixture off.,
Reapply daily.",How to Make an Herbal Flea Remedy for Cats1," These dried herbs may be difficult to locate in a grocery store, but should be available in most health-food stores or may be purchased online.Since cats can be very sensitive to certain chemicals, it’s a good idea to purchase dried herbs that are organic so you can be confident they have not been treated with pesticides that may harm your cat.
Do not use neem oil, lavender oil, or peppermint oil as a substitute for the dried herbs because these could be toxic to your cat. As long as they are not in essential oil form, these herbs are safe to apply to your cat even if it ingests the mixture while licking its hair or skin.;
, In a mason jar or other container with a secure lid, mix the apple cider vinegar and herbs.Vinegar kills fleas, and the herbs also repel fleas while offering skin-soothing benefits to your cat.
If you are unable to locate these herbs or are looking for a faster solution to your cat’s flea problem, you can add 2 cups of white vinegar to your cat’s bath or comb the vinegar through their fur., Store the mason jar in your fridge, and allow the mixture to steep for 1 to 2 weeks to increase the effectiveness of the spray. Shake the mixture on a daily basis because the herbs can settle., Using cheesecloth or a fine strainer, separate the dried herbs from the vinegar, which has been fully infused. You can discard the dried herbs at this point.
Cheesecloth, a gauze-like cotton cloth, can usually be purchased at grocery stores or hardware stores.

, After you’ve allowed the mixture to steep for the appropriate time, pour it into a clean spray bottle.If you are repurposing an old spray bottle or if it had a different mixture in it previously, it’s important to carefully clean the bottle to make sure there are no chemicals in it that might hurt your cat.
A funnel can be a useful tool to fill the spray bottle without spilling any of the solution.

, Now that the vinegar-herb mixture is in the spray bottle, add in the appropriate amount of aloe gel and mix in enough distilled water to fill the 8 ounce spray bottle.The aloe vera is optional, but it will help soothe your cat’s irritated skin.

, Spray the flea remedy on your cat’s body, avoiding the eyes and nose.You might find it easier to do this while grooming your cat with a flea comb or brush. This will ensure that the spray is applied evenly to all areas, and you’ll probably get rid of some fleas right away. To dispose of fleas with the comb, dip it into a container of water with a little dish soap., Allowing the solution to dry on your cat will give the spray more time to eliminate fleas while soothing your cat’s skin., Reapply the herbal remedy to your cat daily to increase its effectiveness against fleas."

Treat your cat for fleas.,
Treat the environment for fleas.,
Use a preventative medication on your cat.,
Keep your cats indoors.",How to Prevent Tapeworms in Cats1," Cats most commonly get tapeworms by ingesting a flea that has tapeworm larvae. Because of this, you can prevent tapeworms by using a flea preventative on your cat. If your cat already has fleas, you need to use a product to get rid of them. To control the fleas, and therefore the exposure to tapeworms, around your cat, you need to treat the cat and the environment.There are many topical products that work to control fleas on your cat. Flea medications include Revolution, Frontline, Advantage, Seresto flea and tick collar, and Capstar tablets.;
, If you find fleas on your cat, after treating the cat you will need to clean and treat your home to get rid of any fleas and eggs that have contaminated the home. If your cat got tapeworms from the infested environment, there is a high risk of other fleas carrying tapeworm larvae and reinfecting your cat. You should treat areas both indoors and outdoors, along with the area where your cat lives, plays, and sleeps. Otherwise, the fleas will continue to be a threat to your cat for up to eight months. You need to vacuum all floors, rugs, and furniture.The contents of the vacuum will need to be thrown away in the garbage and brought out of the house to prevent reinfestation.
Floorboards, tile, hardwood floors, rugs, carpets, and furniture should all be vacuumed to remove as many fleas and eggs as possible.
Pet bedding or any washable items, like sheets or towels, should be washed in hot water and dried in a dryer. Bed mattresses should also be vacuumed on the top, sides, and bottom.
After a through vacuuming, washing, and drying, the home will need to be treated with an insecticide.
For the best results consult veterinary staff or an exterminator for help in choosing the best product to eliminate fleas. An important component is to use a product which has residual effect on killing any new infestations and eggs in the future.

, You may want to use a monthly medication to help control worms in your cat. Many heartworm medications will help prevent tapeworms. Talk to your veterinarian about putting your cat on a monthly worm medication. Don’t put your cat on any medication without talking to your vet first.Outdoor cats that hunt a lot may need to be frequently dewormed against tapeworms in order to keep tapeworms from becoming a problem.

, You may want to consider keeping all your cats indoors. Cats get tapeworms from coming in contact with fleas or contaminated feces or rodents. By keeping your cat indoors, you eliminate his exposure to contaminants.Keeping your cat indoors doesn’t eliminate fleas completely, but it helps significantly reduce the risk of your cat contracting fleas.

Notice your cat’s litter box behavior.,
Look at your cat’s stools.,
Monitor your cat’s diet.,
Isolate each cat one at a time.,
Reintroduce the cats slowly.,
Treat all cats if there is a virus or parasite cause.,
Make an appointment with your veterinarian.,
Regulate the cat’s diet.,
Provide extra sources of hydration.",How to Identify Cat Stool Problems," You can tell a lot about your cat by how it acts in and around it litter box. Watch how often your cat goes to the bathroom. Listen for any crying or painful sounds while your cat is using the litter box. Notice if bathroom trips were successful or not.A constipated kitty may make frequent trips to the litter box (often unsuccessful), and may cry in pain because of its inability to pass the stool.
A cat suffering from diarrhea may make frequent trips to the litter box as well (usually successful). It may also have some feces stuck in the hair around its anus.;
, One of the easiest ways to determine if your cat is having stool problems is to look inside the litter box. You will be able to tell if your cat is having diarrhea from the runny feces you find in there. You may be able to see some parasites or worms in the feces that could be causing your cat’s stool problems.Typically, your cat’s stool should be brown and somewhat firm. If the color or consistency of your cat’s stool changes and becomes irregular for more than a few days, consider consulting your vet.

, Many stool problems are often caused by what the cat eats. If you have just changed your cat’s food (brand or type), this may upset its digestive tract for a few days, but should normalize shortly. If your cat is not staying hydrated, this could cause constipation.If you let your cat free-feed, you may want to consider switching to controlled feeding times to help regulate its bowels.

, If you live in a multiple-cat household, it may take a while to figure out which cat is having a problem. Take one cat at a time and isolate it in its own room for a day or two. Give the cat its own litter box so that you are certain about where the stools come from since no other cats are sharing the box.Be sure to give the isolated cat all of the things that it needs including a litter box, fresh water, food, toys, and daily attention.

, Whenever you separate your cats, you’ll need to take some time to reintroduce them slowly – even if they were only separated for a few days. You may want to bring the cat back into the home inside its carrier and let the others smell the cat before you release it.Allow the cats to smell each other through a closed door. Or you can pet the isolated cat and allow your other cats to smell your hands.

, Once you figure out which cat is having the problem, remember that all of your cats have been exposed to the feces of the infected cat. This means that treatment may be necessary for all of your cats, especially if there are certain kinds of worms or parasites involved. Contact your vet for treatment options for all of your cats.If you leave some of the other cats untreated, it could cause a cycle of reinfection for your other cats that may be difficult to break.

, If your cat continues to have stool problems for more than a few days, you may want to consider consulting your veterinarian. Your vet will be able to run tests to determine the cause and provide you with recommended treatment options.Diarrhea can cause dehydration if it lasts longer than 48 hours. Constipation can cause extreme pain or distress for your cat, and lead to further digestive problems.
You should definitely call the vet if you notice any blood in the stool or if your cat has black stools. Also call your vet if your cat is experiencing fever or vomiting in addition to stool problems.

, If your cat is having stool problems, you may need to exert a greater amount of control over what the cat eats. Limit the number of treats your cat eats, switch from free-feeding to controlled feeding, and maintain consistency in food type. You should also try to determine whether your cat is eating anything else (like human food) that it should not be eating.Remember to transition your cat slowly (over a period of several weeks) to any new food.
If your cat is suffering from constipation, you may need to transition it to canned wet food to help hydrate your cat more effectively. Or consider switching to a low protein, high fiber diet.

, Make sure your cat has constant access to fresh drinking water. You should rinse out the water bowl and provide clean water every day. You should also provide several sources of fresh drinking water.You may also need to consider adding water to your cat’s dry food or switching to canned wet food to provide more hydration for your cat.

Make sure that the box is big enough for the kitten to comfortably stand up and turn around, but not so big that it will dangerously roll around when you turn corners.Secure the top of the box so that the kitten cannot crawl out.
Put air holes in the sides of the box so that the kitten has abundant fresh air.
To help the kitten feel safer and to absorb any vomit or urine, place an old towel or t-shirt in the box with the kitten.;
, Newborn kittens don’t have the ability to regulate their own temperature and will rely on their mother or you to keep them warm. Wrap a towel or blanket around the box that you’re keeping the kitten in, but make absolutely sure that you have left the air holes unobstructed.You can also wrap the kitten up in a towel or old shirt to give it extra warmth.
Just as you need to keep the air holes free and clear, if you wrap the kitten up, ensure that you’ve left the kitten’s head and airways unobstructed.

, Your kitten needs medical attention right away. You may need to find an emergency veterinarian if the kitten needs immediate attention and your local veterinarian can’t see you. Get your kitten to the nearest vet to improve its chances of survival, but remember that an emergency appointment does typically cost more than a routine veterinarian visit.


Use a search engine and type “emergency veterinarian near me.”
Or, simply type in veterinarian and your zip code in the search bar.
Or call your local Humane Society and ask for a referral.

, Your kitten is already in a box or carrier, and now you need to transport it to the veterinarian. Kitty might make crying sounds or meow quite a bit during the drive, and that’s okay. It just means that your kitten is uncomfortable with riding in a car; unfortunately, you need to get it to the vet and don’t have time to let kitten adjust to the carrier. Just wrap make sure that you have soft cloths in the carrier or box and that you drive cautiously, making no sudden movements with the car or turns that would cause the kitten to roll around inside the carrier.Some kittens do better when they can see out the car’s windows, and others do better they can’t. You can try both positions and see which your kitten handles better.

, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the simulated heartbeat and breathing performed by a rescuer on an unresponsive patient, and works on humans, cats, and a variety of other animals. Only administer CPR if you are confident that the kitten is not breathing or heartbeat. While CPR is being administered, designate someone to contact your veterinarian. If nobody else is available, contact them yourself you’re able.Clear the kitten’s airway of any obstructions. If the kitten has a foreign object lodged in their throat, use your finger to dislodge the object. If their mouth, throat, and lungs are full of fluid, hold the kitten with their head facing toward the ground so that gravity will help you clear their airway.
Put your mouth around the kitten’s nose and mouth and give three small puffs of air. You only need to give little puffs because the kitten’s lungs are too small to take in much air. Use discretion and remember that there are diseases that are transmitted between cats and humans. Administer a breath every 20 seconds.
If your kitten is not breathing but has a heartbeat, only offer rescue breaths and skip chest compressions.
Feel the kitten’s chest for a heartbeat. If no heartbeat is located, take the cat’s chest between your forefinger and thumb and administer chest compressions by squeezing the chest behind the kitten’s bent elbow. Check for a heartbeat every minute.
Don’t perform CPR for more than five minutes, as survival is unlikely at that point.

, If your kitten has a long or deep cut, or a deep puncture wound, you will need to control their bleeding so that they don’t bleed out. Fortunately, you control a kitten’s bleeding almost exactly like you would a human’s. The goal is to get the wound clean, the bleeding controlled, and the cat to a veterinarian as soon as possible for stitches.


Clean around the edges of the wound with water or antiseptic solution.
Do NOT flush the wound and do not use alcohol or peroxide.
Once the edges of the wound are clean, use clean gauze or cloth to apply firm, direct pressure. Apply pressure for 5-10 minutes, and don’t lift the gauze or cloth to check the wound. That will only promote the wound to bleed again.
Once the bleeding is controlled, tape the gauze or cloth down and get the kitten to a vet.
Try to limit the kitten’s movement so that they don’t restart the bleeding or tear off their bandage.

, Kittens are prone to hypothermia and need heat, which is typically provided by the mother cat. If the mother is unable or unwilling to warm up the kitten, or if she isn’t present, you’ll need to warm the kitten quickly and safely. Place the kitten in a box with bedding, such t-shirts or old, soft towels and warming bottles, also known as hot water bottles.Newborn kittens aren’t able to regulate their own temperatures and rely on their mother to do it for them.
Don’t use a blow dryer or other mechanized heat source that blows heat directly on the kitten. This could actually cause them to overheat.

, Even with an attentive mother and perfect care, some kittens in a litter may pass before they are weaned. Kittens who die before they wean are called fading or wasting kittens. There are several health conditions that contribute to these losses and the mortality rate among kittens. Catching symptoms of fading kitten syndrome early is the kitten’s best chance at survival, but you must remember that sometimes these losses are often unavoidable.If you suspect that you have a fading kitten, get them to a veterinarian right away, which is their best chance at survival.
Some causes of fading kittens are congenital defects, traumatic birth, environmental toxins, blood type incompatibility between mother and kitten, prematurity or low birth weight, parasitic, bacterial, or viral infections, environmental temperature too hot or too cold, and even dehydration., Kittens are naturally playful, curious, and energetic. They sleep quite a bit, as babies do, but when they’re awake, kittens are bundles of inquisitive energy. If your kitten is lethargic, meaning that they sleep all day or don’t seem to have any energy when they’re awake, this could be a sign that something is wrong. You’ll need to get your kitten to a veterinarian to determine the underlying issue., Kittens, especially newborns, need to eat every two or three hours. If the kitten is refusing to eat, especially for several hours, this could be a sign that the kitten is unwell. Kittens cannot go too long without food, and abstaining from food over several hours could mean that the kitten has an upset stomach or something much worse. Get the kitten to a vet if they won’t eat., Babies spit up, and kittens, being babies, will vomit occasionally. This typically means that they were over eager and ate too fast or ate too much. If your kitten is vomiting persistently, though, this is likely a sign that something is wrong with your cat and that they need medical attention.Some websites advocate giving animals over-the-counter, anti-vomiting medicine made for humans. Under no circumstances should you give this to a kitten. Take the animal to a veterinarian so that they can administer medicine that won’t be fatal to your kitten.

, Kittens have very weak immune systems, and if a kitten was unable to nurse from its mother right away, it will have missed out on the antibodies in colostrum. Without that precious colostrum, your kitten has no immune system at all. Bacterial and viral infections are real dangers in kittens because of their slight immune systems. If you notice lethargy, diarrhea, or vomiting in your kitten, take them to a vet right away as they may have a potentially fatal infection."

Don't feel guilty about making the right decision.",How to Know when to Euthanize Your Cat," Food is essential to life. If the cat has pain (dental, arthritic, or abdominal are the most common in older pets) then it may inhibit her from eating because it hurts to get up and do so.


Another example is the cat that eats but regularly vomits food back up. Either of these scenarios are a cause for worry and will result in the cat losing weight. Weight loss in itself is not an indication for euthanasia but if the cat's body score falls to around 1.5 / 5 the cat is likely to feel weak, and lacking in energy.
If there is no prospect of her gaining weight, you must consider euthanasia. If the body score falls further, to 1/5 then it is time to let her go.;
, A body score is a simple way of assessing how fat or thin your cat is. It consists of a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being obese and 1 emaciated. An ideal body score is around 3.



Score 1: Ribs, spine, and pelvis are visibly sticking out, even at a distance. The cat has no body fat and looks starved and bony.

Score 2: Ribs, spine, and pelvis are easily felt. Viewed from above, the cat has a distinct waist, and from the side the belly is tucked up. The cat looks thin.

Score 3: Ribs and spine can be felt but not seen. The cat has a slight waist when viewed from above, and a level, but not saggy tummy from the side. Ideal.

Score 4: Ribs and spine difficult to locate. Pear-shaped tummy from above and sagging down from the side. Can be described as chunky or stout.

Score 5: Bony landmarks obscured by fat. Thick cover of fat over chest and tummy. Oval silhouette. Obese.

, Elderly cats need to drink more than young, fit cats. This is because their kidney function often relies on drinking to flush toxins out of the system. The cat needs to be mobile enough to get up and walk to the water bowl, with minimum discomfort.


Cats in pain will not get up unless it is essential. They are likely to wait longer between drinks and are prone to dehydration, which in turn puts a strain on their kidneys and makes them more likely to feel nauseous and increasing unwell from the build-up of toxins.
Obviously, you can move the water bowl within reach, but the principle remains that it is a basic requirement for the cat to be mobile enough to walk a short distance without distress. If this is not the case then the pet's quality of life is in question and euthanasia should be considered.

, Cats are proud, clean creatures. They have a basic need to keep themselves clean. If they are unable to keep themselves clean, then the cat's dignity suffers and keeping them alive is morally questionable.


Of course a one off or occasional accident is no reason to act, but if the cat either has intractable diarrhea which catches her off-guard, or lacks bladder control such that her coat starts to smell, this causes the cat significant distress. It is also a cause for concern if a cat that used to be house trained starts soiling in the house.
However, before you decide she has to be euthanized, speak to the vet about whether pain relief is appropriate, or look into changing her litter box to one with lower sides. Cats with arthritis can find it difficult to jump into steep sided boxes and may take the easier route of using the floor.
Likewise, stiff achy joints can make the cat less willing to walk to another room to the tray. A trial with pain relief meds may be all it takes to clear up this unseemly habit.

, Lack of grooming could be a sign of a stiff back, or even that your cat is sleeping more and not devoting the necessary to coat care. If this is your cat's only quirk, don't panic, the chances are she's okay for a while yet.


However, you can also look at things the other way round. A cat with a glossy, well-kept coat is a cat that still has a pride in her appearance and is well enough to do something about it. If this describes your cat, then it's likely she isn't ready to depart just yet.
Of course, if your cat is having difficulty grooming herself, this is one area where you can make a big difference. Giving an elderly, unkempt cat a comb and brush over can make her feel much better about herself.

, This is a big one. It is a basic necessity that the cat can sleep and rest without being disturbed by pain. A cat in pain is more likely to be restless, and show tell-tale signs such as swishing her tail, or resting with her ears drawn back.


Pain also causes tension in the muscles and the cat is more likely to have a hunched-up, ""tight"" appearance, rather than lying on her side with her legs extended. Cats in pain are also more short-tempered and grouchy. So be alert for changes in character from sweet-tempered to hissy and spitty.
Of course pain comes in different intensities and different cats have differing tolerances to pain. When deciding whether it's time for euthanasia the underlying question to ask yourself is if the pain means she spends more time feeling unwell, than she does getting pleasure out of life.

, Don't forget your vet is there to advise you. The ideal situation is if your cat has seen the same vet for years, because she has followed the cat throughout her life and is aware of her normal appearance and behaviors.


The veterinarian will also know you, and this makes it easier to have a full and honest discussion about what is best for your pet.

, If your cat is on regular medication and the vet is familiar with him, you should ring and ask to speak to the vet at the first sign of concern.


The vet may suggest a visit to the clinic, or suggest a change of medication or a different dose. The vet will try to find a solution to your pet's problems before the topic of putting the cat down is even broached.
When you first become concerned, speaking to a professional does not commit you to having the pet euthanized - it simply gives your pet the best chance of finding a medical solution.

, If your pet has not been to the vet for some time and you are growing concerned about their physical condition, book an appointment for a physical exam.


Again, this is not committing you to euthanasia but it will give to vet an opportunity to conduct a full examination and give you time to discuss your cat's health in person.
This allows you to get an honest opinion about the cat's health, and if it isn’t time to let her go it provides a bench mark against which to measure any deterioration later on.

, There are two elements in making a decision about euthanasia. The first is the physical side, and the second is the mental.


The vet's role is to check for signs of ill health or pain that mean the animal is suffering, or about to suffer, and to advise you on the options for treatment. Sadly, euthanasia is sometimes considered an appropriate ""treatment"" if it is not possible or practical to alleviate the cat's suffering through medications or other means.
During the health check the vet will assess things such as the cat's hydration levels, body condition, and signs of pain. She will also trouble shoot for conditions such as anemia or cancer that might indicate that the cat is unlikely to respond to treatment. She will assess the cat's general mobility and state of mind.

, It is the veterinarian's job to ensure an animal does not suffer, and if the cat has a problem that is badly affecting her quality of life and there is little chance of improvement, then the vet will help you understand this and guide you towards making the best decision.

, In some cases, cats who are poorly at home will seem to perk up at the vet's clinic. This is simply a result of stress.


Be aware this can happen, (and vet's know it), so be honest with the veterinarian and explain how the cat acts at home. She will appreciate the honesty and help you make the best decision.
Keep in mind that certain factors, such as senility, are often best judged by the owner who lives with the pet, rather than the vet in a ten minute consultation.

, Life is a balancing act. Sometimes things go well, other times they go badly, but everything should balance out in the end. Your cat's life is a bit like this.


An elderly or sick cat will have good days and bad days, but if the overall balance is positive and the ""bad"" is never extreme pain, then it is reasonable to carry on. However, there comes a time when the bad outweighs the good.
The tipping point may occur when the cat stops responding to pain medications, or you notice a deterioration in house training. Although it varies from cat to cat, a point is usually reached beyond which quality of life becomes unacceptable.
Once this tipping point has been reached, euthanasia may be the kindest thing for your cat.

, It is the nature of hard decisions that they are not clear cut. Continuing with the scales analogy, it may not be one large thing that tips the balance (such as the cat having a stroke) but it may be lots of smaller things added together (such as the cat no longer grooming, soiling herself, and losing weight).

, ""Quality of life"" are three words much talked about in the context of animal euthanasia. As well as physical factors such as pain, quality of life can be quite an abstract idea that includes factors such as the cat's enjoyment of life. Considering the cat's quality of life will help you to reach a decision about what is moral and humane.

, A useful concept to keep at the back of your mind is ""quality of life, not quantity of life."" If you decide to keep your cat alive, it's important to ensure that her life is worth living. If she is in constant pain, it would be kinder to put her down, as her quality of life is non-existent.

, Trust your instincts is sage advice when it comes to euthanasia. You know your pet, and chances are if you think she is suffering, then she is. No owner wants to say goodbye, but it comes down to putting the cat's best interests first, and your reluctance to let go second.

, The first thing to remember is that by deciding to euthanize your cat, you are not killing her, or playing God. These ideas are not helpful. In fact, what you are doing is making a positive decision to prevent the cat from unnecessary pain, discomfort and distress.


The second thing to remember is that it is better to let the cat pass early, rather than do nothing and watch the cat deteriorate. Owners do not consider euthanasia lightly, and it is highly likely that if the thought of euthanizing your cat has occurred to you, then your cat is close-to, or already in distress.
The third thing to remember is that cats show you love and compassion throughout their life, and when their quality of life fails, it is an unselfish decision on your part to say goodbye and bring that life to a dignified end.

Purchase chamomile tea.,
Make the tea.,
Chill the tea in the fridge.,
Pour the tea into a spray bottle.,
Spray it on your cat’s irritated skin.,
Reapply as needed.",How to Make an Herbal Flea Remedy for Cats4," You probably know that chamomile tea is often recommended for upset stomachs and sleeplessness in humans, but it can also help soothe your cat’s irritated skin. If you don’t already have chamomile tea in your pantry, go to the grocery store or a health food store and buy some.Look for a product that does not have additional herbs in it, because these ingredients may not help relieve the itchiness or irritation that results from flea bites.
Both tea bags and looseleaf chamomile tea will work, so pick whichever option you prefer. While tea bags are more convenient, looseleaf tea is often stronger, which will make it more effective at relieving your cat’s itching. The leaves of looseleaf tea can also sometimes be used more than once. Keep in mind that if you go with looseleaf tea, you’ll need brewing equipment such as an infuser or brew basket., There are no set guidelines for the type of equipment you should use to brew the tea or the length of time you should let it steep, but steep the tea long enough to make a strong solution.Don’t be afraid to let the tea steep for 15 to 30 minutes. You won’t be applying the hot tea to your cat, so it’s not a problem if it gets lukewarm.
If you are using smaller size tea bags, you may need to use several to make the tea more potent.

, After you’ve brewed the tea, chill it in the fridge until it is no longer warm.It won't be a problem to let it sit in the fridge overnight.
If you are trying to make the mixture quickly, you can place the brewed tea in the freezer for a couple minutes to cool it down fast.

, After chilling the tea, you can now pour it into a spray bottle, which will make it easy to apply to your cat.Use a new spray bottle or thoroughly clean an existing one so that you know it does not contain any ingredients or substances that might be toxic to your cat.
Since the mouth on many spray bottles is narrow, a small funnel can make this process less messy and ensure as much of the tea as possible actually makes it into the spray bottle.
If you have extra tea that won’t fit in the spray bottle, store it in a container in the fridge so you’ll be able to have the next batch ready when it’s time to reload the bottle.

, Flea bites often cause itchy, red, and raw skin, so thoroughly coat these areas on your cat. The tea will soothe the skin, and you will notice that your cat is no longer licking, scratching, or biting the affected area.Chamomile also acts as a disinfectant, and will kill yeast and bacteria that might irritate your cat’s skin.
There’s no need to rinse the tea off your cat. It will work better if it has time to sit on the skin.

, Since the tea mixture won’t hurt your cat, you can reapply the spray as often as necessary.


If your cat’s ears also seem irritated from flea bites or other skin issues, you can add a splash of distilled white vinegar to the chamomile tea and use this to clean your pet’s ears.

Identify tapeworms.,
Recognize other symptoms.,
Treat tapeworms.,
Learn how cats contract tapeworms.",How to Prevent Tapeworms in Cats2," Tapeworms attach onto the intestinal wall, and when the tapeworm matures, it develops body segments that contain eggs. The segments break off from the main body of the tapeworm and pass out of the body in the stool. After the segments pass out of the cat’s body in the stool, they will frequently stick to the hair around the anus. These small white, flat egg segments will dry out and look like little pieces of rice stuck to the hair.Occasionally, you will also see the segments and possibly an adult body on the actual bowel movement. These will be white, glistening, and ribbon like pieces on the surface of the stool.

, The most common way to find out your cat has tapeworms is through evidence in the feces because cats have very few symptoms from tapeworms. Because the tapeworm attaches itself to the intestine and may end up in the stomach, your cat may vomit the tapeworm. Your cat may also lose weight because the tapeworm is taking nutrients from the intestines.Your cat may also have a lackluster coat.
Your cats may have anal irritation because of the tapeworms, so he may lick at it or scoot its behind across the floor.

, If you think that your cat has tapeworms, take him to the vet. Your vet will generally rely on you to inform him about the tapeworms because fecal exams won’t show the eggs.Your vet will recommend medications that kill the adult worm and cause it to eventually pass out of the body. The medication that is effective at killing tapeworm is called praziquantel. This drug is frequently combined with other deworming medication to kill other intestinal parasites.Trade names for this medication include Droncit, Drontal Plus, and Tradewinds Tapeworm Tabs.
These medications can be found at vet clinics or other stores which sell pet products.

, Cats can contract tapeworms a few different ways. Tapeworms are carried by fleas, so your cat can get tapeworms if he has fleas. Tapeworms pass to the cat when he ingests the flea. Tapeworms need to have an intermediate host, the flea, to complete its life-cycle and infest the next cat that comes along. The cat becomes infected with tapeworms by swallowing a flea infected with tapeworm larvae, or by eating a small mammal, usually a rodent, that contains the worm in its body.Cats that hunt vermin like rodents and eat their kill can frequently catch tapeworms from their prey.

Talk to your veterinarian about any concerns you have regarding your pet's quality of life. These can include the following factors:Complete loss of appetite or unwillingness or inability to eat
Trouble standing or walking. Falling over when standing or trying to walk.
Difficulty with breathing or every breath is labored
Incontinence or soiling problems
Chronic pain or inability to get comfortable
Chronic vomiting or diarrhea that threatens to leave your pet dehydrated;
, Before making the appointment you will want to prepare yourself and your family members for life without your beloved cat. Make sure you have photos of your cat, spend some time with your cat petting and comforting it, and giving it a special treat or food.Remember to let any children that cared for and loved the cat join in this process. Do not lie to them that the cat is going to another home or that it ran away. Instead, explain to them the decision making process to euthanize the cat and explain the death to them in an age appropriate manner. An excellent book for kids is When a Pet Dies by Fred Rogers of Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood fame.

, You will need to decide if you want to be with your cat to the end of its life. Only you can decide if you want to present for the process. Some people want to be, some don’t. It only depends on what is right for you and your cat.


Most veterinarians and their staff will be fine with you being present and will explain the process to you. If you can’t be present they will understand that decision as well.
When you call for the appointment to euthanize your cat you can ask if they will come to your home to do the euthanasia. Many cats get extremely anxious or stressed out with car rides or being at the veterinarian’s office, so this may be a final kind thing you can do for your cat. Or you may prefer to have it done at the veterinarian’s office to avoid unpleasant memories at home. Either the way the procedure is similar.

, You will need to decide on the disposition of the body after the euthanasia is completed, basically whether you want the cat's body cremated or not. Connected to this, you will also decide whether you want to take its ashes or body home with you for burial.


Do you have a box or a special blanket to wrap the body in? Or will you decide to have the veterinarian’s office arrange for cremation, which will add more money to the final bill.
Do you have room to bury the body in your yard? Can you dig in the yard if it’s winter time? Is there a safe spot to dig? You may have to check with your local utilities to make sure you don’t damage any buried lines on your property.

, Pay any fees upfront, as you don't want to have to deal with this after your cat has passed away. Try to stay calm for the cat's sake. It will not know what is going on, so its best to not make is scared at the end of its life.

, Many times a sedative will be given to your cat in one of its muscle. This will help it relax, as the euthanasia solution needs to be given in the vein, usually using a front leg vein. After access to the vein is achieved the solution is slowly given and the cat’s heart will soon stop. This normally takes place very quickly.


Many veterinarians will place a small catheter into the vein while others are adept at using a plain needle on a syringe full of the euthanasia solution.The veterinarian will usually need their assistant to help hold the pet and keep its leg steady, but you should be able to stroke and speak to your pet if you want to.
Occasionally a cat with heart or circulation troubles will take a bit more time for the solution to work. The cat may give a sigh or a couple of deep breaths.
The veterinarian will check with his or her stethoscope to make sure your cat’s heart is stopped before pronouncing your cat dead. They will assist you in respectfully readying your cat’s body for a proper disposition.

, Grieving at the loss of your beloved companion is normal. Your cat gave you companionship, loyalty and unconditional love which will be sorely missed. Everyone grieves differently: some cry, some get angry, some feel sadness. Here are some tips to help you cope with your loss:Create a memorial. This could be a spot on a shelf with your cat’s framed photo, a special photo album with photos or you could plant a tree or bush in your cat’s memory.
Write your feelings in a journal.
Ask your humane society or veterinarian if there are any pet loss support groups in the area.
Call a pet loss hotline to speak with a counselorMost of all remember the happy times with your cat and enjoy those good memories.

Consider grief counseling after the death of your pet.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Dying," A lowered heart rate is a sign that the cat may be getting weaker and nearing death. A healthy cat's heart rate is between 140 and 220 beats per minute (bpm). A very sick or weak cat's heart rate may drop to a fraction of the normal rate, indicating death could be near.Here is how to measure your cat's heart rate:


Place your hand over your cat's left side, right behind his front leg.
Use a stopwatch or your smartphone to count the number of beats you feel in 15 seconds.
Multiply the number by four to get the heart rate beats per minute. Assess whether the bpm is at a healthy or below-normal level.
A very weak cat's blood pressure will drop as well, but this can't be measured without special equipment.;
, A healthy cat takes between 20 and 30 breaths per minute. If a cat's heart has become weak, the lungs operate less effectively and less oxygen is pumped into the bloodstream. This causes rapid breathing as the cat struggles for oxygen, followed by slow, labored breathing as the lungs fill with fluid and breathing becomes very difficult.Monitor your cat's breathing in the following way:


Sit near your cat and quietly listen to her breathing. Watch her abdomen rise and fall with each breath.
Use a stopwatch or your smartphone to count how many breaths she takes in 60 seconds.If she is breathing quite rapidly and heavily, or if she seems to be taking very few breaths, she may be close to the end.

, A healthy cat's temperature is between 100 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit.A cat nearing death will have a lower body temperature. As the heart weakens, the body temperature begins to drop below 100. You can check your cat's temperature in the following ways:


Use a thermometer. If you have a pet thermometer, take your cat's temperature in his ear. If not, you can use a digital rectal thermometer to take the temperature of pets. Set the thermometer, insert it slightly into the cat's rectum, and wait for it to beep to learn the temperature.
If you don't have a thermometer, feel his paws. If they're cool to the touch, this could be a sign that his heart is slowing down.

, It is very common for cats to stop eating and drinking toward the end of their lives. Notice whether your cat's food and water dish seem to always be full. Your cat may also exhibit physical signs of anorexia, such as a wasted look from losing weight, loose skin and sunken eyes.Check the cat's waste as well. A cat who is no longer eating or drinking will have lower output and darker urine.
As the cat weakens, he may have low or no control over his urinary tract and bowels, so you may notice accidents around the house.

, When a cat's organs begin to shut down, toxins build up in the body and cause a bad smell. If your cat is near death her breath and body may have a foul odor that gets worse and worse over time, since she has no way of eliminating toxins.

, In the wild, a dying cat understands that it is more vulnerable to predators, so it seeks out a place where it can pass away in peace. A cat who is dying may instinctively hide in an out-of-the-way room, under furniture or somewhere outside.

, If you notice any signs that your cat is ill, take him to the vet right away. Many of the signs of imminent death are also signs of severe illness that could be cured with proper treatment. Don't assume that because your cat exhibits these signs, he is definitely about to die; there could still be hope.For example, chronic kidney disease is common among older cats. The symptoms of the disease are very similar to end-of-life symptoms. With proper intervention, however, a cat with chronic kidney disease could live for many years.
Cancer, lower urinary tract disease, and tapeworms are also examples of potentially curable problems with symptoms similar to those of a cat who is dying., Once it has been determined that medical intervention will not significantly prolong your cat's life, you'll want to talk with your vet about how to make your cat as comfortable as possible in her final days. Depending on your cat's symptoms, the vet may provide a prescription for pain medication, equipment to help her eat and drink, or bandages and salve to dress a wound.Many owners are now turning to ""home hospice care"" to ease their pets' passing. The owners provide round-the-clock care to keep their pets healthy and comfortable for as long as possible.
If you don't feel comfortable administering a certain form of treatment, you might be able to set up frequent appointments with your vet to get your cat the care she needs.

, Sometimes the best thing you can do for a cat who is nearing the end of his life is provide warm, cozy place to rest. At this point your cat probably isn't moving around very much, so he's probably spending most of his time in his bed. You can make his favorite place to sleep more comfortable by providing extra soft blankets.


Make sure your cat's bedding is kept clean. Wash the blankets every couple of days in hot water. Don't use a highly perfumed detergent, since this could be irritating to your cat.
If your cat is experiencing incontinence, line the bed with towels that you can easily change out each time your cat urinates.

, Sometimes cats have trouble making it to the litter box to relieve themselves normally. If your cat is too weak to get up, you may have to carry her to the litter box every few hours. Talk with your vet about getting a sling for your cat to help her eliminate more comfortably.

, Your cat may be in severe pain even if she doesn't cry or flinch when you touch her. Cats exhibit pain more quietly, but with careful observation you should be able to tell when she is having a hard time. Look for the following signs of suffering:The cat is acting more reclusive than usual
The cat is panting or struggling for breath
The cat shows reluctance to move
The cat is eating or drinking even less than usual

, The decision to euthanize a cat is never an easy one. Many cat owners would prefer to allow their pets to die naturally at home instead. However, if your cat's suffering becomes extreme, you may decide that euthanizing him is the more humane choice. Call your vet to help you decide when the time has come.


Keep a diary of your cat's level of suffering and pain. When the ""bad days"" outnumber the ""good days"" — days when your cat can get up and move around or breathe easily — it might be a good time to talk with your vet about ending your pet's suffering.
If you choose euthanasia, the vet will administer a sedative followed by a medication that causes him to pass away peacefully. The process is painless and takes between 10 and 20 seconds.You may choose to stay in the room with your pet or wait outside., If your cat dies at home, it's important to store the body in a cool place until you're able to proceed with cremation or burial plans. This ensures that the body won't deteriorate or become a hazard to your family's health. Wrap the cat carefully in plastic (such as a plastic bag) and store the body in a cool place, such as a freezer or on a cold concrete floor. If your cat is euthanized, the vet will properly store the body for you., If you would like to have your cat cremated, talk with your vet about options in your area.

Prior to burying your cat, check local regulations. You can call someone at your local courthouse or Department of Natural Resources to see whether it's legal to bury a pet in your backyard. Usually, you cannot bury a cat in public place like a park.Refrain from burying a cat near a body of water. This could contaminate the water supply.
You should also make sure you're not digging into any cables in the ground. Choose an area of your yard that's far away from home. If you encounter any cables while digging your hole, stop digging, refill the hole, and pick a different spot.
If you're renting, make sure to check with your landlord. Not all landlords will allow people to bury pets in the backyard.;
, Once you have made sure burying your cat is legal, select a burial site. You can pick a spot in your yard or an area in a public place.You may want to pick a special or symbolic place to bury your cat. If your cat always hung out near the wildflowers in your yard, for example, this may be a good spot to bury it. If your cat loved to play in the woods, you could bury your cat there.
However, think about logistics when deciding to bury your cat. You do not want the grave somewhere in the yard where it will frequently be stepped on or disturbed. Choose an area of your yard where you don't usually go. If you have young children, pick a spot where they do not play.

, You want some kind of vessel to place your cat in prior to burial. This is particularly important if your state or area has certain regulations regarding burying pets. You may be required to use a particular type of container due to concerns about contaminating the ground.You can purchase a coffin for a pet online. If it's important to you to have a formal coffin, this may be the right option for you.
However, coffins can be expensive. You can also bury your cat in something like a cardboard box. If your cat had a bed it loved, consider burying your cat in its bed.
If you don't need to use a container, you can always just wrap your cat in a towel prior to burial.

, There are many things you could use to mark your pet's grave. You can purchase a marker for your pet online, which you can custom create to include your pet's name and other details, such as the date of birth and death. However, if this is out of your budget, there are other options.You can gather stones and rocks from your backyard and pile them near the grave. If it's important for you to have your cat's name on the grave marker, you can use paint to write the cat's name on a larger rock.
If your cat loved a particular type of plant, consider placing a plant over your cat's grave. You can also put down something bigger, like a tree.

, You want to bury your cat before the body starts to decompose. Ideally, bury your cat within the day it died or the day afterwards. A prompt burial is especially important in warmer months.Unfortunately, if a cat dies in the winter a prompt burial is not always possible. The ground may be frozen over. In this case, ask your vet whether you can store your cat's body with them until you're able to bury it.
You can also wrap your cat in a towel and place it in a Styrofoam container filled with ice. However, you should only use this method if you're storing your cat's body for a few days prior to burial. It will not work for long term storage.

, You will need certain supplies to bury your cat. You can find most of them at a local hardware store if you don't have them on hand in your home. You will need the following:Gloves
A spade or shovel
Rope to tie around the box or container

, Use gloves when handling your cat's body. If you want, you can bury your cat with a few of its favorite items. You can, for example, wrap your cat in its favorite blanket. You can also place your cat's favorite toy in the container with it, or other items the cat liked when alive.Make sure to tie the box closed with rope after placing the cat in it.

, You want to make sure the hole is deep enough that your cat's body will not be targeted by predators. Make sure to dig the hole wide enough that you can place your cat's coffin into the ground.Remember, if you notice any cables, stop digging immediately. Fill in your hole and look for another place to bury your pet.

, Many people find a memorial is helpful when burying their cat. Before placing your cat in the ground, you can say a few words, sing a song, or read a poem.Consider inviting friends and family members over to say goodbye your pet.
Young children may find a memorial particularly beneficial. You can encourage them to all collect things that remind them of their lost pet. They can place these things in the hole alongside the cat's coffin.

, After saying a few words, gently set your cat's coffin in the ground. Refill the hole with the soil you dug up. Make sure to press the soil down as you place it over the grave. You want the soil to be firmly in place to prevent predators from digging up your cat., Do not skip the grave marker. While it may not be important to you as a symbolic gesture, a grave marker prevents the grave from being disturbed. If you purchased a coffin, set it over the grave. If you're using rocks or other materials, pile them over the cat's resting place.If you're planting something in the ground, make sure to surround the base of the plant with something heavy. This will keep predators away.

, Once the marker is up, you may want to decorate the gravesite. You can put up temporary decorations, like flowers and other foliage.If you have young children, they may want to decorate the grave.

Give your cat preventative medication.,
Prevent mosquitoes from breeding in your yard.,
Provide preventative care for indoor cats.",How to Prevent Heartworm Disease in Cats1," Like most diseases, prevention is the safest and most cost effective measure. Cats can be given once a month preventative medication that kills the heartworms. These preventative medications are available from your veterinarian in the form of a prescription.In year round warm weather regions, your cat should be given this medication year round.
For cats that live in areas with long cold winters, the medication should be given once a month during the mosquito season. Your veterinarian can help you figure out when these months are.;
, Preventing mosquitoes from gathering in your yard and sneaking into your house is also a great preventative measure. Dump out, cover, or drill holes into any container, planter saucer, tarps, kids toys, wheelbarrows, old tires, or anything else capable of holding more than ¼ inch of water. Items that hold water can turn into mosquito breeding grounds. You should also fill in any spots on your property where water puddles.Dump out bird baths with standing water at least once a week.
Keep gutters cleaned out so water flows from them freely after rains.

, While outdoor cats are at a higher risk to get heartworms, indoor cats can also get heartworms. Mosquitoes transfer the heartworms, and indoor cats are also exposed to mosquitos. Make sure to give your indoor cat preventative heartworm medicine.Place screens on windows and doors to help prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home.

She will need a calm, quiet environment that is free of noisy activity and chaos. For example, if you have other pets, you may need to restrict their access to her.Consider moving your cat’s rest area to a part of your house that does not get much activity or noise.If moving your cat’s rest area to a different room would be too much of a change for her, then you should adjust your habits, as well as those of your family, to decrease the amount of activity and noise around your cat.
Allow your cat choose where to sleep.She may naturally choose an area that will give her the peace and quiet she desires.
Playing soft, low music for your cat could make her feel more comfortable. Examples of soothing music are singing birds and running water.The hustle and bustle of daily life may be too much for your cat to handle in her final days, and could actually make her illness or general state of health even worse.;
, When your cat is dying, it may be difficult for her to rest as comfortably as she used to. Extra blankets and bedding will give her some extra padding on which to lay and get comfortable. The extra padding can also prevent pressure sores that could develop if she lies in one position for too long.Your cat may soil her bedding due to bladder control issues or physical inability to walk to her litterbox.Choose extra bedding that is easy to clean, such as blankets and towels.
Foam bedding, though comfortable, can be difficult to clean.Check the bedding regularly for evidence of soiling (dampness, fecal material) and clean it as often as is necessary.
The extra bedding can also serve to keep your cat warm. Older, dying cats can have difficulty maintaining their body temperature and can become cold more easily., Changing the lighting for your cat can make her environment seem more comfortable to her. During the day, open the window shades or blinds just to enough to let in diffuse, natural light.When the sun goes down, provide your cat with soft lighting.Leave a low light on for your cat when it is time to say good night. She may feel more comfortable with a low light than complete darkness.Visit your local home improvement store to learn more about low lighting options for your cat.

, As your cat nears the end of her life, she may have trouble getting up and walking around. The distance that she used to walk to get to her litterbox and food and water bowls may be too far for her now. To minimize her discomfort with eating, drinking, and using the litterbox, place her bowls and litterbox in a nearby area that will be easy for her to get to.Even with the close proximity, your cat still may have trouble getting up on her own. You can either fashion a sling out of a towel or blanket, or purchase a sling, to help her to her feet.Place her favorite toys close by.

, Earlier in your cat’s life, you may have limited the amount of tasty morsels your cat ate so that she could maintain a healthy diet. Now that she is near the end of her life, why not indulge her a bit more? Spoil your cat with some tuna, such as tuna flakes or even tuna juice poured on top of her food.Meat-based baby food,, such as turkey,is another type of tasty food to feed your dying cat. Since onions are toxic to cats, make sure the baby food does not contain any onion powder.Gourmet cat food is another tasty food option for your cat.Whichever tasty food you give her, make sure that it has a strong and appealing smell. Your cat probably won’t have a big appetite in her final days,but giving her food that is very aromatic may encourage her to eat at least a little bit., Not only may your cat be losing her appetite when she is dying, but she may also no longer have the physical ability to chew her food adequately. Therefore, you will need to make her food easier to eat. For dry food, you can soften it by soaking it in some water or mashing it.Other than mashing dry food, you can grind it up in a blender.
If you are feeding your cat baby food, you can mix it with some water to make it even softer.Warming up your cat’s food can make it easier and more appealing for her to eat.Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure what types of foods your cat can eat, and would want to eat, at the end of her life.

, Your cat, in her final stages of life, may not want to drink as much water as she used to. In addition, her body’s ‘thirst’ signal may not be working very well, so she may not even realize that she needs to hydrate herself.Keeping your dying cat well hydrated is key to keeping her comfortable.Her water should be lukewarm instead of cold.If your cat is too weak or in too much pain to drink out of her water bowl, you will have to help her by gently supporting her head upright.She may not want to open her mouth willingly to drink the water, so you may have to give her water using a medicine dropper.While supporting her head, position the medicine dropper next to her back teeth on the inside of her cheek. When she opens her mouth, gently squeeze the water down her throat.

, Your cat may be at the end of her life, but that does not mean that her health challenges should not be addressed. In fact, not addressing her health problems could make her feel even more uncomfortable and speed up her rate of decline.Make an appointment with your veterinarian to discuss your cat’s various health challenges and what can be done to manage them.


If your cat has a terminal illness, such as cancer or chronic kidney disease, develop a plan with your veterinarian to manage and minimize your cat’s discomfort.

, Depending on your cat’s medical condition, she may be in a lot of pain. When she is dying, you should do what you can to relieve this pain. Your veterinarian can recommend what type of pain medications your cat would need to achieve pain relief.Remember that, at this stage in your cat’s life, the pain medication is to make her feel more comfortable, not cure her physical ailments.Consider using a pill popper to administer the pain medication if your cat cannot open her mouth on her own.Position the pill popper as you would the medicine dropper. When she opens her mouth, push on the pill popper to dispense the pill down her throat. To stimulate swallowing, give her a few drops of water using your medicine dropper., Pain, disease, or general weakness can make it very difficult for your dying cat to make it to the litterbox in time. If your cat has trouble controlling her bladder, your veterinarian may want to prescribe a medication to manage the incontinence.Your cat may also have trouble controlling fecal elimination.
Check your cat regularly for evidence of soiling or wetness.Gently clean her genital and rectal area to prevent urine scald and other skin irritation caused by elimination problems.Clean her with a soft cloth and warm water.
Disposable cat diapers are also available. If your local pet store does not carry them, you can either search online or ask your veterinarian for recommendations on diapers for your cat.
Putting a diaper on your cat may be a bit awkward and challenging at first, so you may want to ask your veterinarian about the easiest way of doing it.

, While you are making the best of the time you have left with your dying cat, you will also need to prepare for the realities of her eventual death. By no means is this easy, but it is something you must do. Talking with your veterinarian will help you handle and organize this difficult preparation.


Euthanasia is a painless and humane way of ending your cat’s life. To perform euthanasia, your veterinarian would administer an overdose of an anesthetic drug.After a few seconds, your cat would slip peacefully into unconsciousness and eventually stop breathing.Do not feel ashamed or guilty about thinking or talking about euthanasia. Many pet owners struggle with the idea of putting their pets to sleep.
Your veterinarian can help you sort out your emotions and questions regarding euthanasia.

, After talking with your veterinarian, it is up to you to decide when the time has come to have your cat euthanized. It may be helpful to look for clinical signs that your cat is clearly suffering: hiding, sleeping more, wasting away, and either withdrawing from human contact or being overly clingy.Ask yourself this question: ‘Am I keeping my cat alive for myself or for my cat?’How you answer that question will help you decide when the time is right to euthanize her.
If your cat is truly suffering, despite your best efforts to make her comfortable, then it may be time to have her euthanized.
Come up with a plan for when it is ""the right time"". Your veterinarian can help you to come up with a written plan to help you know when the time for euthanasia is. This can be very helpful:

It uses your vet's knowledge on the progression of your animal's disease (if any) that will alert you to symptoms that indicate pain or suffering, or not.
It helps eliminates arguments among families, roommates, or other multiple owners.
Making big decisions with big emotions is hard, and having a plan done at a more neutral time can help take the emotions out of the equation.


It can also help to either observe or keep a written record of your cat’s daily activities. When you notice that she’s having more bad days than good days, it’s probably time to start thinking about euthanasia.When you have made the difficult decision to euthanize your cat, promptly call your veterinarian to schedule the appointment.Delaying the process will only make it more difficult for you, and may prolong your cat’s discomfort.
Some veterinarians will offer to perform the euthanasia at the owner’s home. Ask your veterinarian if he or she offers this service. If not, then schedule the euthanasia at a time when the veterinarian clinic is quiet—usually the early morning or late evening., As if the decision to euthanize your cat was not hard enough, you also need to think about what do with your cat’s remains. You have the options of burying your cat at a pet cemetery or having her remains cremated.Do not feel pressured to choose one option or the other—decide what you are most comfortable with.


Your veterinarian can give you information about pet cremation and burial services.

Watch for respiratory distress.,
Check for digestive issues.,
Be aware that many heartworm complications cannot be observed.",How to Prevent Heartworm Disease in Cats2," One symptom of heartworm disease in cats is respiratory problems. This may present in your cat as coughing or hacking. Your cat may also have difficulty breathing.The difficulty breathing may be heavy, raspy, or abnormally fast breathing. In severe cases, your cat may have acute respiratory failure due to clots.
Respiratory problems in cats due to heartworm disease is frequently misdiagnosed as feline asthma or bronchitis.This is the signs of HARD. HARD is caused when the heartworm larva end up in the lung arteries where they may die and cause inflammation of the artery walls., Sometimes, your cat may have digestive issues if he has heartworms. Your cat may start vomiting or have diarrhea. He may also start to lose a lot of weight and display signs of lethargy.Since these are non-specific signs that can point to many illnesses, you should take your cat to the vet for a specific diagnosis.

, The main two symptoms for heartworm disease in cats are respiratory and digestive problems. Other complications caused by the worms can only be detected by your vet. Your cat may have tachycardia or a heart murmur.Your cat may also have signs of anemia or other blood-related issues.


Your vet may be able to find evidence of dead or broken pieces of worms in your cat’s lungs, intestines, heart, brain, or spine, which leads to various internal problems.Cats can die suddenly because of heartworm infections. Since sometimes a cat doesn’t present symptoms for heartworms, your cat may die without any other symptoms. This is why it’s important to get your cat screened for heartworms and try to prevent them.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Diagnose the symptoms.,
Treat the heartworm infection.",How to Prevent Heartworm Disease in Cats3," If your cat shows any signs of respiratory or digestive problems, you should take him to the vet immediately. These signs are common signs for many different illnesses. Your vet can do an exam to determine the root cause for the symptoms.


Even if your cat does not show any signs, you should take him to the vet for checkups where your vet checks him for heartworms.

, During a physical exam of the cat, the vet may notice heart problems, such as an arrhythmia or a heart murmur. Otherwise, the vet may notice a non-specific respiratory problem, or the examination may be normal. Tests for heartworm antigen or antibodies toward heartworm can be done on blood.X-rays or ultrasounds of the chest may show enlarged arteries, lung changes, or an enlarged heart, all of which could indicate heartworm infection.

, Unlike dogs, there is no specific treatment for cats with heartworms. An injection of a harsh medication can be given to the cat, but is very risky and unsafe for cats. A surgical procedure to remove the adult worms from the heart can be undertaken by trained veterinarians, but this also is risky and can result in death.The most common treatment is to treat the symptoms, especially if your cat has HARD.
Sometimes a spontaneous death of the worms occurs within two to three years so no treatment may be necessary other than treatment of any symptoms.

Rule out potential medical issues.,
Have your cat’s kidneys and liver tested before giving them an SSRI.,
Discuss the costs of brands, generics, and dosage forms with the vet.,
Combine medication with behavior modification.,
Combine medication with pheromones to treat urine marking.",How to Give Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors to a Cat1," SSRI are often prescribed to treat aggression, urine spraying, and compulsive behaviors; however each of these can result from an underlying medical condition. Aggression could indicate hyperthyroidism, central nervous system issues, and painful conditions like arthritis or dental disease.Urine spraying could indicate urinary tract inflammation, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or diabetes.The vet should give your cat a physical examination and blood screenings to rule out potential underlying issues before prescribing an SSRI.  ;
, A cat’s liver and kidneys process an SSRI, so you should make sure these organs are in good health before giving your cat an SSRI. Have the vet test your cat for kidney and liver disease and overall metabolic function.If your cat takes an SSRI long-term or will take one for the rest of its life, you should have its kidneys and liver screened at least once a year., Medication costs depend on the type of SSRI, brand, dosage strength, and dosage form. If cost is an issue, talk to the vet about ways of reducing treatment cost.

Many generic SSRI are available, so if the vet recommends a more expensive brand, ask if there’s a less costly generic option.If you have trouble administering pills but other dosage forms are more expensive, ask the vet for a pill dispenser or crusher. Ask if they can recommend a liquid or gel form that’s more affordable., An SSRI is not a substitute for behavior modification and training. If you’re dealing with a fearful or aggressive cat, combine medication with desensitization training for best results.For example, if your cat is afraid of or acts aggressively around people, try having someone stand in the next room within visual range of your cat. Pet it, use positive verbal reinforcement, and offer treats to encourage it to reassociate other people with good things. Over the course of several training sessions, have the other person stand gradually closer to the cat until they can offer the cat a treat.
If you need help modifying your cat’s behavior, ask its vet to recommend a certified animal trainer or behaviorist in your area.

, SSRI are often prescribed to treat indoor urine marking. You’ll have the best success treating this problem by using feline pheromones with medication. Have your cat wear a Feliway collar or spray pheromones around your house.Your cat won’t want to mark areas where it can already detect pheromones.
Be sure to stop your cat immediately if you catch it marking and clean up soiled spots with a pet odor neutralizer to deter future marking."

Assess your cat's pain level.,
Consult your veterinarian.,
Make sure that your cat won't react badly to codeine.,
Give your cat the right dosage.,
Make up for missed doses.,
Complete the full prescription unless instructed otherwise.,
Monitor the side effects.,
Taper off of the drug.,
Administer the pill by hand.,
Encourage your cat to swallow the pill.,
Use the three treat trick.,
Divide the pill.,
Crush the pills.",How to Give Codeine to Cats in Pain," A cat may experience pain for a number of reasons, including injury, illness (e.g. arthritis), or old age. While it is difficult to accurately assess your cat's pain level, there are a number of indicators that your cat may present due to its discomfort. Observe your cat to look for signs of pain that you can relay to your veterinarian, including:Aggressiveness
Increased vocalization (e.g. meowing, growling)
Self-harming (e.g. biting itself)
Evasiveness
Decrease in appetite
Reduced mobility;
, Ask your veterinarian if codeine is a suitable option for your cat. Codeine should only be considered after all other milder pain relief options (e.g. milder medications like Ketoprofen), as it is a strong, potentially addictive drug. Codeine is not FDA approved for use in pets, so a veterinarian must write you a prescription before you can administer it to your pet.For instance, codeine might be the best option for an aging cat with severe arthritis that does not respond to milder pain medications.

, Before giving your cat codeine, make sure that doesn't have any conditions that would cause a bad reaction. On the off-chance that your veterinarian may not be aware of all your cat's conditions (or may have overlooked something), avoid giving your cat codeine if it has:A respiratory disease
A heart condition
Kidney or liver problems
Head trauma
Prostate problems

, The proper dosage of codeine for cats is between 0.25 and 1 mg per pound (0.5 to 2 kg). This dosage should be given to cats every 6-8 hours, or 3 times a day. To ensure that you remember, set an alarm on your phone or time each dose to coincide with other daily rituals (e.g. meals).To make it easier to give your cat codeine pills, use a weekly medicine tray to separate and organize the pills.

, If you forget a dose or are unable to give your cat the dose at the correct time, give them the codeine as soon as you are able to. If it is already time for the cat’s next dose, skip the missed dose. It is better to miss a dose than to give your cat two doses at once., Unless your veterinarian advises you to stop, administer the full prescription of codeine to your cat. Consult with your veterinarian after the prescription is done about whether your cat will require more pills. Get your veterinarian's approval if you wish to take your cat off of the medication before that point., Keep a close eye on your cat while you are giving it codeine to watch for side effects of the drug. Some common side effects are manageable (e.g. lethargy), but other symptoms may put your cat at risk for injury or illness. Contact your vet immediately if you observe one or more serious side effects, such as:Vomiting
Labored breathing
Constipation
Sedation

, If you and your veterinarian decide to stop giving your cat codeine, it is best to taper off gradually as an abrupt stop may cause withdrawal symptoms. Start by administering two pills a day instead of three for a week, then move to one pill a day. Stop giving your cat the pill after two to three weeks., Position your cat so that is it sitting up against you with its back to you. With one hand, brace your cat's head gently and tilt it upwards. With the other hand, open your cat's mouth with your middle finger and insert the pill (braced between your thumb and forefinger) as far back on your cat's tongue as you can., Gently close your cat's mouth and hold it closed until your cat swallows the pill. If it hesitates, gently massage its throat under its chin. Once it swallows the codeine, give your cat a treat and lots of praise., Choose a brand of treat that is hollow or soft enough to be molded around a pill. Give your cat one treat, without a pill in it, then immediately give it a treat containing a codeine pill. Have a third treat lined up and ready so that your cat eats the second treat quickly to get to the third., If the codeine pills are too large for your cat to swallow as is, consider cutting them into smaller pieces. Ask your veterinarian if you can use a pill cutter to divide them, as breaking through the coating of a pill can sometimes cause the medication to irritate the stomach lining. If this is allowed, smaller pill fragments can be hidden in treats more easily than full pills., Ask your veterinarian if it is safe to crush codeine pills, as crushing can sometimes affect the potency of a medication. If you go this route, opt to mix the crushed pills into thick, flavorful canned food to mask the taste and texture. Crushed medication often has bitter taste that may deter your cat from eating if it is not properly disguised."

Look for a decreased range of motion.,
Check your cat’s joints.,
Look for lameness in the affected limb.,
Pay attention to your cat’s appetite.,
Pay attention to your cat’s activity levels.",How to Handle Septic Arthritis in Cats1," Because septic arthritis causes swelling in joints, it can prevent your cat from being able to move properly. If you notice your cat seems to be limping when it walks, it might have septic arthritis. Limping is a sign that your cat can't extend its legs as far as usual., The joints affected by septic arthritis will show symptoms. They might be hot or swollen. When you touch one of your cat’s joints, it might yelp or hiss, since septic arthritis can also cause pain there.If you are testing your cat's joints, do so gently. You don't want to cause your cat more pain that necessary.

, If the septic arthritis has advanced far enough, your cat might not be able to move the affected limbs at all. They’ll favor the other limbs that aren’t affected, dragging the ones that are., If your cat is in enough pain, it may lose its appetite. If your cat isn’t eating as much as it normally does, it can be a sign of septic arthritis. However, lack of appetite is a serious symptom regardless of what causes it, so if you notice it in your cat, you should take it to the vet right away., If the septic arthritis has advanced far enough, your cat may not want to move at all. If you notice that your cat is lethargic and not willing to move much, it might have septic arthritis. Lethargy is also a symptom of other serious issues, so if you notice it, you should take your cat to the vet right away."

Give your cat its medication every day.,
Ask the vet if a tablet can be taken with food.,
Put it in a treat or make a meatball.,
Hold the cat’s mouth open to administer a pill without food.,
Ask the vet for a pill gun.,
Calm your cat with a reward and praise.",How to Give Serotonin (5 Ht) Agonists to a Cat1," Like other medications that affect serotonin, a serotonin (5-HT) agonist must be taken every day in order to be effective. The most common dosage schedule is one five mg tablet every twelve hours.Buspirone is the only 5-HT agonist that’s regularly prescribed for pets. It can be used on its own or in combination with a tricyclic (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).;
, Giving your cat a serotonin agonist with food usually makes administering it easier and prevents stomach upset. Before doing so, you should make sure the dosage amount is enough for your cat to absorb and metabolize properly when it’s mixed with food.Ask the vet, “Should I give my cat the tablet you prescribed on an empty stomach or with food? If I crush it and mix it with food, will my cat’s body still absorb it properly?”

, You can try putting the pill in a treat or a Pill Pocket, which can be bought at a pet store. Pill Pockets are specially designed treats with a slot into which you insert a medication tablet. You can also try forming your cat’s wet food into a small meatball with the pill at its center.Give your cat a treat or meatball without medicine before giving it one with the tablet. That way, you’ll see whether your cat eats the meatball whole or breaks it apart.
If your cat breaks the meatball apart, it might notice the tablet and just eat the food around it.  If that happens, or if it doesn’t tolerate the taste of the medicine, you might need to try another method.

, If you have to administer a pill manually, use one hand to hold your cat’s cheekbones and tilt its head. Hold the tablet with your other hand between your index finger and thumb. Use that hand’s fourth finger to open your cat’s mouth by lowering its chin.While holding its mouth open, insert the pill onto the back of the tongue, close the cat’s mouth, and massage its neck to encourage it to swallow.
Avoid getting bit by keeping your fourth finger between your cat’s lower canine teeth as you hold its mouth open.
You might need to administer a pill manually if your cat doesn’t like the taste of medicine mixed with its food, or if the vet advises against taking the pill with food.

, The vet can give you a pill gun, which can make it easier to give your cat its medicine without food. Insert the pill onto the tip of the dispenser, tilt your cat’s head back, and open its mouth. Place the pill gun into your cat’s mouth so the pill sits on the back of its tongue, then release the pill by pressing the plunger.Close your cat’s mouth and massage its neck to encourage it to swallow.
A pill dispenser might be a helpful tool if you have trouble giving your cat its medicine by hand.

, Giving your cat a pill by hand can be a stressful process for both you and your pet. Reward it with a favorite treat and give it plenty of positive verbal praise after giving it medication.


If your cat needs space, give it time to calm down on its own.

Reward your cat after giving it medication.",How to Give Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors to a Cat2," You can typically give your cat an SSRI with food to make administering it easier and prevent stomach upset.However, you should always ask your cat’s vet if they recommend administering any medication with or without food., Try crushing the tablet and mixing it with a small amount of your cat’s favorite food or treat. Go for something with a strong taste and aroma, like canned fish, to disguise the medicine’s flavor.Before crushing the tablet, ask the vet, “Is it ok to crush or split the tablet or capsule and mix it with food, or does it need to be ingested whole?”
Ask the vet if they can give you a pill crusher, or purchase one from your local pet store.

, Pill Pockets are special treats into which you insert a medication tablet. They are available at your nearby pet store and a good choice if your vet advises against giving your cat crushed pills.You can also try forming your cat’s wet food into a small meatball with the pill at its center.
Give your cat a medicine-free treat or meatball before you give it the one with the tablet. This will let you observe whether your cat likes eating food in this form and whether it eats the meatball whole or breaks it apart. If it breaks the meatball apart, you might need to try another method, since your cat will likely notice the tablet and just eat the food around it.

, Give your cat a tablet by hand if it won't take a pill with its food or if the vet tells you to administer the pill without food. Hold the cat’s cheekbones and tilt its head back with one hand. In the other hand, hold the tablet between your index finger and thumb, and use your fourth finger to lower and hold open your cat’s mouth from its chin. Keep your fourth finger between your cat’s canine teeth as you hold its mouth open.

Ask the vet about other dosage forms if you have trouble with tablets.,
Squirt liquid medication between the teeth and cheek.,
Apply a transdermal gel to your cat’s skin or inner ear.",How to Give Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors to a Cat3," The first choice of dosage forms for SSRI is the pill, since it’s generally considered the safest and most efficient method. However, many SSRI also come in liquid and transdermal gels. If you have trouble administering an SSRI in pill form, ask the vet to prescribe another dosage form., You can administer an SSRI in liquid form using a syringe-like dispenser. Insert the dispenser between your cat’s cheek and teeth, then pull the plunger to squirt the medication into its mouth. Massage its neck or blow onto its nose to encourage it to swallow the medicine.Liquid medication is more likely than a pill to enter a cat’s windpipe and pose a choking hazard. Don’t hold your cat’s head back when administering liquid medication to prevent accidental inhalation, and be sure to squirt between its cheek and teeth.

, While absorbed much less efficiently than tablets or capsules, a transdermal gel might be the only safe and feasible option if you have trouble with other dosage forms. To use the applicator, rotate the nozzle to measure out the proper dosage amount. Depending on the vet’s instructions, apply the medication either in your cat’s ear or directly onto its skin.Use your hand to part your cat’s fur when applying a transdermal gel to its skin.

Work with the vet to determine the best SSRI and dosage.,
Report any side effects to the vet.,
Consult the vet before you stop giving your cat an SSRI.",How to Give Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors to a Cat4," An SSRI can require several weeks to take effect, so you’ll need to monitor your cat’s behavior to gauge how well it’s working. After four to six weeks, you might need to bring the cat back to the vet to discuss switching medications or dosage.It usually takes no more than two tries to find an effective medicine and dosage. A vet’s first or second choice of prescribed medication is effective about 75 percent of the time., Call the vet and schedule an appointment if you notice any side effects after starting your cat on an SSRI regimen. SSRI can cause decreased appetite, lethargy, and stomach upset.More serious side effects include seizure, hyperactivity and, in some cats, hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to a drug., Because of its effects on neurotransmitter levels, stopping SSRI treatment can be hazardous to your cat’s health. You should wait at least four weeks after starting treatment before discussing cessation with the vet. Work with the vet to gradually lower dosages to wean your cat off of an SSRI.SSRI are often prescribed on a short-term basis. In many cases, dosage is gradually decreased and eventually eliminated without recurrence of any behavioral issues."

An x-ray will show you and your vet if there’s any permanent change in the joint structure caused by the inflammation., For treatment, your cat will have to be admitted to your vet’s office or an animal hospital. Treatment often requires surgery – although it’s sometimes minimally invasive – and your cat will need to be sedated., To determine the extent of the bacterial infection, your vet will extract joint fluid to perform a bacterial culture. This will tell your vet the best way to treat your cat’s septic arthritis.You cat will be sedated for this, and your vet will be able to tell you how long the drugs will affect your cat., To get all of the bacteria out of the joint that’s affected, your vet might lavage – or wash – the joint. This will require your vet to put your cat under anesthesia, open its skin near the joint, and use a scope to clean out the joint."

Alternate cold and heat packs at home.,
Restrict your cat’s activity.,
Administer antibiotics for 4 to 8 weeks.",How to Handle Septic Arthritis in Cats3," Once your cat is home from surgery, alternating hot and cold packs on your cats joints can give it some relief. Place a heat pack on the affected joints for 10 minutes. Swap it out for a cold pack and leave that on for the same amount of time. You can do this up to a couple of times a day.Your cat might not be willing to sit still while you do this. Try holding your cat in your arms while you hold the packs to its affected limbs. Petting it and speaking to it in a soothing voice while you do so can help calm down your cat.

, While your cat heals, it’s important it doesn’t move more than it needs to. Place its food, water, and litter box near where it's resting. You should also prevent your cat from running and playing as much as possible., The type of antibiotic you give your cat depends on the results of the bacterial culture your vet takes. Any other conditions, illnesses, and medications will also affect the type of antibiotic your vet prescribes. You should give them to your cat for four to eight weeks, even after their symptoms disappear."

Ask the vet to prescribe a liquid or gel if you have trouble with tablets.,
Inject liquid medication between the teeth and cheek.,
Apply a 5-HT agonist in gel form.",How to Give Serotonin (5 Ht) Agonists to a Cat2," Administering buspirone in tablet form is most common, since the tablet is considered the safest and most efficiently absorbed method. However, it’s also available in liquid and transdermal gels. If you have trouble giving your cat pills, discuss other dosage forms with the vet., You can administer buspirone in liquid form using a syringe dispenser. Insert the syringe into your cat’s mouth between its cheek and teeth. Pull the plunger to squirt the medication into its mouth, then massage its neck or blow onto its nose to encourage it to swallow the medicine.The syringe-like dispenser doesn’t have an actual needle, so there’s no need to worry about pricking your cat.
A cat is more likely to accidentally inhale liquid medication than a tablet. To prevent accidental inhalation, avoid holding your cat’s head back when administering liquid medication. Take care to squirt between its cheek and teeth instead of in the back of its mouth.

, While a transdermal gel is absorbed less efficiently than a pill, it could be the only safe and feasible method if your cat won’t tolerate other dosage forms.Measure the proper dosage amount by rotating the applicator nozzle. Depending on the vet’s instructions, apply the medication either in your cat’s ear or directly onto its skin.Part your cat’s fur to apply a transdermal gel directly onto the skin.
Always wear gloves when applying the gel.

Discuss issues like aggression and urine marking with the vet.,
Make sure your cat’s liver and kidneys function well.,
Discuss treatment costs with the vet.,
Monitor your cat for any adverse side effects.,
Talk to the vet before taking your cat off of a serotonin agonist.",How to Give Serotonin (5 Ht) Agonists to a Cat3," Serotonin agonists are used to treat aggression, urine spraying, fear, and other abnormal behaviors.However, each of these can result from an underlying medical condition, so the vet should give your cat a full examination to rule out other potential issues.


Aggression can be related to hyperthyroidism, central nervous system issues, arthritis, or dental disease.Elimination problems (improper urinating and defecating) can be caused by urinary tract inflammation, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or diabetes., Serotonin agonists are processed by a cat’s liver and kidneys, so the vet should screen for kidney and liver disease and overall metabolic function. You shouldn’t give a cat a 5-HT agonist or most other antidepressants if these organs aren’t in good health or if your cat has a history of kidney or liver disease.Serotonin (5-HT) agonists are usually used for less than six to twelve months.However, if your cat takes one for a longer duration or for the rest of its life, you should have its kidneys and liver tested at least once a year., Medication costs will depend on the brand, dosage strength, and dosage form. If cost is an issue, ask the vet about more affordable treatment options.


If they prescribe a buspirone brand, ask for a less costly generic option.Ask if a more affordable antidepressant or antianxiety medication, like a TCA or SSRI, might be an effective option.

, The most common side effects of the 5-HT agonist buspirone are increased affection and playfulness. However, it can also cause dizziness, decreased appetite, stomach upset, and agitation. Some cats are hypersensitive to buspirone, and may exhibit hyperactivity, increased aggression, or seizure.Adverse side effects like drowsiness and restlessness seem to be less common in buspirone than in other medications.Schedule a vet appointment if you notice any side effects.

, Because of buspirone’s effects on brain chemistry, stopping treatment abruptly can be dangerous. Unless you observe any serious side effects or are directed by the vet, you should wait at least three weeks after starting treatment before you consider stopping treatment. Talk to the vet about gradually lowering dosages to wean your cat off of buspirone and other antidepressant or antianxiety drugs."

Ask your veterinarian of you can divide the pills.",How to Give Gabapentin to Cats with Cancer2," Hold your cat against you, facing away from you (wrapped in a towel to restrict its movement, if necessary). With one hand, steady your cat’s head and tilt it upwards. Make sure that your cat stays leaned up against you. , Using your other hand, grasp a Gabapentin pill between your thumb and forefinger. Use your middle finger to open your cat’s mouth as gently as possible and insert the pill. Slide the pill down your cat’s tongue, as far backwards as you can go., Remove your finger and close your cat’s mouth gently. Hold your cat’s mouth closed until it swallows. If this does not occur after a few seconds, gently rub your cat’s throat under its chin to encourage swallowing., If you want to avoid putting your fingers in your cat’s mouth, ask your veterinarian if they can provide you with a pill-giver. This syringe-like device uses a soft nozzle to plunge the pill toward the back of your cat’s mouth, and can be used in the same way you would administer liquid medication with a syringe. After inserting a pill with the pill-giver, gently close your cat’s mouth and encourage it to swallow the pill., Purchase cat treats that are either hollow or soft enough to be molded around a pill. Start by giving your cat one plain treat, then immediately feed it a treat with a pill hidden inside of it. Have a third treat ready at the same time so that your cat consumes the second treat quickly to get to the third., If your cat resists swallowing full size pills, ask your veterinarian if cutting them into smaller pieces is an option. Use a pill cutter to evenly divide the Gabapentin pills into smaller pill fragments, which can be hidden in treats more easily. Very small pill fragments can also be hidden in a small amount of canned food."
"
Look for side effects.,
Observe your cat’s pain level.,
Stop providing the medication gradually, if necessary.",How to Give Gabapentin to Cats with Cancer3," The most common side effects in cats that are given Gabapentin are mild sedation and ataxia (i.e. loss of control of bodily movements). Call your veterinarian if you are concerned that your cat’s symptoms may be too severe or dangerous (e.g. putting your cat at risk for injury). Your cat’s cancer, cancer treatments, or other medications may also be causing side effects, which your veterinarian will best be able to assess., Monitor your cat while it is on Gabapentin to assess the drug’s effectiveness in treating pain. If your pet is experiencing intense pain as a result of its cancer or cancer treatment, it may require a more intense pain reliever (e.g. a strong opioid drug like morphine). Call your vet if your cat’s discomfort does not seem to improve after several days on Gabapentin., If you choose to stop giving your cat Gabapentin, discontinue it gradually over a period of two to three weeks. Stopping the medication abruptly can cause rebound pain or seizures, in some cases. If your cat is on a higher dosage of Gabapentin, ask your veterinarian about switching to a lower dose temporarily to taper off the medication, or administer it less frequently (e.g. once a day instead of every 12 hours)."
"
Assess your cat’s pain.,
Consult your veterinarian.,
Make sure that you get a compounded form of the drug.",How to Give Gabapentin to Cats with Cancer4," If your cat is suffering from cancer, it may experience pain as a result of the disease as well as the treatments for it (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation), which you should convey to your veterinarian. The level of pain that your cat experiences may vary due to factors such as its age, what stage the disease is in, where the cancer is located, and your cat’s personal pain tolerance. While assessing your pet’s comfort level can be a difficult task, there are many probable indicators of pain such as:Decrease in energy
Reclusiveness
Reduced appetite
Negative reaction to touch
Increased vocalization (e.g. whining or hissing)

, Your veterinarian will tell you if Gabapentin is a good pain relief option for your cat during cancer treatment, taking into account its other symptoms and other medications your cat may be taking. The drug can be prescribed by veterinarians for chronic pain treatment and control of seizures. Tell your veterinarian if your pet is receiving antacids or narcotics for pain (e.g. morphine or hydrocodone), or if your pet suffers kidney impairment., Gabapentin is a drug designed for pain relief and seizure control in humans, and is not approved by the FDA for use in pets. While veterinarians can prescribe this medication for cats, the human version is not safe because it contains xylitol, a sweetener that is toxic to pets. Make sure that you receive Gabapentin in a form compounded especially for cats (in either liquid or pill form) before administering the drug.Never administer any form of Gabapentin to your cat that has not been approved and prescribed by your veterinarian.

Consider administering an enema at home only in cases of mild, occasional constipation.,
Take your cat's temperament into account.,
Purchase an appropriate enema.,
Use the correct, lubricated syringe.,
Prepare your environment and materials.,
Wrap the cat in a towel.,
Conduct the enema.,
Palpate the abdominal area.,
Monitor your cat for complications.",How to Give a Cat an Enema at Home," If your cat is constipated, you may notice her repeatedly enter the litter box, squat to defecate, but fail to pass any feces. Your cat may strain and vocalize (meow, cry, yowl) during these attempts. Other symptoms can include low energy, loss of appetite, throwing-up foam or undigested food, and abdominal pain. Sometimes, you can even feel a large hard lump of feces if you gently push on your cat's abdomen.Signs of constipation can look similar to signs of a urinary blockage, which is an emergency that can quickly become life threatening. If you suspect your cat has been straining to urinate, or if you have not seen any urine in the litter box in more than 12 hours, take your cat to the vet to rule out a urinary obstruction.;
, Tumors and foreign objects like hair, bones, and plant material can obstruct the passage of feces.Sometimes diet can play a role in constipation. If your cat has a history of constipation, you might add canned food for extra moisture or enrich the cat's diet with psyllium.Metabolic or endocrine disorders like dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or obesity may also cause constipation. Neurological problems from spinal cord disease, pelvic injuries, or primary nerve dysfunction can cause constipation in some cats. Megacolon may develop when feces is impacted in colon and colon no longer pushes contents along.

, You can try an enema at home if your cat is mildly constipated (less than 2 to 3 days) or when constipation is not chronically observed. If the case is more severe or you think your cat may have a more complicated disorder, seek veterinary care.


Your cat may have a more complicated disorder if you notice changes in water intake, very low energy level, severe vomiting, or a complete loss of appetite. Sometimes, a constipated cat might be slightly less hungry from feeling full or from the discomfort of being constipated, but may still be willing to eat.

, Attempt an enema at home only if your cat is docile and gentle. She shouldn't have other underlying painful or medical conditions like fractures, arthritis, and kidney problems. One potential advantage of giving an enema at home is that your cat is in a more familiar place and may be calmer.


You may want to have a second person present to help gently restrain your cat. Your cat may still be uncooperative and might scratch or bite you. Don't excessively restrain your cat if she is fighting back.

, The best kind of enemas are specifically prepared for cats. These contain dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate in glycerine like Feline Pet-Ema ®. The dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate draws water into the feces causing it to soften. The glycerin portion helps in lubricating the rectum. You can easily find cat enemas for sale online.


Alternatively, consider using warm water or mineral oil. You can also use warm water or mineral oil. Warm clean water is the cheapest and safest option since it's not likely to cause dehydration. Mineral oil is also relatively safe, can easily lubricate the rectum, and help small hardened stools pass. But, it can affect levels of fat soluble vitamins (like vitamin D) and should be avoided in cats with underlying kidney disease. If you use water or mineral oil, know that it can take time before the stool softens since it does not draw water from the intestines like sodium-based enemas do. It also lacks lubricating properties. Expect it to take several flushes into the rectum before the feces softens and slowly comes out (from a few minutes to 2 hours).

Never use Fleet enemas or any other enema containing sodium phosphate. Cats can absorb sodium and phosphate molecules from these enemas into their blood and tissues. This can lead to a severe electrolyte imbalance and dehydration, which could be life-threatening., If you're purchasing a prepared enema kit, it will come with the correct syringe. If you are using water or mineral oil as an enema, use a 10-25 mL syringe and a soft feeding tube attached to its end.The tips of feeding tubes are rounded, soft and can prevent damage during insertion.


Always lubricate the end of the syringe or feeding tube. Place a light coating of lubricant (like KY Jelly or Vaseline) on the end of the syringe or feeding tube., Your bathroom is a great place to do enemas because your cat is familiar with the place, it is enclosed, and the cleaning will be confined to a small place afterwards. Clean all the surfaces and assemble your materials.


An enema can be a messy procedure. You may want to lay out some towels, absorbent pads, or newspaper on the bathroom floor. You'll be best off wearing clean, plastic gloves. It's important that this process is hygienic for you, too.

, Lay out a clean towel and set your cat in the middle. Pull one side up and over your cat's back and around her side, tucking the free end under her feet. Pull the other side of the towel over the opposite direction in a similar fashion. At this point, your cat should be rolled up like a burrito.


If you are alone, snuggle your cat close to your body with her head facing the opposite direction of your dominant hand. Talk to her this entire time in a calm voice. Try to do this during the entire procedure as it will help in calming the cat.

, Lift the cat's tail and gently insert the tip of the enema syringe or feeding tube attached to a 20cc syringe 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) into the rectum. Or you could insert until you feel the hard feces hitting the tip of the rubber tubing. Do not push really hard with the tube or fluid since you could cause rectal trauma or tears, leading to serious medical complications.


If you're going to use mineral oil, apply 15-20 ml slowly into the rectum. If you're going to use warm water, slowly administer 50-75 ml. If you're going to use a Feline Pet-Ema ® Enema, first put in 6 ml at a rate of around 1 ml every 3 seconds. After 1 hour, administer another 6 ml of the enema and follow the same procedure as the first administration.

, Place your palm under the belly between your cat's legs and gently squeeze until you feel the hardened feces. Massage this area in a gentle pinching action using your thumb and the rest of the fingers. In some cats, the feces will come out quickly, after 5 to 10 minutes.


In other cats with very hardened stools, it could take 1 to 2 hours before the softened stool passes. You can repeat the enema in 1-2 hours if no stool passes. If the second enema is ineffective, contact your veterinarian.

, You may notice a few small streaks or specks of bright red blood, and that's okay. But if you see large amounts of blood or continuous rectal bleeding, your cat may have an injury in her rectum. See a vet immediately.

Raise the cat's head.,
Place the syringe in the cat's mouth.,
Begin administering the medicine.,
Finish dosing the medicine.,
Reward the cat.",How to Give Cats Liquid Medicine," In the area where you plan to administer the medication, lay out a large clean towel. Unless your cat is very placid, you will use this later to wrap the cat up in order to keep it still and avoid being scratched.A full-sized beach or bath towel is ideal.
Stretch the towel out so it is entirely flat.
Work at a comfortable and convenient height, such as a table or counter top.;
, Follow the instructions on the bottle or provided by your veterinarian to properly prepare the medication. In many cases liquid medications will need to be shaken before each dosing.


If the medication will be administered directly from the bottle, place it on a flat surface, easily within reach of your dosing area (i.e. the towel)., If your medication will be administered via dropper or syringe, load the syringe with the prescribed amount of medication.


Follow all instructions and measure carefully.
Put the dropper or syringe somewhere it can be easily reached from your dosing area.

, Gently carry your cat to your dosing area (i.e. the towel) and make sure your voice is soothing, happy, and relaxed. Place the cat in the middle of the towel, facing you.

, At this point, you will need to ensure that the cat cannot wiggle or escape during the dosing.


If your cat is very placid, it may be sufficient to hold it. If you have an assistant, he or she should place a hand on each of the cat's shoulders and gently grips the cat's upper forelegs. This keeps the cat still and stops it from lifting a front paw to scratch.You or the assistant can also cuddle the cat to your chest or stomach, to stop the cat backing away or wriggling sideways.If your cat is wiggly or likely to scratch you, you'll need to wrap the cat in the towel. Wrap your feline snugly, with just its head protruding. A snug fit around the neck ensures the claws are safely contained inside and cannot scratch you.To do this, fold one half of the towel over the cat's back and repeat with the opposite half so that the cat is contained within the towel. Take up any slack in the towel around its neck, so that its front legs are pinned against its body and contained within the towel.
If you have an assistant, have him or her put their hands on the outside of the towel, over the cat's shoulders, to steady the animal.

, Form an inverted ""C"" shape with the forefinger and thumb of your left hand. Place this upside-down C over the cat's head. Your fingertip and thumb should be resting on either side of the corner of its mouth, with your palm resting on the cat's forehead. Gently press inwards with the fingertip and thumb, pressing the cat's upper lips over its upper cheek teeth (the molars).If you are left-handed, use your right hand to open the cat's mouth so your left hand is free to administer the medication.
This approach forces the cat to open its mouth slightly in order to avoid biting its own lip, while also minimizing the likelihood that you will be bitten.

, Once the cat has opened its mouth a little, angle its head upwards towards the ceiling.This can be done without shifting your left-hand grip, simply by rotating your wrist. Tipping its head upwards helps the lower jaw to drop down a little, opening the mouth wider.

, Pick up the syringe in your free hand and rest the hub of the syringe (the open end) just behind the cat's lower fangs (the long teeth at the front of the lower jaw), angled over the tongue., Gently and slowly press the syringe's plunger so that about half a milliliter of fluid is dribbled into the cat's mouth.Once you have put medicine in the cat's mouth, it will move its tongue and try to swallow.
Some cats like to lower their head to swallow, so you may need to relax your wrist so that her head can drop down to a more natural position for swallowing., After the cat has had a chance to swallow, give it another half milliliter of medicine.


Repeat this process until you have administered the full prescribed dose.

, Talk soothingly to the cat as you slowly unwrap the towel. Most likely, the cat will run off as soon is it can, but if it doesn't give it some affection and maybe a tasty treat.


Rewarding the cat after giving it medicine will make it less resentful and make the task easier next time.

Make sure your cat is hydrated.,
Decide where to perform the injection.,
Choose an appropriate site of injection.,
Rub the injection site with an alcohol swab.,
Use food as a distraction.",How to Give a Cat an Injection1," If you're administering subcutaneous injections to your cat, it is imperative that your cat remain hydrated prior to and following the injection. If your cat is severely dehydrated, the medication you administer may not be fully absorbed.This should not be a problem for most healthy cats, but if you suspect your cat may be dehydrated you should talk to your veterinarian about keeping her well-hydrated.;
, You may wish to hold the cat in your lap to comfort her during the injection, but this increases the chances that your cat may scratch or injure you, and it may cause her to associate being in your lap with receiving injections. If you do decide to hold the cat in your lap, it's best to put a thick towel down to cover your legs. However, the best location is a flat surface, like a table top., The site of injection will vary, depending on whether you're giving a simple subcutaneous injection or an intramuscular injection. But even within those parameters, giving your cat too many injections in the same spot can create problems for your cat. That's because a cat's body takes between six to eight hours to fully absorb the fluids administered by injection.Giving too much medication in one spot before it is absorbed can cause a fluid buildup, called an edema.This can cause discomfort for your cat, and could prevent a lot of the medicine you're giving from running its course in your cat's body.


You should be able to administer about five to ten milliliters of medicine per pound of body weight (or about 10 to 20 ml of medicine per kg of body weight) before you'll need choose a new injection site.Check your cat to ensure that fluid injections are being adequately absorbed. You can do this by feeling along the injection site, as well as along the belly below the site of injection, as fluids tend to pool along the cat's underside., Most cats won't need this step unless they are suffering from a compromised immune system. But killing bacteria isn't the only benefit of an alcohol swab; rubbing alcohol can also help keep your cat's thick coat down flat, making it easier to see the skin when you give her an injection.Unlike a human's relatively hairless skin, a cat's thick coat takes about thirty minutes to be completely clean of bacteria after an alcohol swab.Therefore, if you need to swab the site of injection, you should do so about a half hour before you actually administer the medicine, and try to keep that site clean (by keeping her from rubbing the swabbed area against waste in the litter box, for example) until you can give her the injection.

, Right before you administer an injection, give your cat a treat she really enjoys, like canned cat food or tuna fish. As soon as she starts to eat the food, gently pinch her skin where you will be giving the injection. After about five seconds you should stop pinching and remove the food. Return the food, and pinch a little harder this time. Repeat this until your cat becomes tolerant of the pinching and remains focused on the food. This will help prep her for the injection, and reduce the pain and stress she experiences when you give her the shot."

Place the medication in the cat's mouth.,
Make sure the cat swallows.,
Release the cat gradually from restraint.",How to Deliver Oral Medication to Cats," Try feeding the medication to your cat without restraining it. Gel medication is generally flavored to appeal to a cat’s taste. In fact, cats will frequently lick it off a finger or surface readily. Gel medication can also be smeared on a cat’s shoulder for it to lick off or quickly smeared inside the lips with a swipe of a finger.;
, Liquid medication and occasionally pills can be mixed with a flavorful canned food and eaten by the cat when it normally eats. Be sure to mix the medication in thoroughly, so that the cat cannot, or has a hard time, avoiding it. Some cats, for example, can detect pills in their food and eat around them.


If you are trying to feed your cat pills in its food, be sure to inspect the bowl afterword for leftover pills.
Check the directions for medication in pill form to see if you can crush it up. Your cat is more likely to eat a crushed up pill mixed into its food than a whole pill mixed into the food.

, If your cat won't eat its medicine in its normal food, try enticing it with a special treat. Get a bit of tuna or other smelly morsel and put the pill in it. You can also use a piece of cheese, a bit of deli meat, or a bit of hotdog.Feed the treat directly to the cat, instead of letting it pick at it in a food dish. This way it is less likely to pick out the pill and avoid eating it.
There are treats specifically designed so that you can hide a pill in them. These ""pill pockets"" have a hole inside where you can conceal the treat and they smell strongly, so your cat will be enticed by them. Make sure the cat has actually swallowed the pill. Feed the cat another piece of treat immediately after the one with the pill. This will make it more likely to quickly swallow the pill.

, The types of restraint that can be used on a cat include a scruff hold, a harness hold, or the towel technique. Figure out if your cat will put up a lot of resistance or just a little. Is your cat apprehensive even about being petted? Then it will probably need a lot of restraint. Is your cat pretty passive? Then if probably won't need much restraint. The key to successfully delivering medication to your cat is to safely restrain the cat while applying as little restraint as possible.


Restraining the cat gives you control over the cat and allows you to make sure the cat swallows the medication in a safe manner.
An improperly restrained cat may spit out the medication or, even worse, get some of the medication into its lungs which may lead to pneumonia or even death.

, This type of restraint will only work for a cat that mildly resists taking medicine. Firmly grab a handful of the loose neck skin behind the cat’s ears. As long as you do not attempt to lift the cat by the scruff it is a perfectly acceptable means of restraint.This technique should only be used when the cat is resting its body on a flat surface, such as a table, floor, or counter.
While holding the scruff, you can also grab the rear legs to lay the cat stretched out on its side. The front feet will often grab onto the table’s edge, keeping the cat still.

, A harness can be used to keep a firm grip on the cat. These are more preferable than a collar, which can hurt the neck or strangle a cat. A properly fitted harness will give you a good handle on the cat when light restraint is needed.

, This will only leave the cat's head exposed. Thick bath-sized towels can be used to keep a cat tightly bound so its paws cannot claw at you. This is one of the best options, as it keeps you and the cat safe.


Start by placing the towel, unfolded, on a table or countertop. Put the cat in the center of the towel. Pull the towel up over the cat’s rear end and then fold in the sides, essentially wrapping the kitty up like a burrito.Make sure the sides are pulled up snug to keep the cat from being able to pull its legs out of the towel.
Remember a cat can still use its teeth when in this position. Placing a hand behind the cat’s head can keep the head steady but you should also keep your hands away from its mouth.

, Keep in mind that if a cat defecates or urinates while being restrained it is becoming too agitated for restraint. If this happens you should release it. You will need to try another restraint technique or get professional help if this happens., It's important to be all set up before attempting to restrain your cat. If you need to put medication in a syringe or count out pills, do that before grabbing the cat. Have the medication near by, so that you can easily grab it while you have the cat restrained., If you are giving a tablet or capsule you may need to wash it down to actually get the cat to swallow it. Thus, it is helpful to have a small syringe filled with 1 to 2 milliliters (0.034 to 0.068  fl oz) of water to help wash the pill down.

, You can hold a towel wrapped cat in your lap. If you are simply holding the cat by its scruff or by a harness, hold it against a hard surface.


If you have a helper, have him or her hold the cat. This way you can open the cat's mouth and give the animal its medicine without the added burden of holding it still.
Keep out of harms way. Do not get close enough to the cat's mouth to get bitten.

, Put your thumb on one side of the cat's mouth and your forefinger on the other side of the mouth. Apply pressure gently by pressing down on the cat’s lower jaw until your cat opens its mouth., You can now quickly place a tablet or capsule toward the back of the cat’s mouth. Liquid medication can also be delivered at this point, putting it into the back of the mouth but not squirting at the back of the throat. This type of medicine may need to given a little at a time, so that the cat swallows it and it doesn't run out the front of the mouth.Squirting liquid medicine at the back of the throat could cause the cat to inhale it.

, Let go of the cat’s mouth and hold its top jaw or face so that its nose points upward. Rub your cat's throat gently to trigger its swallowing reflex.


Use the syringe to place a small amount of water in between the cats lips to encourage the pill to go down the throat. This prevents the pill from irritating or sticking in the throat and damaging the tissues.
Do not shoot the water down the back of the throat, as the cat could inhale the water into it’s lungs.

, Keep the cat restrained for a minute to make sure all medication is swallowed and the cat is calm. Also make sure to protect yourself from the scratching that might occur as you let the cat go free.


Give your cat a lot of praise and some tasty treats as a reward for good behavior.

Find a patch of loose skin.,
Insert the needle.,
Pull back on the plunger before injecting.,
Inject the medication.,
Check for bleeding or leakage.,
Dispose of the used needle properly.",How to Give a Cat an Injection2," Generally, on a cat, the area of skin between the neck and the back are the loosest and most flexible patches of skin.Gently pinch the skin where it's loosest and hold it between your thumb and forefinger while distracting your cat with food. This is called ""tenting"" the skin, as it should somewhat resemble an erected pup tent (also known as a shelter-half)., Once you've got the loose skin firmly between your fingertips, you should see a narrow strip of skin between your thumb and index finger. Insert the needle into that strip of skin.The needle should be kept parallel to the skin along your cat's back at all times. Angling the needle could cause it to pierce through the skin and stab your finger.Do not hold your thumb over the plunger until you're certain that the needle is correctly inserted. Holding the plunger while inserting the needle could cause a premature injection, if the cat flinches or if you've incorrectly inserted the needle., Before you inject the medicine, it's important that you slightly pull back on the plunger. This is to ensure that you've hit an acceptable site for the injection.If blood enters the syringe when you pull back the plunger, it means you've hit a blood vessel. You'll need to remove the needle and try again in a different spot.If air bubbles enter the syringe, it means you've stuck the needle all the way through the pinched skin and have drawn in air from the room. You'll need to remove the needle and try again, perhaps in a different spot.If no blood or air bubbles enter the syringe, you've hit an acceptable location, and may proceed with the injection., Be sure that you inject all of the medicine in the syringe. Once the syringe is completely empty, carefully remove the needle, moving along the same path you used to insert the needle.Hold the syringe between your index and middle fingers, and use your thumb (on the same hand) to press down the plunger., Once you've completed the injection, you'll need to check the site of injection, looking for blood or for any medicine leaking out of the needle hole. If you detect either blood or medicine emerging from the site of injection, use a clean cotton ball or tissue to apply pressure to the site until the secretion stops. This should only take a minute or so, but may take longer if your cat is moving around too much., Do not dispose of a syringe in your household trash, as needles are considered biohazardous waste. Contact your vet's office to find out if they collect used needles for disposal. Never put an uncapped needle in the trash, as this could cause injury or infection to the refuse collector or anyone else who handles your garbage.

Insert the needle.,
Pull back on the plunger before injecting.,
Inject the medication.,
Check for bleeding or leakage.,
Dispose of the needle properly.",How to Give a Cat an Injection3," Your veterinarian should have given you specific instructions on where to administer intramuscular medication, and you should follow those instructions carefully. As a general rule, most vets recommend administering intramuscular injections in the quadricep muscles (cranial thigh) or the lumbar spinal epaxial muscles (dorsal muscles along the spine).Be extremely cautious while administering intramuscular injections. A misplaced needle could cause serious damage to your cat's nerves.For this reason, it's best to follow any and all instructions given by your veterinarian. If you're uncertain about any part of your vet's instructions, or if you can't find the recommended site of injection at home, call or visit your vet for more thorough guidance.

, The needle should be angled between 45 and 90 degrees, depending on the site chosen for injection.It may be helpful to hold your cat's muscle flat, to prevent movement and ensure that the needle enters the muscle correctly.


Ensure that you insert the needle at the proper angle your vet demonstrated to you. Inserting the needle at too shallow an angle could prevent the injection from reaching the intended depth and penetrating the muscle.Do not hold your thumb over the plunger of the syringe until you're certain that the needle is inserted correctly. Touching the plunger while inserting the needle could result in a premature injection, should the cat flinch or the needle go in wrong., Much like administering a subcutaneous injection, you'll want to slightly pull back on the plunger before injecting the medicine. Air bubbles shouldn't be a problem with intramuscular injections, but if you see blood you'll need to withdraw the needle and try again, as this can indicate that a blood vessel has been hit., It's important to ensure that all of the medication dosage in the syringe has been injected. Once the syringe is completely emptied, withdraw the needle along the same path you used to insert the needle.While holding the syringe between your index and middle fingers, use your thumb (on the same hand) to press the plunger down., Once you've completed the injection, check the site of injection for blood or leaked medicine. If you see signs of blood or leaking medicine, use a clean cotton ball or tissue to apply pressure at the site of injection. It should only take about one minute for the bleeding or leakage to stop, with proper pressure., Used syringes are considered a biohazard, and as such they should never be disposed of in household trash or left uncapped in the garbage. Ask your vet's office about whether they collect used needles for disposal.

Regularly inspect your cat for injuries.",How to Clean a Cat Wound," Sterile saline, such as that found in first aid kits, is the ideal substance for flushing a contaminated wound.The physical act of washing removes the bacteria and debris, while the saline is so similar to the pH of the body tissues that it causes minimal tissue damage.


The trick to using saline is to use large volumes and keep washing until the area looks clean.;
, For a very dirty wound with lots of mud or gravel in it, an alternative is to boil water and then let it cool. Use this water to literally wash the area clean.


There is a slight risk using water that it will damage the exposed tissue bed, as it does not have the same composition as body fluids and therefore draws fluid out of damaged tissue. However, medical studies have shown that using tap water to irrigate a wound does not have a huge impact on whether the wound eventually gets infected., Salt water has natural disinfectant properties and is a good standby for cleaning a cat's wound. To make a salt water solution boil the kettle, measure out a cup of water,and add half a teaspoon of salt. Then stir to dissolve and leave to cool.


This salt water is also around the same composition as tears and body fluids, so it is less damaging to exposed tissue than commercial disinfectant solutions or water alone.

, There are a variety of disinfectants that are sold for use on pet wounds. The most common are providone-Iodine and chlorhexidine. Consult with your veterinarian if you want to have one of these products on hand if your cat gets scratched up.


Remember, not all disinfectants are safe for cats. Those contained phenol are toxic to felines. Read the label to see if the product is a phenolic disinfectant, and avoid using if it is. Another sign the product contains phenol is if it goes cloudy when water is added. If in doubt, avoid and use an alternative.
To use povidone-Iodine dilute it by mixing 1 ml of povidone-iodine with 100 ml of water.Use this solution to wash away contamination from the surface of the wound.
To use chlorhexidine mix 2.5ml of chlorhexidine with 100 ml of water to make the correct strength to clean a wound.Chlorhexidine is the active constituent in many surgical scrubs, such as Hibiscrub. It is a pink soapy solution that needs to be diluted in water. Chlorhexidine has good antibacterial properties and also has a slight residual action, which means it keeps on working at killing bacteria for a while after it has dried.

, Another popular wound cleansing agent is hydrogen peroxide. However, this has the potential to be very damaging to tissue if used undiluted. The 'myth' is that the fizzing as the peroxide contacts the wounds is simply killing the bacteria, but unfortunately it is also damaging the tissue bed, which needs to be healthy for future healing.


The correct dilution is to take a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide and mix one part peroxide with three parts water (for example 25 ml of peroxide with 75ml of water) to make a disinfectant solution that is suitable for cleaning wounds., The disinfectant to use is a matter of personal preference and what you have available. Always follow the instructions on how to dilute the product, because using it too concentrated can be damaging to tissue. Be aware that many household disinfectants and some disinfectant sprays contain benzalkonium chloride and are not designed for use on living tissue.If in doubt as to the suitability of a product for use on a cat, then consider just using a saline or salt water solution instead, as this is always safe.

, Your cat may be in pain or shaken up after an injury and it may lash out when you touch the sore area. This is true even if it is normally sweet tempered. With this in mind, try to enlist the help of a friend or neighbor to hold the cat so that you can concentrate on the wound.


Try wrapping the cat in a large bath towel with just the wound exposed. This is a good way to keep it calm and minimize the risk from teeth and claws., Grab your chosen rinsing solution and place it in a bowl. Use a syringe to suck up the solution, and then squirt it over the wound to rinse and clean it. Repeatedly spray the wound this way until you are happy the wound is clean.


Fresh bite wounds need to be cleaned and disinfected, to reduce the risk of infection.Scrape wounds sustained if the cat was hit by a car or fell from a tree, may be contaminated with grit, gravel, and bacteria. A thorough cleaning to remove contamination helps reduce the risk of complications, such as poor healing or infection.

, If you do not have a syringe, then soak clean cotton wool in the cleaning solution and squeeze the cotton wool so the solution runs down over the wound. If the area is very contaminated, and this is not lifting the debris away, then use downward stroking movements with the cotton wool to clean the area.


Use a clean piece of soaked cotton wool for each downward wipe, so that the dirty piece does not recontaminate the wound on the next downward pass. Keep cleaning until the cotton wool comes away clean, and then finish with a rinse.
If your cat has a burst abscess, a considerable volume of pus may leak from the wound. Use dry cotton wool, gauze, or absorbent paper tissue to wipe away the pus. Apply gentle pressure to the area around the abscess, pressing inward towards the tooth mark through which the pus is draining. It is important to remove as much pus as possible or it will act as an ongoing source of infection.

, Once you have cleaned away the gross contamination, you can start applying the disinfectant. Follow the directions on the packaging for proper application.


The aim is to wipe away infection until you expose healthy, uncontaminated tissue and then apply the disinfectant.

, Most wounds are best left open to the air, so do not attempt to bandage or cover a small, insignificant wound. However, if the cat is trying to lick or chew the wound then it needs to be covered. In these cases, the healing of the wound may be compromised.There is a myth that it's healthy for a cat to lick a wound. In truth, that abrasive tongue is likely to damage exposed tissues rather than promote healing.

, As a cat owner, it's important to know your cat's normal behavior. This will help you to assess whether something is wrong. Look for changes in behavior, including, but not limited to, changes in eating patterns, types of movement, and interest in socializing.These can be the signs of a variety of illnesses, including physical trauma.
If your cat's personality or behavior has changed drastically, and you can't figure out why, take it to a veterinarian. These changes could be symptoms of a medical problem.

, If you heard a cat fight, or your cat comes back limping, then check the cat over for signs of trauma. A tell-tale sign of a fight are tufts of hair that are clumped together. Look at the cat and check to see if any areas of the coat look unkempt or are sticking up at an odd angle.Gently investigate the cat's body by parting the fur and looking at the skin underneath.


Alternatively you may find an area of hair loss, where the aggressor cat pulled the fur out. The area may have a wound, or you might see spots of blood or see a swollen area.This is easiest to spot on white or pale coated cats. For a black cat, gently run your hands over it and watch for a reaction to tenderness, or feel for a wound, swelling, or scabs.

, You may not always witness a fight or see the signs of a fight on your cat's coat. This is why it is important to regularly inspect your cat for injuries that you might otherwise miss. This is especially important to do if your cat is an outdoor cat, and if it's prone to fighting.


A good time to do this is when you are snuggling and petting the cat. Keep the cat calm and gently sweep your hand over the body while looking at the skin beneath the fur.
Older wounds may be infected, in which case you may find swelling, a scab, hair loss, or a bloody or purulent discharge.
Old abscesses that have burst often contain a lot of pus which mats the fur.
Also, the skin over the abscess dies off and can leave a considerable hole behind, through which you can see muscle or exposed tissues.

Identify risk factors.",How to Check Cats for Dehydration," Some causes warrant immediate medical attention in any cat no matter his age or general health status. These causes include as any suspicion of internal bleeding, burns, moderate to severe wounds, significant or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, lack of appetite that lasts for more than 24 hours in an adult cat or 12 hours in a young kitten, open-mouth breathing, or high fever., In its early stages, dehydration is easy to miss. In fact, even the most subtle physical signs aren't detectable until the cat is at least 4 or 5% dehydrated.Because of how subtle the signs are, you should pay attention to how much your cat drinks every day. Notice if he is drinking less or none at all.


You should also make sure you keep plenty of fresh water around for him, especially if you are going to be away for an extended period of time, such as work or all day outing.

, One way to tell if your cat is dehydrated is to check his gums. Use your finger to push up his upper lip and expose his gum line. Touch your finger to the gum. In a well-hydrated cat, the gum tissue should feel moist. As the cat becomes more and more dehydrated, his gums start to dry. If the gum tissue feels sticky or tacky, the cat may be showing the first signs of dehydration.


If the gum tissue actually feels dry, the cat may be moderately or severely dehydrated, depending on other signs. Gums usually don't feel completely dry until a cat is at least 6 to 7% dehydrated.Keep in mind that your cat's gums will rapidly dry in the air after you raise the upper lip, so you need to assess moistness immediately.
If your cat's gums feel dry, sticky, or tacky or you aren't certain whether or not the gums are normal, examine the cat further to help you decide whether the pet is dehydrated or how dehydrated he is.

, The CRT is the amount of time it takes the capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels, in the gums to refill with blood. Because dehydration reduces blood volume, this time is increased in dehydrated pets.To check CRT, press your finger to the cat's gum and release it. The skin should blanch or turn white. If it doesn't, try again and press a little harder. After you lift your finger, count the number of seconds it takes the blanched skin to return to its normal color.


In a healthy, well-hydrated cat, the skin should return to normal color in less than 2 seconds.
In a moderately dehydrated cat, this may take slightly longer. In cases of more severe dehydration, this refill time may be even more noticeably prolonged.
CRT does not usually increase in cases of mild dehydration, so an increased CRT may indicate moderate to severe dehydration and warrants veterinary attention.
If the gums are very pale or white before you press on them, take the cat to the vet right away. Pale gums can be a sign of more advanced dehydration., Another early sign of dehydration is a subtle loss of skin elasticity. This becomes more pronounced as dehydration worsens. Check elasticity by choosing an area of skin along your cat's back or chest. Avoid the skin on the back of the neck since it is thick and may give misleading results. Gently pinch the skin between two of your fingers and release it. Observe the skin you pinched.


In a healthy, well-hydrated cat, the skin should snap back into place immediately. In a mildly dehydrated cat, the skin may not snap back into place as quickly as it would in a well-hydrated animal.
In a moderately to severely dehydrated cat, the skin will be obviously slow in returning to place, and in a profoundly dehydrated cat, the skin may stay in the pinched position instead of snapping back into place.It is important to realize that this test is not always completely accurate. Old or emaciated animals often have less elastic skin than younger animals, so their skin may not snap into place quickly even if they are well hydrated.Kittens under 6 weeks of age have less skin elasticity than adult cats. Overweight pets have a lot of subcutaneous fat, so they may not have obvious loss of skin elasticity until they are severely dehydrated., Your cat's eyes can give you important information about hydration status. Slightly sunken eyes in an otherwise healthy cat can signal moderate dehydration. It is important to note, however, that very thin cats, especially older cats or those with chronic illnesses, may have slightly sunken eyes normally.Severely sunken eyes that appear dry can indicate severe dehydration. In some advanced cases, the third eyelid may even be visible.If the eyes appear dry, sunken or the third eyelid is protruding, the cat should receive prompt veterinary attention.

, In a cat with other signs of dehydration, paws that feel cool to the touch can indicate moderate to severe dehydration.To assess this, gently pick up your cat. Hold his paw in the palm of your hand and note the temperature. If it feels like the normal temperature of your cat, then he is not moderately dehydrated. If his paws feel cool or cold, this could be a sign of severe dehydration and you should get him to the vet as soon as you can.

, If your cat is showing signs of dehydration, you need to make a visit to the veterinarian. You should consult a veterinarian as soon as your cat exhibits signs of dehydration, since the condition is far easier to correct in its earliest stages. If you suspect your cat is moderately to severely dehydrated, or if the animal is lethargic or unresponsive, get your pet to the veterinarian right away.


Let the vet know it is an emergency so you can be seen faster. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency.
In addition to confirming the results of your physical examination and assessing your cat's history, your veterinarian can run tests to help determine how dehydrated your cat is and to decide on an appropriate course of treatment.

, In addition to a physical examination, your vet may run some basic tests to access the state of your cat's dehydration. Some basic tests veterinarians use to assess hydration include a blood test to assess the packed cell volume (PCV). If the PCV will be higher than normal, your cat is likely dehydrated.The vet may also run a urine sample to check its concentration. Usually, when animals are dehydrated, the kidneys concentrate urine to conserve water. If your cat has kidney disease or a hormone imbalance, however, he may not be able to appropriately concentrate his urine even when he is dehydrated.Other tests can be run depending on the suspected underlying cause of the dehydration.

, Once the veterinarian assesses your cat, she will calculate the approximate degree of dehydration and formulate a fluid treatment plan. The best way to correct moderate to severe dehydration is by providing intravenous fluids. You also will need to address the underlying cause of the dehydration in your cat in order to remedy the situation in the future.


In cases of severe dehydration, immediate, aggressive intravenous fluid therapy is required to ensure the cat's recovery.

, Because early signs of dehydration are subtle and easy to miss, being able to identify potential dehydration risk factors and situations that could lead to dehydration in your cat is important. You should look for common underlying causes of dehydration such as not eating or drinking enough, excessive urination, vomiting, diarrhea, burns or other skin damage, internal or external bleeding, fever, and loss of fluid inside the body due to internal bleeding or other inappropriate shift of fluid out of the blood vessels.


Sick or debilitated cats and young kittens are especially vulnerable to this condition. If your cat fits this description, you should be especially vigilant in looking for these factors. These are always cause for alarm and warrant veterinary attention. , Certain medical and environmental conditions make dehydration more likely, so pets suffering from these conditions are at increased risk of becoming dehydrated. This means you should watch pets with these conditions very closely for early signs of dehydration. Examples of such conditions include kidney disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal parasites, various infectious diseases, and heat exhaustion.

Ask your vet to show you how to properly load the syringe, and have them walk you through where and how to inject the medication.It is also advisable to ask your vet about any aftercare needed for the injection site. Typically, injection sites just need to be carefully monitored, but your vet may also recommend further care depending upon the medication being used.
If you feel nervous or unprepared to administer this injection, do not be afraid to ask your vet for additional training. It is part of their job to help you get comfortable enough giving the injection that you can do it properly and pose minimal risk to yourself or your pet.;
, Cold injections often hurt. If you are providing and injection of medication that is stored in the fridge, take the medication out and allow it to warm up for half an hour or so before injecting.Do not warm up medication in the microwave or on the stove. This could impact the medication's effectiveness, and also has the potential to hurt your cat.

, Many cats do not mind routine injections, as the needle point is kept very sharp to minimize discomfort. However, if your cat tends to dislike being handled, or if they become aggravated when they get a shot from the vet, it may be a good idea to calmly and gently restrain your cat.If your cat is comfortable sitting on your lap for the injection, remember to place a towel or blanket across your legs to help keep you from getting scratched.
It may be helpful to have a second person hold the cat, protecting themselves with a blanket, while you administer the medication. This way, you do not have focus on restraining the cat while you provide the injection.You may also be able to distract your cat with a small treat such as canned food during the injection process., Each needle and syringe is sterile until it is removed from its packaging, as is the medication. Prepare the injection so that you are ready to give it as soon as the syringe is filled, and avoid putting it down on counters or other potentially unclean surfaces. To prepare the injection, place the needle tip into the medication and pull back the plunger of the syringe until you have taken up the recommended dose.A sterile syringe and needle should be used for every injection.
If you are unclear about the recommended dose, check the medication packaging or call your vet.

, Subcutaneous injections are the most common injection that owners will have to administer to their cat, and most subcutaneous medications can easily be administered directly into the folds of skin around the cat’s neck. If you are giving a subcutaneous injection, gently pull the scruff of the neck upward so that it is sticking up like a small pyramid. Hold the skin in place between your thumb and index finger while you inject.Subcutaneous injections are the most common, but they are not the only type of injection a pet owner may be asked to give. Different types of injections have different injection sites. If you are not sure what type of injection you are administering, contact your vet for verification.
If you are not giving a subcutaneous injection, simply locate the injection site your vet showed you. Make sure it is clear of any debris or matting before injecting.

, When your cat and its skin are in place, quickly insert the needle into the skin at about a 45 degree angle. Depress the plunger to inject the medication, and withdraw the needle from the skin as soon as the medication has been administered.It is important to administer the medication quickly, but not in such a rush that you are not able to do so properly. Do not feel so rushed that you panic and fail to perform the injection properly. It is ok to take a few seconds to fully administer the injection.

, Collect the used needles and syringes in a plastic container with solid walls and a sealable lid. Place all used needles and syringes in this container, and don’t forget to reseal it after disposing.Keep the container some place secure, out of reach from children and pets, and away from an area where it could fall over or get knocked down on someone.
As the container fills, take the used needles and syringes to your vet or a nearby pharmacy for disposal. Most communities have strict regulations regarding medical waste, prohibiting you from simply throwing the old needles in the trash., After you administer the injection, use the pads of your fingers to gently massage the injection site for a minute. This applies gentle pressure to the area to stop any small amounts of bleeding that may occur due to the injection.If your cat is sensitive after an injection, it is alright to let them go without massaging the injection site, so long as they are not bleeding profusely or uncontrollably.
If you notice your cat bleeding excessively after injection, contact your vet or a nearby animal hospital immediately.

, After injection, be sure to give your cat affection and praise for any good behavior. Reward them with scratching or petting, and perhaps a treat. This is especially important for cats who receive regular injections, such as insulin, as it helps them associate the experience with positive outcomes., After injection, be sure to monitor the site for any swelling, excessive bleeding, discoloration, leaking medication, or excessive tenderness. If you notice any of these complications arising, contact your vet immediately, as it may be an indication of a bad injection or a negative reaction to the medication.Try not to inject your cat in the exact same location every day, as this may cause soreness or tenderness. Find a few different spots within the prescribed injection site, and rotate injecting in each of them so that the others have the chance to heal.

Inspect your cat’s mouth if you see red sores appearing on the upper lip.The sores may be covered in scabs, or they may bleed and give off a foul odor.
In rare instances, sores may develop on other areas of the body.;
, In some cases when a cat is inflicted with rodent ulcers it will stop eating or it will eat less than normal. This is because the lesions on their mouth are sore making it painful to chew food.If you notice your cat has a decreased appetite you should check for sores and take it to the vet.

, The cat may exhibit signs of pain caused by the rodent ulcers. For example, the cat may hide or become aggressive. If your cat demonstrates any major behavioural changes, you should check for sores and take it to the vet., If your cat has developed sores on its lips and inside its mouth, you should consult your vet for a formal diagnosis. Your vet will be able to diagnose rodent ulcers simply by examining the lesions.In rare instances the veterinarian may need to perform a biopsy to ensure that the ulcers are not cancerous. This typically only happens if the ulcers do not respond to treatment.

, Steroid injections are the most common way to treat rodent ulcers in cats. Your veterinarian will give the cat an injection in order to treat the ulcer. These injections will be given once every two to three weeks, until the sores have disappeared., Rodent ulcers can also be treated by giving your cat prednisone orally. Your veterinarian will prescribe pills that are given orally every 24 hours until the lesions are gone. In order to properly administer the medication, follow the directions provided by your veterinarian., In some instances the ulcers may become infected. If this happens, your vet will likely prescribe an antibiotic in order to treat the infection alongside the lesions. Take the antibiotics as directed by the veterinarian., Some vets believe that essential fatty acids can help relieve stress in cats and reduce allergic reactions in some instances. If you are not feeding your cat a premium food, they may not get enough fatty acid in their diet. Change to a new food that is higher in essential fatty acids or give your cat a supplement, as directed by their vet., Rodent ulcers are typically caused by an allergic reaction. As a result, they may recur if you are unable to determine what is causing the allergy. If the ulcers return, take your cat to the vet and repeat the treatment.

, Some cats will have an allergic skin reaction to fleas. This reaction can cause rodent ulcers to develop. If your vet suspects that fleas may have caused the development of the ulcers, you will need to treat the fleas and prevent future infestations. Talk with your vet about the best treatment and prevention option for your cat.For example, your vet may prescribe Advantage or Frontline Plus which are given monthly and treat and prevent fleas.

, Some cats have food allergies that could contribute to the formation of rodent ulcers. Your vet can help conduct a food allergy trial to determine if food is causing the ulcers. Once you have discovered the cause, change your cat’s food to prevent future outbreaks., The rodent ulcers may be caused by an allergic reaction to plastic or rubber. For example, if your cat eats and drinks from plastic or rubber bowls, you should consider switching to stainless steel bowls. Stainless steel is less likely to cause an allergic reaction."

Look for signs of choking.,
Be aware of signs that mimic choking.,
Assess whether it is likely that the cat is actually choking.,
Keep the cat calm during an episode that is only mimicking choking.,
Check the color of the cat's gums.,
Deal with the situation immediately.,
Wrap the cat securely in thick material, such as a towel.,
Look in the cat's mouth.,
Try to expel the obstruction.,
Treat an unconscious cat differently.,
Make an appointment to see the vet quickly if you do manage to remove the obstruction.,
Get the cat to the vet immediately if you don't manage to dislodge the obstruction.",How to Save a Choking Cat," These are important to identify quickly. The signs of a choking cat include:Inability to breathe
Coughing forcefully
Drooling or gagging
Pawing at the mouth;
, These include an exaggerated breathing effort involving the whole body, while at the same time the cat makes a whistling noise as it tries to breath out. These movements and sounds can be quite dramatic.Cats can make things harder for humans because they're fond of coughing up fur balls or retching up grass, each of which could mislead you into thinking that the cat is choking. In fact, retching is frequently confused with choking by cat owners, as it's a common symptom in cats., Ask yourself, ""What was the cat doing immediately before hand?"". If the cat was asleep, or quietly walking across a room, and starts making choking noises then it is unlikely it is choking. This is because it didn't pick anything up in its mouth, so it hasn't had access to any thing to get stuck.

, These episodes can be caused by a cat taking a sudden deep breath and pulling part of the soft palate against the larynx (the entrance to the airway). Then repeated deep breaths keep suctioning the soft palate against the airway. Simply calming the cat and getting it breathing slowly usually does the trick.


Speak to the cat gently, try petting its fur, and even stroke it under the chin.
Sometimes it helps to get the cat to swallow, which releases suction on the soft palate and allows the anatomy to realign correctly. To get a cat to swallow try offering it a super tasty treat., If all else fails, you can look at the cats gums to determine if it is getting enough oxygen. Pink gums indicate it is getting plenty of oxygen and is in no immediate danger. Blue-tinged or purple gums indicate a lack of oxygen and an emergency.


If the gums are blue or purple contact your vet immediately to warn them you are on the way.
If the gums are purple or blue take a quick look inside the cat's mouth. If you can't see the obstruction or easily remove it, then don't waste further time and take your cat straight to the vet.If you can see the obstruction and can remove it easily then you should.

, Cats have an extremely sensitive larynx and if it goes into laryngeal spasm, the airway can be shut off completely, asphyxiating the cat. There is no time to be waiting for a vet's assistance. However, call the vet both for advice and to warn them that you will be coming in if possible.

, Leave only the head exposed. This will support the cat and control its front limbs., Angle the cat's head back slightly to be able to open up her mouth and see better inside. Use one finger to depress the lower jaw. Use tweezers to remove an object that is obvious. If you can't see what is causing the blockage or it's too deeply lodged or wedged in, do not attempt to remove it.Do not stick your fingers into the cat's mouth. Not only could you be bitten but you might cause the choking object to be pushed in further.
Having a helper to hold down the cat can be a huge help for you.

, Use the palm of your hand to thump the cat gently but firmly between the shoulder blades. Alternatively, you can apply several quick, squeezing compressions on both sides of its ribcage.To administer squeezing compressions, do the following:Sit down on the floor with the cat in front of you but facing away from you.
Lift the cat's hind legs and hold them between your knees.
Place one hand on either side of the cat's chest and squeeze with sufficient firmness to compress the chest by a third.Do not apply excessive force - it may break her ribs. When squeezing, use jerky movements.The aim is to try to get the cat to cough. Squeeze four to five times; this should be enough to get her to cough out the obstruction.

, Your cat may faint or become unconscious in response to the lack of oxygen. If so, do the following:Open up its jaws as wide as possible. There won't be any damage from opening the jaws up wide. Look for an obstruction. If it is easy to see and not wedged in, use tweezers to remove it. In this case, you could use your fingers but only if you're able to avoid putting pressure on the object, as it could wedge it further into the airway.
Swab away any fluid using a clean cloth or tissue. Lie the cat on a slope with its head lower than its heart. This is to help any fluid in its mouth drain out, rather than flow back down the throat where the cat might inhale it. Don't use cotton wool or balls, as these can stick to the throat.
Once you're certain that the throat and airway are clear, begin rescue breaths on your cat, using mouth-to-nose resuscitation. Applied quickly in the absence of an obstruction, this can save your cat's life.

, It is important to have the cat checked out to assess whether the obstruction caused any damage in the cat's throat. Keep it calm until you can get it to the vet.

, Make sure that the method of transportation is as stress-free as possible (having a helper is vital if possible) and keep a good air supply coming into the car. Call the vet practice to let them know you're on your way.

Consult with your vet.,
Read the medication directions.,
Equip yourself as necessary.",How to Apply Topical Medication to a Cat1," Before applying any medication on your cat, speak with your vet. If the vet prescribes the medication during an appointment, you may be able to ask them for a demonstration for proper application. If you are using an over-the-counter treatment, it is still advisable to call your vet and make sure you are using the right treatment.Be sure to ask your vet about potential side effects and complications during application. Some medication may sting, for example, and thus may require planning before application.;
, In addition to talking to your vet, be sure to carefully read the medication packaging before you apply any topical treatment. Read the directions to find out how much medication to apply at a time, how and where to apply the medication on your pet, and how frequently to reapply the treatment.If directions are missing from the packaging, or if you have any questions regarding application and use of the medication, reach out to your vet for clarification.
Take note of any warnings, as well. Some medication may cause irritation in the eye area, for example, and thus should not be used near that area.

, Some topical medications may suggest the use of gloves for protection or tools to properly administer medication. Gather any supplies you need to successfully apply the treatment. Check the packaging or consult with your vet to see what tools may be necessary."

Look for behavioral changes.,
Take note of your cat’s appetite.,
Look out for vomiting or diarrhea.,
See if your cat is extra lethargic.",How to Check a Cat for Fever1," If your cat is normally playful, active, and generally friendly, reclusiveness could be a sign that your cat is sick. If it starts hanging out under your bed, couch, table, or any other out of reach, unusual place, this could be a sign. Cats are instinctively cautious creatures, even if they might be playfully curious on any given day. If your cat is sick, it will want to reduce his or her vulnerability by hiding from you., If your cat is accustomed to eating at a specific time or normally eats a certain amount of food each day, it may alter this behavior if it’s sick. Check your cat’s food bowl throughout the day to see if it has eaten anything.


If this is the case, try tempting your cat with slight more “exciting” food options. Even consider bringing their food bowl to them. If they are hiding because they don’t feel well, they might not be confident enough to venture out to their normal feeding place. If you place the bowl in their safe zone, they might be more inclined to eat., Many cat illnesses — ranging from colds to more serious diseases or conditions — produce fevers, but may also cause other symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. Check your cat’s litter box area. In some cases, your cat may attempt to bury this. If you have an outdoor cat, try to follow it. Check its resting areas for disturbed dirt if it normally buries its business., This is a tough symptom to identify because cats are notoriously lazy creatures. If your cat refuses to get up when you shake a treat bag, it might be lethargic. If your cat normally likes to follow you from room to room, but remains content sleeping all day in a room away from you, it might be lethargic. If you think your cat shows signs of sluggish behavior, be sure to tell your veterinarian."

Assess your cat for other symptoms of blood clots.,
Keep an eye on cats that have a history of cardiomyopathy or blood infections.,
Bring your cat to a veterinarian immediately.,
Give your veterinarian a thorough health history of your cat.,
Allow your veterinarian to proceed as they see fit.,
Approve immediate medical treatment.,
Give continuing treatment.,
Focus on making your cat comfortable.,
Be realistic about your cat's chances of recovery.",How to Diagnose and Treat Blood Clots in Cats," In many cases of blood clots in cats, the clot eliminates blood flow to the back legs. This makes it impossible for the cat to move its back legs. If you notice that your cat can't walk all of a sudden, take it to a veterinarian immediately.This inability to walk can begin with abnormalities in the cat's gait or lameness. If you notice that your cat is walking strangely, keep an eye on the cat and get it seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible.;
, If your cat has a blood clot it is likely that it has lost some of its blood circulation. Look for bluish or pale nail beds and foot pads, as well as areas of the body that are cooler than others.If your cat has lost its ability to move its back legs, feel the legs. If they feel cooler than the rest of the cat's body, then they may not have blood flowing through them.

, If you suspect that your cat has a blood clot you should assess it for other symptoms as you take it to be seen immediately by a veterinarian. It is likely that a cat with a blood clot will also present with some of these symptoms:Vomiting
Pain (especially in the legs)
Difficulty breathing
Anxious temperament
Vocalizing, such as by crying, continuously meowing, or groaning.

, Cats that have a history of heart problems or problems with their blood are more likely to suffer from blood clots. For example, a lack of proper blood flow through the heart can lead to the formation of clots, which then travel through the body and block blood flow once they lodge somewhere. If your cat has had one of these medical problems, keep a close eye out for the symptoms of blood clots.If your cat has been treated for cardiomyopathy or blood infections, discuss the risk of clots with your veterinarian. Make sure that the veterinarian is giving your cat medication that can help minimize the threat of clots in the future and testing your cat regularly for problems that could cause clots., If you spot the signs of a blood clot in your cat it is important that you get it veterinary care immediately. You should literally pick your cat up and drive it to be seen by a veterinarian without delay. Getting prompt veterinary care can help to increase the likelihood that it will survive a blood clot.Go to an emergency veterinary hospital if your normal clinic is closed or the veterinary hospital is closer.

, When you bring your cat in for an emergency you may not be able to take it to its normal veterinary office. If this is the case, be sure to tell the veterinary staff all about your cat's health history, including any medications the cat is on and any serious illnesses it has had.If you can't remember everything about your cat's health history, don't feel bad. Just do your best so that the veterinarian can have as much background information as possible. It is also a good idea to mention to the staff that you think your cat has a blood clot.

, If your cat is very ill the veterinarian will likely take the cat away to be assessed immediately. They will begin lifesaving procedures and do testing to find the root of the cat's health problem. Allow them to do all of these things so that your cat has a better likelihood of surviving its illness.

The veterinarian is likely to do testing on your cat's heart, usually including x-rays. They may also do testing to assess the blood flow in your cat's body.The staff will likely do bloodwork on your cat as well.

, When your bring your cat into a veterinary office or emergency pet hospital for blood clots, it is likely that the staff will want to give your cat immediate care. Allow the veterinary workers to take your cat immediately and begin treatment to save your cat's life.This immediate treatment usually includes testing of your cat's body functions to find out what is wrong and giving your cat medications, such as pain relievers and clot-dissolving drugs, if they suspect your cat has a clot. Surgery to remove the clot may also be required.

, Once your cat has one clot, it is likely that it will get another and it is likely to be in a lot of pain while recovering. Discuss the ongoing treatments that your veterinarian prescribes in order to decrease the likelihood of your cat having another episode and to increase the likelihood of your cat recovering from its illness.Ongoing treatment may include a variety of medications depending on your cat's health. However, it's likely you will be giving your cat medications that thin the blood, for instance clopidogrel or aspirin.If your cat recovers from a clot, it will need frequent check ups and tests to monitor its condition.

, In some cases of blood clots, the cat will lose mobility due to the blood clot. It is especially common for them to lose movement in the back legs. In these cases, you will need to help your cat to stay comfortable and you may even need to help it use the bathroom when it needs to go.It's important to let a recovering cat relax and mend in a quiet and stress-free environment.
Discuss your cat's prognosis with its veterinarian and ask about exercises or movements that you can do with your cat to help its mobility. Some cats that have blood clots will never regain the use of their back legs again.

, Only about one third of cats affected by blood clots survive the first clot. Even if your cat does survive the first clot, it may die from subsequent episodes or associated health problems. With this in mind, you need to be aware that if your cat has a blood clot, it may not survive.In severe cases of blood clots, if your cat is very ill, in pain, and not likely to recover, the veterinarian may suggest euthanasia.

Secure your cat before application.,
Apply the medication.,
Dress the wound.",How to Apply Topical Medication to a Cat2," You want to make sure that you have a firm grasp on your cat before you use the medication. You also want to ensure your cat is as calm and comfortable as you can make it for this process. Hold your cat in way that keeps it relaxed. Use a hold that is as close to your typical hold as possible while still exposing the application area.If you need extra restraint, consider gently wrapping your cat in a warm towel or blanket. This can help calm them while providing extra hold on extremities with claws.
You may also find it helpful to have another person hold the cat while you apply the medication.

, Once you have a proper hold on your cat, apply the medication as directed. Focus on administering the treatment carefully to the necessary areas. Wipe away any medication that leaks from outside of the treatment area. If the medication must dry before your cat can come into contact with other pets or children, continue to gently restrain and calm your cat until the medication has dried.
If you are applying medication to a healing wound, inflamed, or damaged skin, try to avoid rubbing the area too much. Instead, use a finger to lightly dab the medication onto the afflicted area.

, Some medications, such as flea and tick treatment, will not require you to cover up the area of application. If, however, you are applying medication to a damaged or injured area, it may be necessary to apply a patch or bandage. Do so immediately after application unless otherwise instructed.Be sure to use dressing that is made for pets. Those made for humans use adhesives that may catch on fur or skin. Wrapped bandages or patches made for pets are preferred whenever possible.
Keep your pet restrained and comfortable until you have the bandage secured on your cat.

Apply immediately before feeding.,
Use an Elizabethan collar.,
Change the dressing.",How to Apply Topical Medication to a Cat3," If your cat has a tendency to lick or wipe off medication, try applying the treatment immediately before feeding time. Feeding your cat directly after applying the medication may help keep it distracted long enough for the treatment to dry or be absorbed., If your cat is prone to licking or biting at its injury, use an Elizabethan collar, or cone, to help keep your cat's mouth from coming into contact with the afflicted area. You may opt to use the collar while the medication dries, or keep it on the cat until the injury being treated heals completely.Elizabethan collars may be supplied by your vet, or can be purchased at most pet stores.

, Bandages or other dressing should be changed regularly to keep the treated area clean, and to avoid snagging or becoming loose. Redress the area each time you apply medication. If medication is applied less than once a day, be sure to check on the bandage daily to make sure it hasn’t come loose.Bandages should not be too loose or too tight. You should just be able to slide two fingers under the bandage.
Bandages should generally be changed every two or so days regardless of how loose they are.

Prepare the thermometer ahead of time.,
Lubricate the thermometer with petroleum or other water-based lubricating jelly.,
Position the cat correctly.,
Insert the thermometer into the cat's rectum.,
Hold the thermometer in place for approximately 2 minutes.,
Read the result.,
Clean off the thermometer.",How to Check a Cat for Fever2," Shake the thermometer well if you are using one that contains mercury. A digital thermometer may also be used and typically gives a faster result. It is recommended that you use a disposable sleeve with a digital thermometer., KY Jelly or Vaseline works well. Your goal is to make this process as stress-free for the cat as possible. Using lubrication helps decrease the risk of abrasion, ripping, and puncturing., Hold the cat under one arm like a football, with its tail towards the front of your body. Make sure its feet are on a solid surface like a table. Doing so will reduce the likelihood of scratches.


It may be a good idea to have a friend help you hold the cat if possible. Some cats are wiggly and may be difficult to keep still. Have your helper position the cat in a way so that you can insert the thermometer in its rectum easily.
You might also grab and hold onto your cat’s scruff (extra skin on the back of its neck). Since many cats associate this with their mother’s protection, it may have a calming effect. , Be sure to only insert the thermometer approximately 1 inch (2.54 cm). Do not go more than 2 inches deep. Hold the thermometer at a 90 degree angle so it goes straight into your cat’s rectum. Do not enter at any other angle as this will increase the likelihood of pain and discomfort., A mercury thermometer may take a little longer to get an accurate reading. If you are using a digital thermometer, hold it until it indicates that it has finished reading the temperature. Most digital thermometers will beep when finished.Hold your cat firmly during this process. It may squirm, scratch, or bite. Do your best to keep it still to avoid injury to your cat and yourself.

, A temperature of 101.4 degrees F (38.55 degrees C) is ideal for a cat, but a cat's temperature may also range from 100 to 102.5 degrees F (39.17 degrees C) and still be considered normal. If your cat's temperature is below 99 degrees F (37.22 degrees C) or above 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) you should seek immediate medical attention.
If your cat's temperature is approaching 103 degrees F (39.44 degrees C) or over, and your cat is acting unwell, also seek veterinary attention.

, Use warm, soapy water or rubbing alcohol to rinse and wipe off the thermometer. If you used a cover sheet for the thermometer, remove the sheet and wash the thermometer as instructed.Make sure that it is completely sanitized before storing it.

Use an ear thermometer that is specially designed for cats and dogs.,
Restrain your cat.,
Place the thermometer deep into the animal's ear canal.,
Clean off the thermometer and put away.",How to Check a Cat for Fever3," These have longer arms that better reach into the pet's ear canal. These thermometers can be purchased at pet specialty shops or at some veterinarian's offices. In general, these thermometers are not as effective as rectal thermometers.If your cat is feisty, it might sit still for an ear thermometer rather than a rectal one.

, Hold their body firmly with their paws on a surface (try using the floor). Be sure to hold its head in your arm firmly. You don’t want your cat to buck or pull its head while you are taking its temperature. Have a friend help with this too if you have that option., Follow the manufacturer's directions to determine when the reading is complete. Ear thermometers take roughly the same amount of time to register a temperature as a rectal thermometer. It will take a couple of minutes.

, Just like for any thermometer, you'll want to clean it thoroughly with soapy water or rubbing alcohol after use. After you've done this, put the thermometer away in a designated place."

If your cat is sick for several days or you suspect a chronic condition, it is even more important that you visit your vet., In addition to telling the vet that your cat has had a fever, be sure to tell your vet any other symptoms that your cat has exhibited. This is important information that your vet can use to determine a diagnosis.

, Depending on the vet’s diagnosis, you may simply need to keep your cat hydrated and comfortable. If your vet suspects infection or something else, you might have to administer medicine."

Perform chest compressions if needed.,
Continue administering CPR.,
Check the cat often for breathing and a heartbeat or pulse.,
Follow the veterinarian’s instructions for care.,
Contact the veterinarian again if the cat shows signs of a problem.",How to Perform CPR on a Cat," The best thing you can do is get your cat to a vet right away so that you can avoid having to perform CPR on your cat yourself. A veterinarian is much better equipped to handle a severe health crisis. Watch for signs that there may be a serious problem and get your cat to a veterinarian immediately if you notice that your cat is:


having difficulty breathing
unconscious
weak of lethargic
severely injured
severely ill;
, To determine if your cat is breathing, you can either watch for movement in your cat’s chest, feel for breath by placing your hand in front of his nose and mouth, or place a small mirror in front of your cat’s nose or mouth and see if a mist forms. If your cat is not breathing, you may need to give him CPR., Whether or not your cat has a pulse may also help your decide if you need to perform CPR. To check for a pulse, place your fingers on the inner part of your cat’s thigh and wait. If you have a stethoscope, you can use it to try and listen to your cat’s heart. If your cat has no pulse, you may need to give him CPR., The color of your cat’s gums can also indicate whether or not your cat needs CPR. Normal, healthy gums should be pink in color. If your cat’s gums are bluish or gray, that means that he is not getting enough oxygen. If your cat’s gums are white, that means that he may have poor circulation. These factors should be considered as you decide whether or not your cat needs CPR., Sometimes a cat may require CPR after being injured by a moving vehicle. If you're tending to a cat in a roadway or driveway, move your cat out of the way of traffic before beginning CPR.


If possible, have someone drive you and the cat to the nearest animal hospital or your veterinarian. That way you can perform CPR on the way.

, Ensure that she is lying on his side on something comfortable such as a coat or blanket. This will help your cat conserve heat and feel more comfortable., With the cat on his side, tilt his head back a little bit. Open his mouth, and use your fingers to extend the cat’s tongue. Look to see if you can see an obstruction in the cat’s throat.If you can’t see anything, gently sweep the inside of the mouth with your finger to feel for a foreign object that may be obstructing the airway. If you feel an obstruction, determine if you can remove it with your fingers or if you need to use abdominal thrusts.


Do not try to remove the tiny bones in the back of a cat’s mouth. These are part of the cat’s larynx., If you cannot dislodge an object from your cat’s throat using your fingers, you can try to use abdominal thrusts. First, lift the cat, so his spine is up against your chest then use your other hand to locate the bottom of the cat's rib cage. If the cat is not struggling, clasp both hands under the last rib. If the cat is struggling, hold the cat by his scruff with one hand while making a fist under the last rib with the other. Press your fist or clasped hands to the cat's body, and push up. Repeat this upward thrust five times.


Do not attempt to do this if your cat is conscious and seems upset. Put him in a carrier and take him to the veterinarian right away.If the object does not come out; you should turn your cat over and give him five blows on the back. Position the cat over your forearm so his head is dangling toward the floor and you are supporting his body with your arm under his hips. Use the hand not holding the cat to locate the shoulder blades. With the open palm of your free hand, strike the cat sharply between the shoulder blades five times.
If the object does not dislodge, try using your finger to remove it again, and keep cycling through the removal methods until you remove the object.
Once the object is dislodged, move on to check the cat's breathing, and begin or continue CPR procedures as needed.

, If the cat is not breathing, you will need to immediately give the cat two rescue breaths. To deliver rescue breaths, close the cat's mouth with your hand and gently extend the neck to straighten the airway. With the cat’s mouth closed, cup your hand around the nose and put your mouth to the cat's snout.


Breathe directly into the cat’s nose for 1 second.
If you feel the breath go in, give another breath and resume CPR if the cat has no heartbeat. If the cat has a heartbeat but is not breathing, continue rescue breathing at a rate of 10 breaths per minute until the cat breathes on his own or you reach help.
Make sure to keep checking the cat for a heartbeat, and if it ceases, begin compressions. If the breath does not go in, straighten the neck and try again. If it still does not go in, recheck for an obstruction.

, Place the cat on his side and wrap your hand around the cat's chest behind the front legs. Your thumb should be on the side of the chest facing up and the rest of your fingers under the cat. If using this position, you will squeeze the cat’s chest to perform the chest compressions. If you cannot easily span the cat's chest with your hand or the position is uncomfortable for you, place one hand on the side of the cat that is facing up. Then, position your hand(s) with the heel of your hand against the chest wall. Make sure that your elbows are locked, and your shoulders are directly over your hands.


Depending on whether you are using one hand or two, squeeze or push down on the chest hard enough to compress it to 1/3 to 1/2 of its normal depth, and then, allow it to return to normal depth before compressing it again.
Avoid leaning on the chest or allowing it to remain partially compressed between compressions.
The rate of the compressions should be 100 to 120 per minute. A common recommendation is to compress the chest to the beat of the Bee Gees' song, ""Stayin' Alive.""
After giving the first 30 compressions, check the cat's airway and breathing again. If the cat has resumed breathing on its own again, then you can stop performing the compressions.

, You should continue giving the cat CPR until the cat starts breathing on its own and the heart begins to beat again or until you reach the veterinarian. You may need to have a friend help you if you have a long ride to the veterinarian. Follow this cycle of CPR measures every two minutes:


Deliver 100-120 chest compressions per minute along with one rescue breath for every 12 compressions.Check for heartbeat and respiration.
Repeat the cycle.

, When the cat does start to breathe on her own again, keep her under very close observation. If you haven’t done so already, get her to the vet for a thorough check-up and to fix any injuries or bleeding.A vet visit is vital. Your cat needs to be checked for internal injuries and fractures or broken bones. In some cases, emergency surgery may be required after she has stabilized.
Your pet may still be in shock. A cat in shock must be treated by the vet.

, Be aware that your veterinarian may need to keep your cat for a few days to observe her and get her back to optimal health.After your cat is released to you again, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions for care. Administer any medications that your veterinarian prescribes and observe your cat closely.

, A cat who has had a severe health problem that required CPR may be at risk of other problems or even death. Make sure that you notify your veterinarian right away if your cat shows signs of a problem and schedule regular check-ups for your cat to help keep him healthy."

Many of the things you do to keep the house cool for yourself will also benefit your cat, such as keeping the blinds, drapes, and doors closed.Make sure that your cat can go into a warmer room if she feels too cold. (Sometimes air-conditioning and fans can make things too cold and this may be irritating for a cat, after a while.)
Even if your cat likes to spend time outside, it is recommended to keep your cat inside during the hottest part of summer days, which is between 10am and 4pm.;
, If you do not have air condition, fans and open windows are another good option to cool off your home and your cat. Place fans in front of open windows to move air through your home and cool it down. Make sure the fans you use are safe for your pet to be around by checking to see if the cover for the rotating blades is secure.


Place one fan or more at floor level in a corner of the room facing towards the center of the room. This way the cat can lay at a distance that is comfortable for her to get some air movement over her fur. This air movement helps to cool down your cat in a way that is similar to sweating., Cats need access to water in order to stay hydrated. In addition, when your cat’s blood temperature rises, sensors in the brain tell her to drink water in order to cool down and dilute the blood. Therefore, it is essential to make sure that your cat always has access to clean, fresh water.Provide multiple drinking bowls with a large surface area (such as dinner plates or dog bowls). Wider bowls encourage the cat to drink because cat do not like their whiskers to touch the sides of the bowl. Make sure that you replace the water at least once a day and keep it topped up at all times.
Never let your cat drink from water than contains algae as the latter is toxic and may cause diarrhea, vomiting, seizures, and sudden death.Consider getting a cat drinking fountain. Many cats prefer to drink running water and a cat drinking fountain is a great way to do this.

, Cats are smart about comfort at all times, including during the heat. Cats love to curl up in the bathtub or sink because porcelain stays cool even when it is hot outside. Because they are often cooler, cats sometimes prefer tiled areas of the house, such as the bathroom, laundry room, and kitchen. If your cat chooses a spot and seems comfortable, let her be."

Talk to your cat’s veterinarian.,
Read the medicine instructions carefully.,
Decide how to administer your cat’s medicine.",How to Give a Cat Medicine1," Before you give any medication to your cat, you should talk to your veterinarian first. Your veterinarian will examine your cat and determine the best course of treatment for his/her condition. If medication is required, your veterinarian will prescribe it and explain how to administer it to your cat. Ask if you are unsure about any of the instructions.Ask your veterinarian for a demonstration. If you will be giving your cat pills without food, you may benefit from a demonstration by your veterinarian. Before you leave the vet’s office, ask if he or she can demonstrate how to give the medication to your cat. That will allow you to see the process and ask any questions that you have at the time.
If your cat is sick, do not attempt to diagnose your cat yourself. Take him to see a veterinarian as soon as possible.
Never give medicine to your cat that was prescribed for a human, a different cat, or another pet.;
, Before you administer the medication to your cat, read the instructions carefully and make sure that you understand them. If you have any questions or concerns about the medication, call your cat’s veterinarian.Some questions you may want to ask your veterinarian include:


What time should the medication be given?
Should the medication be given with or without food?
How should the medication be given? By mouth? By injection?
Can I crush the medication?
What are the potential side effects of this medication?
How do I keep myself safe when administering the medication? Should I wear gloves?

, Before you give your cat the medicine, make sure that you are clear on the best way to give the medication. If you are able to give your cat his medicine with food, that will be the easiest and most pleasant method for both of you.With Food If the medication can be taken by mouth with food, then your best option is to use Pill Pockets or another type of food that your cat likes. You may need to experiment with different types of food before you find something that your cat really likes.

Without Food If your cat needs to take his medication on an empty stomach, you will need to use a pill syringe or carefully place the pill in your cat’s mouth while you restrain him. If you need to administer a liquid medicine, you will need to use a medicine dropper to put the medicine into your cat’s mouth while you restrain him.

Keep your cat indoors.,
Administer medication at home.,
Return for a follow-up appointment.",How to Get Rid of Harvest Mite Infestations in Cats," If your cat begins scratching suddenly and intensely, this will probably be your first clue that something is wrong. If the scratching continues for more than 24 hours, your cat is likely experiencing a harvest mite infestation, another type of ectoparasite infestation, or some other type of skin infection.Harvest mites are very small orange insects, but it is very likely that you will not see them.
If you notice these symptoms, contact your vet.;
, The most common time of year for a harvest mite infestation is during late summer or early fall. If your cat is experiencing a sudden onset of severe itching during the winter, it is most likely another type of skin irritation.Regardless of season, if your cat is experiencing severe itching, it is a good idea to call your vet.

, Harvest mites are most likely to infect areas on your cat's body where there is only a thin covering of hair. In such places, your cat is likely to develop red skin, papules, and/or scabs.Specific places to look include:


The base of the ears
The face (especially the chin and around the mouth)
The neck and shoulders
Under the front legs
On the abdomen
Around the nipples, vulva or scrotum
Between the toes

, The symptoms of harvest mite infestation can be very similar to the symptoms of other ectoparasite infections (such as fleas). Additionally, unlike a flea infection, there is no one-size-fits-all, over-the-counter cure. If you believe your cat is experiencing a harvest mite infestation, your best course of action is to seek the advice of your vet.Your vet is likely to take a skin scraping and examine it under the microscope.
This is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis.

, Unfortunately, there is not an insecticide created to specifically treat a harvest mite infestation. However, your vet can effectively use a insecticides formulated for fleas instead.Some insecticides may be administered orally, while others may be used topically.
Your vet may use a combination of both.

, In cats who are particularly sensitive, anti-inflammatory medications may be given to help reduce swelling and inflammation.Your vet may provide this medication in the form of a pill or an injection.

, Scratching the infected area can result in secondary skin infections. If this is the case for your cat, your vet may recommend the use of antibiotics.Your vet may provide this medication in pill-form or as an injection.

, The most effective way to both prevent harvest mite infestation, and to help your cat heal, is to keep them indoors during the late summer and early fall. Particularly if your cat is recovering from an infestation, staying indoors will reduce the likelihood of re-exposure., In most cases, your vet will complete any insecticide and/or anti-inflammatory treatments in their office. If your cat has developed a secondary skin infection, however, you may need to continue the use of antibiotics at home.


Most likely, this medication will be in the form of a pill.
You may need to try a few methods for giving your cat this medication.
Follow all dosage instructions provided by your vet.

, If your cat's infestation and/or secondary skin infection was severe, your vet is likely to request a follow-up appointment. Be sure to attend this meeting to ensure that the infestation is completely gone, and that your cat is healing nicely.

Allow your cat to be sedentary on hot days.,
Make sure that your cat has access to shade.,
Cool down your cat with damp towels.,
Brush your cat daily.,
Create a cool retreat.",How to Cool Your Cat Down in the Summer2," Now is not the time to play energetic games with the cat. Chasing after a laser pointer or a wing-on-a-string is definitely out. Instead, encourage the cat to rest and take it easy. Muscular activity generates heat, which the cat doesn't not need on top of the already hot conditions., Take sensible precautions such as ensuring the cat has access to shade when outside, and does not have to stay in the full sun. This could be the shade form a tree or bush, or a garden umbrella. If your cat is indoors, make sure that she is not restricted to a room with lots of bright sunlight and that she can rest out of the glare of the sunshine.If you have an outdoor cat, make sure that you check any outdoor buildings and greenhouses before closing the doors. The building could become very hot and your cat could die as a result if he or she were to be locked inside.

, Most cats do not like getting wet, but you can at help them to cool off a little with dampened towels. Simply dampen a cloth with cool water and gently stroke your cat with the cloth or towel from the top of its head and down the back.


If the cat is very hot, gently wipe her with a wet towel as often as she will tolerate.

, Matted fur traps heat; ensuring that the fur is not matted and allows air to flow through it will help to keep your cat cool. This is especially important for long-haired breeds of cats.


Get into the routine of combing and brushing your cat during the coolest part of the day before she gets hot, such as first thing in the morning. She will be more willing to cooperate if she isn't already feeling cranky because of the heat.
Avoid shaving your cat to the skin as this will expose your cat to the sun and can result in sunburn and risks skin cancer.
Although it seems bizarre to wear a thick fur coat on a hot day, experts now believe the fur keeps heat out in the summer, as well as in during the winter. Thus shaving the coat may not help kitty to stay cool.
However, if the coat is severely matted or tangled, it forms a shell over the cat's body. This shell means the coat doesn't work how it is meant to and so getting a professional to shave the coat is the best idea

, You can help your cat cool down by making a cool, dark spot for her to retreat to when she gets too hot. Just place a cardboard box on its side and put it somewhere that is quiet and out of the way, such as in a closet, behind a chair, or near a cool spot in the house. Line it with a terry towel or other cool cotton fabric. Stick an ice pack inside a sock and place it into the retreat underneath the towel for an added cooling effect.Another good idea is to place towels or sheets over your cat's favorite spots. Doing so will create a cool barrier between your cat’s fur and warmer surfaces.

Watch for signs of heatstroke.,
Cool your cat down with cool damp washcloths and provide water.,
Call your cat’s veterinarian for advice.",How to Cool Your Cat Down in the Summer3," Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting and rapid breathing, lethargy, bright pink ears, confusion, weakness and inability to stand, shaking, tremors, and possibly even seizures.A cat with heatstroke will also feel hot to the touch on the pads of her feet. If you suspect that your cat is suffering from heatstroke, place your cat on a cool surface right away, such as a tiled floor. Then turn on a fan and place it so that it is blowing on her to remove some of the heat.

, If your cat appears to be suffering from heatstroke, place cool damp washcloths over her paws and offer her some water to drink right away. If she is too weak to drink the water, try to moisten her gums with water using a damp cloth.


Avoid ice water or very cold water as the temperature difference between the extreme heat and extreme cold can send the cat into a form of shock.

, Your cat may need to be taken to see your veterinarian to treat her heatstroke. A veterinarian can provide intravenous fluids to reduce your cat’s core temperature and maintain the blood supply to her organs. As your cat’s temperature rises, her blood will become thicker and circulation to vital organs can be impaired.Call your cat’s veterinarian right away if you suspect that your cat is suffering from heatstroke.

Purchase some special treats meant for medicine administration.,
Find out if you can crush the medication.,
Prepare the treats.,
Give the treats.,
Follow up with a medicine-free treat.",How to Give a Cat Medicine2," If your cat can take his medication with food, your best bet is to use a commercial product like Pill Pockets to coat your cat’s pills. You can find Pill Pockets in pet stores. If you cannot find pill pockets or if your cat does not like them, try using wet cat food to make tiny meatballs to coat your cat’s pills.You can also look for Flavor Doh, which is another brand of pill concealing treats.

, It is much easier to mix a powder in with a strong-flavored food (to hide the taste) than administer a pill; however, be aware not all pills are suitable for crushing. If the pill is a slow-release pill, crushing it will destroy this property, making an overdose possible. Or crushing it may simply make it taste unpleasant, and your cat will taste it and reject the food., Put your cat’s pill into a Pill Pocket or Flavor Doh. Make sure that the treat is sticking to the pill so that your cat will not be able to separate the pill from the treat. Have a few other non-medicine treats ready to give your cat after he eats the pill treat.If you are using wet cat food instead, make four tiny meatballs using a cat food that your cat likes and then insert one of the pills into one of the meatballs. Keep track of which meatball you put the pill into!

, Give your cat the treats you have prepared in a location that he likes, such as where he normally eats or a favorite roosting spot.If you are using the Pill Pockets or Flavor Doh, simply give your cat the treat and make sure he eats it. If he spits it out, you can try again with a new treat or use wet cat food to make tiny meatballs.


To give your cat the treat using the wet cat food, give him two of the four meatballs that do not contain the pill. Then, give him the pill meatball and wait for him to swallow it. Follow up with the last non-medicine meatball to help get the medicine taste out of his mouth. The last non-medicine meatball will prevent him from associating the cat food with a bad taste, which will make it easier to keep using this method.

, After your cat has taken his treat using either method, make sure to follow up by giving him one of his favorite treats. You can also pet him and play with him if he is feeling up to it. Just do whatever you can to make the experience pleasant for him so that he looks forward to taking his medicine in the future.Be aware that some cats develop an aversion to the food containing the pill. Try to avoid ""pilling"" with a food your cat relies on, in case they refuse to eat it in future because they link it to a pill.

Prepare the medicine.,
Wrap your cat in a towel with only his head exposed.,
Use an elevated surface such as a high counter, dresser, or washing machine.,
Open the cat's mouth.,
Put the medication in the cat's mouth.,
Close your cat’s mouth and stroke his throat.,
Reward your cat for his cooperation.,
Provide your cat with water.",How to Give a Cat Medicine3," Before you restrain your cat, you will need to get his medicine ready to go. If you have not done so already, read the medicine label carefully before you prepare your cat’s medicine. Call your cat’s veterinarian if you have any questions about how to administer the medicine.Your vet may give you a pill pusher if you will be administering pills without food. A pill pusher is like a syringe for pills, so that you do not have to stick your fingers into your cat’s mouth. If your cat will be taking liquid medicine, your will need to use a medicine dropper.
Double check the dosage for your cat’s medicine and make sure that you have prepared the correct amount.
If your cat has to take a pill without food, prepare a medicine dropper with about 5ml of water as well. You can give this water to your cat after administering the pill to ensure that your cat swallows the pill and it doesn’t get stuck in his esophagus.Place your cat’s medicine someplace close to where you will be holding your cat, so that you can grab it as soon as the cat's mouth is open. For example, you could place the medicine on a paper towel on a nearby surface or ask someone to hold it for you.

, Wrap your cat up like a burrito by placing him onto the middle of the towel and quickly pulling the sides up around him. If you have to administer a pill to your cat without food, you will have to restrain him and put the pill into his mouth. If your cat is not used to taking pills, then there is a good chance that he will struggle to get free. By wrapping him in a towel with only his head exposed, you can prevent him from finding traction on your body and getting away from you. The towel will also help to prevent him from scratching you.You can also try holding your cat in your lap while you administer the medicine, if that feels easier for you. You should still wrap your cat in a towel because there is still a good chance that he will try to get away.You may also want to enlist the help of a friend or family member if this is a new experience for your cat. That way, one of you can hold your cat and the other can administer the medicine with both hands.

, Any surface that is at least waist high will make it easier for you to administer your cat’s medication. Hold your cat (still wrapped in the towel) while allowing his body to rest on the surface.If you are administering the medicine by yourself, you will want to have one hip against the side of the surface and your arm around your cat.

, Use your thumb and ring finger to press the corners of your cat’s mouth. Your cat’s mouth should begin to open as you apply pressure. If your cat’s mouth is not opening wide enough to give the medicine, use your other hand to gently push down on your cat’s lower jaw.Do your best to keep your fingers out of your cat’s mouth as you hold it open. Keep them on the edges of his mouth so that they are out of the reach of his teeth.

, If you are using a pill pusher, put the pill towards the back of your cat’s tongue. If you are using a medicine dropper, insert the dropper between the cat's cheek and teeth. Do not squirt liquid medication into the cat's throat or tongue. Liquids are likely to go down a cat's windpipe, making the cat choke.Follow up with the 5 milliliters (0.17  fl oz) medicine dropper of water if you are give your cat a pill without food. Make sure to administer the water between your cat’s cheek and teeth.

, After you have administered the medicine, close your cat’s throat and gently stroke his throat under his chin. This will help to encourage him to swallow the pill., Even though you cannot give your cat a treat to reward him for taking his medicine, you should still do something to let him know you are happy with him. Pet him, play with him, and praise him immediately after you finish giving your cat his medicine.

, Give your cat a drink or syringe a small volume of water into the side of his mouth (remember not to squirt straight into the cat's throat or onto tongue, as the water will likely end up down his windpipe). This washes the pill down so that it doesn't get stuck halfway down the esophagus. Some meds can burn if they get stuck, with potentially serious consequences."

Prevent tapeworm infections in humans.",How to Diagnose Tapeworms in Cats," An adult tapeworm has a small head that is connected to a chain of proglottids. Proglottids are about 1/4 inch (6 mm) long. Each proglottid has its own set of reproductive organs, and, when fully mature, will break off and exit your cat’s body in her feces. Once in the environment, proglottids will move around by increasing and decreasing in length.Proglottids are pale in color and look like cucumber seeds or tiny, cooked grains of rice.An adult tapeworm can be anywhere from 4 to 28 inches (10.2 to 71.1 cm) long, so your cat may pass a lot of proglottids through her feces.;
, Look for proglottids in the areas where your cat frequents, such as cat trees, furniture, and her bedding.Since proglottids are light in color and very small, you may want to use a magnifying glass to look for them.


After being in the environment for a while, proglottids become hard, yellow, and even smaller (around 2mm).Finding proglottids in the environment is the best way to diagnose tapeworms. If you see them, ask your veterinarian about the proper way to dispose of them.

, The proglottids may become stuck to the fur under your cat’s tail and around her anus, so check those areas of her body.In addition, examine her feces in the litter box to look for proglottids. Keep in mind that you may not see proglottids in each section of fecal material—they are not distributed evenly in the feces.

, Tapeworms usually do not make cats sick, so your cat may not show signs of a tapeworm infection. However, if the proglottids get stuck to the fur near her anus, she may start scooting along the floor to soothe the irritation. If the proglottids migrate up to your cat’s stomach, she may vomit. You would see the proglottids in the vomit.The irritation may also cause your cat to start biting or licking at her anal area., As soon as you see proglottids on your cat or in your home, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian. Since each proglottid contains eggs and can release those eggs into the environment, you should make the appointment promptly so your veterinarian can confirm the diagnosis and treat your cat., Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination of your cat.The main thing your veterinarian will be looking for is proglottids on the fur around your cat’s anus.


If your cat has a heavy tapeworm infection, she may become weak or experience weight loss. However, this is very rare.Your veterinarian would notice the weakness and/or weight loss during the physical exam.
If you can, take pictures of the proglottids and bring those pictures with you to the appointment.

, Since the tapeworm is an intestinal parasite that passes through the feces, you may think a fecal examination would confirm the diagnosis. However, a fecal floatation (an examination technique in which a solution of fecal material is analyzed under a microscope) is usually not effective at diagnosing tapeworms. One reason is because tapeworm eggs are heavy and don’t float.


In addition, tapeworm eggs are not typically passed in the feces. They are released into the environment after the proglottids have hardened.Since the eggs may not be in the fecal sample, and wouldn’t float in the fecal solution if they were there, a fecal exam may result in a false negative. In other words, the fecal exam would incorrectly indicate that your cat is tapeworm free., Fortunately, tapeworm treatment for cats is very easy and effective. Medications called anthelmintics will kill the adult tapeworms. There are several types of available anthelmintics, so your veterinarian will prescribe the one that will be most effective for your cat. Tapeworms are digested in the intestine after they die, so you will not see dead tapeworms in your cat’s feces.Anthelmintics come in injectable and oral formulations. Make sure your cat completes the full treatment course so all tapeworms are killed.Praziquantel and epsiprantel are commonly-used anthelmintics to treat tapeworms in cats.

, A monthly flea preventative is the best way to prevent tapeworm infections in your cat.Different types of feline flea preventatives are available, so your veterinarian will prescribe the one that will work best for your cat. Give the preventative year round—if you stop administering it during the winter, you may forget to start it up again in the spring, leaving your cat more susceptible to fleas and tapeworms.



Advantage is a frequently used feline flea preventative.

, Fleas are not the only source of tapeworms. Dead wild animals (e.g.,squirrels, rodents, birds, and mice) can also harbor tapeworms.If you have an outdoor cat, you may want to keep her indoors to keep her away from dead animals.


To keep your cat busy when she is indoors, give her lots of toys and some scratching posts. It would also be a good idea to spend extra quality time playing with her.
If bringing your cat indoors is not a reasonable option for you, consider keeping a close watch on the presence of dead animals in your yard. If you see dead animals, contact a professional animal removal service.

, Cleaning your home is also very effective at maintaining a flea-free environment and preventing tapeworm infections. Vacuuming your floors every 1 to 2 days and cleaning your cat’s bedding in hot water once a week will help remove fleas from your cat’s environment.Vacuum every location where your cat spends time (e.g., perches, furniture) and throw away the vacuum bag afterwards.Replace your cat’s bedding when it starts to look old and worn.Flea larvae like to burrow into dark places, such as bedding, so getting rid of old bedding can remove a heavy flea larvae population., People can get tapeworm infections in the same way as a cat—by swallowing an infected flea. Tapeworm infections in people are rare, and occur mainly in children. If you have children, make sure they wash their hands after they play with your cat.If you have older children who clean out your cat’s litterbox, instruct them to wash their hands after they clean out the litter box.


A child infected with Diplyidium caninum may not show signs of being sick. Heavy tapeworm infections in children can cause abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and itching around the anus.Take your child to your pediatrician if you suspect they have a tapeworm infection.

Consider using pest control products.",How to Get Rid of Fleas on a Kitten Too Young for Topical Ointments," Before you begin removing fleas form your kitten, you will want to prepare the space you are going to be using. This will make the task easier, not only for yourself, but for your kitten as well.You may want to wash your kitten in the sink as it can be easier to control your kitten.
You will need a flea comb handy.
Have your soap nearby. Dish soap is fine to use, however, avoid any strongly scented soaps. Flea and tick soaps will likely be too strong to use on your kitten.
Make sure you have a towel to dry your kitten off with.
Prepare a cup of warm salt water to drown the fleas you remove.
Fill the sink with warm water.
Grab some tweezers to pluck the fleas off your kitten.;
, Once you have prepared your space and have collected all the items you will need, you can start to bathe your cat. The first step is to simply place your kitten in the warm water you have prepared. Make sure the water is a safe and comfortable temperature for your kitten before putting it in.Keep your kitten's head dry.
Make sure the rest of the fur has been completely soaked.

, After initially placing your cat in the bath, remove it and start to apply the soap. Gently rub the soap into its fur and make sure you cover all areas of the body, including the head. Once you have applied the soap thoroughly, rinse your kitten off completely, expect for its head.Be careful not to get any soap in your kitten's eyes.
Fleas will try to avoid the water and may swarm your kitten's head, as it is still dry. This is normal and will help you find the fleas when you start removing them.

, Now that your kitten has had its bath, you can begin looking for and removing fleas from it. Use both the flea comb and the tweezers to find and eliminate the fleas from your kitten's fur. Be very thorough as you search and try to remove every last one of them.Brush your cat with the flea comb to easily remove a great number of fleas.
Pluck off the fleas with your tweezers if your flea comb misses any.
Put any fleas you find in your cup of warm salt water, which will cause them to drown.

, Chances are your kitten is going to be upset by this point so dry it off and let it get back to playing. Make sure your kitten is also kept away from any of its old bedding or other areas, such as carpeted rooms, that could still harbor fleas. Make sure your kitten is warm enough after the bath. Dry it off completely and place it in a warm room.
Take the cup of dead fleas and flush them down the toilet to make sure they are gone.
If you think any other cats might still have fleas, keep them away from your freshly cleaned kitten.

, If you have any cats in your home that are old enough for medical flea treatments, apply them to help protect your kitten. By making it impossible for fleas to infest your older cats, your kitten will be less likely to suffer from fleas again.Cats under 6 weeks of age cannot receive chemical treatments for fleas.
Cats aged 14 weeks and older, or which are 2 lbs, may take Comfortis for fleas.
Talk with your veterinarian to learn which flea medications might be appropriate for your cat.

, Fleas can wait and hide on any object your kitten used, such as bedding or fabric, and will return to your kitten if they are able. Take away this possibility by throughly cleaning these items and killing any fleas that remain.Wash your kitten's bedding on high heat to help kill any fleas that might be hiding.
You may want to simply dispose of any old bedding or cloth toys.

, Because fleas are so small, they can easily hide in a number of places in your home. Flea eggs can also lay dormant for a time and later hatch, potentially causing another round of bathing and flea removal for your kitten. You will have to diligently clean these areas to make sure that there are no fleas left hiding in your home.Vacuum all rugs and carpets in your home. You may want to sprinkle borax on them before vacuuming.
Wash all of your own sheets, blankets and pillows. Fleas can hide in fabric and will need to be removed.
If the environment isn't cleaned properly, your cat will likely become infested again.

, After removing the fleas from your kitten and keeping the environment free of fleas, you will need to monitor your kitten for any new infestations. As you play with your kitten, take a moment to look around its fur for any returning fleas or signs of their bites.Constant scratching may be a sign that your kitten has fleas.
Excessive grooming can be another indication that your kitten is suffering from fleas.
Run your flea comb through your kitten's fur occasionally. Drop anything that was collected onto white paper. If you notice small, black specks, this can indicate the presence of fleas.

, If your flea infestation is particularly bad or proving difficult to manage, you may want to use insecticides in your home. These kill fleas and their larvae, preventing further trouble from the ones currently living in your house. Some pest control methods can be quite disruptive, such as a ""fogger"", so make sure it is necessary before you use one.Bring every person and all pets outside if you use a ""fogger"" or ""bomb"" type of pest control. These products are toxic and can kill your pets if exposed directly to them.
When looking for any pest control product, find one that is labeled as an ""IGR"". This stands for insect growth regulator, and will make it impossible for the fleas in your home to reproduce.
If you are using a spray bottle style pest control method, make sure to cover all carpets and rugs. Remember to spray under furniture and rugs as well.
Allow the house to fully ventilate and let the insecticide dry completely before letting your pets back into the targeted areas.

Your vet will be able to diagnose the specific type of worm and give your kitten the proper treatment.Even if you deworm your kittens at home to begin with, you need to take them to the vet by six months old to get a fecal culture. This will check the kittens to see if there are any specific worms that have not been eliminated.;
, If you take your kitten to the vet, the vet will give you a prescription for a dewormer. The vet may also administer the dewormer for you. By taking your kitten to the vet, you know you are getting a dewormer that is approved for a kitten at the age yours is at. The form of the dewormer may depend on your cat's age.


Prescription dewormers may come in chewable tables or topical solutions. Your kitten will eat the chewable tablet. A topical solution is a liquid that must be administered directly to the skin.

, If you want to deworm your kitten at home before taking them to the vet, you can buy a commercial dewormer. Look for products containing pyrantel pamoate, which will kill round and hookworms.Over-the-counter worm preventatives and treatments may come in liquid, tablets, or topical solution. You must look at the age restrictions on the dewormer to make sure the kitten is old enough. Some dewormers are for cats six weeks and up, while others may be nine weeks and up.

No dewormer will get rid of all types of worms. While a commercial dewormer will get rid of most common types of worms, your kitten may still have worms that aren’t treated by the medicine. Take your cat to the vet as soon as you can to get a fecal exam, so they can be treated for the specific worms they carry.

, Most kittens are born with worms. Pregnant cats often pass worms that were dormant in their system to their kittens through the womb or after birth through milk. Because of this, start the deworming process at around two to four weeks of age., Kittens needs to be dewormed often to get rid of all worms they may have. Kittens are also more susceptible to infestations, so deworming often helps combat that. Starting around two weeks of age, you should deworm your cat every two weeks for a total of four treatments.This means you will give your kittens dewormers at two weeks, four weeks, six weeks, and eight weeks.
Some vets suggest starting dewormers at three weeks and others four weeks. As long as you start the deworming process within two to four weeks, your kittens should be fine. If you are unsure when you should start the dewormer, contact your vet.

, After the last of the biweekly treatments, around eight weeks, you should give the kittens dewormers once a month until they are six months old. This means they will get a dewormer at 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks., After you have given the kittens their weekly and then monthly doses, the treatment will be more spread out. Give them a final kitten dewormer at 12 months of age.When the kitten turns one year old, you start deworming them as an adult.

Observe your cat’s eating patterns.,
Notice labored breathing.,
Check your cat’s eyes.,
Observe central nervous problems.,
Run routine blood tests.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Toxoplasmosis1," Fever is a common symptom of toxoplasmosis. Touch your cat’s nose to see if it is wet and damp or dry and warm. If it is dry and warm, then your cat may have a fever. Additionally, if you notice your cat lying down more than usual with irritated or heavy eyes, then your cat may be lethargic due to a fever.You can also use a conventional digital thermometer to check your cat's temperature. You will need to insert the thermometer into your cat's rectum to do this. Oil the tip of the thermometer with lubricant jelly or Vaseline. Stabilize your cat on a flat surface. Gently and slowly rotate the thermometer to insert it. Insert it about an inch into its rectum. Remove the thermometer once you hear a beep.The normal body temperature of a cat ranges from 100.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2 to 39.2 degrees Celsius). A temperature above this indicates that your cat has a fever.;
, Loss of appetite is another common symptom of toxoplasmosis. If you notice your cat eating less or not eating at all, then it may be infected with the disease.Also observe changes in its eating patterns. If your cat becomes picky, or suddenly prefers dry food to wet (or vice versa), then it may be exhibiting signs of an illness like toxoplasmosis.

, Pneumonia is also a symptom of toxoplasmosis, although it is less common. If you notice a shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and/or shallow, rapid breathing, then your cat may have pneumonia as a result of toxoplasmosis.Take your cat to the vet immediately if you see your cat struggling to breathe with its mouth open.

, If you observe inflamed retinas, abnormally sized pupils accompanied by light sensitivity, and/or blindness, then your cat may be suffering from toxoplasmosis.For example, if you see your cat bumping into walls, furniture, and other objects, then it may be having trouble seeing.

, If you notice any personality changes in your cat, twitching of the ears, circling, head pressing, and/or seizures, then your cat’s central nervous system may be affected due to toxoplasmosis. Take your cat to the vet immediately if it is exhibiting any of these symptoms.Additionally, if you notice your cat having a hard time chewing and swallowing its food, then your cat may be experiencing a central nervous problem due to toxoplasmosis.
Incontinence may also indicate a central nervous problem.

, If you observe any of these symptoms in your cat, then take it to the vet as soon as possible. Your vet will ask you about the history of your cat’s health, including vaccinations and shots. Then your vet will run blood tests to confirm or disconfirm a toxoplasmosis diagnosis.The existence of a significant amount of IgM antibodies to T. gondii in your cat’s blood indicates that it has toxoplasmosis.

Take your cat to be seen by a veterinarian.,
Allow the veterinarian to run tests.,
Wait for test results.",How to Handle Lung Fluke Infections in Cats1," It can be really scary to see your cat have breathing troubles. Stay calm, and make an appointment to see the vet as soon as possible. A persistent cough or wheezing can be a symptom of a variety of health issues, but the cause should be assessed by a veterinarian.When you call to make an appointment for your cat to be seen, ask the staff member whether you should bring in a stool sample when you bring your cat in. A stool sample can be very helpful for diagnosing a lung fluke infection.
When you take your cat to be seen by a veterinarian, be ready to describe your cat's symptoms and when they started.;
, Once your cat is being seen by a veterinarian, you should let them run the tests that they think are necessary. There are several tests that may be run on your cat to get a definitive diagnosis, including a special fecal float test, called the Baermann technique. The vet may also want to x-ray the cat's lungs to look for the development of parasites and do a trans tracheal wash to identify ova in the lungs.A transtracheal wash is a procedure in which a sample of respiratory secretions is taken from the cat's trachea and bronchi.
Additionally, your veterinarian may want to run tests for secondary infections that have been caused by the lung fluke infection, such as pneumonia.

, In most cases, your veterinarian will need to send samples to a veterinary lab for analysis. A sample that is being tested for lung flukes needs special processing that is usually done in professional labs, not veterinary offices.While waiting for test results, your veterinarian should be working on treating your cat's acute symptoms. This may mean giving your cat oxygen if it is having a hard time breathing or beginning treatment for any underlying infection, such as pneumonia.

Always comb out your kitten in a warm room so she does not get a chill or develop a cold, which could be fatal to a kitten.Put warm water in a bowl with a few drops of liquid detergent. Comb the fleas off of your kitten and place the fleas in the water. Swish the water around so the fleas drown.
You can also dilute five parts water to one part bath oil and sponge or spray it onto the kitten’s coat. Then, use the flea comb to remove the fleas off her damp coat. Fleas will run from the driest parts of your kitten so they may swarm around her face. Grab them and drop them in a bowl of water so they drown.
You can also place the removed fleas on a piece of double sided tape so they cannot move or escape. You can then drown them or crush them.
If you have other cats or kittens, including the mother cat, in your home, always treat them for fleas as well. You do not want fleas from another animal to get back onto your kitten.;
, Most flea medications can be deadly to kittens, and newborn kittens should always receive manual flea removal. However, kittens over four weeks old can be treated with Capstar. This product will kill adult fleas on your cat, but not their offspring.Other medications require your kitten to be at least eight weeks old for safe use and can kill any flea offspring. But you should always check with your vet before applying any flea medications to avoid harming your kitten.
Avoid using natural oils on your kitten to remove fleas. Some oils, like lavender, eucalyptus, or geranium, can cause severe allergic reactions in cats., You will also need a pair of gloves to protect your hands and a jar of insecticide or rubbing alcohol to drop the ticks into and kill them.Put on the gloves and hold your kitten with one hand, or have someone help you hold your kitten in place.
Place the tweezers close to your kitten’s skin and grasp the tick’s head. Pull, rather than twist, the tick from the skin. Avoid crushing or squeezing the tick’s body, which will flood your kitten’s bloodstream with harmful bacteria.
Drop the tick the jar of insecticide or rubbing alcohol to kill it. Always wash your hands well after you have removed all the ticks from your kitten.
Apply antiseptic to the tick bites on your kitten to prevent infection. Your kitten may try to chew or itch the bites, so treat them daily with antiseptic so they stay clean. Check your kitten for any signs of a disease or infection and bring your kitten to your vet if she displays any symptoms of infection, such as fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, or stiff limbs.

, There are several tick medications that you can apply to your kitten’s coat to remove ticks. However, these can cause health issues in kittens. Always check with your vet about tick prevention products before you use them on your kitten.


If you have other cats or kittens, including the mother cat, in your home, always treat them for ticks as well. You do not want ticks from another animal to get back onto your kitten.

, When your kitten contracts fleas or ticks, they do not just live in her fluffy coat. In fact, most of the flea and tick population live in any of the bedding, fabrics, or surfaces your kitten has come in contact with during the infestation.About five percent of the adult fleas live on your cat, and the rest are pupae, larvae, and eggs that live in the surfaces of your home.If you do not clean your kitten’s living environment, there could be persistent flea and tick outbreaks that could cause infection or illness for your kitten.

, Use garbage bags to bag all bedding and fabric items, like cushions. You will then need to wash the bedding on the hottest setting to kill all pests and their offspring., Do an extensive vacuum of all the surfaces in your home. Focus on vacuuming in corners or covered areas, like under furniture or behind furniture, where fleas or ticks might be hiding. You should also vacuum the surfaces of furniture, curtains, and shelving.You can put a flea collar in your vacuum cleaner bag to help collect the fleas. After the vacuum, clean out the bag and dispose of it carefully. Empty out the vacuum bag every time you vacuum to prevent any fleas from escaping.

, If you want to do a serious cleaning of your home to prevent another infestation, you can buy a professional pest control product from your local pet store. This product will likely come in the form of an aerosol “flea bomb” that will kill any remaining fleas or ticks. You and your pets should vacate your home before putting off the bomb. Flea bombs are toxic to other animals so you need to ensure all pets are out of the environment before setting off the bomb.You can also hire a professional pest controller to spray your home and your garden for fleas or ticks. The pest controller can use a spray that is formulated to be safe for pets.

, Ticks and fleas will latch on to your kitten when she plays outdoors or runs around outside. Prevent another infestation by keeping your kitten inside.If she does go outside, inspect her carefully for any fleas or ticks before letting her inside. Remove any pests right away to prevent another infestation in your home or on your kitten. As your kitten gets older, you can start to use a tick prevention spray or a topical flea treatment.

, Keeping your home clean and free of debris can also prevent fleas and ticks from living in your home undetected. Get into the habit of vacuuming your house at least once a week, especially if your kitten likes to go outdoors or if you have other pets in the home.You should also inspect your carpets, furniture, drapery, or storage areas for ticks or fleas once a week to prevent them from multiplying. If you notice any fleas or ticks, kill them right away.

, Ticks are attracted to tall grasses and shrubs, so keep your garden or yard tick free by mowing the lawn and trimming any shrubs or bushes. You can also treat your garden with pet-safe insecticide to keep the area flea and tick free."

Look for a swollen abdomen.,
Notice any stunted growth.,
Monitor for any digestive issues.,
Prevent worms by keeping your kitten indoors.",How to Deworm a Kitten2," Kittens who have worms will have large, round, swollen tummies. This is different from the kittens gaining weight. The tummy will not match the rest of the body because the cat will not be gaining weight, despite an increase in appetite.The kitten may even lose weight.

, Kittens with worms will not grow at the normal rate. They will appear smaller and not gain the right amount of weight each week. Instead, they will be smaller and unhealthy looking.Healthy kittens will gain weight as they grow. For example, by two weeks, they should be between eight to 14 ounces, and by four weeks they should be 12 ounces to 1.3 pounds. Healthy kittens will gain around 1.75 to 3.5 ounces each week.This occurs because the worms are taking the nutrients that the kitten needs.

, Worms cause problems with a kitten’s digestive system. Worms may cause the kitten to lose their appetite or vomit. They also may have diarrhea, and sometimes it may be bloody.Often, you will find worms in the vomit or feces, and you may even see worms around the anal area.

, The best way to prevent your kitten from getting infected with worms is to keep them indoors. Outdoor cats come into contact with all sorts of things that may transfer worms to them, such as contaminated feces, food, or animals.This also helps protect them from ticks, fleas, and other parasites.

Give your cat anti-parasitic medication.,
Treat additional infections.,
Watch your cat for signs of recovery.",How to Handle Lung Fluke Infections in Cats2," While there are no medications made specifically to treat lung fluke infections, luckily there are some anti-parasitic medications that can eliminate the infection. Praziquantel, which is commonly used to treat tapeworms, is a medication commonly used to treat lung fluke infections. This medication is typically given daily for three days and it will eliminate the lung flukes.Fenbendazole, another anti-parasitic drug, is another treatment that might be used. This is typically taken daily for ten to fourteen days.

, If your cat's lung fluke infection is advanced, it may cause the cat to have additional problems. These need to be treated separately, in addition to the treatment for the parasitic infection. Discuss treatment options with your veterinarian and begin treatment as soon as possible.


For example, your can may have gotten pneumonia due to the lung fluke infection. This typically needs to be treated with antibiotics., As your cat is treated for its infection, the respiratory symptoms it was experiencing should go away.

The cough will likely come from deep in the cat's chest and bloody mucus may be coughed up as well.While many cats with this infection experience coughing and difficulty breathing, your cat may have no symptoms at all if the infection is mild.

, If the lung fluke infection becomes severe, your cat may develop pneumonia, pneumothorax, or bronchiectasis. These infections cause severe breathing difficulty that requires immediate veterinary care. If your cat seems as if it cannot breath, you need to get it to a veterinarian immediately.Pneumothorax is a condition in which the lungs collapse, due to air collecting in the chest cavity outside the lungs.
Bronchiectasis consists of damage to the bronchioles of the lungs, which leads to a thickening, widening, and scarring of the lungs.

, If the lung fluke infection becomes very advanced, your cat may have a very low energy level and go into a depression. If your cat has no energy, is not interested in its normal routine, and is having difficulty breathing, then it may have a lung fluke infection.Lethargy and depression can be symptoms of a variety of health problems.

Advantage should not be applied to kittens under two pounds, or cats less than eight weeks old.;
, Slide the tube down to the bottom of the pouch, if it is not already there. Next, use scissors to open the top of the pouch. Remove one tube from the pouch.Use only one tube per application of Advantage., Opening the tube of Advantage is not as simple as just untwisting the cap. First, using the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand, hold the tube upright and away from you and your cat’s eyes and face. Then, use your dominant hand to untwist the cap., Invert the cap and push it back on top of the tube. To break the seal on the tube, twist the cap. After the seal is broken, remove the cap and place it to the side., To apply the Advantage, your cat can be lying down or standing up—just make you can keep her still. Use both hands to part the fur at the base of her neck until you can see her skin.The base of her neck is the preferred application site because it is unlikely that your cat will be able to reach that area with her tongue.Make sure your cat’s skin is clean and dry before applying the Advantage.Hold the parted fur with your non-dominant hand so that you can apply the Advantage with your dominant hand.
Have someone else hold your cat if you do not think you are able to hold her and apply the Advantage on your own.

, With your dominant hand, press the tube directly onto your cat’s skin at the application site. Apply the entire tube of Advantage, without letting it run off her body and onto the floor.If any product lands on another part of her body or on the floor, quickly clean it up with a paper towel or absorbent towel.


You do not need to apply pressure when touching your cat’s skin with the tube.
Make sure the Advantage does not get into your cat’s mouth or eyes. If it gets into her mouth, she will probably start to salivate due to Advantage's bitter taste. If it gets into her eyes, do your best to rinse her eyes with cold water.Call your veterinarian if Advantage gets into her mouth or eyes.Wearing gloves is not necessary to apply Advantage., The application site may be sticky for up to several hours after you have applied the Advantage.

If you decide to shampoo your cat after two days, make sure to use a soap- or detergent-free shampoo. Shampoos with soap or detergent can strip away the oily layer of your cat’s fur through which the Advantage is absorbed. Vigorous shampooing can also disrupt the oily layer.Your cat probably does not want a bath anyway, so you will likely have no problem waiting two days to shampoo her.
Advantage is waterproof and will remain effective after a bath., Fortunately, side effects of Advantage are uncommon.One potential side effect is hair loss at the application site. In addition, if your cat manages to lick at the application site immediately after you apply the Advantage, she will probably start to salivate due to the bitter taste.The bitter taste is meant to dissuade cats from licking the application site., If the tube is empty, throw it away or recycle it.

Prevent heartworms in your cat by giving her medication that kills heartworm.",How to Diagnose Heartworm Disease in Cats," Though some cats infected with heartworm have few or no symptoms, you may notice non-specific symptoms in your cat, like a poor appetite. Your cat may eat little to nothing for several days to a week and loss a significant amount of weight.One less common sign of heartworm is a pot-belly appearance in your cat, even if she has not eaten in some time. This is due to a buildup of fluid called chyle, which can gather in your cat’s chest and abdominal area.;
, Your cat may also display symptoms that are related to lung and breathing issues. She may have rapid breathing and coughing. She may also appear to have a hard time breathing in and out.


Your cat’s breathing issues may make it difficult for her to move around so she may appear lethargic or lacking in energy.

, These symptoms are due to issues in her gastrointestinal tract as a result of the heartworm. You should take your cat to the vet right away if she displays these symptoms, as they usually indicate a serious medical issue.

, Your cat may experience neurological issues like a lack of coordination, seizures, or fainting episodes. You should take your cat to the vet right away if she collapses or has a fainting spell. This could be the result of a heart murmur in your cat’s heart due to the heartworm., It can be difficult to make a positive diagnosis of heartworm in cats, as cats tend to harbor very few worms. The vet may try several tests to determine if there is worms in your cat, including an antigen test.This test will help your vet to detect any female worms in your cat. The vet will look at a sample of your cat’s blood and look for the traces of the antigens produced by female worms.
However, this test is not fool-proof and requires time to reach a confirmed diagnosis. It can take five to eight months for a female worm to mature and trigger the antigen test. As well, cats with worms can actually create a false negative result on an antigen test.

, This is another blood test that looks at the amount of defensive antibodies produced in your cat’s body as a way to fight off the heartworm infection. This test can show a positive result within two months of the development of the infection, a quicker result than an antigen test.However, antibody tests are also prone to false negatives. In one study, 50% of cats tested with antibody tests turned up negative for heartworm infection, though they in fact did have heartworm.
Antibody tests will also only tell your vet that heartworm has been present in your cat and your cat’s body produced antibodies against it. But it does not confirm if the infection is active or dangerous to your cat.

, An echocardiography, also called an echo test or a heart ultrasound, will take moving images of your cat’s heart.This test will help you vet to get a positive visual of the worms in your cat’s heart and is considered the most useful way to confirm a diagnosis of heartworms in your cat.An echocardiography is painless and will have no side effects on your cat. It can be done in your vet’s office or by a trained echocardiographist in another facility and usually takes no more than one hour. Your cat’s heart movements will be shown on a screen and video and images will be taken of your cat’s heart to confirm the presence of heartworms.The cost for an echocardiography for cats can range from $200-$400. Talk to your vet about the cost and be sure you can afford an echocardiography before you give your vet the go ahead to do one., The X-ray will help the vet look for pathological changes in your cat’s lungs due to the heartworm. If there are changes present, this can indicate a disease is present. But it cannot tell the vet definitively if your cat has heartworm or another condition, such as asthma.


Your vet may also do other tests to rule out other breathing issues or disorders until the only possibility is heartworm., Currently, there is no approved drug for the treatment of heartworms in cats. Some vets may prescribe a drug used to treat dogs with heartworm but it can cause significant side effects in your cat, including lung failure and possibly death. Another option is to treat the symptoms of heartworm in your cat in the hopes that your cat will outlive the infection.As heartworms can live in your cat for two to three years before they become serious, your cat may need several months worth of treatment. The vet may prescribe oxygen treatment and drugs such as corticosteroids and diuretics that you can give your cat when she is experiencing symptoms due to the heartworms. She may also give you corticosteroids you can give your cat when she is stable but still infected.
Surgical removal of heartworms from cats is currently being tested in Japan and Europe. In the future, surgical extraction of the worms may be a viable option.

, The best way to treat heartworm in your cat is to try to prevent her from developing the infection in the first place. You can give her medication that contains macrocyclic lactone on a regular basis, which will kill the heartworm and prevent the infection from getting worse.Cats that are given heartworm prevention drugs do not show any signs of toxicity or negative side effects. You can give cats heartworm prevention drugs when they are as young as six weeks old.

Bring your cat to the vet for annual heartworm tests.",How to Choose a Heartworm Preventative for Your Cat1," Even before you begin looking for a heartworm preventative, you should take your cat into your veterinarian’s office and have the animal tested for heartworm. It would be deeply unfortunate to begin giving your cat preventative medication, only to find that it already has heartworm.If the test results come back positive, you can speak with your vet about how to treat the heartworm.;
, If the cat’s heartworm tests come back negative, ask your vet about heartworm preventative medication. Heartworm prevention is much cheaper than treatment, so it’s important to not put off this conversation. Most veterinarians recommend that cats be kept on constant heartworm preventative treatment, with preventative medication given once a month.If you have recently adopted your cat—no matter its age—schedule this appointment to discuss heartworm prevention with your veterinarian as soon as possible.

, Cats can contract heartworm from mosquito bites in all 50 states (although states with a larger mosquito population have higher incidences of heartworm), so pet owners should consider their cats to be always at risk. Have your cat tested annually to make sure they have not contracted heartworm.Even if your cat is on a preventative heartworm medication, still plan to have them tested annually. No medication is 100% effective, and heartworm can be deadly to cats.

Identify how long to wait before treating your cat again.If your cat has ticks, you should administer Frontline Spray once every four weeks.",How to Administer Frontline for Cats2," Find a well-ventilated area to administer the spray. Wear a long-sleeved shirt to prevent the spray from getting on your skin.


If you get the spray on your skin or clothing, take the clothing off and rinse your skin beneath running water for about 15 minutes.
If you get it in your eyes, rinse your eyes under running water for about 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after five minutes. Call your doctor for further treatment.
Do not use the spray on cats younger than eight weeks old.
After spraying your cat, keep them away from intense heat or open flame, since the medicated spray is flammable.

, Knowing the dose rate your cat needs will help you decide how many pumps of the Frontline Spray to apply.


Use a low dose rate (six pumps of a 100 milliliter spray per kilogram of the cat’s body weight, or two pumps of a 250 milliliter spray per kilogram of the cat’s body weight) when your cat has short, fine fur, healthy skin, and few or no fleas.
Use a medium dose (nine pumps of a 100 milliliter spray per kilogram of the cat’s body weight, or three pumps of a 250 milliliter spray per kilogram of the cat’s body weight) if your cat has short or medium-thick fur or a moderate flea population.
Use a high dose (12 pumps of a 100 milliliter spray per kilogram of the cat’s body weight, or four pumps of a 250 milliliter spray per kilogram of the cat’s body weight) when the cat has lots of fleas, thick or long fur, hypersensitivity to fleas, or has ticks.

, The number of sprays you’ll use depends on the size of your cat and the size of your Frontline Spray bottle. You can determine the exact number of sprays your cat will need by consulting the chart located beneath the pull-away label on your bottle of Frontline Spray.


Larger cats will need more Frontline Spray.Cats getting sprayed with the larger (250 milliliter) bottle will need fewer sprays than a cat of equal weight getting sprayed with the smaller (100 milliliter) bottle.
The chart is also available online here.

, Hold the cat still by grabbing them by the scruff of their neck.Ruffle the cat’s fur with the hand that is not holding the spray bottle to ensure the spray reaches the cat’s skin. With the nozzle about three inches (five centimeters) from the cat’s body, spray the requisite number of pumps onto the cat by depressing the handle on the squeezable bottle. Spray evenly across their body so as not to apply an excessive amount to just one spot.


Rotate the nozzle clockwise to deliver Frontline in a cone of spray. Rotate the nozzle counterclockwise to deliver the spray in a more concentrated way.
Start at the back of the neck and work your way down the length of the cat’s body. Ensure that the cat's head, body, legs, chest, and tail all receive the spray.
Do not spray the medicine directly in the cat’s face, ears, or eyes. To apply Frontline Spray to a cat’s face, spray a bit on your glove or onto a cloth, then gently apply it to the face, taking care to avoid the eyes and ears.
You might want a friend or family member to restrain the cat while you administer the spray.
Hold the cat still for a few minutes after administering the spray until it dries.

, If your cat has hypersensitivity to fleas or is sporting a high flea population, you should also apply Frontline Spray once every four weeks. If your cat is getting a low or medium dose of spray, you can administer it in slightly longer intervals of six weeks before giving your cat another dose.

Limit your cat’s outdoor time.When cats wander about outdoors — especially when they encounter strange cats or dogs — the likelihood that they will contract fleas or ticks increases.,
Feed your pet supplements.Keeping your pet healthy with a well-balanced diet and good nutrition gives them healthy skin that could help control flea infestations.,
Check your cat regularly for fleas and ticks.After your cat comes back inside, part their fur and look for small brown or black spots that could be bugs.",How to Administer Frontline for Cats3," But even extended time alone in their own backyard can increase your cat’s risk for fleas and ticks, since these bugs can be found anywhere, especially during spring, summer, and fall.

, Vitamins C and B are the most effective at keeping your cat’s skin healthy.


Feed your cat a chewable vitamin B or C (available at your local pet store), or add a liquid vitamin supplement to their water.Avoid feeding your cat meaty cat foods, as these are usually made with low-quality meats that are unfit for human consumption.
You could also add a spoonful of coconut oil to your cat’s food or water to keep their skin healthy.

, Pay attention to prolonged scratching, chewing, or licking behavior that might indicate the presence of fleas or ticks.


After walking about outside, you should also check your clothing for fleas and ticks to avoid bringing them in with you.
Wash your cat regularly. After drying them, comb them thoroughly with a flea comb to remove potential bugs. Place any fleas you find in a jar, then seal the jar and place it in the freezer to kill them.

Consider an oral pill or tablet.,
Apply a topical liquid.,
Do not give cats an injectable heartworm preventative.",How to Choose a Heartworm Preventative for Your Cat2," These are the most common types of heartworm preventative. Oral pills can be crushed and put in your cat’s food, or otherwise fed to them.Since oral medications only need to be given monthly, the pills or tablets are not much of a hassle. Some even come in a chewable variety, with a meat or cheese flavor that the cat will enjoy.


Oral pills and tablets are available by prescription only, and may contain ivermectin or milbemycin oxime.

, The second type of popular and effective heartworm preventative for cats is a topical liquid, which you apply to the cat’s skin on the back of its neck. Topical liquids have the added benefit of also killing off fleas. However, some cats may not like the feeling of the liquid on their neck, and may try to rub the liquid off on furniture or the carpet.These topical liquids can be harmful to cats if ingested, so you may need to watch your cat after the liquid has been applied to make sure it doesn't lick up any liquid that it has rubbed off itself.
Topical preventatives are also only available by prescription. They commonly contain the drugs selamectin or moxidectin.

, Although this treatment—which protects pets against heartworm for up to 6 months at a time—is often used to treat dogs, it should not be used with cats. Heartworm treatment and prevention works differently between the two breeds, and the injectable treatment, while it can benefit dogs, should not be used on cats.Injectable heartworm preventatives commonly contain the drug moxidectin, also used in topical liquids. Nevertheless, these injectable preventative treatments are not safe to cats.

Determine how often your cat will be outside.,
Decide if you would like a heartworm preventative that kills other parasites.,
Examine the side effects of the medication.",How to Choose a Heartworm Preventative for Your Cat3," The regularity with which your cat will be outside can influence the type of heartworm prevention you use. If the cat is primarily a housecat, you probably won’t need a preventative that kills parasitic insects. However, if your cat spends hours outdoors each day, plan to buy a heartworm preventative that kills at least fleas.Especially if you live in the American South—which has the highest number of heartworm incidences—from central Texas through North Carolina, plan to find your cat a heartworm preventative that repels mosquitos and kills other parasites.

, Depending on whether or not your cat is susceptible to other types of parasitic creatures, you may want a heartworm treatment that also kills other parasites. For example, many topical treatments also kill fleas. Other preventatives repel mosquitos, and some treat and prevent ear mites.This may also depend on the type of area in which you live. If you live in a rural location, your cat may be at risk for encountering fleas, ticks, or mites.
If you allow your cat to hunt, or if they are outside often, they should be on a heartworm preventative that also treats and prevents other parasites.

, Depending on the type and brand of heartworm preventative that you choose, it may induce one or more medical side effects on your cat. Be sure to fully read the label before you give your cat the medication. You can let the potential side effects help guide your decision: if any preventatives advertise more serious side effects, avoid giving them to your cat.This is also an appropriate topic to ask your veterinarian about. If you are unsure if a certain heartworm preventative will harm your cat or not, or want to discuss the possible side effects, don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment.

Start leaving small dishes of food and water for the bird.,
Feed the bird from the dish.,
Once the bird is eating on its own, start decreasing the amount of food you hand feed it.,
After a couple of weeks, the baby bird will be eating independently.,
Around this time it will also need to learn how to drink water.",How to Wean a Wild Baby Bird," You should begin doing this once it is fully feathered (a fledgling). You can leave seeds, insects (dead mealworms and crickets work well), and fruits (cherries, grapes, plums, etc., which can be cut up into smaller pieces). Eventually the bird will begin pecking at the food out of curiosity.;
, Tap the dish a couple of times and then feed the baby bird from it. You can also hold up the dish to the bird and try to coax it to eat from it.

, This will encourage the bird to eat by itself, and it will begin to prefer not being hand-fed anymore.

, It may still beg for food but will no longer need you to feed it.

, Start by dipping the bird's beak in a shallow dish of water, or put a few drops of water on the bird's beak.

Candle an egg to look inside for embryonic development.,
Observe if your eggs float.,
Crack open an egg to check for fertility.",How to Tell if a Bird Egg Is Infertile1," If a you or a hen has been incubating an egg for a few days, you can candle an egg to see if it is fertile or not. Hold your egg up to a candle or strong light like an incubator light and observe what you see inside:A fertile egg will have clear signs of development such as networks of blood vessels present, an opaque shape of an embryo at the larger end of the egg, and even movement within the egg.
A fertile egg with an embryo that has stopped developing will have a blood ring or blood streaks observable in the egg. Since the embryo is no longer viable, the blood vessels that once supported it have pulled away from it.
An infertile egg or yolker will look fairly clear, with no blood streaks, rings, or vessels.;
, Floating eggs are often infertile as the volume inside of the egg is not large enough for it to sink. As embryos form, eggs become heavier. Check for floating eggs:


Wait until your bird eggs are a few days old and all possible embryos have developed. In practice, it is best to only move possibly fertile eggs every once in a while and never too often. Taking an egg from its incubator too early can stunt development and taking an egg too late in its development can hurt the chick inside.
Get a bowl of warm water. Be sure to use warm water in case your bird egg is fertile.
Carefully place the eggs in the water. Be gentle, as some eggs are very fragile.
Observe if your eggs float or sink.
Return your fertile eggs back to the incubator as soon as possible.

, The most accurate way to see if an egg is fertile or not in its early stages is to crack the egg open. When cracked, look for the blastodisc to see if it has turned into a blastoderm. For obvious reasons, cracking open an egg means you are not planning to breed or incubate chicks. If you're are cracking eggs for consumption, infertile eggs and fertile eggs have no taste difference.


Fertile eggs will have a blastoderm that looks like a white bullseye or circle. The white colour of the blastoderm will be quite opaque and its edges solid and pronounced. A lighter, almost transparent, outer later will surround the denser spot.
Infertile eggs will have a blastodisc that will have an irregular shape and its white colour is very faint and foggy.
All eggs will have a white spot or blastodisc whether or not it is fertile.

Outline your reasons.,
Be straightforward.,
Keep your vet in the loop.",How to Get a Veterinary Second Opinion for Your Cat1," Before you speak to your current vet, spend some time thinking about your reasons for seeking a second opinion. Also, think about what you'd like to ultimately outcome to be.Here are some questions to consider:

What is the reason for the second opinion? Are you disputing a specific diagnosis? Do you think the current treatment plan isn't working? Do you need to see a specialist?
Do you intend to keep using your current vet, or are you hoping to switch?;
, If you hope to maintain your relationship with your current vet, your best course of action is to be direct. Make a list of your reasons for wanting a second opinion. Then call and ask to speak to your doctor. In many cases, you may need to leave a message for your vet to call you back. A good vet will support your decision, and will not be offended.You might say:

""I am calling because I am afraid Eddie's treatment plan isn't working. I was thinking of seeking another opinion on the matter.""
""I'm afraid I may not be able to afford the treatments you have suggested. I may need to seek less expensive care, if I can find it.""
""Eddie doesn't seem to be getting better. I think it might be time to consult a specialist.""

, If you want to keep a relationship with your current vet, you can do so by keeping them informed. Put them in touch with your new vet, and contact them with any major changes to your pet's health and/or treatment plan. You may even consider scheduling a follow-up with your current vet, after your second opinion, in order to discuss all of your options."

Separate your female birds from your male birds.,
Put laid eggs in the refrigerator immediately.,
Observe eggs for 14 to 21 days.",How to Tell if a Bird Egg Is Infertile2," In order for an egg to be fertile, a female bird must mate with a male to produce an egg with both male and female genetic material to create an embryo inside the egg. If you only own female birds, then all eggs laid by them will be infertile.


An unfertilized egg or an egg only containing female genetic material is called a blastodisc.
In fertile eggs or eggs that contain both female and male genetic material, the blastodisc is then term a blastoderm. The blastoderm is also called the first stage of embryonic development., Eggs must be kept warm in at least 85°F (30°C) temperature for the egg to develop into an embryo. You can stunt this development by taking the egg away from the bird and placing the eggs in a cool or refrigerated place.


You'll need to do this rather quickly after the egg is laid. It can take as short as several hours for the embryo to being forming in the right conditions.

, The time it takes for a chick to hatch in incubation varies between different species of birds. Most lovebird eggs hatch in 2 weeks while chickens take up to 21 days to hatch.If nothing happens to the egg past this period, the egg was most likely infertile or the embryo died and stopped its development.


This method is not recommended for consumption if you are checking chicken eggs. If your egg has been in an incubator for 21 days or left out in room temperature for more than 7 to 10 days, the egg will have most likely gone bad or is beginning to rot.

Bring all necessary records.,
Be ready to answer some questions.,
Ensure your ability to pay.",How to Get a Veterinary Second Opinion for Your Cat2," Since you will seeing a vet that is not your regular doctor, you will need to provide some medical and shot records. If you make the appointment far enough in advance, you may be able to provide the new vet with the contact information for your other doctor, and they can retrieve the necessary information themselves.At the bare minimum, you will need to show that your animals shots are up to date.
If your vet has run tests regarding your pet's condition, the results of these tests will be very helpful to your new vet.

, When you go in for the appointment with your new vet, you are going to need to provide some information about your cat and their condition.Be ready to explain:

Your cat's age and medical history.
What symptoms your cat is experiencing.
When these symptoms began.
What diagnosis the first vet provided.
What treatments have been rendered and when.
What medications your cat is currently taking (or has taken for this problem).
Any other health problems your cat has been diagnosed with.

, Before you agree to any treatment plan, inquire about the cost. Some services and treatments can be quite expensive, particularly specialized care. Many animals clinics will require you to put down 50% of the anticipated cost of treatment before services are provided. Make sure that you can afford treatment before you agree to anything."

Recognize the difference between a ""second opinion"" and a ""referral."",
Ask for a referral.,
Find a specialist yourself.",How to Get a Veterinary Second Opinion for Your Cat3," Generally speaking, a ""second opinion"" mean you are seeking the advice of an equally qualified general practitioner. A ""referral"" on the other hand, means you are seeking the advice of a specialist.If you simply don't trust to prognosis or treatment plan of your current vet, you may choose to see another general practitioner.
However, most of the time, you will be able to gain greater insight into your cat's health problems by seeking the help of a specialist.

, Don't be afraid to discuss this with your vet. Explain that you'd like to seek the advice of a specialist and ask for a referral. In some cases, it may even be your vet's idea for you to seek the care of a specialist. Your vet simply wants the best care for your cat.Different types of veterinary specialists include:

Behavioral specialists
Surgeons
Internists
Ophthalmologists
Dermatologists
Oncologists
Dentists

, If your current vet has not been able to provide a referral, you can turn to friends and family, search the internet, and make some phone calls in order to find a specialist. Ask your cat-owning friends and family if they can recommend the specialist you need. Perform an internet search for feline-based veterinary specialists. Once you locate some potential veterinarians, call each one and explain your situation. Select the doctor who seems best able to accommodate your needs, and make an appointment.A practice that is listed as ""secondary referrals only"" means that they only accept patients referred by other vets and do not take appointments directly from the public.

Dispute a poor prognosis.,
Question complicated or expensive care.,
Notice a lack of improvement.,
Honor your intuition.,
Don't feel guilty!",How to Get a Veterinary Second Opinion for Your Cat4," There are a number of reasons why you might want to seek a second opinion. One strong reason is to dispute or question a poor prognosis. If you receive quite dire news about the health of your cat (such as a degenerative disease or serious illness), it never hurts to speak to another vet. Get a second opinion before opting for expensive treatments or thinking the worst., If the treatment plan a veterinarian proposes seems overly complicated or too expensive, it can be helpful to speak to another professional. A second opinion can help you decide if a complicated/expensive treatment plan is truly necessary., If the treatment plan laid out by your practitioner does not seem to be working, it can be helpful to speak to someone else. In these instances, often your veterinarian may recommend that you speak to another doctor or specialist, and give you a referral., If you just plain have a bad feeling about the diagnosis or treatment provided by a particular veterinarian, honor those feelings and speak to someone else. You know your animal best., Most veterinarians will welcome the opinion of a second vet, especially a specialist. A good vet will understand and honor your desire to be well-informed, and support your choice to seek a second opinion. In many cases, your vet can refer you to another veterinarian."

, Have a partner or assistant hold the cat still, facing away from you.

, If your cat is hairy, you may need to trim the hair around the anus before you can proceed.

, Pull the cat’s tail gently upward to observe the anus. Look for the gland openings, which should be located just beneath and to the sides of the anus.

, If the anus and gland openings are crusted with dried secretions, rinse with water and then gently wipe away the softened crusts.


In some cases, you may not be able to wipe away the softened crusts very easily. If this happens, try putting a warm compress in the anus for five or ten minutes to soften clogged openings.

, Using your gloved hand, pinch the two anal glands under the anus, using your forefinger and thumb. Gently push upwards, increasing your pressure until the glands pop and release excess secretions.


You will likely notice a distinct odor once the glands release their secretions. This is a sign that you have succeeded in your task.
If there is blood or pus in the discharge, your cat’s anal glands are probably infected. You’ll need to contact a veterinarian as soon as possible.

If you do not get many results from your search, try searching for alternate words. For instance, try searching for ""veterinary behaviorist"" instead of ""pet behaviorist."";
, There are professional organizations for veterinary animal behaviorists that keep lists of their members. These list can help you find someone that is actually licensed and educated in this field.


For instance, the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists and the Animal Behavior Society both have online lists of members and their contact information., In many cases, your veterinarian will be a great source of information about specialized pet professionals in your area. Discuss your cat's specific problems with the veterinarian and then ask them for any suggestions of who to take your cat to for its problem.


In many cases, it will be the veterinarian that suggests that you take your cat to a specialized cat behaviorist. In this case, they should have a suggestion for you of who to go see.
Going to your veterinarian for a referral has the added benefit of making sure that your cat's behavior problem doesn't have a medical cause that can be easily treated. Tell your veterinarian about the cat's problems and then ask them if there might be a health problem at the root of the bad behavior.

, If you have friends or family members that have used a pet behaviorist before, you can ask them who they used and if they liked them. At the very least, if they did not like them then you can leave that behaviorist off your list.


You can even ask on social media platforms if anyone you are connected with has any recommendations. This is a good way to ask a lot of people all at once for their recommendations.

, In order to find the right behaviorist for your cat, you should first identify your cat's exact behavior problems. Knowing exactly what issues you need treated will help you figure out if potential behaviorists will work well for your cat. There are a wide variety of issues that behaviorists typically treat, including:Biting
Scratching
Hissing
Not eating
Not using a litter box
Excessive meowing
Running away
Self mutilation
Separation anxiety
Various phobias

, It is a good idea to talk to several pet behaviorists before picking one. This will help you to figure out whether a specific behaviorist can help your cat and which one will be best for your cat. When you consult with these behaviorists you can get a general feeling for their demeanor and you can ask them questions about their:Qualifications
Experience
Treatment methods
Training methods

, There are three types of veterinary pet behaviorists: Applied Animal Behaviorists, Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (CAABs), and Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (ACAABs). These veterinary professionals all have specific graduate degrees in animal behavior, either a MS, MA or PhD, or they went through post-graduate work on behavior after veterinary school.If a potential behaviorist does not have this type of educational background, then you should find someone else that does.
It will cost more to take your cat to a veterinary professional that has an advanced degree than it would to someone who does not. However, just remember that you are paying for their advanced education and experience.

, Have a honest conversation about your pet's problems and what the behaviorist can do to treat them. You should discuss not only what the cat is physically doing, for example attacking strangers, but how that behavior is impacting your life, for instance if it limiting your relationships with friends.


This kind of honest conversation will allow the behaviorist to truly understand the seriousness of the situation.

, If your cat has an especially bad behavior problem then you will need to find a pet behaviorist that is experienced with treating hard cases. Ask them whether they have treated cases like your cat's and what type of treatment they think would be appropriate.It may be helpful to write out some questions you have before going to a consultation appointment. This will help you to assure that you ask all of the important questions you have thought of.
When asking the behaviorist about their experience, feel free to ask for some references from former clients that you could contact.

, Once you have decided on a behaviorist for your cat, you should watch the treatment sessions to see how the behaviorist interacts with your cat and what their treatment process is like. This will help you to assess whether the behaviorist is right for your cat and it progress is being made.


If your cat is not responding well to the behaviorist or is not progressing after several sessions, feel free to try a different behaviorist.

, In order to minimize bad behavior and keep your cat happy and healthy, you should make sure that you are fulfilling your cat's basic needs. On the most basic level, these include giving it food, water, shelter, a clean place to go to the bathroom, and affection. If you don't provide one of these, such as when a cat's litter box doesn't get cleaned regularly, your cat may act out in order to get your attention about the situation and in order to express its displeasure.


If your cat is having behavior problems, it does not automatically mean that you are not providing for its basic needs. Behavior problems can have a wide variety of causes, many of which have nothing to do with the care you give your cat., In addition to providing for your cat's basic needs, many cats that are bored and not stimulated enough can lash out and begin to have behavior problems. This means that you should provide your cat with a variety of types of stimulation, which could include:Feather toys
Catnip toys
A cat tree
A scratching post
Cat climbing shelves
A perch with a good view outside

, You should take your cat to see a veterinarian for regular veterinary exams and for care if it gets sick or injured. Making sure that your cat is healthy will go a long way towards keeping it healthy and bad behavior free.


Some behavior problems, such as urinating outside of the litter box, can have a medical cause. If your cat begins to act out inappropriately and uncharacteristically, have it seen by a veterinarian to rule out a medical cause for the bad behavior."

Feed your cat wet food to increase their protein intake.,
Choose a high protein dry food if your cat won’t eat wet food.,
Select food high in fiber.,
Pick food that is low in carbohydrates and fat.,

Transition your cat to its new food gradually.,
Stick to regular feeding times.,
Determine your cat’s body condition score.,
Reduce your cat’s portions if it is overweight.,
Check your cat’s blood sugar regularly.,
Monitor your cat’s appetite, weight, and litter box.,
Bring your cat to the vet for regular check ups.",How to Feed a Diabetic Cat," High protein is an important dietary factor for cats with diabetes. Look for food that contains high quality protein sources like chicken, fish, or beef. Canned food can be fed to increase your cat’s protein intake and decrease their carbohydrate intake.Diabetic cats with kidney disease may negatively react to a high protein diet, so talk to your veterinarian before switching your cat’s food.
Cats with diabetes can become dehydrated easily, so choosing canned wet food for your cat also helps ensure they get the water they need at each meal.;
, Dry foods that are high in protein and/or fiber can be fed to cats that are picky and will only eat dry food. Talk to your veterinarian before switching your cat’s food.Be sure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times.

, Cats with diabetes may need food high in fiber so they can better absorb glucose and fat in their diet. High fiber diets are also good for weight loss, which is ideal if your cat is overweight or obese.Read the label of the cat food and check the nutritional values listed. Make sure the canned food contains at least 50% animal based protein.

, Make sure your cat is getting at least 20-45 percent of its daily calorie intake from fat and only 1-2 percent of its daily calorie intake from carbohydrates. Having a low carbohydrate diet will help your cat regulate its symptoms. Look for wet cat food where less than 10 percent of the calories are coming from carbohydrates.It can be tricky to find information about the carbohydrates and fat content in cat food on the label. You can contact pet food companies to find out this information or ask your vet if certain cat food brands are known to be good for diabetic cats.

, Before you change your cat’s diet, consult with your vet. Ask them for recommendations on cat food brands that are ideal for diabetic cats. Your vet should be able to suggest several cat food options for your pet.Based on your cat’s condition, your vet may recommend a prescription diabetic food for your cat. These prescription foods are designed for diabetic cats but they can be expensive.

, Always give your cat its insulin first, followed by a meal. Doing this will ensure the insulin is absorbed properly and do not have low blood sugar. Get in the habit of giving your cat insulin right before its scheduled feeding time.Your vet should show you how to give your cat their insulin. You may need to practice doing this a few times to get it right.

, Do this by adding a small amount of the new food to its old food. Increase the amount over time so your cat gets used to the new food. For example, you may give your cat ¼ of its old food and ¼ of a can of high protein, low carbohydrate food to start. Over a week to two weeks, you can increase the amount of new food in your cat’s diet.Make sure your cat eats the mix of old and new food. Not eating can be dangerous for diabetic cats. If your cat does not seem interested in its food, you may need to revert back to its old diet for a little while to get it to eat again and transition it to the new food more slowly.
Do not let your cat eat people food or table scraps, as this can negatively affect its condition.

, It is very important that a diabetic cat have a strict and regular feeding schedule. Feed your cat twice a day at the same times. If your cat usually likes to graze or snack throughout the day, try to get it to eat at set times instead.For example, you may feed your cat once in the morning before you go to work and once at night before bed.

, A body condition score tells you whether your cat’s size and weight are under ideal, ideal, or over ideal. Look at your cat from the side and from the top to determine its score. If your cat is over or under ideal, speak with your veterinarian about adjusting their diet.An under ideal cat has visible ribs, no palpable fat, and a pronounced abdominal tuck.
An ideal cat is well-proportioned, with a slight abdominal tuck and a minimal abdominal fat pad.
An over ideal cat has a poorly visible waist, rounding of the abdomen, and fat deposits present.

, Many diabetic cats are overweight or obese. If this is the case with your diabetic cat, you should reduce its portions so it can lose weight and stay healthy. Ask your vet to recommend portion sizes for your obese cat. Your cat should be given reduced portions until it hits a healthy body weight.Do not leave your cat's food out throughout the day to let it graze or snack on. This can lead to weight gain. Instead, only put your cat's food out when it is feeding time.
You can also help your obese cat stay healthy by giving it access to climbing and resting areas in your home so it can roam around. Have play time with the cat regularly so it gets enough exercise every day.

, Diabetic cats should have their blood sugar levels checked regularly to ensure they are not experiencing low blood sugar or other issues. Ask your vet to recommend a blood sugar level monitor that you can use on your cat. You will need to use the monitor to test your cat’s blood for any issues or abnormalities., Check that your cat eats all of its food at every meal. If it is not eating, you may need to switch the cat back to its old food for awhile or speak to your vet. You should also monitor your cat’s weight using a scale to make sure it is not overweight or gaining more weight than it should.You should also check your cat’s litter box to confirm it is going to the bathroom regularly. It should be urinating the same amount of liquid on a regular schedule. If this is not the case, speak to your vet.

, Schedule monthly or semi annual check ups with your vet to monitor your cat’s condition. Your vet can help you stay on top of your cat’s feeding schedule and diet. They can also let you know if your cat’s diabetes is improving or if you need to make adjustments so your cat’s condition does not get worse.Keep in mind with the right diet, some cats can go into diabetic remission, where they no longer have low insulin levels. Over time you may be able to reduce the amount of insulin you give your cat or not need to give them insulin at all. If this happens, you will still need to maintain your cat’s diet and health to ensure the diabetes does not return.

Look for signs of malnutrition.,
Observe to see if the cat is simply overweight.,
Notice signs of Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP).,
Look for signs of infection, virus, or parasites.,
Identify signs of cancer or a tumorous growth.,
Look for signs of metabolic or digestive issues.,
Explain the timetable of your cat's swollen abdomen.,
Discuss your cat's eating patterns.,
Allow your vet to run bloodwork.,
Ask your vet to run diagnostics.",How to Diagnose the Cause of a Swollen Abdomen in Cats," Cats who have malnutrition often have a distended belly. A distended belly may appear as if it bloated or sticking out. It may look to have very little fat or muscle covering it. Malnutrition is common in cats who:

Eat food prepared at home.
Are kept on a vegan or vegetarian diet.
Lack enough Vitamin E, copper, zinc, and potassium.
Eat food that contains a lot of vegetable oil.;
, Typically, a cat will need about 30 calories a day per pound of weight. If your cat consumes more than this, they may become obese.

Consult your vet and/or the nutritional information on the back of your cat food packaging., FIP is a potentially fatal condition that starts as a viral infection and is common in areas or households with a high cat population. In addition to a distended abdomen, diarrhea is one of the most common signs of FIP.

FIP can be confirmed through blood tests that test liver enzyme levels, bilirubin levels, and globulin levels., There are a wide variety of communicable diseases that may cause a swollen abdomen in cats. While most cases are minor, some might lead to serious problems for the affected cat. Look for symptoms of:

Pyometra, which is an infection in a female cat’s reproductive system. Pyometra may manifest in lethargy, lack of appetite, or frequent urination.
Intestinal worms. The most common symptom of intestinal worms may be rice-like objects in your cat's fecal matter or around their anus., These are perhaps one of the most serious causes of a swollen abdomen in cats, and you should seek veterinary care immediately if you suspect it. Some of the most common symptoms of cancer or tumors are abnormal skin growths and/or loss of appetite., Metabolic and digestive issues (like diabetes and colitis) may be one of the most common causes of swollen abdomen in cats. Common signs include change in appetite, weight change, and/or a decline in energy level.

If you suspect your cat has a metabolic or digestive issue, you may need to have your vet run blood tests to confirm or rule out these conditions., Give your vet a sense of when and/or how quickly your cat developed a swollen abdomen. This is important information your vet will need when they diagnose your cat. Inform them if:

Your cat developed a swollen abdomen overnight or over the course of several days.
Your cat developed a swollen abdomen over the course of several weeks or months.

, Your cat’s appetite is likely connected to their swollen abdomen. This is because an infection in the abdomen or other problems in the digestive system will impact whether your cat wants to or even has the appetite to eat. Let your vet know if your cat:

Is eating less.
Is eating more.
Has a complete lack of appetite.
Throws up after eating.
Has been started on a new food recently., Bloodwork is essential in helping to arrive at a diagnosis about what is causing your cat’s swollen abdomen. Without bloodwork, your vet won’t have basic information about your cat’s immune system and more. Bloodwork may:

Give your vet information about your cat’s immune system. If your cat has an infection, like pyometra, they will have elevated white cell counts., Your vet may have to run a variety of diagnostic tests to arrive at a proper diagnosis. Some diagnostics that might shed light on a swollen abdomen include:

X-rays. An X-ray might help your vet locate any cancerous growths or infected organs.
An ultrasound. An ultrasound will give your doctor a lot of information and may help rule out or confirm the diagnosis of cancer. In addition, it will let the vet know if there is an accumulation of fluid in or around the abdominal cavity.
A biopsy. If your vet locates a growth or infected area within your cat’s abdomen, they might need to take a biopsy."

Ask your vet about payment plans.,
Offer to exchange work for care.,
Consult another vet.",How to Find Financial Assistance for Feline Veterinary Care1," If you’ve kept up with your veterinary expenses but are facing an unexpected cost, your vet may work with you to make your expenses more manageable. For instance, you may be able to pay off a large bill over the course of a few months.A vet who has cared for your cat before is more likely to offer this option.
It may help to propose a plan that would work best for you. For instance, ask “Would it be possible to make three monthly payments to cover this expense?”;
, In some cases, your vet may be willing to waive charges if you can perform services for their business in exchange. For instance, you may be able to walk dogs or clean kennels for a certain numbers of hours to cover a procedure you cannot afford.If you have a particular skill that may benefit your vet’s business, offer a specific exchange. For instance, if you are a web designer, offer to update their website.

, Getting a second opinion is often worthwhile, especially if your vet is unwilling to help you pay for the care your cat needs. While switching vets means you may have to pay an initial consultation fee, you may be able to find a vet that offers care at lower costs, or that recommends a less expensive form of care.Ask friends that have pets if they have a vet they'd recommend, and read online reviews of the vets in your area.
Call around and ask for quotes from a few different veterinary offices for an expensive treatment.
Consider going to a vet in a rural area. Often, vets in smaller towns charge less than vets in urban areas.

Praise your cat.,
Take your cat to the vet for annual exams.,
Give detailed information about your cat.,
Pay attention during the exam.,
Ask questions.,
Discuss possible treatment with the vet.",How to Get the Most Out of Your Cat's Vet Visit," If your cat only associates its carrier with a visit to the vet, your cat will probably fight getting into it. To encourage your cat to get into the carrier, get it used to the carrier before the visit. You might place treats in the carrier and leave the door open for your cat to explore. You could also place your cat's favorite toys in it or make it cozy so your cat enjoys playing or sleeping in the carrier.Ensure that the carrier isn't too small for your cat. If you haven't purchased a new cat carrier since your cat was a kitten, it may be time to buy one that fits your full-sized cat. Your cat should be able to stand up and turn around in its carrier.;
, Most cats don't like riding in the car so driving to the vet can make your cat anxious. To reduce your cat's anxiety, take it for short (5 to 10 minute) drives through your neighborhood before the cat's visit. You could drive your cat to the vet's office even if it doesn't have a scheduled visit just to get it used to the experience.Getting your cat used to riding in the car for no reason will help your cat associate the car with pleasant things instead of just going to the vet.

, Even if your cat remains calm in the car, it may become upset as soon as it gets into the waiting room with other nervous cats. Try to stay calm so that your cat sees there's nothing to fear. You should also keep your cat in its carrier while you wait. You may want to place a blanket or covering over the carrier so your cat doesn't become overstimulated by everything it sees, hears, and smells in the waiting room.Consider buying a calming pheromone spray. Spray your cat with the pheromone spray to relax it.
Talk to your cat in soothing tones to make it feel relaxed and reassured. Hearing your voice can help it realize that you're still close by even if it's in the carrier with a cover.

, If you can, work with a veterinarian who has a friendly and calm attitude. This will make your cat feel at ease and make your visit go smoother. If you think the vet is too clinical or impersonal, you may want to ask friends to recommend a vet who is known for good bedside manner.A vet can calm your cat by talking to it and petting it for a few minutes before the exam. If the vet doesn't automatically do this, ask them to do this.

, Make your cat feel happy and loved by talking to it in a comforting voice. You should tell your cat how brave and good it is. Stroke and pet your cat to put it at ease. You can also place treats in the carrier to reward and distract your cat.Your cat should feel safe and loved. You may need to pay extra attention to your cat after the vet's appointment so your cat is reassured.

, Annual exams are an important part of keeping your cat healthy. You can expect the vet to do a physical exam, take your cat's medical history, check for dental health, and get vaccine boosters. You can also talk with the vet about giving your cat preventative treatments for parasites.If your cat is showing any problem behaviors, you can also talk to the vet about possible causes for the misbehavior. For example, you might say, ""Why do you think my cat has just started scratching the furniture?""

, You'll probably need to give health information about your cat to the veterinary tech and veterinarian. Try to be as detailed and thorough as possible so the vet team has all the information they need to examine and treat your cat. For example, instead of saying, ""My cat has been withdrawn,"" say, ""My cat hides from people every afternoon and is no longer affectionate.""It may help to keep a health journal for your cat. Write down any health issues or concerns you have so you can refer back to it during the exam. For example, you might write down that your cat urinated outside of her litter box three times one day. Bring this concern up with the vet and ask about possible causes.

, Watch what the vet does during the physical exam and ask for more information about what the vet is looking for. This way you can learn about ways to improve exams you give your cat at home. You should also assist the vet if the vet asks you to hold your cat. This can make your cat feel more assured than if the vet tech is the one to restrain your cat.


If the vet does anything you're confused or concerned about, don't hesitate to ask the vet for answers. You might say something like, ""I see that you're checking the cat's fur. What exactly are you looking for?""

, A visit to the vet is your chance to ask any questions you have about your cat. If you find that you forget your questions when you're actually at the appointment, you might try writing them down in the days before the exam. This way, you'll be sure to remember to ask them.If you remember questions that you forgot to ask, don't hesitate to call the vet's office or email them. You can call them and say, ""I was in the other day with my cat and I remembered a question I have for the vet.""

, If your cat needs any treatment, talk with the vet so you understand procedures that your cat may need. Find out whether or not your cat will need to stay overnight, what kind of home care your cat will need, and determine if the cat will need procedures in stages.For example, you might say, ""Could you walk me step-by-step through the treatment procedure and tell me what I should do when I take my cat home?""
If you're worried about paying for a treatment, tell the vet. Depending on the condition and treatment, the vet may be able to schedule staggered treatment so you can pay in installments.

Work with your vet to create a diet plan.,
Decrease your cat’s carbohydrate intake.,
Give your cat foods with a higher fat content.,
Make sure your cat is getting enough protein.,
Ask your vet about dietary supplements.,
Keep your cat hydrated.",How to Feed a Feline Cancer Patient1," While there are some general guidelines for feeding a cat with cancer, your cat’s needs will vary depending on their age, size, overall health, and the type and stage of their cancer. Talk to your vet about the best kind of diet for your cat.Your vet may recommend a prescription cat food, a home-made diet designed to meet your cat’s needs, or some combination of the two.;
, Too many carbs can feed your cat’s cancer cells, causing the cancer to grow and keeping your cat from getting enough nutrients. Vets recommend that cats with cancer should eat food that contains less than 25% carbs on a Dry Matter Basis (DMB).To calculate the DMB percentage of carbohydrates or any other ingredient in your cat’s food, use an online calculator like the one available on the Feline Nutrition Awareness Effort website: http://fnae.org/dmb.html


, In contrast to carbs, it is much harder for cancer cells to convert fat to energy. Give your cat foods that are relatively high in fat and omega-3 fatty acids, which may actually inhibit tumor growth.Your cat’s food should have a fat content of about 25-40% DMB.
Look for foods with at least 5% DMB of omega-3 fatty acids.

, Protein intake is important for helping your cat maintain a healthy lean body mass. In general, cats with cancer should eat a diet containing at least 40-50% DMB of protein.However, be aware that your cat may need to eat a smaller quantity of protein if the liver and kidneys are not functioning properly.

, In some cases, cats with cancer may benefit from additional dietary supplements, such as arginine (an amino acid that is important for the feline diet) or vitamin B12, which can be especially important for cats with intestinal cancer. You should consult with your vet before starting your cat on any sort of dietary supplement., Cats with cancer often have trouble getting enough fluids, especially if their kidney function is impaired.Make sure your cat always has access to plenty of fresh, clean water.

You can boost your cat’s fluid intake by feeding them a wet food diet or adding water to their kibble."

Warm up your cat’s food.,
Give your cat multiple small meals.,
Offer your cat a new food.,
Avoid feeding your cat when they are nauseated.,
Avoid mixing food and medication, if possible.,
Ask your vet about giving your cat an appetite stimulant.",How to Feed a Feline Cancer Patient2," If your cat is not showing much interest in their food, you may be able to make it more appealing by warming it up a little bit. This will bring out the aroma of the food.Don’t make the food too hot. It should be no warmer than the normal feline body temperature of about 100 °F (37.78 °C).
If you use a microwave, heat the food for about 5 seconds and then stir it up to distribute the heat evenly through the food., Instead of giving your cat one or two large meals, feed them several small, manageable meals throughout the day. This will prevent uneaten food from sitting in the dish and becoming stale., When your cat is ill, they may come to associate their regular food with feeling sick. If your cat is refusing to eat, sometimes offering a new type of food, or even feeding the cat in a different location from usual, will spark their interest in eating.Before trying any new food, make sure that it meets your cat’s special dietary needs.

, Feeding a nauseated cat can lead them to associate their food with feeling sick, and make them less likely to eat it in the future. If your cat is showing signs of nausea, like drooling while looking at food, spitting out food, or turning away from food when you offer it, don’t keep encouraging them to eat.Your vet may be able to prescribe an anti-nausea medication for your cat. Let them know if your cat is showing symptoms of nausea.

, If your cat’s medication tastes bad or makes them feel nauseated, try to avoid mixing it into their food or administering it too close to a meal. If your cat associates their food with unpleasant medication, it may discourage them from eating.However, keep in mind that some medications need to be given with food to reduce the risk of upset stomach. Talk to your vet and follow the instructions on your cat’s medication.

, As a last resort, your vet may prescribe a medication to stimulate your cat’s appetite. Keep in mind that appetite stimulants are not a long-term solution to eating problems in cats, and they do not work for every cat."

Make food and water easily accessible.,
Syringe-feed your cat.,
Tube-feed your cat.,
Give your cat subcutaneous fluids.",How to Feed a Feline Cancer Patient3," If your cat has trouble getting around, keep their food and water in easy-to-reach bowls in the area where they spend most of their time. You may wish to place multiple food and water dishes around the house for easier access., If your cat is very weak or extremely malnourished, they may need to be syringe-fed. This involves hand-feeding your cat small amounts of soupy, high-calorie food through a medicine syringe.Ask your vet about the type, amount, and consistency of food that you should administer to your cat via syringe.
Lightly warm the food before giving it to your cat.
Wrap the cat gently but firmly in a towel to keep them from scratching or struggling during the feeding.
Grasp the cat’s head from behind, with your thumb and forefinger resting on the cheekbones, and gently lift the cat’s head.
Insert the syringe tip into the cat’s mouth from the side and gently nudge it between the cat’s jaws.
Direct the syringe toward the roof of the mouth at a 15° angle and slowly inject the food into the cat’s mouth.

, If your cat has trouble eating by mouth, they may need to be fed through a feeding tube. There are a variety of types of feeding tube, which may be inserted into the cat’s nose, throat (through an incision on the neck), or directly into the stomach through an incision in the side of the cat’s body. Liquid food is slowly inserted into the feeding tube through a syringe.Ask your vet for detailed instructions on the best way to tube feed your cat. The amount and type of food you give, and the number of feedings per day, will depend on your cat’s needs.
Pay careful attention to your vet’s instructions for keeping the syringe and the area around the tube clean, in order to minimize the risk of infection.

, If your cat is especially dehydrated, has impaired kidney function, or is having trouble drinking, you may need to administer fluids directly under the skin through a catheter attached to a drip bag. Subcutaneous fluids may need to be given a few times a week, or as often as once a day.Ask your vet for instructions on how to give your cat subcutaneous fluids. The amount of fluid and the frequency of administration will vary depending on your cat’s needs.

Offer a variety of bowls and glasses.,

Keep the bowls and water clean.,
Pay attention to where your cat drinks.,
Run the tap.,
Consider using a drinking fountain.,
Add flavors to the water.,
Offer bottled water.,
Give your cat more wet food.,
Add ice cubes to the water.,
Serve smaller, more frequent meals.",How to Encourage Your Cat to Drink More Water," Your cat may simply be picky and have her own bowl or glass preferences. She may want a bowl or glass made from stainless steel, ordinary ceramic, or plastic. To see what your cat likes, put out a variety of styles to see if one appeals more to your cat.


You might also experiment with depth of the bowls. Your cat may prefer a deep bowl or a shallow bowl. It's just a matter of personal preference.;
, Avoid keeping water bowls in only one place since it may discourage your cat from drinking. Instead, put bowls near the sink, on the kitchen counter, near your bed, in the bathroom, or just all over the house. This will encourage your cat to explore and remind her to drink water.Make sure the bowls are located in areas your cat is likely to be. For example, if your cat spends hours napping on the windowsill, place a cup of water next to this spot.
You can also place a bowl near the bathtub to see if your cat is interested.

, Clean the bowls out with soap and water every other day, taking care to rinse them well. Once a week, run them through the dishwasher to sterilize them. Change the water at least once or twice every day and check to make sure that nothing has fallen into the bowl throughout the day, especially if it's near the kitchen.Your cat may not be drinking much water if her bowls are dirty. Some cats can be very picky about having clean water and will show their displeasure by not drinking.

, The water bowls should be in an appealing place far from your cat's food or litter box. While some cats don't care if their water is close to the litter box or food bowl, others are particular about having them close to the water.Make sure your cat can see you move the water to a new location, away from the food or litter box. This way, she won't fear that her water has been removed.

, Though this isn't the most water-saving friendly approach, some cats love drinking from the tap. Your cat may be excited and curious by the movement, making her want to drink. If she doesn't seem interested right away, you can move her up to the sink and show her how fun it is to drink from the tap.Since you probably don't want to run the tap constantly, make this part of your morning or evening routine so your cat knows to expect it at those times.

, If you find that your cat loves running water, buy a drinking fountain. This will keep the water flowing all day, making drinking more exciting. Your cat may love to stare at, play, and drink from the fountain. Don't throw away the regular water bottles when you introduce the fountain. Keep both options available so your cat can decide which she prefers.Cat drinking fountains can be a bit pricey, costing over $50 in most cases. However, if you're worried about your cat becoming dehydrated, then it may be worth the investment.

, Pour a little tuna or chicken broth into your cat's water. You can also add some juice from wet cat food. Just a spoonful or two of flavoring mixed into the water may be enough to trick your cat into drinking the water, especially if your cat normally likes wet cat food. However, realize that not all cats like the taste of flavored water.


You can also try to trick your cat into drinking water by crushing up catnip in the water bowl. Let your cat see you crush a bit of catnip in the bottom of her water dish so she knows it's there., Buy a plain bottled drinking water and see if your cat prefers that to the water out of the tap.Your cat may dislike the tap water because of the chlorine or excessive minerals in it.

Try offering room temperature bottled water as well as chilled bottled water to see which temperature your cat prefers.

, While wet food is richer and more expensive, it does contain more moisture than dry cat food. If you're concerned your cat isn't drinking enough, completely switch to wet food or incorporate some into her regular dry meals. Ask your vet before making any dietary changes.Do not add water to your cat's dry food in an attempt to make her drink water. Not only will this make his food much less appealing and soggy, but it can cause the food to spoil, making your cat sick.

, Some cats really love cold water and the ice cubes also give her something to play with. At first, add just one or two ice cubes to each bowl. This way, your cat isn't shocked by the change in temperature. If your cat likes the flavor, freeze broth into ice cubes and place them in the bowl.You may even want to have your cat watch you put the ice cube in her water. Eventually, she may be more excited and mentally stimulated about drinking her water.

, Lots of cats tend to drink after they eat, much like humans, so try feeding your cat more than once or twice a day. Break those meals into several smaller ones to encourage your cat to drink more often throughout the day. It may take time for your cat to adjust to the new feeding schedule, but it may keep your cat hydrated.


If you want to offer more frequent meals, you must be available for feeding.

Check the color of your cat’s gums.,
Measure the capillary refill time.,
Determine if your cat is drinking less.,
Look for cracks in the skin on the nose.,
Check the nose for sores and blisters.,
Take note of when your cat’s nose is dry.,
Decide if a visit to the vet is necessary.,
Have your vet examine your cat.,
Follow treatment instructions, if necessary.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Dry Nose in Cats," A cat with a dry nose could have a fever. Before taking your cat to the vet, you can take its temperature at home. The normal range of temperatures for cat is 100–102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8–39.2 degrees Celsius)., A cat’s temperature can be taken rectally or in the ear. Ear temperatures are not very accurate, so it is better to take a rectal temperature.If you do not already have a digital thermometer, purchase one at your local pharmacy, along with some lube (KY jelly, petroleum jelly) to put on the thermometer.


To take your cat’s temperature, place some lube on the thermometer. Hold your cat like a football, with its hind end facing you, and gently insert the thermometer about two inches into your cat’s rectum.
Remove the thermometer when it beeps and read the temperature.
If your cat has a fever, you will need to take it to the vet.If your cat resists you taking its temperature, have your veterinarian take the temperature.

, A dry nose can also be warm. However, a warm nose doesn’t necessarily indicate a fever. Your cat’s nose may be warm because your cat has been sitting or lying in a sunny spot. Also, because a cat’s normal body temperature is higher than a human’s body temperature, a cat's nose may naturally feel warm to the touch., A dry nose can also be caused by dehydration. One way to test for dehydration is to make a ‘skin tent.’ To make the tent, use your thumb and index finger to pinch and pull up a piece of skin from the scruff (just behind your cat’s neck). Release the skin. If the skin stays in place, your cat is dehydrated.For a well-hydrated cat, the skin would immediately go back down.

, If your cat has a dry nose, the gums can also indicate if dehydration is causing the dryness. In a healthy cat, the gums will be bright pink. In a dehydrated cat, the gums may be white., If your cat has pink gums and a dry nose, you may wish to check their circulation. Gently press your index finger against your cat’s gums for a few seconds, then lift your finger. Your cat’s gums should become briefly pale, then quickly return to pink once the capillaries refill with blood. If the gums stay pale or take longer than two seconds to go back to pink, your cat could have circulatory problems. Visit a vet promptly for a diagnosis, since this may be a sign of a serious medical issue such as heart disease or anemia., Monitoring your cat’s water intake is another way to test for dehydration. If your cat is drinking less than usual, then it may be dehydrated.If you can, watch your cat to see if it is walking to its water bowl less frequently than usual.


You could also measure how much water your cat is drinking. In the morning, use a liquid measuring cup to put an exact amount of water into your cat’s water bowl.
At the end of the day, pour the remaining water back into the measuring cup to determine how much (or how little) water your cat drank on a given day.
If your cat is showing any signs of dehydration, take it to your vet.

, A cat’s nose can become so dry that it starts cracking. This can indicate a serious skin problem called pemphigus foliaceus. This condition can also cause the skin on the nose to look crusty.Pemphigus foliaceus requires veterinary treatment.

, Pemphigus foliaceus can also cause the skin on a cat’s nose to develop sores and blisters. These skin lesions can start to ooze, so you may also see discharge coming from the skin on your cat’s nose., If your cat’s nose is normally dry, there probably is not a problem. However, if your cat’s nose is usually cold and wet, then suddenly becomes dry, your cat may have an underlying health problem., A dry nose in your cat may or may not indicate a health problem. If your cat looks otherwise healthy (eating, drinking, and grooming normally; still playful), a dry nose likely isn’t something for you to worry about. However, if your cat has the signs listed below, along with a dry nose, you should take your cat to the vet:Fever
Dehydration
Tiredness
Decreased appetite
Crusty nose with sores and/or blisters

, If you think your cat’s dry nose is a problem, then a veterinary exam will be helpful to diagnose the cause. First, your vet will perform a physical exam of your cat. They will pay close attention to your cat’s nose, then look for other signs of illness that you may have detected at home.


If your vet thinks the dry nose is a problem, they may perform some diagnostic tests, such as blood work and skin samples, to determine the cause of the dry nose.

, If your vet identified a health problem as the cause of your cat’s dry nose, your vet will prescribe treatment for that problem. For example, if your cat has the skin disease pemphigus foliaceus, your vet will prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication (pemphigus foliaceus attacks the immune system)."

Try asking the librarian at your local library to help you locate books and periodicals that can help you identify native caterpillars in your area.
You can find a list of state wildlife websites to help you find caterpillars here: https://www.fws.gov/offices/statelinks.html
;
, Once you have identified the types of caterpillars in your region, you can narrow down your search by what kind of caterpillar you’d like to have for a pet. Different kinds of caterpillars develop into different kinds of moths and butterflies, so you may choose one based on its caterpillar state, or on what type of butterfly you’d like to see emerge from the cocoon.Some caterpillars can be dangerous to touch. You may want to take that into account when choosing a type of caterpillar to start looking for.
You may want to choose a species of caterpillar that you have ready access to a food source for. Caterpillars prefer leaves from their “host plant” to eat.

, Different kinds of caterpillars (and therefore butterflies) prefer to reside in different kinds of plants, so It’s important that you choose what kind of caterpillar you’re looking for in order to know where to look. The plant a breed of butterfly prefers is called a “host plant.” Some examples of host plants for certain species of caterpillar are:Monarch butterfly caterpillars prefer milkweed plants.
Spicebush Swallowtail caterpillars tend to reside in spicebush.
Your best bet to find a Zebra Swallowtail caterpillar is in the Paw-Paw plant.
Black Swallowtail caterpillars are commonly found in parsley, dill, or fennel plants.
Luna moth caterpillars can be found in both walnut and sweet gum plants.
Cecropia Moth, Viceroy or Red-Spotted Purple moth caterpillars can be found in cherry trees.

, Different caterpillars are more active at different points of the year, but nearly all caterpillars can be found in the Spring and Summer months. You will likely not be able to find caterpillars beyond the early stages of fall.Some caterpillars enter a state similar to hibernation throughout the colder months.
Other caterpillars lay eggs that stay dormant until spring.

, It may not be easy to spot a caterpillar right away. Caterpillars often blend in with their environment as a defense mechanism against predators. One way to spot a plant that likely has caterpillars in it is to look for signs that a caterpillar has been feeding on a plant recently.Different kinds of caterpillars will leave different eating damage, so it’s important to look for the type of damage caused by the caterpillar you’re looking for.
You can find photographic examples of different caterpillar eating damage here: http://www.raisingbutterflies.org/finding-immatures/caterpillar-strip-patterns/


, Caterpillars cling tightly to the leaves and branches they are on, so pulling on it could injure the caterpillar or even pull off its legs. Instead, place your hand, a leaf or twig in the path of the caterpillar and allow it to crawl onto it to transport them.Be careful not to touch fuzzy or spiny looking caterpillars, as the bristles you see may be a defense mechanism that can cause skin irritation.
Always wash your hands after handling caterpillars.

, Caterpillars do not require an elaborate enclosure to keep them safe and healthy. A one-gallon jar, fish tank or reptile enclosure will all work fine. Make sure the container has a cover and allows air to flow in and out. Line the bottom of the container with paper towels to make it easy to clean.Cheese cloth can be used as a lid for enclosures that don’t have a top. Caterpillars cannot chew through cheesecloth but it allows air to travel in and out of the enclosure.
If you are going to poke holes in a lid or enclosure to allow airflow, be sure the holes are very small or the caterpillar may find a way to escape through them.

, Caterpillars need sticks and twigs to crawl around on, and eventually, to hang off of as they enter their pupae stage. Adding sticks and twigs will also make your caterpillar feel more comfortable and at home.Make sure to place some of the sticks upright, leaned against the wall or top of the enclosure to give your caterpillar a place to climb.
Place some sticks on their sides on the bottom of the enclosure as well.

, Once you have the enclosure prepared, give it a once over to make sure it looks safe for your new caterpillar friend. Caterpillars can easily injure themselves or get trapped if an enclosure isn’t safely put together.Caterpillars can easily get cut by sharp edges in their enclosure. Make sure the areas around holes you punch are bent or sanded over so they can’t injure the caterpillar.
Look at the ways your sticks are positioned to ensure the caterpillar couldn’t easily get trapped under or between them.

, If you have more than one caterpillar in your enclosure, it’s important that you provide each caterpillar with enough space to thrive. Make sure there is at least three times the body size of each caterpillar in the enclosure.If you plan to use the same enclosure for the caterpillars until they hatch into butterflies, you need to ensure there is enough room for them to expand their wings when they emerge from their cocoons.

, Caterpillars eat the leaves of the host plants you often find them on. Take some of the leaves from the type of plant your particular caterpillar prefers and place them in the enclosure to serve as a food source.Caterpillars will eat in their own time, so don’t worry if the caterpillar doesn’t begin eating as soon as you place leaves in the enclosure.
If a caterpillar has more than one preferred host plant, add leaves from each to give the caterpillar a few choices.
If you are unsure of a caterpillar’s host plant, add a few different kinds of leaves and see which one the caterpillar eats. Use those leaves for food from now on.

, Caterpillars need water added to their enclosure on a daily basis. Do not place a water dish in your enclosure as caterpillars may fall into them and drown. Instead, simply spray some water onto the leaves each day and the caterpillars will drink from the droplets.Instead of spraying water onto the leaves, you can simply rinse them before you place them in the enclosure, that will provide enough water.
If your caterpillar begins to look very dry, try spraying more water into the enclosure.

, You will need to remove uneaten leaves on a regular basis. Depending on the plant, leaves may last up to a week, or they may begin to dry out after only a few days. You may also want to replace the paper towels you place at the bottom of the enclosure as bedding.Replacing the bedding will remove caterpillar droppings and waste that could cause caterpillars to get sick.
Remove old leaves any time you place new leaves in the enclosure.

, If your container does not allow enough room for your caterpillars to emerge from their cocoon and spread their wings, you will need to relocate the cocoons to a larger enclosure once they enter them.Make sure the new enclosure has enough space for the butterflies to emerge from their cocoons and spread their wings.
Be very gentle when removing the cocoons. You can handle them with your hands as long as you are very careful.

, If you are relocating your butterfly cocoons, you may want to simply move the twig it’s hanging from into a new, larger space. If that isn’t an option, there are a few ways you can hang the cocoons in their new habitat.You can use the glue from a hot glue gun, cooled slightly so it’s tacky, to attach the pointy end of the cocoon to a twig.
You can puncture the pointy end of the cocoon with a needle and thread to hang it in your enclosure, but this can be dangerous, as you may hurt the caterpillar inside.

, Most caterpillars will hatch from their cocoons as butterflies within ten to fourteen days, but some may not emerge from their cocoon at all during the winter months.In the Spring and Summer months, caterpillars will emerge as butterflies at the fastest rate.
In the Fall, some caterpillar breeds may remain inside the cocoon for extended periods of time.

, You will know that the butterfly will emerge from its cocoon soon when it changes colors. Some turn darker in color while others become clear, depending on the species of moth or butterfly inside.If the color of the cocoon changes, the butterfly will likely emerge within the next day or two.
If a cocoon’s color becomes extremely dark, it is likely that the caterpillar inside died.

, Many butterflies and moths do not have digestive tracts once they reach the butterfly stage of their lives. These butterflies and moths usually only have a lifespan of a few days. Some others can and do eat. Make sure to provide some leaves from the host plant species of that butterfly in case your butterfly or moth eats.You may want to release your butterfly or moth at this point so it can pursue a mate.
To release a moth or butterfly, simply open the container outside and allow it to fly away.

Schedule an appointment as soon as possible.,
Allow your veterinarian to examine your cat.,
Follow your veterinarian’s treatment plan for your cat.,
Change your cat’s diet.,
Give your cat plenty of fresh water.,
Clean your cat’s litter box.,
Reduce your cat’s stress.,
Have your cat’s urine tested regularly.",How to Diagnose Urinary Tract Disease in Cats," One of the most obvious signs of feline urinary tract disease is an increased frequency of urination.When you are at home, make a note of how often your cat is going to her litter box and compare it to her normal frequency. If she is going more often when you are at home, you can be confident that the frequency is also increased when you are not there.;
, In addition to increased frequency, how your cat urinates will indicate urinary disease. For example, you may hear her whine or cry out when urinating, due to pain.She may also squat for a long time, trying to urinate.The straining would be due to a blockage of the urethra, which is the structure carrying urine from the bladder and out of the body. Your cat may feel the urge to urinate frequently, but will not be able to urinate much, or at all.
Urethral blockage is a medical emergency, particularly in male cats. If left untreated, a cat can suffer serious organ damage, and may even die from the condition.Your cat may also squat if she is trying to defecate. If your cat becomes vocal when squatting, it is probably because she can’t urinate.

, With urinary tract disease, your cat may not want to go to her litter box anymore. She may prefer a cool and smooth surface, such as a tile floor or bathtub, on which to urinate.This different surface may help her feel better, at least temporarily.


Your cat’s urinary tract disease may cause her to lose her bladder control and drip urine, which would lead to her urinating elsewhere. She may also have developed a fear of the litter box, if she associates it with painful urination.
Do not punish her if she is urinating outside of her litter box.

, If your cat manages to urinate, look at her urine. Blood is commonly seen in the urine of cats with urinary tract disease. The urine may look cloudy, which would indicate an infection. In addition, the urine may have a very strong ammonia odor.

, Unsurprisingly, your cat will probably start acting differently if she has a urinary tract disease. For example, she may be more irritable because of the pain.She may direct this irritability toward you and/or your other pets. In addition, she will groom her genital area excessively.The constant pain and strain may leave your cat feeling very tired. She may also start drinking more water.
Urinary tract disease will make your cat’s abdomen feel painful, so she will probably not want you picking her up or touching her abdomen.Upper urinary tract disease can cause back pain, so you may see your cat walking more slowly and gingerly, or not at all., If your cat is experiencing any urination problems, make an appointment with your veterinarian right away. Urinary tract disease can quickly become a serious medical problem, so you do not want to delay getting your cat diagnosed and treated. When you call your veterinarian’s office, provide as much detail as you can about your cat’s urination behavior (e.g., how long it’s been going on, level of pain).


If your cat is having trouble urinating, poisonous wastes in the urine can accumulate in her body and make her very sick., In addition to a physical exam, several other tests are available to diagnose urinary tract disease in cats: urinalysis, urine culture, bloodwork, and imaging (x-rays and abdominal ultrasound). Because lower urinary tract disease in particular can have many causes (e.g., urinary stones, cancer), your veterinarian may need to run several tests to rule out other causes of your cat’s urination problems.For the urinalysis, your veterinarian will test the urine’s pH and look for the presence of blood, stones, and white blood cells.He or she will also look for ‘casts,’ which are clumps of dead cells from the kidney that would indicate kidney disease.If white blood cells are present, your veterinarian may want to also perform a urine culture to see what types of bacteria are in the urine.
Bloodwork can provide a good indication of your cat’s overall health and indicate kidney disease.
Imaging can be helpful if your veterinarian suspects stones or some type of blockage within the urinary tract. For example, x-rays or ultrasound could show a tumor mass in the bladder (very rare) or stones in the kidney or bladder., After making a diagnosis, your veterinarian will put together a treatment plan. There are many available treatment options (e.g., antibiotics, dietary changes, surgical removal of stones), so your veterinarian will choose the combination of treatments that will most effectively treat your cat’s urinary tract disease. Do not hesitate to ask your veterinarian any questions you may have about your cat’s treatment.


Other potential treatments include pain medication, anti-inflammatory medication, and stress reduction.Be aware that what works for one cat may not work for another.If the initial treatment is not working well for your cat, talk to your veterinarian so he or she can come up with another treatment approach.

, Urinary tract disease, particularly kidney and bladder stones, can recur after initial treatment.Several specially formulated therapeutic diets (e.g., Hills C/D Multicare, Royal Canin Urinary SO) are available that can both treat and prevent feline urinary tract disease. Purchase the diet through your veterinarian—pet store foods that claim to aid in the prevention of urinary tract disease may not be as effective as veterinarian-prescribed therapeutic diets.Your veterinarian will recommend which diet will be best for your cat.
Switch your cat’s diet gradually by slowly increasing the amount of new food versus old food until she is eating 100% new food. A sudden change could upset her digestive system and be stressful to her.
Urinary diets add acid to your cat’s urine to prevent stone formation. Do not supplement your cat’s diet with urine acidifiers—they can damage your cat’s kidneys and cause an imbalance in her body’s minerals., A limitless supply of fresh water will encourage your cat to drink more.You can also encourage her to drink more by giving her water with a syringe or feeding her more wet food.Consider increasing the number of water bowls around your home or purchasing a cat fountain to encourage more drinking., A clean litter box will encourage your cat to urinate more frequently.Scoop out the dirty litter each day. Be aware that, even though her litter box will be clean, your cat may continue to have a negative association with the litter box.Encourage her to start using her litter box again by using comfortable litter and giving her privacy. Do not use treats to entice her—she will not want to eat where she uses the bathroom., Stress can contribute to urinary tract disease development, so it will be important for you to minimize your cat’s stress as much as you can. For example, maintain her daily routine with as few changes as possible. In addition, spend more quality time with her (e.g., playing, petting) and give her toys and scratching posts to keep her busy. Also, consider spraying a cat pheromone in your home, which will have a calming effect on your cat.Pheromones are available at your local pet store.
If you have a multi-cat household, make sure each cat has her own litter box.Place the litter boxes far enough away from each other so that one cat cannot block access to them.If your cat’s stress or anxiety is especially bad, your veterinarian may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication for her., This is particularly important if your cat was treated for kidney or bladder stones. Your veterinarian may want to test your cat’s urine for the presence of urinary tract disease. He or she will recommend how often your cat’s urine should be tested."

Identify your caterpillar.,
Inform yourself about your caterpillar's host plant.,
Eventually when your caterpillar grows, it will start to wander around.,
Be sure to have another hanging stick out for your butterfly, when it emerges.,
Let the butterfly go after couple hours, cause it needs it's wings to dry off and harden.

",How to Raise Caterpillars,"  You can go to Discover.;
, Caterpillars eat different types of leaves. For example , Black Swallowtails feed on rue, celery, carrot, parsley , dill , and fennel. As you can see, it has a wide range of food. Yet some types of caterpillars, such as Monarchs feed only on Milkweed. So it is fairly important to learn about the host plant , or else they will not eat.

, This is the time to put a stick in it's cage, so it can pupate. Before you put the caterpillar inside the cage, you may also try putting dirt at the bottom, since some moths will actually burrow to form a chrysalis. Most caterpillars pupate for around 10 - 12 days.

, Butterflies need a stick to hang on to, so they can pump fluids into it's wings , because when the emerge, their wings are shriveled.

Be aware that that hypertension is more common in older cats.,
Know that certain diseases can cause hypertension.,
Understand why hypertension is an issue.,
Realize that in order to treat hypertension, you must treat the underlying condition.,
Be aware that medication is often required to treat hypertension in cats.",How to Diagnose Hypertension in Cats," Hypertension can be ""silent"", which means the cat shows no symptoms.


However, the higher the blood pressure the greater the risk of a sudden deterioration in the cat's health, as a result of a stroke or blindness.
Hence the importance of regular monitoring at your vet clinic, in order to detect hypertension before it causes problems.;
, Suspicious signs of hypertension are if the cat walks as if drunk - staggering from side to side, as if not in charge of his legs.


Also, watch the cat's eyes to see if they are tracking from side to side - this is known as ""nystagmus"". This is a sign of a stroke, of which the number one cause is hypertension.
Depending on the damage caused by the stroke, other symptoms include permanently tilting the head to one side, and an inability to co-ordinate or control the limbs.

, Another suspicious sign is if your cat suddenly starts bumping into things, and doesn’t react if you flick a finger near her eye. Sudden blindness is associated with hypertension.


Another hint is if the pupils are large and dilated, and do not close down to slits even in bright light. This is because the detached retina is not registering the bright light.

, The pupil is the dark slit contained by the colored iris. A cat has a slit-shaped iris which is very narrow in bright light, and wide, round, and dilated in low light conditions such as at night.


A blind cat, (such as one with detached retinas) does not receive messages from the retina to change pupil shape. The pupil remains as a wide, circular, and dark, no matter how bright the light is.
Look carefully through the wide pupil. Sometimes, even with the naked eye, it is possible to see folds of something semi-transparent, draped across the back of the lens.
This is the retina which has bulged forward because of the pressure of fluid between the retina and the eyeball. When detached it drifts around like a net-curtain in the breeze, and may settle against the back of the lens.

, Your veterinarian will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope, which is a bright light with magnification, to examine the eye in more detail. Retinal detachment is often found hand-in-hand with small bleeds, or hemorrhages, at the back of the eye.


Hemorrhages are a useful way of monitoring the progress of a cat with hypertension. This is because sometimes blood pressure rises and falls in cycles. Thus, it is possible that at some times of the day the pressure is normal, and at others is high. This causes problems when physically measuring blood pressure because you can get misleading normal readings.
However, a useful check is if the blood pressure reading is normal, but the clinician spots signs of fresh hemorrhage at the back of the eye. This means the cat may not be as stable as the measurement suggest, and more frequent check-ups, weekly or fortnightly, are recommended.

, The hearts of cats with hypertension are usually working very hard - beating at a racing, bounding pace. To check this, place your fingertips just behind the cat's elbow, resting them against the chest wall.


The pounding of a diseased heart is often easier to feel than a normal heart. Some hearts that are working extra hard really bound hard against the chest wall and almost seem to leap out to tap your fingers.
This is contrasted with a normal heart where it can take a great deal of concentration to detect the heart beat with fingertips.

, A normal heart rate is around 120-140 beats per minute. This rises in response to stress (such as a trip to the vet clinic!).


The heart rate is interpreted in view of the circumstances, hence 180 beats per minutes is acceptable in a stressful situation, but over 200 beats per minute is too fast.
Likewise, if the cat is asleep at home with a heart rate of 180, this is likely to be significant.

, The gold standard for diagnosing hypertension in cats is to measure their blood pressure. This is done the same way that a doctor checks your blood pressure - with an inflatable cuff placed around the arm (or leg, in the cat's case).


The principle behind measuring blood pressure is putting a known amount of pressure into an inflatable cuff, and listening until the pulse sounds stop. A bit like putting your foot on a hosepipe, once the pressure of your foot exceeds the force pushing water through the pipe, the water flow stops.
In this case, the pressure is the inflated cuff, and the force is blood in an artery. The pressure applied to the cuff when the pulse stops, is equal to the blood pressure.

, To measure blood pressure the veterinarian, or vet tech, decides which pulse to use. Cats have good pulse points in their wrists, just below the main stop pad.


There is often a good pulse at the base of the tail on the lower surface. However, fur interferes with the sensor picking up the pulse and so a small amount of fur is clipped over the area, and water-soluble acoustic gel applied to the skin.
With the cat gently held on the owner's lap, an inflatable cuff is placed around the cat's upper arm, above or below the elbow.

, The clinician places the sensor pad over the pulse point and applies gentle pressure until the sensor rests firmly against the skin.


He moves the sensor around until he can clearly hear the ""whoosh whoosh"" of blood through the artery. The cuff is slowly inflated, and a note made of the pressure required to silence the pulse.
This is repeated several times to obtain an average reading.

, Normal blood pressure in a cat is below 130 mmHg. However, in the stress of a clinic situation up to 180mmHg is acceptable if the cat has no symptoms.


If the cat has symptoms (such as evidence of a retinal hemorrhage) then the blood pressure should be measured again about 7 days later.
The clinician uses his judgment as to whether treatment is required, if blood pressure lies between 180 – 220mmHg. However, if the blood pressure is over 220mg Hg treatment is definitely in the cat's best interest, because this places her at a high risk of complications such as a stroke.

, Any cat aged 8 years or older should have her blood pressure measured at least once a year. A cat aged 15 years or over, but in good health, should have her pressure checked at least twice a year.


A cat diagnosed with a problem that is associated with hypertension, such as renal disease or hyperthyroidism (over-active thyroid glands) should have their blood pressure monitored regularly, at 3-6 month intervals, even if they appear completely normal.
A cat diagnosed with hypertension and started on treatment should have her pressure checked every 7-14 days until she is stable. This is marked by her blood pressure coming down within normal levels and staying there.
Once stabilized, she should have a check 4 weeks after initial stabilization, and if that pressure is normal, then routine checks every 3 months.

, Blood pressure tends to rise with age because the blood vessels become less elastic, which means they are harder to stretch.


It takes more force to push blood through narrow vessels, and to maintain circulation the heart pushes harder, thus increasing blood pressure, to force blood through the vessels.

, Diseases such as kidney failure and over-active thyroid glands make a cat more likely to develop high blood pressure.


There are also some extremely rare conditions, such as hyperadrenocorticism, also known as ""Cushing's disease"" that are associated with hypertension in cats. In humans, diabetes mellitus is associated with high blood pressure, but the link is not as strong in cats.

, When blood is forced through delicate tissue at high pressure, it can damage it.


This commonly happens in the eye, where the high pressure causes fluid to seep between the retina (the light sensitive layer) and the back of the eye. This is called ""retinal detachment"" and causes blindness.
Also, damage to blood vessels in the brain can lead to strokes which can have a long-term detrimental effect on the cat's ability to walk and move, and can in some cases be fatal.
High blood pressure through the kidney causes inflammation and further damage, and deterioration in the life expectancy of the organ.

, High blood pressure is strongly linked to underlying disease conditions. An important part of controlling hypertension is to stabilize the primary condition (i.e. kidney disease, or thyroid glands).


For renal disease this involves prescription diets that give the kidney less work to do, phosphate binders to decrease phosphate absorption from the blood, and ACE inhibitors to increase blood flow through the kidney.
Cats with hyperthyroidism can be treated with a low-iodine diet, or corrective medications containing methimazole, radioactive iodine therapy, or surgery to remove the overactive glands.

, If, despite treatment of predisposing factors, blood pressure remains high then medication may be needed. The most widely used anti-hypertensive drug is a human medication, amlodipine. This is because there is no licensed veterinary anti-hypertensive.


Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which means it stops the influx of calcium into heart muscle cells and vascular smooth muscle. This causes the arteriole walls in particular to relax, which decreases the resistance to blood flow.
The dose is 0.625 to 1.25 mg per cat every 24 hours. Unfortunately, this medication is only available as a 5 mg tablet, thus for a cat the dose is about an eighth to a quarter of a tablet once daily."
"
Take your cat to the vet.,
Get a physical examination.,
Run additional tests.",How to Diagnose Keratitis in Cats1," If you suspect that your cat has keratitis, take him to the vet immediately. Leaving keratitis untreated can lead to severe eye damage which may result in blindness.


Common symptoms of keratitis include swollen or irritated eyes, discharge from the eye, and discoloration of the eye.
Though eye irritation might be due to multiple conditions, or caused by a variety of triggers, any eye problems in your cat should be seen by a vet.;
, When you take your cat to the vet, the vet will perform a thorough physical exam. This usually includes checking the cat's temperature to rule out fever, listening to the chest, and looking at the tongue. Then the vet will check for complications in the eye, such as a corneal ulcer or glaucoma.


Your vet will check to see if the cat has a more generalized respiratory infection, such as with herpes virus.
To check for an ulcer, the vet puts drops of a special dye into the eye. The orange dye stains ulcers bright green. This is important to check since the treatment for keratitis can involve steroid drops, and steroids can make corneal ulcers worse.
If the vet suspects glaucoma, then she will use a tonometer to check the pressure within the eye. This condition can mimic keratitis, but the treatment is different for glaucoma than keratitis.

, To rule any other reasons for keratitis, the vet may select other tests to run. This may include wiping a sterile swab over the surface of the eye and then sending the culture to check if there is a bacterial colony present which needs treatment.The vet may also run blood tests, checking the pet's general health and factors which may suppress the immune system, such as FeLV and FIV. These can prevent the natural defense mechanisms of the eye from reducing inflammation.

Test the urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC).,
Take a sample of the cat's blood for blood testing.,
Do a test to distinguish between kidney disease and dehydration.,
Perform a kidney biopsy only if renal cancer is suspected.",How to Diagnose Kidney Failure in Cats," The kidneys have a huge reserve capacity and it isn't until at least 75% of total kidney function is lost that the cat shows clinical signs of a problem.


Thus, by the time a diagnosis can be reached the cat is coping on a maximum of 25% of the renal capacity when healthy. (This sounds alarming, but remember when people donate a kidney, they automatically lose 50% of their renal capacity and yet do not become ill).
Unfortunately, as total kidney function declines, the nephrons (the individual filtration units contained in the kidneys) which are still working are asked to work harder and so their demise is hastened. It is therefore important to identify renal disease in the cat are early as possible because early treatment extends the life of the remaining nephrons.
However, early detection is problematic because blood screening is relatively insensitive up to the point where 75% damage has occurred. Many vet clinics offer routine yearly, or six-monthly screening programs for senior (over the age of 7 years) cats.;
, Kidney failure is usually accompanied by a range of symptoms. The symptoms occur as the body adapts in order to minimize the effects of kidney disease.


As an owner you may notice little changes in your cat early on, such as the need to fill the water bowl more often, or empty the litter tray more regularly. These are signs that the cat is drinking more, a sign which should never be ignored.
However, many of the signs associated with renal disease overlap with other conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, pancreatitis, or infections. This means that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made on symptoms alone, but they are a strong hint that further steps need to be taken to get to the bottom of the problem.

, You may notice if your cat develops unusual habits such as drinking from the toilet or if the water bowl constantly needs topping up. Increased thirst happens as a result of the kidney losing its ability to recycle water from the blood stream.


The body loses water through the urine, which is more dilute, and so this water needs to be replaced, causing increased thirst in the cat.

, Because the cat is drinking more and is not able to concentrate her urine as well, the volume of urine produced is larger. This means the bladder fills more often and the cat needs to urinate more often to stay comfortable.


Cardinal signs are needing to clean the litter tray more often, or a break down in house training habits.

, Even though the cat drinks more, there is often an imbalance between water loss and water taken in, which results in the gradual development of dehydration.


Veterinarians assess this during a physical examination by looking at how quickly the scruff springs back to its normal position. To do this, gently grasp a piece of scruff over the shoulder blades, between the finger and thumb of one hand. Lift the scruff 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) away from the backbone and release it.
In a well-hydrated animal the scruff springs straight back into the normal position. In a dehydrated animal the skin loses elasticity which means it returns slowly to the resting position. If the skin takes over a second to slip back down then the cat is probably dehydrated.

, As part of the kidneys impaired ability to filter, large molecules such as protein tend to leak through the kidneys and be lost in the urine. Protein loss represents an important waste of calories.


Another reason for weight loss is that the buildup of natural toxins often makes the cat feel nauseous, which reduces her appetite.

, Cats get bad breath for many reasons, including rotten teeth, gum infections, diabetes mellitus, diet, and kidney failure. In kidney disease it is the toxins that cause the bad breath and this is described as having a typical ammonia-like smell.


This smell is not always easy to detect and some people's noses seem better tuned to pick up ammonia smells than others.

, The same toxins that cause bad breath also damage tissues and cause ulceration in the mouth and stomach lining. Of these, you can see the ulcers in the mouth. They tend to form along the margins of the tongue, or where the teeth meet the gum.


Again, ulcers do form for other reasons such as viral infections or if the cat has licked a caustic substance, but it remains a sign that needs to be taken note of.

, Ultimately, when protein loss exceeds intake from the diet, the cat's muscle starts to break up to provide her with the necessary protein requirements.


Cats with kidney failure are typically thin, with dull coats and wasted muscles.

, Gastric ulcers caused by a buildup of toxins make the cat nauseous. This results in vomiting and a reluctance to eat.

, Scar tissue causes the kidneys to shrink and failing kidneys typically feel smaller than usual. Especially in thin cats, the kidneys are easy to feel in their location sitting beneath the lumbar vertebra.


Gauging their relative size is a subjective measurement and a skill that veterinarians acquire over the years. Don't try to feel your cat's kidneys at home.
A normal kidney is usually equivalent in length to that of three lumbar vertebrae, and shrunken kidneys measure less than two lumbar vertebrae in length.

, Scar tissue forms fairly uniformly throughout the kidney and so the surface of the kidney feels smooth and both feel equally shrunken. However, cancerous kidneys often feel knobbly with a rough, bumpy surface.


The latter is an important indication for kidney biopsy because some renal cancers are amenable to chemotherapy, whereas old age kidney deterioration is not.

, The kidney breaks down several hormones that control blood pressure. When the kidney is not working properly the levels of these hormones rise which creates an increased risk of high blood pressure o hypertension.


On physical examination the veterinarian may see telltale signs of hemorrhage on the retina, or even spot detached retinas, which are a common consequence of hypertension.
Once again, high pressure is not diagnostic of kidney failure, but a strong clue that needs to be followed up on.

, Urine analysis is an extremely valuable tool for assessing renal health, especially in the early stages of kidney disease. A simple dipstick test can quickly rule out conditions which cause increased thirst such as diabetes, if no glucose is present.


A dipstick test also gives a rough indication of the protein content of the urine. A high protein level can result from a urine infection (in which case blood is commonly present in the urine) or kidney disease.
If blood is present the clinician will suggest either treating preemptively with antibiotics, or sending the urine for culture. Only once the blood has cleared can a decision be reached that the protein is because of leakage from the kidney.

, Specific gravity is a measure of how dilute or how concentrated the urine is. Cats are very efficient at concentrating their urine, in order to preserve water.


Specific gravity is measured relative to water (which is SG 1.000). A healthy urine SG is between 1.035 – 1.060. Urine below SG 1.035 is considered abnormally dilute. Urine SG below 1.025 is significantly dilute.
Dilute urine should contain very little protein, thus a result of a low SG and high protein level is an indicator that the kidneys are not concentrating urine and are leaking protein. This is an important pointer towards kidney disease, which can be detected before changes are evident in the blood test.

, This test measures the ratio of protein in urine to another naturally occurring metabolite called creatinine. The normal value in the cat is below 0.4. Ratios above 1.0 indicate significant protein loss which needs investigating.

, Blood tests play an important role in identifying cats that have lost over 75% of their functional kidney capacity. Most useful for diagnosing kidney failure are three indicators: blood urea, creatinine, and phosphate levels.



Blood Urea: Normal blood urea levels in the cat are less than 32mg/ml and levels above 35mg/ml are considered to be high. Whilst raised urea in the blood is an indicator of kidney failure, it can be high for other reasons. Therefore raised urea levels alone are not sufficient to diagnose renal failure.

Blood Creatinine: The normal level in cats is below 130 umol/l. Any reading above 130 umol/l is likely to indicate renal disease. Creatinine is a waste product of protein breakdown and is only excreted by the kidneys.

Phosphate levels: The kidney finds it difficult to excrete phosphate and when kidney function fails the levels of phosphate in the blood stream rise. Normal levels are below 2.6mmol/l. Unfortunately, high blood phosphate levels cause further kidney damage and so a vicious circle of poor kidney function leading to phosphate retention, which then causes further damage.

, High levels of urea, creatinine and phosphate is a strong indication of kidney disease. However, raised results do not necessary tell the clinician whether the problem lies within the kidney (i.e. true kidney failure) or if the kidney is under strain because of another condition such as dehydration.


To investigate whether the problem is pre-renal (caused by dehydration) or renal, the clinician often suggests rehydrating the cat by putting her on an intravenous drip for 2-3 days, and then repeating the blood tests at the end of this time.
If in the fully rehydrated cat the results are now normal, this indicates the kidney is probably functioning normally but was under severe stress. If however the results remain raised in the hydrated cat, kidney failure is likely.

, Kidney biopsy plays a limited role in the diagnosis of kidney failure. The main indication for kidney biopsy is when renal cancer is suspected, in which case a definitive diagnosis as to the type of cancer can indicate whether chemotherapy would be beneficial or not.


The majority of renal cancers present with either large kidneys, or kidneys with knobbly surfaces – which contrasts sharply with the small, smooth feel of kidneys with renal failure.
With the exception of kidney cancer, most causes of renal failure are treated in the same way. Putting the cat through the extra stress of an anesthetic and a surgical procedure in order to reach a precise diagnosis which is largely of academic interest is therefore not warranted.

Allow your vet to take a biopsy.",How to Diagnose IBD in Cats," If your cat has IBD, pooping outside of the litter box may be the first symptom you notice.Because IBD commonly causes diarrhea, your cat may not make it to the litter box each time it needs to poop.


Don’t punish your cat if you see poop outside of the litter box. Clean it up without making a fuss.;
, Looking at your cat’s poop won’t be a pleasant task. However, knowing what the poop looks like can help determine what part of your cat’s GI tract is affected by IBD (stomach and small intestine vs. large intestine). For example, if your cat’s large intestine is affected, the poop may be watery (indicating diarrhea) or have flecks of blood in it.If the stomach and small intestine are affected, the poop may look completely normal.Pay particular attention to see if blood or mucus are present in the feces, and report any blood or mucus to your vet.


Consider writing down what the poop looks like, or even taking a picture. This information will help your vet diagnose IBD in your cat.

, Straining to defecate is another sign of IBD in cats.If you see your cat squatting for a long time in or out the litter box, then it is likely straining to poop. Straining can be painful, so your cat may cry out in pain while trying to poop.Straining during urination and defecation can look similar. Check your cat's litter box to make sure that they are passing urine. If not, then this indicates that your cat may be in a life-threatening situation and require emergency treatment. Take your cat to see your veterinarian right away if this happens.

, Vomiting is a sign of IBD in cats, especially when the upper GI tract (stomach, small intestine) is inflamed. The vomiting may be occasional in the beginning of IBD, then become more frequent until it occurs everyday.The vomit will either be liquid or contain digested food.Sometimes, owners may think the vomiting is caused by hairballs., Cats with IBD will eat less, stop eating completely, or develop huge appetites.If your cat is eating less or wants to eat much more than usual, it may have IBD.


Your cat may lose weight when it eats less, or when it eats more.If your cat is losing weight despite eating more, it may be because the GI tract is not able to absorb nutrients and is losing them through diarrhea or vomiting.

, In cats with IBD, symptoms can appear in cycles. For example, symptoms may be present for days or weeks at a time, then disappear for days or weeks.Or, the symptoms might appear only with specific situations, like vomiting after eating.Write down when the symptoms appear and disappear. This can also be helpful information for your vet.

, It’s normal for cats to occasionally vomit or have diarrhea.However, if your cat regularly vomits or has diarrhea, or if these symptoms are occurring frequently than before, it’s time to take your cat to the vet.


Be aware that some cats with IBD may show signs only once or twice a month.If this describes your cat, it would still be a good idea to take it to the vet before the vomiting and diarrhea get worse.

, Your vet will first physically examine your cat. They may be able to feel the thickened walls of the GI tract when touching your cat’s abdomen. Your vet may also be able to feel enlarged lymph nodes in the GI tract.A large portion of a cat’s immune system is in the GI tract. Therefore, if your cat has IBD, the lymph nodes in your cat’s GI tract may enlarge in response to the disease.

, Because other health conditions can resemble IBD, your vet will need to rule them out using diagnostic tests. Blood work will show elevated levels of inflammatory cells. It will also show decreased levels of various nutrients (potassium, protein, calcium) due to diarrhea and vomiting.Your vet will also run specific blood tests. For example, they’ll take a blood sample to test for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus.They may also evaluate thyroid hormone levels in the blood.
A fecal sample is useful for identifying intestinal parasites., After taking blood and fecal samples, your vet will want to look at your cat’s GI tract. An abdominal ultrasound will help your vet see thickened GI tract walls. However, if the walls are only mildly thickened, they may look normal on an ultrasound. Mildly thickened walls can also look normal on an x-ray., Food allergies can cause symptoms similar to those of IBD. Your vet may recommend conducting hypoallergenic food trial to rule out a food allergy.For the food trial, you will feed your cat a protein it hasn’t eaten before (kangaroo, duck), then re-challenge your cat with its old diet to see if the symptoms come back.


Food trials are very lengthy. They can take as long as a few months.

, A biopsy is the only way to confirm IBD. With your cat anesthetized, your vet will perform an endoscopy or surgery to take a tissue sample, then have a veterinary pathologist example the sample. The pathologist will identify the inflammatory cell types in the sample.An endoscopic tube is long and thin with a camera and biopsy instrument at the end.
For an endoscopic biopsy, your vet would pass the tube down into your cat’s upper GI tract, or up through the rectum into the large intestine. The sample would be fairly thin.The endoscope may not be able to reach the inflamed area of your cat’s GI tract. Also, because the sample will be thin, making a definitive IBD diagnosis may be difficult.A surgical biopsy would be thicker than an endoscopic biopsy. However, surgery is much more invasive and expensive than endoscopy.Given the pros and cons of each procedure, talk with your vet about which procedure will be best to diagnose IBD in your cat.

Watch for swollen eyes.,
Check to see if the cat is favoring his eye.,
Monitor for eye discoloration.,
Look for brown stains in the eyes.,
Look for respiratory distress.",How to Diagnose Keratitis in Cats2," One symptom of keratitis is red, swollen eyes. Swollen eyes may be accompanied by a discharge from the eye.The discharge from the eye may be clear and watery, making the fur beneath look wet. It may also take on a yellow-green color if it is infected.
Swollen eyes may be a symptom of a generalized infection from the herpes virus.

, Cats with keratitis may display symptoms of eye discomfort. This means the cat may favor the eye.Your cat may rub the eye with his paw or rub his eye on the ground.
The eye may be closed, or your cat may start squinting. Additionally, he may be sensitive to light, so he may spend time in dark places or have trouble keeping his eyes open in bright lights.

, If your cat has keratitis, there may be some discoloration in the eye. The surface in the center of the eye should be clear so you can see the black pupil. If keratitis is present, you may see abnormalities there.


The surface of the eye may have inflamed patches with blood vessels threading over the surface.Sometimes, due to extra cells in the eye area, the eye may take on a whitish appearance that looks like white-pink lace., With severe keratitis that becomes well-established due to lack of treatment, sometimes the area slowly becomes pigmented and brown staining covers the surface. This change may be permanent and the pigment prevents light entering the eye and interferes with the cat's sight.


In severe cases, the cat may become blind in that eye as a result. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment is desirable.Tests may be done to rule out other possible causes of the eye symptoms to make a more definitive diagnosis, especially in the case of herpes., Cats who have keratitis may display signs pointing to problems with their upper respiratory system. This might include sneezing, nasal discharge, or even discharge from the ears.If the keratitis occurs because of the herpes virus, respiratory symptoms may show earlier than or at the same time as eye symptoms.

"
"
Treat the condition.,
Understand that keratitis may be a result of a contagious disease.,
Vaccinate your cat against FHV.,
Learn the causes of keratitis.",How to Diagnose Keratitis in Cats3," The treatment depends on the underlying reason for the keratitis and the symptoms. Common treatments for keratitis are eye drops or a topical ointment since eye infections are common.


Your vet may also recommend giving your cat some kind of supplement to help boost her immune system, such as L-Lysine. This is supposed to help decrease the chance of a recurring corneal ulcer.If your cat has the herpes virus, the eye may not respond to the same treatments. Anti-virals may be given, along with an antibiotic for any present infection.If the swelling in the eye is bad, the vet may give the cat anti-inflammatory drugs., A cat with the feline herpes virus can infect another cat, which may lead to keratitis. If you know your cat or another cat has keratitis due to an infectious disease, separate them until the cat has been treated and healed.An infectious disease like feline herpes can be contracted through contact with bodily fluids such as saliva, nasal or ear discharge, and sneeze droplets.
The virus can also be contracted from litter trays, food and water bowls, and bedding.

, Since a common reason cats get keratitis is due to the feline herpes virus, you should vaccinate your cat. While vaccinations won’t eliminate the chances of your cat getting FHV, it will significantly reduce the risk.You can get your cat vaccinated against FHV at around eight weeks. It initially takes two or three injections, then a booster at one year, then boosters every one to three years.

, Keratitis is an umbrella term to describe the appearance of an affected eye. There is no one cause of keratitis. Anything that produces prolonged irritation on the surface of the eye can trigger the inflammation associated with keratitis.


Common triggers include a herpes virus infection, a blow to the eye like a scratch sustained during a catfight, or rubbing on the surface of the eye, such as from eyelashes from inturned eyelids.

, The woolly bear likes to hibernate in the soil.

,, You also may want to make 2 or 3 twigs stand up against the sides of the cup so the woolly bear can climb up the twigs. Just make sure they aren't big enough for the woolly bear to crawl out of the cup.

,, Only put in a maximum of 2 in a cup because in their later stages, they do not like to have much company. Just keeping one by itself is great for him.

, Do this every 3 days. It's okay if you spray the woolly bear, too. You will find that if you are putting enough water in the cup, he will start getting a black band if he doesn't have one already, or if he does have a black band, his black band will expand or stay the same. If his black band is smaller, it should get bigger if he's drinking enough water.

,, Leave the lid of the cup just laying on top of the cup, but not sealed. A woolly bear cannot lift the lid, but a moth can.

, He cannot survive in a cage.

Find a suitable container.,
Prepare the container.,
Add the caterpillar’s host plant.,
Avoid direct sunlight.,
Clean the habitat regularly.",How to Make a Caterpillar Habitat1," The first step to create a caterpillar habitat at home is to find a suitable container in which you can create a nice environment for your caterpillar. There are a wide variety of ways you can do this, including a well-ventilated glass tank, a plastic container, or even by using a couple of 1 litre plastic soda bottles.The size of the container depends on the number of caterpillars who you will have living in there.
As a general rule, each caterpillar should have at least three times their body size in extra floor space.
So a container for 10 6cm long caterpillars should have be at least 25x25cm of floor space.
Caterpillars don’t tend to move around that much, but every caterpillar should be able to feed without coming into contact with the others.;
, To make your container suitable for caterpillars you need to ensure that it’s well ventilated, has a little humidity, and that the caterpillars can’t crawl out of it. To keep it ventilated, punch lots of small holes in the lid of a plastic container. They should be big enough for air to pass through, but small enough that the caterpillar can’t escape.


To make the habitat a little more humid, you can just add a moistened paper towel to the container.Don’t add any open water into the container, as a caterpillar can easily fall in and drown., Caterpillars don’t have complex needs, but you do need to make sure they have a constant supply of their host plant for feeding. The host plant is the plant that the caterpillar eats, and tastes can vary significantly across breeds. If you take a caterpillar you found in the wild, look at what plant he is on, and bring that too.


Some common host plants include Aster, Hollyhock, Sunflower, Snapdragon, and Violet.If you know the details about your caterpillar, you can search for host plants via the website of London’s Natural History Museum: http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/hostplants/search/index.dsml.
Caterpillars will typically get most of their moisture from these plants, but you can wash the leaves with clean water to leave some extra moisture for them.
You can add individual twigs and leaves, or a potted plant. If you add a potted plant make sure it is kept watered, but there is no standing water that could potentially be a drowning hazard., The next step is deciding where to place your caterpillar habitat. There is a risk of your caterpillar drying out if he is in a place with too much heat, so don't place the container in direct sunlight, such as on a sunny windowsill.Heating in the winter and air conditioning in the summer may also dry out the atmosphere and potentially harm your caterpillars.
You can keep them in an unheated place, such as a garage, or introduce more moisture to their environment by adding a wet paper towel., Perhaps the biggest potential health problem for your caterpillars comes from their own poop (or frass). If you have an enclosed caterpillar environment it is especially important that you pay close attention to this. In an enclosed environment the frass will not dry out properly as it would in an open air environment.


In a closed container you should be checking and cleaning out frass up to every day.You may want to place some tissue paper or paper towel on the bottom of the container to help catch and absorb frass. You should still change this paper daily.A more well-ventilated container could be cleaned of frass once a week. It’s important to monitor it closely and react accordingly."

Do not use human allergy medicine.",How to Diagnose Seasonal Allergies in Cats," If your cat is licking or chewing its paws, abdomen, back, or legs, it could be simply engaging in regular cleaning and maintenance. However, if the licking produces excessive hairballs or exposes the skin, your cat is itchy.This itchiness could be due to seasonal allergies.As a result of its licking or chewing, you might see open sores or wounds on your cat.;
, Hives are a series of small red bumps that break out on the skin. Your cat’s hives might be localized to a particular region or they might be all over the body, so check carefully when looking for hives.Facial swelling might also accompany hives.
Hives are extremely itchy, so your cat might scratch its fur to the point that the skin is laid bare in affected areas.

, Redness and crusty rashes (miliary dermatitis) commonly affect the neck, back, and head in cats with seasonal allergies. These rashes are extremely irritating and itchy, and can be detected by watching your cat’s behavior, since in order to alleviate its itchiness, it will probably try to claw at the itchy areas or roll around on its back in an atypical way.If you see this behavior, part the cat’s fur if necessary to check the condition of the skin.

, EGC is a condition which produces up to three distinct symptoms. The most common symptom is eosinophilic granuloma, a cluster of pinkish-yellow lesions.Manifestation of these lesions vary widely. For instance, your cat might have small bumps, or large tumor-like ulcers.A variation, eosinophilic plaque lesions, more closely resemble hives. Look for small red bumps on the skin, especially near your cat’s stomach or thighs.
A final symptom that may appear is an indolent ulcer, a pus-producing sore that often appears along your cat’s upper lip.

, If your cat is exposed to an allergen, their eyes might be irritated. This irritation might cause them to shed tears or have a glassy shine in their eyes that is not normally there. Additionally, you might see streaks or staining at the corners of your cat’s eyes., Just like in people, cats might sneeze or snort due to seasonal allergies. If your cat is out of sight, listen for the sharp exhalation of breath that accompanies a sneeze., In order to remedy its itching, your cat might lick certain spots of its coat clean off, exposing the skin. If the hair loss occurs in a hard-to-see spot like its abdomen, you might not notice it at first. Look for other signs that your cat is suffering from seasonal allergies by checking for hair in the stool or large clumps of hair strewn about the house., Pollen – a microscopic powder discharged from flowering plants – is one of the most common causes of seasonal allergies. You can get the pollen count in your area by checking the pollen forecast. If the pollen count is high that day, keep your cat inside., Remove your shoes at the door to prevent bringing pollen all over the house. If, for some reason, your cat does get outside, wipe its paws down gently with a cool, damp cloth when it comes in. This will remove pollen from its paws and prevent it from tracking pollen and spores about the house.If you suspect your cat has more extensive pollen coverage on its fur or elsewhere on its body, give your cat a proper bath instead of just a wipe-down on its paws.
If your cat has a canine brother or sister, do the same when they come back inside.

, If your windows are open, you’re more likely to get irritating pollen and mold spores in your home, and trigger an allergic reaction in your cat. To prevent this from happening, keep the windows shut tight, especially during high-pollen periods., Pollen can get tracked inside from the outside and get stuck in carpets, on clothes, and on bedding. Launder your bedding and clothes regularly, and vacuum your home at least once each week.Additionally, dust the tables and counters of your home to avoid dust buildup.

, An allergy test administered by your vet will help identify the specific type of seasonal allergy your cat has. Your vet might draw your cat’s blood and analyze it. Alternately, they might use an intradermal skin test, which involves injecting your cat with allergens and looking for a reaction in a controlled environment.Armed with more precise knowledge of your cat’s allergies, you can identify the months when the allergens that impact your cat are at their peak and enact additional precautions to protect your kitty.

, Hyposensitization therapy (allergy shots) reduce the potency of your cat’s allergic reaction. These shots might not be appropriate for all cats and can take up to two years to become effective., There are several medications available for cats suffering from seasonal allergies. Your vet might prescribe, for instance, an anti-inflammatory medication to reduce redness and swelling. Your cat might also benefit from medications that suppress the immune system reaction that causes allergic attacks. Steroids – especially corticosteroids – are also sometimes used to relieve itching and inflammation.These medications are typically ingested orally, though they might be injected, too.
Always use medication as prescribed.

, Creams and salves have limited usefulness with cats, since they tend to just lick the lotion off. However, if your cat has itching or inflammation on the top of its head, the back of its neck, or in a nearby location that is inaccessible to your cat, topical solutions could prove useful., Medications meant to fight allergic symptoms in humans are not always appropriate for cats. You could harm your cat by feeding it human allergy medications. Contact your vet to obtain a medicine that you can use to relieve your cat’s allergies."

Look at what the caterpillar eats.,
Consult a field guide.,
Search online.",How to Identify a Caterpillar," Although a caterpillar’s body may look like that of a worm, it can be divided into the same three parts as the insect it will become as an adult:


Head. The head features two sets of 6 simple eyes and sharp, powerful jaws that can tear up the leaves it eats into small, edible pieces. A spinneret on the lower lip exudes a silk that can be used to support the caterpillar and to spin the cocoon it enters to metamorphose into an adult.Thorax. The thorax sports 6 of the caterpillar’s legs, using them to hold onto its food.These legs, or true legs, will remain with the insect after it undergoes metamorphosis into its adult form.
Abdomen. The abdomen of a caterpillar is longer than that of the insect’s adult form. Eight temporary legs, called prolegs, are attached to the center of its abdomen. Another pair of prolegs, or anal prolegs, are attached to the rear of its abdomen.These prolegs help it to climb.The entire body is covered with tiny hairs (setae) that provide it with a sense of touch. In some species, these can be quite pronounced, giving the caterpillar a woolly appearance.
In contrast, centipedes have one pair of legs for each body segment, with anywhere from 15 to 177 body segments (always an odd number), while millipedes have two pair of legs for each body segment, with anywhere from 10 to 180 segments (40 to 750 legs).Larvae of other insects, such as the wireworm larvae of beetles, have only six legs.;
, Caterpillars are normally found on or around the plants they eat. (A few caterpillars, such as the zebra swallowtail butterfly larva, eat other caterpillars.) Many species are colored to blend in with the plants they inhabit, often hiding to further the disguise.Other species are colored to resemble predators like snakes, often with eye-like markings to make them look bigger, or are colored to match inedible things, such as the tiger swallowtail butterfly larva’s coloration resembling bird excrement.
Some caterpillars are brightly colored; many of these consume the toxins found in the plants they eat, which can poison the predators that eat them. The monarch butterfly is best known for this, as both a caterpillar and an adult. .Centipedes and millipedes, in contrast, are found under rocks, logs, rotting wood, fallen leaves, or other places that attract and retain moisture., Caterpillars move slowly, in a rippling or undulating fashion similar to that of an earthworm. Their rear segments contract, which pushes blood into their forward segments, lengthening them. Their forward legs seize their position as the segment muscles contract, bringing the rear segments forward.Centipedes, in contrast, move very quickly using their many legs. ., Some caterpillars, such as the zebra swallowtail, have a Y-shaped gland (osmeterium) on their neck that gives off a pungent odor to ward off predators. , Whether their coloration is to disguise them from predators or to advertise they are full of toxins, most caterpillar species can be distinguished by their distinctive markings. Some examples of distinctive colorations are these:


Monarch butterfly caterpillars are yellow with black and white bands. Forest tent caterpillars have fuzzy black and blue bodies with white markings shaped like keyholes running down the centers of their backs.
Eastern tent caterpillars also have fuzzy black and blue bodies, but they bear a solid white stripe down the centers of their backs.
Gypsy moth caterpillars have fuzzy black bodies with red and blue spots running down the centers of their backs.Tomato hornworms are pale green caterpillars with white and green markings and a protrusion resembling a horn.Some caterpillars adapt their coloring according to the time of year. The species ‘’Nemoria arizonaria’’ resembles the flower of the oak tree it is found in during the spring and the leaves of the small tree during the fall. (Both the spring and fall versions of the caterpillar metamorphose into a bright emerald-green moth.) , Many times you can identify a given caterpillar species by what kind of plant it is found on.


Monarch butterfly caterpillars are found on the underside of the leaves of milkweed plants.(Milkweed sap contains a toxin that makes the larvae and adults poisonous to predators.)
Forest tent caterpillars have fuzzy black and blue bodies with white markings shaped like keyholes running down the centers of their backs. They can be found on the leaves of ash, oak, quaking aspen and sugar maple trees, among others.
Eastern tent caterpillars also have fuzzy black and blue bodies, but they bear a solid white stripe down the centers of their backs. They feed on the leaves of apple and cherry trees.
Gypsy moth caterpillars have fuzzy black bodies with red and blue spots running down the centers of their backs. They feed primarily on the leaves of oaks and other hardwoods, but may sometimes feed on sugar maple leaves.Tomato hornworms are pale green caterpillars with white and green markings and a protrusion resembling a horn. They are found on the leaves and stems of tomato plants., If you’re not familiar with the caterpillar species in your area, or encounter a different species when traveling, you can consult a field guide.


Two good guides for children are the ‘’Peterson First Guide to Caterpillars’’ by Amy Wright and ‘’Golden Guide to Butterflies and Moths’’ by Robert T. Mitchell.Guides for adults include Thomas J. Allen’s ‘’Caterpillars in the Field and Garden’’ and David J. Carter’s ‘’A Field Guide to Caterpillars of Butterflies and Moths in Britain and Europe.’’, A number of online reference guides to various caterpillar species are available for you to access from your home computer or mobile device with an active Internet connection.


The Caterpillar Guide of Discover Life’s IDnature series (http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?guide=Caterpillars) helps you identify a caterpillar species by selecting the caterpillar’s main body color, pattern, hair density, and distinct features.
The Butterflies and Moths of North America’s website (http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/identify) features an image gallery from which you can identify the species of caterpillar you’re looking at. You can also submit your sighting and a photograph to have one of the group’s regional coordinators identify it, but to do so, you have to register with the site.
Regional guides such as the United States Geological Survey’s Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center’s ‘’Caterpillars of Pacific Northwest Forests and Woodlands’’ and ‘’Caterpillars of Eastern Forests’’ are structured like the printed field guides they were adapted from. The Pacific Northwest guide allows users to identify a caterpillar based on how it looks, while the Eastern Forest guides groups caterpillars by family..

Find a bucket or open container.,
Add the host plant.,
Consider adding a screen or net.,
Maintain the habitat.",How to Make a Caterpillar Habitat2," Caterpillars don’t tend to move around too much once they find a good place to feed, so it’s perfectly possible to have a habitat that is open. A caterpillar habitat could be as simple as a single potted plant placed on a table, but if you want to have a bit more control of where your caterpillar can crawl to, find an open bucket or container.


If you have a clear container, this will make it easier for you to observe the caterpillars.
Make sure it’s clean, but doesn’t have any lingering cleaning substances on the surfaces.

, Next you need to add the host plant to the container. You can do this in a variety of ways, such as just placing a potted plant into the bucket or container, or making some cuttings and placing them inside. Whichever method you use, make sure the leaves are a little damp to add some moisture.If you are adding a whole plant, make sure the plant is healthy and will continue to thrive and grow.
A plant will still need light to photosynthesis and remain healthy and a good food source for the caterpillars.

, If you are opting for an open container, you might consider adding a mesh, screen or net over the top of the plant or container. Your caterpillars may attract attention from predators and parasites in and around your home, such as spiders. Adding a net, such as a butterfly net, over the container or the plant can reduce the risk of this.


You will struggle to completely eliminate the danger of predators and especially parasites and parasitoids.Regularly cleaning away frass can help, as spiders are drawn to the smell., Once you have built up your caterpillar habitat, it’s important that you pay close attention to it. This means regularly cleaning out frass, adding fresh cuttings from the host plant, and ensuring the environment is not too dry. This is a bit of work, but it also gives you time to enjoy observing the caterpillars as they prepare to pupate.


You can always add some extra things, such as pebbles or more greenery. Remember that once your caterpillar has found a good place to eat, he won’t be too interested in exploring.
Try to avoid handling the caterpillars as much as possible. If you do need to handle them make sure your hands are clean, and ensure that you have rinsed off any excess soap."
"
Recognise when your caterpillar is looking to pupate.,
Make sure he has a good environment.,
Determine whether to move the chrysalis.,
Monitor the chrysalis.,
Help him release safely.",How to Make a Caterpillar Habitat3," Once your caterpillar has reached maturity and the last stage of its development, it will begin looking for a place to pupate. You may notice your caterpillar being more active than usual as it moves around looking for a good spot to make its cocoon.When it is ready to pupate, the caterpillar may move away from the host plant.
Remaining near the host plant can make it especially vulnerable to predators, so he may look for an unusual spot.
He will find a place to attach himself to form a cocoon, or, in the case of some species, he will dig into the ground and pupate there., You should try to provide plenty of suitable places for your caterpillar to pupate in your container. Put some extra twigs in, and add a fresh layer of soil. Give him options and spots that are a little bit away from the host plant.


For most butterfly species you should supply a vertical surface, such as a twig.
For moths, you should give them some leaf litter or loose soil., In some cases it might be necessary for you to move the chrysalis once it has formed. This should not be taken lightly, but it can be done safely if you are careful. When he emerges as a butterfly, it’s essential that he has enough space to fully unfold his wings. He needs space to stretch out and dry his wings or he won’t be able to fly and may fall and die.If the pupae is on a stick that you can move, try to carefully move it to a more open space in the container.
You might be able to make more space by removing other leaves and twigs while leaving the cocoon itself untouched.
If you have to move a cocoon, moisten the silk that attaches it to the surface and very carefully pull it free.Be sure you keep it the right way up and attach it to a string or stick that has more room.
You can use a straight pin to attach it, or some glue that is warm and tacky but not hot., Once your caterpillar has found his chosen spot and begun to pupate you should keep an eye on him. Not only will you be able to observe an amazing process of transformation, but you can also keep an eye out for any potential predators or parasites. Once he is in his cocoon he has no real defence, so if you have an open container he is very vulnerable.


Most caterpillars will stay in their cocoon over the winter, so if they pupate in the fall, they will likely remain in there for months.
He could, however, only be in his cocoon for a matter of days before emerging, so it’s important to pay attention.
Remember that throughout this time they are still alive and still require some care.
An occasionally misting of the container with water, or the addition of a wet paper towel will help provide the moisture he needs., When he is about to break out of the cocoon you may notice a change to the colour of the pupae. This can happen just a few hours before he emerges. The actual emergence happens very quickly, but then you will be able to observe him stretching and drying out his wings for a couple of hours. Make sure he has plenty of space to expand his wings.The butterfly will fly when he is ready, and then you have to choose whether to keep him, or release him into the wild.
You should only release him if he is a native to your country."

,,, Butterflies are attracted to salt, something your sweat will definitely bring forth., It's important that you don`t do any sudden or rapid movements that could scare them off. Standing still improves your chances of a butterfly landing on you., Butterflies can be attracted with slices of oranges, bananas and kiwifruit. If you're near a group of butterflies , a slice of orange, for example, will be an irresistible signal for them to come toward you.

Place the slice somewhere near you. When they sit on it, you can take the orange slice gently in your palm; the butterfly will not leave it.
Another alternative is to stand still and observe a feeding station quietly. Eventually, a butterfly may land upon you after feeding.

, It is said that what attracts butterflies most are pure souls."

,
Release the butterfly once you have looked at it.

",How to Hold a Butterfly," If they're already feeding on flowers (such as a butterfly bush) or at a butterfly bar, this is an ideal place to be.
, Wear bright colors.Butterflies are attracted to bright colors because they look like flowers, which is where they get their food from.


See How to attract butterflies for more details.

, Put just a little on a small spot on your hand; any more and the butterfly might get stuck.


To make butterfly nectar, boil a solution of 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.

, When it lands, simply observe it and let it rest there or feed upon the sugar water., When the butterfly lands, slowly approach and put a container on top of it. Take the lid of the container and slide it under to trap the butterfly in the container.

, Wait for the butterfly to move onto it, then slowly take the leaf out, gently holding the tip of the butterfly's wings so that it cannot fly away. Be very careful when holding the wing. One slip up, and the butterfly's wing will be crumpled or torn.

, Once there, you can let go of the wings.

,,,,


When you trap the butterfly with your hand, make sure the upper side (top of wings) are facing the edge of the net so that when you hold it, it isn't the wrong way up.
If the butterfly can flap its wings, you are not holding it hard enough and/or high enough.

If you see one flying purposefully in one direction, try to head it off.",How to Find and Catch Swallowtail Butterflies," Swallowtails love to fly up and down sunny roadsides. The best ones will be roads with creeks or rivers running alongside them. When you start seeing swallowtails, park and begin the hunt.;
, Male swallowtails love to ""puddle"" (drinking from wet ground), and are particularly fond of open, sunny expanses of wet gravel or sand on roads or alongside creeks. Large numbers may gather here, and the puddling butterflies are relatively easy to catch because they're just sitting on the ground.

, Thistles are a particular favorite, and swallowtails are easy to catch when they're nectaring. Other good flowers include verbena, valerian, lilac, and butterfly-bush, although swallowtails will nectar from many others if need be.

, Swallowtails like to fly up and down linear corridors -- roadsides, creeks, city streets, etc. -- while searching for mates. If you can't find any of them perched on the ground or on flowers, find a linear corridor that they're flying along, and station yourself along the corridor.

, A swallowtail flying along a roadside, streamside, or similar corridor usually doesn't turn around frequently. It'll keep going the same direction for long periods. Try to get ahead of it, and take your swing at it as it passes you.

Enjoy and release the butterfly or moth that emerges.",How to Keep Wild Caterpillars As Pets," Caterpillars need specific weather and seasonal conditions before they can be found. You'll need to wait for warm weather and summer months before you can begin searching for your caterpillar. The month of June is the ideal time to begin your search, as caterpillars will just start to be active during this time.If you wait too long, caterpillars may already be in their pupa or butterfly stages of life.
Searching too early in the year will make finding caterpillars difficult or impossible.;
, Once you have a nice day in June with some good weather, you can get outdoors and start looking for a caterpillar. Many caterpillars will still be small this time of year, so search for them carefully to avoid missing them. Try looking in some of these locations to help you in your search:Look on any leaves or shrubs that you pass by.
Seeing small holes or areas cut away from leaves can indicate that a caterpillar was recently eating it.
Look carefully. Many caterpillars have natural camouflage and can be hard to spot.

, Many caterpillars will have a certain type of plant that they prefer to eat. Because of this, it can sometimes be easier to find the plant before finding the caterpillar. Take a look at some of these plants that caterpillars prefer to help your search be successful:Milkweeds can attract monarch butterfly caterpillars.
Spicebush swallowtails are known to prefer the spicebush plant.
Zebra swallowtails enjoy being near the paw-paw plant.
Dill, fennel and parsley can be a good places to find black swallowtail butterflies.

, Although it may be tempting to pick up a caterpillar with your hands, you should avoid doing so. Caterpillars are small, fragile insects that can easily be hurt if you pick them up. Some species of caterpillars may have hairs or secretions that can irritate your skin if you touch them. Always avoid touching any caterpillar you find to keep both you and the caterpillar safe., Once you've found a caterpillar that you want to take home and care for, you can collect it by picking up or breaking off the entire leaf that you find it on. Taking the whole leaf will provide food for the caterpillar and will help prevent it from being harmed.Be gentle with your caterpillar. Many caterpillars will be small and easy to hurt.
You can put the leaf and the caterpillar directly in a small bug cage if you have one ready.
It's a good idea to take many of these leaves so that your caterpillar will have plenty of food to eat when it gets home.
Keep an eye on your caterpillar. Make sure it doesn't fall or blow off of the leaf.
Don't take too many caterpillars from one place. You should collect five caterpillars at most.

, Depending on the species of the caterpillar you find, you will have to provide specific methods of care for it. It's always a good idea to bring a field guide out with you when searching for caterpillars to allow for quick identification. You can also try looking up the type of caterpillar after you've captured it to learn more about it. Always make sure you are certain which type of caterpillar you've found before giving it a new home.


Improper care of a caterpillar can result in it being harmed or dying.
You can use certain physical characteristics such as length, color and shape to learn the caterpillar's species.
The type of plant you find your caterpillar on can be a helpful clue when identifying which species it belongs to.
Some caterpillars may turn into butterflies. Other caterpillars could turn into moths. Moths and butterflies will each have their own unique care requirements.

, Your caterpillar will need a safe space to live and grow in. The key elements of a good caterpillar house are air, water and food. You'll need to provide everything the caterpillar would normally have in the wild to help it grow up into a butterfly. Make sure your caterpillar cage has some of these features:The cage should be at least three times the size of your caterpillar.
There will need to be proper ventilation in the cage to allow air to enter and exit.
The cage should have room for some sticks, leaves and small branches.
Make sure the cage doesn't have anywhere your caterpillar could get stuck or cut on.
You can add in optional strips of paper to collect any messes the caterpillar might make.
A simple plastic jar with holes punched in the lid will work just fine as a caterpillar home.

, Like every other creature, caterpillars will have to eat in order to grow and survive. It's important that you provide fresh food everyday for your caterpillar. Caterpillars are oftentimes picky eaters and will need to eat very specific leaves. Make sure you are following these guidelines when feeding your caterpillar:Feed them the exact same type of leaf that you first found them on.
Provide fresh leaves everyday.
Remove old leaves from their home.

, You'll need to provide clean water for your caterpillar to drink while it grows up in your cage. Although caterpillars won't need much water, it's important that they do have some available. Keep some of these tips in mind when providing water for your caterpillar.You can simply wash the caterpillar's leaves in water and put them in the cage. The droplets of water that are leftover will be enough to keep them hydrated.
Some caterpillars may need more or less water, depending on the species. You'll need to identify and learn the needs of the species you are caring for.
Don't add too much water. You only need to provide small beads of water to the leaves. Large amounts of water can easily drown your caterpillar.

, Caterpillars will be busy eating and growing and can make quite a mess in doing so. Because caterpillars can be so messy, you'll need to clean their cage everyday to help them stay healthy and have a good environment to grow up in. Always remember to remove any droppings or messes that your caterpillars make each day., At some point, your caterpillar will enter into the pupation stage of its life. It will spin a cocoon around itself and become inactive, slowly metamorphosing into a butterfly. If your caterpillar was a moth, it will likely need some dirt at the bottom of its cage to pupate inside of. It's best to provide for either type of caterpillar just in case.Some caterpillars will build their chrysalis and hang it from a leaf or a wall.
You may need to move the chrysalis to another enclosure if the original is too small to accommodate the butterfly or moth when it hatches.
Provide sturdy twigs or stems for caterpillars who like to hang their chrysalis.
If you aren't sure what kind of caterpillar you have, adding a small layer of dirt for a moth to pupate in can be a good idea.

, After you've noticed your caterpillar enter the pupation phase of its life, all you need to do is wait. Your caterpillar will sit quietly inside of its cocoon as it changes into its butterfly form. Watch the pupa everyday for signs that it's getting ready to hatch so you can catch the moment it emerges.Some butterflies can hatch in only 8 days.
Other butterflies may take months to hatch, spending the winter in their cocoon.
You'll need to keep the chrysalis in an environment that has an ideal temperature and humidity for that species of moth or butterfly.
You should lightly mist the chrysalis each day to provide moisture.
The chrysalis will become transparent right before the butterfly is about to emerge.

, Take some time to enjoy the beautiful colors or patterns on your butterfly or moth after it emerges from the chrysalis. You'll still need to care for it a bit longer, waiting until it strengthens its wings and starts flying. Once you're sure the butterfly or moth is fully developed, it's time to say goodbye and let your friend go back into the wild.Release the butterfly or moth in the same area that you found it in originally.
Make sure the butterfly has enough room in the cage to stretch its wings out. If the cage is too small, your butterfly or moth may develop deformed wings.
Add some twigs to the cage for the butterfly to rest on and stretch its wings.

Wait for the butterfly to land on a flower.,
Still keeping your fingers in the same position, catch the butterfly's wings with your thumb and pointer fingers.,
If you want to take it for a journey, get a partner and have the partner put his/ her hands together with the four fingers of the right hand in between the thumb and pointer finger of the left hand.,

, Press them together tightly so it can't fly off.

, The four fingers of the left hand must completely wrap around the at least the two last fingers of the right hand. The thumbs must be crossed over the top. This is a comfortable hand cage that you can put the butterfly into. Make sure there is a small hole at the top for the butterfly to breath. It should not let the butterfly escape.

, Do not squish the butterfly or close the hole. Press your other fingers together tightly to not allow the butterfly to get through. Let it free by simply separating your hands

To learn more about the types of butterflies and caterpillars that reside in your area, either visit your state’s official website, go to a forestry and wildlife conservation website or office, or borrow some butterfly books from your local library.
There are about 20,000 different species of butterflies in the world, and about 725 different species in North America. If you live in the U.S. it’s likely that there are about 100 butterfly species near you — even more if you live closer to Mexico.;
, Once you know which butterflies are native to your area, learn how to identify their host plants. You can look up images and descriptions of the plants online or in a book, or even download a mobile app. Here are some common host plants:Milkweed thrives in dryer climates across the U.S. and is a common host for Monarch butterflies.Spicebush thrives in moist woods and marshes, and commonly hosts the Spicebush Swallowtail.Paw-Paw trees grow in moist places across Ohio and most of the Eastern U.S., and commonly host the Zebra Swallowtail.Parsley, dill and fennel can grow in the wild but you’re more likely to find them planted in a butterfly aficionado’s garden. These herbs commonly attract the Black Swallowtail.
Walnut and Sweet Gum trees host the Luna Moth. Several types of walnut trees grow across the U.S. They thrive in deep, fertile soils that are protected from cold air and water-logging.Sweet Gum trees thrive in deep, moist bottomland and full sun.Black Cherry trees host the Cecropia Moth, the Viceroy, and the Red-Spotted Purple butterfly. They grow across North America on various types of soils, but thrive in cool, moist and temperate locations., Caterpillars look different from one another based on what species of butterfly they come from/will turn into. For example, they can be brightly coloured, hairy, spotted, skinny or fat.


You can narrow down which type of caterpillar you’ve found by considering the host plant. For example, if you find a caterpillar on a Milkweed leaf, it’s likely a Monarch.
The next step in figuring out which type of caterpillar you’ve found is to consider its appearance. As an example, Monarch caterpillars are striped yellow-green, white, and black, and look kind of thick and chubby.It’s a good idea to consult a book or website if you’re unsure of which type of caterpillar you’re looking at. Some websites even help you figure out which caterpillar you’ve found using checkboxes., It’s possible to find caterpillars between early spring and early fall each year; different butterfly species lay eggs at different times. The key is to find out what types of butterflies are native to your area, then look up when they are most likely to lay eggs.


Monarch butterfly eggs are laid and hatched in March and April; it takes the caterpillar about 2 weeks to be fully grown, after which it will attach itself to a stem or leaf and begin its metamorphosis into a butterfly.Cecropia and Polyphemus moths lay eggs in late May and June. Their eggs hatch within 1 to 2 weeks, and then the caterpillars spend the summer eating and growing, making their cocoons in August or September. They spend the winter in cocoons and emerge in late May or June as butterflies to lay eggs and start the cycle once more.As a general rule, June is a good time of year for finding caterpillars.If you can't wait until they’re in season, it’s possible to buy caterpillars from some companies so that you can raise them into butterflies yourself., This could be a nearby field, forest, woods, your backyard or garden, or even a local nursery.

, These will generally be on the bottom sides of the leaves/flowers of the host plants.


As an example, a Monarch looks like a creamy yellow oblong dot — kind of like the head of those colored tailoring pins.If there are butterflies around, you might even see a butterfly lay an egg. If a butterfly lands on a leaf and lingers, it’s possible she’s laying an egg, so go and check the underside of the leaf once she’s gone., In most cases, caterpillars will be hiding and chewing from the bottom side of leaves., Sometimes caterpillars will hang themselves off the sides of leaves and branches or hang by silken threads, especially if they feel at risk for danger., Caterpillars are vulnerable to bacterial infections and can become sick simply through our touching them. For this reason it’s important to always wash your hands before touching caterpillars., Handle caterpillars with the utmost care as they are fragile and can be easily killed. Be careful not to drop them, as even dropping them a small distance can kill them., Caterpillars cling tightly to the surfaces on which they walk. If you try to pick up a walking caterpillar, you might tear off their prolegs. If you wish to move a caterpillar allow it to walk on to its new surface on its own.If you want it off your hand, lower your hand to a leaf and let the caterpillar walk on to the leaf on its own.
If you are keeping a caterpillar and want to change its host plant, put a new host plant into its container and give the caterpillar a few hours to move over to the new host plant before you remove the old one., If a caterpillar looks spiky, fuzzy, or hairy, it’s possible it has a branching spine that will sting you if you try to pick the caterpillar up. Most stinging caterpillars are brightly colored.Common stinging caterpillars include the Buck Moth, the Io Moth, Slug-like caterpillars, the Puss Caterpillar, the Saddleback Caterpillar, the Euclea delphinii caterpillar, the Hag Moth, and the Stinging Rose caterpillar.,


You can also try putting ice and/or baking soda on the sting to help with pain and swelling.
Caterpillar stings are similar to bee stings in that they are generally not fatal, but severe reactions can occur. If you have a history of asthma or any allergies, or allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing or severe swelling occur, seek medical help immediately., Many people would prefer to leave caterpillars in their natural habitats, but if you feel comfortable taking one home, make sure you have a suitable container for it.


Suitable containers for caterpillars include aquariums or even one-gallon jars. The top of the living space should be breathable and securely fastened: cheesecloth or a thin-mesh screen will work well.
Do not simply poke holes into a jar lid, as this will not provide enough fresh air for the caterpillars. In addition, if they crawl on to the lid the sharp edges of the holes may cut the caterpillars open., These need to be securely fastened and strong enough for the caterpillars to crawl on and pupate on.When pupating, many caterpillars hang upside down and after some time emerge as butterflies.Note that not all caterpillars hang upside down to pupate, however. Some moth caterpillars dig down into the soil to pupate., Caterpillars will only certain types of plants, and this differs based on species. Your best bet is to feed your caterpillar the same type of plant that you found it on, but if this isn’t possible, find out what type of caterpillar you have and then feed it leaves from its ideal host plant., If you can fit a live, potted plant in their cage, that’s ideal. If not, make sure you are within close range of their host plants so that you can retrieve fresh leaf clippings for your caterpillar every day.


Caterpillars won’t eat dead, dry, or old leaves, so it’s imperative to make fresh ones available to them each day. You can keep leaves in water to preserve them, but do not keep the water in the same container as the caterpillar as the caterpillar could fall into it and drown.Caterpillars get the hydration they need from eating plants, so there’s no need to keep water in their container.

, Make sure that the leaves you feed to your caterpillar don’t have any other insects on them. A spider could easily make its way into your caterpillar’s cage on the back of a leaf and then eat it., Caterpillars like a humid environment. If the cage looks dry you can give it a few spritzes with filtered or distilled water, or even rain water collected from outside.


Just be sure not to over-water the container, otherwise it could start growing mould., Caterpillars eat roughly 200 times their body weight each day, and produce a tonne of waste called “frass.” You must clean the frass out of the cage every day, otherwise your caterpillar's environment will be dirty, mouldy and unhealthy.For caterpillars that hang upside down to pupate, the easiest way to keep the cage clean is to line its bottom with paper towels and then remove and replace the paper towels with fresh ones each day.

, Some types of caterpillar pupate underground and require soil to do so. If this is the species of caterpillar you have, you’ll need to line your container with two inches of soil.


If you’re unsure of what species of caterpillar you have, you’re best off lining the container with soil just in case., Caterpillars eat until they outgrow their skin, which usually happens about four times before the caterpillar reaches its final “instar”, or life stage between sheds.


In its final instar the caterpillar becomes a pupa (for butterflies this is also known as a chrysalis). In many moth species the pupa stage will involve a cocoon or the caterpillar burrowing down into soil to pupate.
After anywhere from a few days to a few months, a butterfly or moth will emerge from the pupa. Its goal is then to mate and reproduce before dying.

, The lifespan of a butterfly can be anywhere from a few days to nine months, depending on its environment and ability to avoid predators. The average lifespan estimate of butterflies is one month., The Milkweed plant is host to the Monarch butterfly species, which is one of the most common butterfly species in North America.


Milkweed is a tall perennial with large, tough leaves that are usually long and oval-shaped. The plant usually grows in dryer locations and can be found in fields and along roadsides. Of the 75 types of milkweed that grow across the U.S., Monarchs favor 30.Milkweed seeds are often a defining feature. They are small, flat and reddish-brown, with silky hair sprouting out of one end. , Spicebush is a small dark-green shrub that features oval-shaped leaves and serves as the host plant for the Spicebush Swallowtail and the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail butterfly species.


The plant thrives beneath larger trees located in forests and woods, and grows shiny red berries., Paw-Paw trees are the host plants for Zebra Swallowtails, and can generally be found throughout the eastern region of North America near creeks, ravines, and steep hillsides.


The Paw-Paw has large foliage that appears tropical and bears large pale fruits of the same name., The Black Swallowtail is attracted to herbal plants such as these, which can be helpful if you want to grow herbs at your home for the sake of finding caterpillars.


Dill, parsley, and fennel are known to grow wildly throughout North America, and can also be purchased at most garden nurseries.

, Walnut trees are the host plant to the Luna Moth, which is one of the largest moths in North America.


Walnut trees are usually found near ravines and streams, and grow in abundance throughout the state of California.Walnut trees can grow up to 70 feet (21.3 m) tall and tend to have branches that grow outward into a prominent, upright rounded shape.

, If you’re having trouble identifying host plants, consider downloading a mobile app to hep you. To choose a good plant-identifying mobile app, check the screenshots and user reviews.


Some plant-identifying apps are supported by universities and other research institutes, and kept up to date by experts in their fields. If possible, try downloading one of these apps before choosing a more commercial one.

, If you don’t have a tablet or smart phone, or would prefer not to bring electronic devices with you on nature walks, consider carrying a plant-identification book with you. You can buy this at most bookstores or even pick one up from your local library.

Let them go.",How to Catch and Raise Monarch Caterpillars," Before you go out and find your little friend, it's very important that you go online and do some basic research on caterpillars and monarchs specifically. The more knowledgeable you are, the better care you will provide for your new friend. Do some research on basic anatomy and common diseases among caterpillars and butterflies. This way, you know what to look for if your new friend gets sick.;
, Like any other animal, the size of your container should be dependent on the amount of caterpillars you want to keep. A thoroughly cleaned pickle jar will be suitable for one caterpillar, but two or three caterpillars will require a larger container. Small animal travel carriers are a good choice and can be bought for as little as $5 at most retailers. Transparent storage containers can be used for larger broods. .


Consider buying a butterfly tent; they are inexpensive and available online. The new caterpillars don't necessarily need an enclosure but make sure you always have lots of newspaper or paper towels underneath to catch the droppings (frass). Once they are big and plump, they will need an enclosure to make their chrysalis' at the top.

, Despite conventional wisdom, metal mason jar lids with holes in them can lead to poor ventilation, causing the jar to become too hot or too humid. Unless you are using a travel carrier with a ventilated lid, replace the lid with a thin piece of fabric and a rubber band.

, Keep it in an air conditioned room and out of the sunlight. Sunlight promotes mold and fungus growth, which is detrimental to monarchs. If you don't have a potted plant in the enclosure, replace the milkweed leaves every day. Caterpillars get all of their hydration from the milkweed leaves, so they need to be extremely fresh.


If you run out of milkweed and the caterpillars look plump and ready to pupate in a few days, you can feed them pumpkin! That's right, they will eat squash and be fine.

, You can make hammocks out of twigs and fabric or beds out of cotton balls. Some aquarium or hamster decorations can also be used.

, Milkweed is the only plant that monarch caterpillars will eat. Go online and find some local variations of milkweed and then go searching. Milkweed is a very common type of plant, but identifying it is the tricky part. Once you've located a milkweed plant, collect about three leaves and add them to the habitat. You can buy milkweed from a nursery to harvest from later.


Be careful because most stores sell milkweed sprayed with chemicals which will kill your caterpillars. Make sure you ask at your local nursery or find milkweed plants in your area; many nurseries cater to butterfly lovers and understand the importance of safe milkweed. If your nursery has Giant Milkweed, definitely grab a few plants; it lasts a long time and is a great backup plant.

, Most months of the year, you'll probably be able to find monarchs to some extent. You're unlikely to find any caterpillars in July or August, and it would be almost impossible to find caterpillars in November through January unless you are in a tropical region that doesn't get cold. For any other months, it's possible to find eggs or caterpillars.

, Monarchs cannot survive without milkweed because they only lay eggs on milkweed and their caterpillars only eat milkweed plants. Outside of dense or damp forests, anywhere there's milkweed, there's a chance of monarch caterpillars.


Better yet, plant your own milkweed, lots and lots of milkweed. No need to break the bank; due to the current monarch crisis, many organizations, like livemonarch.com offer free milkweed seeds. Set up about 10 pots with soil, add seeds, wet thoroughly and cover with saran wrap. Once they are sprouting, remove the saran wrap and depending on the type of milkweed, place outside, in a greenhouse or inside. Once the milkweeds are at least 2 feet tall or have lots of leaves they are ready to go. They need to be outside in order for the monarchs to find them, and you don't have to worry, they will find them!

, As soon as you see a monarch visiting, search the underside of milkweed leaves. She probably left some eggs. The eggs are a clear white color and are often laid one per leaf. Shortly after the eggs will hatch, microscopic caterpillars will emerge but grow very quickly as they devour every milkweed leaf in sight. When they reach a week old, they'll be black, yellow, and white striped. Some people bring in the leaves with the eggs on them but it's recommended to do that only if you can bring in the potted plant so they have moist, healthy leaves.

, The size of the habitat is not the biggest issue. Monarch caterpillars very easily contract serious diseases. If one catches something, it could infect the entire brood. The more caterpillars you keep, the more chances go up that one of them will catch something. It is unwise to keep more than three in one container, no matter the size. For jars, limit one. For travel carriers and larger, limit three.

, If you don't have the permanent home with you when you find the caterpillar, put it and the leaf inside a mason jar and transfer it to the habitat.

, Caterpillars get all of their hydration from the milkweed leaves, so they need to be extremely fresh! Not only that, but older leaves could harbor mold or diseases.

, Keep the bottom of the cage clean by replacing the newspaper or paper towels at least every few days. If you are putting milkweed cutting in a glass, make sure the water is covered or the caterpillars will crawl in and drown. Be patient. Once your monarch begins to pupate, let it be. Do not move it or the stick that it is on. Remove the plant or cuttings from the habitat unless other caterpillars have not pupated.

, If any of the caterpillars turn black, remove them immediately because they may be sick and the other caterpillars can become sick too. If a chrysalis becomes dark or leaks fluid, you may need to remove it also. It is extremely common for some monarchs to become sick or emerge with deformed or curled wings. This is not your fault; it's nature taking its course. If all goes well, a beautiful monarch butterfly will emerge in approximately ten days.


Many Monarchs have something called OE and it isn't something that can be cured so what do you do with sick caterpillars, chrysalis' or butterflies? The most humane thing is to put them in a cup and place in the freezer. It doesn't hurt them, it allows them to rest in peace. If you have a butterfly that can't fly, you have the option to keep it. You can feed it sugar water or put a little Gatorade in a cap but the butterfly probably won't live very long.
OE is a parasite and doesn't effect people, only monarchs, so don't worry about your own exposure to it.

, Once your monarch begins to pupate, let it be. Do not move it or the stick that it is on. Remove all leaves from the habitat unless other caterpillars have not pupated. The monarch will emerge in approximately ten days.

, Once your monarch begins to emerge from the pupa, do not assist it. This emergence will give the monarch the chance to stretch its newly developed muscles, similar to a chick using new muscles to hatch from an egg.

, Once it is fully out of the chrysalis, it will send blood into the veins of its wings by slowly pumping them, so make sure it has room to fully extend its wings. After sufficient time to accomplish this, your butterfly should be ready and able to fly.

, Bring the enclosure outside and feel free to gently allow the butterfly to crawl onto your hand it by putting a few fingers in front of it. Say goodbye, knowing you've made a difference, especially to this butterfly, you can place it on a plant or tree or keep it on your hand because when it is ready, it will happily flutter away, grateful to have met you. Now give yourself a pat on the back! You've just helped to ensure the future of monarch butterflies, a butterfly at a time.

Buy a good net.,
Find a good place to look for butterflies.,
Look for butterflies that aren't in motion.,
Sneak up on it.,
Catch one in flight.,
Fold the net over.",How to Catch Butterflies1," Kids' nets are not actually good for catching butterflies. They are too short and can hurt the butterfly. A longer net is better, because you catch the butterfly in the netting, not on the hoop.Your net should be at least 2 feet deep.
However, keep in mind, in some areas, you will need a permit to carry a butterfly net. Check with your local laws to see if it applies to you.Your hoop should be wide enough to make it easy for butterflies to fit through, though you don't want it so large that you can't handle it easily. Also, you should be able to see through the netting. The netting should be coarse, so you can move it through the air without much wind resistance.
The handle should be sturdy enough that it doesn't break when you flip the net around.;
, Woods are often good places to find butterflies, but your backyard can be just as good. If you plan to catch butterflies, you might consider planting flowers that local butterflies are attracted to. For instance, marigolds, milkweed, buckwheat, zinnia, and heliotrope are flowers that many butterflies are attracted to., You may have a vision of swooping your net through the air to catch a butterfly in flight. However, the reality is it's much easier to catch one that's stationary. Look for butterflies sitting on flowers, drinking nectar, or roosting.In tropical climates, you'll usually find butterflies roosting underneath leaves or branches, and you'll find them there in temperate climates, too, when it's raining or cloudy.
Otherwise, you'll often find them roosting on the tops of grass or leaves in temperate climates.
Remember that some butterflies will be camouflaged very well to blend in with their surroundings, so you'll need to look closely., If you can, move in from the back of the butterfly, trying to quietly and slowly move in. Once you are in range, flip the net over the butterfly. Do it in one quick motion, so the butterfly doesn't move away before you've caught it., You can catch one in flight; it's just much harder to do. The best way to do it is to first sneak up on the butterfly from behind. Next, do a quick scoop to surround the butterfly with the net. Flick the net so it can't escape., Once you've caught a butterfly, fold the netting over the hoop. That way, the butterfly can't escape through the hoop. This is one reason why you want your netting so long. You can pull it over the hoop and not hurt the butterfly.

Use the right container.,
Provide twigs.,
Clean the container regularly.,
Keep the container outside.,
Provide plants from where you found your caterpillar.,
Feed your caterpillar leaves.,
Add flowers and grasses.,
Mist the cage regularly.,
Place dead leaves in the container during winter.,
Move the container indoors when your caterpillar builds its cocoon.,
Feed the moth when it emerges.,
Release the moth after two days.",How to Care for Woolly Bear Caterpillars," You can safely keep a woolly bear caterpillar in a clear plastic jar, like a mason jar. The jar should have a lid to prevent the caterpillar from escaping. You can also use a cardboard box.You should punch small holes on the lid. You can also use a mesh lid. It's important for the jar to have some air circulation.;
, Your caterpillar will need a twig to build a cocoon. Place a small twig or branch from outside in the caterpillar's jar. Angle the branch in a diagonal fashion, as this will allow the caterpillar to climb onto it when it's ready to build its cocoon., Each day, you will notice the caterpillar has left droppings in the container. These should be cleaned out regularly. You can move the caterpillar out of the container and use a tissue paper to wipe up droppings., Woolly bear caterpillars need a cold environment to thrive. You should keep the container in a secure location outdoors. Something like a garage or shed near your house is a safe place to keep your caterpillar., Caterpillars will do best feeding off their original host plants. Remove some of the leaves and plants from where you found your caterpillar. Place them in the caterpillar's container.For example, if you found your caterpillar on a tree in your yard, remove leaves from that tree of your caterpillar's home.

, Caterpillars can benefit from eating leaves from outdoors. If you find leaves on the ground, bring them in from outdoors. Scatter them on the bottom of your caterpillar's container. Green and dry leaves can both work. You should feed your caterpillar leaves daily., Caterpillars also eat flowers and grass, so bring those in from outdoors as well. Things like dandelions, grass, plantains, and burdock can be great to help a caterpillar thrive. Provide fresh flowers daily., Wooly Bear Caterpillars do not need a water container and it can actually be a drowning hazard. However, misting the environment is important. Each day, use a spray bottle to mist the bottom of the container. Small droplets of water can help a Wooly Bear Caterpillar stay hydrated., When winter comes, add dead leaves to the caterpillar's container. This will allow the caterpillar somewhere warm to sleep during the colder months. Eventually, the caterpillar will build a cocoon, but it will not do so until spring. It's important to keep your caterpillar warm over the winter., In the spring, you will notice your caterpillar will stop moving and take to its branch. Eventually, it will build a cocoon. Once the caterpillar has built a cocoon, it is safe to bring it inside. You will be able to better observe the moth inside., Before the moth emerges, provide extra twigs in the container. You should also add fresh flowers. As you will not be releasing the moth for a few days, it will need these food sources., You can enjoy your moth for a few days after it emerges. Observe the moth in its container and watch it feed on leaves and grass. If you have young children, this can be a great learning experience. However, after a few days, you should release the moth outdoors near where you found it. A moth cannot comfortably live in a small container the same way a caterpillar can."

Identify the plant the caterpillar was collected from.,
Clean the plants.,
Put the plants in a glass of water.,
Lay the plants along the bottom of the tank.,
Replace used food.,
Change to other food plants.,
Put a variety of plants in the tank.",How to Feed Caterpillars," Take a photo or sample stem of the plant you collected the caterpillar(s) from. If you got the caterpillar(s) from a store, then make a note of what plants were in the original habitat. If you’re unsure, use a book on botany or ask a local garden shop or pet shop expert to help figure out what the plant was.Caterpillars have specific types of food plants related by species (there are at least 160,000 species of butterflies), and will only eat from that family of plants.;
, Make sure the plants you select are thoroughly washed before you feed them to your caterpillars. Run them under water from a sink faucet, but don’t soak them so much they begin to wilt. Leave some droplets of water on the plants for the caterpillars to drink., This is a good way to keep the plant supply fresh at least while the caterpillars are young. Set up a glass of clean water just tall enough to fit in the caterpillar’s habitat. It can be a cup or even a small vase. Put the plants into the water, stalk first, and let the leaves rest up and over the top. Leave paper towels under the cup and plant to absorb any moisture or droppings., This is an alternative to the glass of water method, but plants placed in this manner can dry up and rot faster. Place the stalk and leaves bunched along the bottom of the habitat. Allow them to rest along the length of the tank without running up the sides. If length is an issue you can use a pair of scissors to cut the stalk shorter. Leave the leaves intact., As soon as you notice the leaves in the glass or on the bottom of the tank wilting, or see them eaten up, replace them. What you replace the food with depends on the species of caterpillar you have. Some allow a more varied diet within the family of plants. If this is the case you should put in one of the other types. If the caterpillar does not eat it, then put the first type back in.Remember to wash the plants each time you replace them.

, Only use this method if the species of caterpillar you have can eat multiple types of food plants within a plant family. Go to a local plant nursery and collect supply of the other plants in the family. Make sure you get intact leaves. Also make sure the plants are not treated with pesticides. Place only one of the varieties into the cup or tank bottom at a time. Watch if your caterpillar is eating the leaves. If not, then you should swap out to another variety.An example of plants in the same family would be leaves from apple, cherry, and plum trees. All come from the family “rosaceae.”

, This is a method to consider for multi-plant eating species only. You can leave a stalk of the original plant the caterpillar(s) came from in the glass or cage bottom. Add other food plants from the species-appropriate family of plants into the glass or tank bottom. Examine the leaves as you do this to make sure none are damaged or wilted before you put them in. If you notice the caterpillars ignoring one particular variety of plant, then you should remove it and not attempt to give it again.An example of a multi-plant eating species is the viceroy butterfly. The caterpillar can eat leaves from the willow, poplar, aspen, apple, cherry, and plum trees.
Wash the plants before introducing them.

Moths are generally nocturnal, which means they mostly fly at night.However, some species, like the buck moth, that are diurnal, meaning they fly both day and night.Moths prefer warm, humid and overcast nights to cooler, clear nights.There are thousands of species of moths and butterflies. Some eat plants, while others may eat wool and items of clothing.Contact your local county extension to help identify any moths you may have in or around your home.;
, You’ll need a few items to most effectively catch a moth. By gathering the following materials before you start, you may be able to catch one—or many—moths:


An outdoor light bulb bright enough to attract moths at night.Moth “food” to attract insects.A butterfly/ moth net.A homemade net or other container, such as a jar or box, with holes so the moth can breathe.

, “Baiting”, which is also called “sugaring” is a technique you can use to attract moths you want to catch. Baiting involves making “moth food” and putting in places to attract moths.Make bait by mixing one can of beer or apple cider, 1.5 cups sugar, ¼- ½ cup molasses, four over-ripe bananas or other fruit such as apples or peaches in a blender. You can also add a spoonful of cornmeal and some brewer’s yeast if you like, too.Place fermenting fruits like spoiled watermelon as another form of bait.Remember that moths are also attracted to any kind of light, so you can seek them near outdoor or indoor lights if you wish.Apply an approximately 20-30cm patch of bait to tree trunks with a brush just before sunset.Find trees with smooth bark or plates of smooth bark such as pine, hickory, cherry, or birch.Fill a small bowl or your container with bait if you want to catch the moth in your home.
Be aware that bait can attract more than moths. Bears, mice, skunks, and foxes may like your bait in addition to the moths you want to catch., In order to effectively catch your moth or moths, you need to check the bait or light sources.Check the bait every 30 minutes to see what you’ve lured in to your bait.Decide whether you want to catch individual moths or groups when you check the bait.

, Wait until the moth or moths are at rest or not moving before you catch them. Once you’ve observed them, approach them slowly so that you don’t startle them away.Avoid sudden movements, which may startle moths into flight.Approach the moth from behind if you can.

, Take out your net or container and sweep it forward quickly. This can help you effectively capture the moth in your container without releasing it.Make secure to quickly secure the container over the moth so that it can’t escape.Ensure that the moth is at the deep or far end of your container to minimize the risk of it escaping., Once you’ve captured the moth, seal your net or container. This can help you transport the moth so that you can release it or observe it.If you’re using a net, collapse the end of it with your fingers. Leave enough space at the end of the net to minimize the risk of damage to the moth.If you’re using a jar, box, or another container, slowly thread a piece of paper or a lid under it. Make sure to not lift the container up too high so that the moth doesn’t escape.

, After you’ve caught the moth and observed it if you want, release it into the outdoors or someplace outside your home where it won’t bother you any longer. This is a more humane way to deal with a moth than killing it.

, Set up regular inspections and clean sessions of spaces that attract moths. This can help you nip problems in the bud before they become infestations and kill larvae.Check closets, human and pet bedding, behind furniture, in curtains, behind radiators or heaters, in air ducts and vents, and along baseboards.Wipe down and vacuum areas attractive to moths at least once a week.Clean your clothes regularly as well. Moths are attracted to garments soiled by food, drinks, sweat, and urine., If you are concerned about clothing, fabric, or other material getting infested by moths, store them in airtight containers. This may kill any moths current residing in your belongings and prevent them from reproducing.Store your items below 40 degrees Fahrenheit if possible., Distribute mothballs in places that currently have a moth infestation or where you’d like to deter them. You may want to consider this as a last resort before professional extermination because mothballs come with an unpleasant smell and can have health side effects.Inhaling the vapors from mothballs over a longer period of time can have health consequences.These include: anemia, liver damage, neurological damage, and cataracts.Ensure that spaces where you place mothballs are airtight to help prevent you from inhaling the vapors., There is some evidence that lavender repels moths. Mixing a lavender spray may help you keep any moth infestations at bay.Mix 30-40 drops of lavender essential oil with 1.5 ounces of distilled water. Use a clean spray bottle.The stronger you want the spray, the more oil you will mix with water.Boil 3-4 cups of distilled water and 3-4 tablespoons of dried lavender to make a spray with lavender you purchase or grow at home. Strain leaves from the mixture and allow it to cool before using it. Spray the mixture wherever you want to repel moths. Avoid dousing material, which may promote the growth of mold., Add some lavender plants in and around your home. It can help not only repel moths from your spaces, but it will also leave a pleasant scent., There is some evidence that other natural herbs, such as cloves, may repel moths from your home. Set a small amount of these herbs in places where you have moths.Use a jar of cloves or a handful of cinnamon sticks in areas infested or frequented by moths.Be aware that if you place cloves or cinnamon near clothing or other fabric, that you may end up smelling “Christmas-y.”, Studies have shown that using a bug zappers in conjunction with a pheromone lure may help kill moths.Consider buying a zapper and pheromone lure if you have a moth problem outside.


Get a high voltage electronic black light.Purchase a pheromone lure at a home or hardware store.
Use these items in conjunction with one another for optimal results. There is some evidence that a pheromone lure may not work effectively on its own., There is some evidence that burning citronella candles may control insect infestations.Burn citronella candles in areas where you want to repel moths.


Make sure the concentration of citronella in your candle is 5-10% for the best results.Burn the candle when you are outside."

Grasp the butterfly.,
Put them away for later.,
Transfer the butterfly to a cage.,
Kill the butterfly, if desired.",How to Catch Butterflies2," If you need to do so, you can handle the butterfly. Simply grab it lightly just above the body with the wings folded together. Unless the butterfly is very delicate, it won't be harmed by this operation. Monarchs, for instance, are sturdy. You can also turn it over to make it calm down., You can store a butterfly in a glassine envelope, which is a stamp or coin envelope. These envelopes are semi-clear, made of a waxy paper. You can also simply use a small triangular envelope.Make sure to mark any information you need on the outside of the envelope in permanent ink.
You may want to use a specimen number or note the date, time, and area you found the specimen. You may also want to note if the specimen was with a partner., If you are going to keep the butterfly alive, you need to transfer it to a cage when you get home. Generally, the best cages for butterflies have netting or screens on the outside. You'll need to provide nectar or sugar water appropriate for the butterfly.Glass or plastic isn't as good because the butterfly can't walk on it.
Some butterflies won't eat at all. However, most eat nectar or sugar water., You can kill the butterfly in the net so it won't damage itself. Simply squeeze the middle body segment (the thorax) hard between your fingers until the butterfly stops struggling. Then you can slip it in an envelope for later."
"
Find plants that the butterflies favor.,
Transfer them to a feeding bucket.,
Replenish the food as needed.,
Clean out the cage.,
Provide pupation sites.,
Keep an eye out.",How to Catch Butterflies3," For instance, milkweed is a common place to find monarch caterpillars. Look up the type of butterfly you want to find first, so you have an idea of what they eat, where they lay eggs, what the caterpillar looks like, and what the eggs look like.Look for feeding damage in the shade. On milkweed, for instance, milkweed bugs may damage the plant in the sun, but in the shade, it's more likely monarch caterpillar damage.
Get in close. Some caterpillars will be pretty tiny, not bigger than 5 or 6 millimeters, though they can also get an inch or so long. The eggs are also fairly tiny. In the case of monarchs, they are tiny white balls.
Don't take too many caterpillars from one spot. Leave some to grow up in the wild., A five-gallon bucket is sufficient for keeping 5 to 10 caterpillars. The bucket should have plenty of what the caterpillars eat, such as milkweed leaves, and you should provide a variety if your caterpillar eats more than one kind of leaf. In addition, it should have a screen roof for ventilation, so that the feces from the caterpillars can dry out and not harm them.You can use a smaller enclosure, as long as you provide proper ventilation at the top.
You can also place tissue paper or blank newspaper at the bottom to collect droppings.

, If you're putting leaves in the bottom of the bucket, you'll need to replenish them regularly. You can also put small branches in a glass of fresh water, which don't need to be replenished as often, as they'll stay good for longer.If you do put branches in water, try to block most of the top of the glass or jar, so the caterpillars don't fall in and drown.Consider rinsing leaves in water and leaving them wet. Doing so can provide the caterpillars with the moisture they need.

, You will need to clean out the cage regularly. You can clean out the cage once a day. Remove the paper you used and replace it. Also, take out any dead or dry leaves, as caterpillars won't eat anything but fresh leaves., Most caterpillars prefer branches or leaves, so make sure to provide places for the caterpillar to pupate. Once they choose a pupation site, consider moving it to a different cage. You will want to keep this cage lightly misted.Your caterpillar will likely remain in this stage throughout the winter if it went into the pupation stage in the fall. It's not dead, just turning into a butterfly.
Make sure the pupa is high enough. It should stay hung up (for most butterflies), giving the butterfly space to emerge. Hang up the leaf or stick if is too low to the bottom of the cage.
You can also glue a cocoon up. Add a dab of low-temp hot glue to a piece of paper. Let it cool, but make sure to move while it is still liquid. Place the tip of the cocoon in the glue. Hold it there until it dries. Tape or pin the paper up so the butterfly has space to emerge., Watch the chrysalis. When it changes color, to dark or translucent, the butterfly will emerge soon. Make sure to mist the cage. The butterfly will emerge in under a few seconds once it's ready, so you need to be prepared if you want to see it."

Secure your windows.,
Close your windows and balcony before you leave.,
Check your window, screen, and balcony openings.,
Secure the entire balcony.,
Monitor your cat.,
Avoid startling your cat.,
Take your cat to the vet if it falls.,
Treat your cat for feline high rise injuries.",How to Prevent Feline High Rise Syndrome," If you frequently open your windows, install window screens. These should fit snugly over the window, so there are no gaps. Screens allow you to keep the windows open, but prevent your cat from falling out of the windows.If you rent your home and can’t install screens, consider purchasing an adjustable screen insert that will fit into the open window.
Another option is to only open the top part of the window instead of the bottom, as long as you are confident your cat cannot reach or jump to the top portion.;
, If you'll be heading out of the house for a while, remember to close all of your windows. You should also close off access to balconies or railings that your cat could fall from.You can also just close the door to rooms with windows, if you don't feel like closing all of the windows.

, Even if you close off a window or balcony you might open it occasionally, so it's important to check how wide the door, window, or railings are. The space of any opening should be smaller than your cat's head. If it's larger, your cat will try to squeeze through and could become stuck or fall.For example, you can roll up a towel and lay it in the door track of a sliding door. This will remind people that you're trying to keep the door closed or only open the door a little bit.

, If you'd like your cat to still have access to a balcony, you'll need to prevent it from jumping up on railings or fire escapes. You can attach chicken wire or thick netting to the balcony railings. It's important to attach it from floor to ceiling (not just from the floor to the railing), since your cat can jump up high.You'll need to check the netting or wire frequently. Ensure that it's not coming loose, that it's still secured, and that there aren't any holes.

, If you have a balcony, never let your cat go on it alone. You should always watch your cat when it's on the balcony, so you can keep it from jumping up on the railings or on furniture that it could fall from. Avoid letting your cat sleep next to an open window or while perched on a high place.It can be difficult to monitor your cat at all times, so take precautions to ensure your balcony and windows are secure.
Try to move furniture or storage containers away from the railing. This may prevent your cat from jumping up on the railing.

, If your cat enjoys sitting near an open window or likes jumping around dangerous places (like a fire escape), take care not to startle it. Frightening your cat could cause it to lose its balance and fall.For example, if you see your cat perched near an open window, try not to start up the blender or make a sudden noise that could surprise your cat.

, If you see your cat fall, take it to the veterinarian immediately, even if it only fell from one or two stories. Cats are more likely to have worse injuries when falling from small heights because they don't have as much time to prepare for the landing. If you didn't see your cat fall, but your cat is showing these signs, you should take it to the vet:Appears to be in pain (especially when walking)
Has difficulty breathing or is breathing at a faster rate than normal
Has broken bones
Has facial or oral damage (fractured jaw, broken teeth, bleeding or bruised face)
Doesn’t want to be petted or handled as usual, as this may indicate an injury

, Many injuries caused by feline high rise syndrome are internal, so you may not be able to tell how injured your cat is simply by looking at it. The vet can run tests (like x-rays), examine your cat, and give it pain relief.Your cat may need to stay in the hospital for treatment. Your cat may need surgery, dental work, bandaging, and pain medication, so treatment may last for several days before you can bring your cat home.

Tease your cat.,
Let cats play when they want to.",How to Play With Cats1," Get your cat to stalk a rope, a wind-up toy, or a fluffy or feathered toy tied to a string. A piece of string with something fluffy attached to it is one of the simplest toys that you can make, and it is also one of the most effective. Use an old stuffed animal that you don't mind letting a cat chew on. Try to find objects that are smaller than your cat, roughly the size of its natural prey (small birds and rodents). If you don't have a stuffed animal, you can just drag a string around — there's a good chance that your cat will still try to ""hunt"" the end of the string.


It helps when a toy makes some kind of sound to grab your cat's attention, whether it squeaks, rattles, or clicks. Cats have very good hearing, so even a piece of rope sliding over the floor may be enough sound to grab their attention.
For cats, playing also functions as training for hunting skills. Play and hunting often go hand-in-hand, and cats will use their claws to bat at anything that holds their attention.
It is very easy for a cat to use its imagination, but you need to activate it sometimes. A piece of rope lying limply by itself isn't a prey-like toy. However, when you grab that rope and pull it away from your cat, it will trigger your cat into hunting for its prey.;
, Tie a noose into a length of twine and loop the noose around the toy's neck. You can also tie the string to the toy's tail, midriff, or leg — anything that allows you to jiggle the toy in a lifelike manner.


Make sure that once you've tied the toy, it can stand up on its own. A floppy old stuffed animal won't fool your cat for long. It needs to be able to stand!

, You can simply hold the string in your hand to make the toy move, but an extra degree of separation between your hand and the stuffed animal may help your cat forget that you are the one dangling the toy. Tie the free end of the twine onto a sturdy but comfortable stick.

, Get your cat's attention by dangling the stuffed animal on its string so that the cat cannot ignore it, and then make your stuffed animal stand still, upright, facing your cat. Wait for your cat to pounce on the stuffed animal, then pull it away. Try to entertain him by both letting him grab the string, and by letting him almost grab the string. Make the game difficult, but make it possible to ""win"". The important thing is that you catch your cat's attention with a sudden motion, then keep the toy still enough to give your cat the chance to ""stalk"" its prey.


When cats put their nails into something, they don't want to let go. This is where the fun begins. Once they grab their 'prey' it is your job to make the 'prey' to try to escape from his claws by both alternating between gentle and rude pulling on the rope.
Make your cat run around! Guide him with the toy. Make the cat use your furniture as an obstacle, and jump in the air as high as possible. Make your cat run in circles.
If you practice this kind of play with your cat often enough, the cat might hold onto the piece of string so fiercely that you can drag him around.

, Give your cat the chance to suss out the situation, and do not interrupt. When the is ready to pounce, it will happen. When the cat is done playing, it will stop. Try not to look at your cat while ""fighting"" with a toy, and do not hit or push to play with a certain toy.

Use a laser pointer to tease your cat.,
Throw paper or wrappers.,
Use your hand to play-fight.,
Use a plain ping-pong ball.,
Use catnip.,
Use a plastic egg filled with rice.,
Brush your cat with an animal brush.",How to Play With Cats2," Point the laser at the ground or the wall near your cat. Move the laser to catch your cat's eye, then keep it still for a moment to build suspense. Move the laser around, slowly, and your cat may begin to stalk it like prey. Do not move the laser around too rapidly, or your cat may lose spirit. Just when your cat pounces onto the laser, move it quickly away.


You can find laser pointers online, at pet-supply stores and at most technology stores.
Be careful not to point the laser into your cat's eyes. Once you have your cat under the spell of the laser, try not to lead it anywhere dangerous. Cats may run headlong into a chair or wall because they are so focused on the dot.

, Use materials that will make enough noise to catch your cat's attention, but not so much noise to scare your cat away. Ball up the paper, wave it slowly until your cat is tracking it with his eyes, and then throw it a short distance for your cat to chase. This may also work with food or toys.

, Gently ""wrestle"" with your cat as though your hand were another cat. Let the cat rub its head against your hand, and let it bat your hand with its hand. Be wary: a cat won't usually use its claws while play-fighting, but it might nibble or bite your hand.


Avoid using both hands when playing, as the cat will feel outnumbered and flee. This is, incidentally, a good way of ridding yourself of a playful cat when you're no longer in the mood.

, This might sound boring to you, but many cats love to swat and play with them. Roll the ball gently toward or past your cat to get some attention. If the cat's eyes track the motion of the ball, it means that he sees the ball as potential ""prey."" Some older cats may not bother to move if you throw the ball.

, You can give your cat a sprig of fresh or dried catnip, or you can buy a catnip toy for your cat to play with. Many cats love the smell of catnip, and some cats become visibly intoxicated by it. They may stare into space, stumble around, and roll on the floor in pleasure.


Be warned that every cat reacts differently to catnip. Your cat may love it, your cat may indifferent, and your cat may even abuse the stuff. Give your cat small amounts of catnip, and watch it for cues.
You may also consider buying catnip spray from a pet store and spraying it onto the toys that your cat already has. Spray the catnip spray onto the toys and wait for it to dry. Once it has fully dried, slowly bring out the toys.

, You can fill a surprise egg or plastic Easter egg with rice and use it to play with your cat. You can even make a little hole on one end of the egg, and pull a thread through it, and make a knot in the thread. The sound of the rice shaking may draw your cat's attention, and the string will help you make the egg seem as though it is moving of its own volition.

, You can brush their chins, their tails and backs, as well as their bellies. Brush under the tail and on either side, but don't brush your cat's butt. Test it out on your cat, but be aware that not all cats like being brushed. Cats may be wary about you touching their bellies. Don't brush too hard, or else the bristles might hurt your cat.

Let your cat play in a box or a bag.,
Set the box or bag out where your cat will find it.,
Let your cat use the box or bag on his own terms.,
Respect your cat's space.",How to Play With Cats3," If you don't have any spare time to play with your cats, a cardboard box or a shopping bag will provide endless entertainment. Cats might be predators in their natural habitat, but they are not the highest in the food chain, and they love to hide out in small spaces.


A box should be large enough for the cat to climb inside, but not so tall that your cat cannot climb out afterward. You can set it upright or on its side, as long as the cat can easily access it.
You can use any type of bag that your cat fits inside, but be wary of plastic bags that can trap and suffocate your cat. In general, paper and canvas bags are safer and more breathe-able.

, Make sure to use a space in which your cat is comfortable: a living room, a bedroom, or any place where your cat spends much of its time. Try putting a treat, a toy, or a sprig of catnip into the container to entice your cat inside. Try putting crinkly, noisy paper into the box to give your cat something to explore.

, You can pick the cat up and put him into the box, but do not force him back in if he climbs out. Avoid tipping the box or bag over while the cat is inside, or else you may give your cat scary associations with the space. Your cat may spend hours at a time resting in the box, and it may become a place that he associates with safety.


Never make your cat feel as though he is trapped or cornered. Avoid reaching into the box or looming over the exit, especially if your cat tends to be skittish.

, Some cats love to hide out in cupboards and drawers, under beds and blankets, or perched on the tops of furniture and cat trees. Your cat may enjoy a box or bag that you set out, but it may revert to its own ""safe spaces"".

Allow your cat to rest on high cupboards.,
Provide high shelves for your cat to rest on.,
Allow your cat to rest on tables and couches.,
Let your cat rest on stairwells and windowsills.",How to Provide High Resting Spaces for Your Cat1," Cats usually gravitate to high places like the top of cupboards. Being up high helps to reduce stress and keep your cat calm and relaxed. Provide an open pathway to high cupboards so they are easy for your cat to access.For example, if your cat likes to climb the high cupboards in your kitchen, make sure there is no clutter on the top of the cupboards and that there is a lot of room for your cat to lie down or sit down in this area.
Make sure your cat has enough room to leap up onto the high cupboards. You can also provide steps or other flat surfaces that your cat can step on to get up to the high resting spot.;
, You can also provide high shelving for your cat to climb and rest. Set up shelving, such as book shelves, in your living room or bedroom and leave the top shelves empty so your cat can rest on them. Make sure there is an open pathway leading to the shelves so your cat can get on them easily.You can also create a rising pathway made of shelving so your cat can climb and rest on different levels. Put shelving of different sizes together to create an ascending row of shelves. Or use shelving of different sizes throughout your home so your cat has different levels it can rest on.

, Table tops are good spots for cats to rest on. Try designating one high table in your home as your cat's resting spot. Make sure there is no clutter on the table so your cat can access it easily.


You can also allow your cat to rest on the back of high couches, such as couches in your living room or bedroom.

, Stairwells and windowsills can act as great resting places for your cat. They provide different levels for your cat to climb, making them ideal high spots for resting and relaxing.Windowsills are also good options, especially if your home has wide windowsills. Keep the these areas clean and empty so your cat can rest on them as it sees fit.

Let the cat sniff you before you pet it so it can become comfortable with you.,
Wait for the cat to bump her head against you.,
Pet the cat once if she jumps into your lap and lies down.,
Pet a cat when she's on her side.,
Let the cat give you some low audible sounds (called purring).,
Watch for signs that the cat does not want to be petted anymore.,
Start with a soft chin-scratch.,
Focus on the area between or behind the ears.,
Pet the cat's cheeks just behind the whiskers.,
Gently run the back of your hand along the side of face.,
Stroke the cat from forehead to tail.,
Keep your petting from the head to the tail and don't switch directions.,
Don't pat the cat.,
Stay away from the tummy.,
Approach the feet with caution.",How to Pet a Cat," Extend a hand or finger and allow the cat a chance to touch her nose to you.


If she shows no interest in your hand or just stares at it suspiciously, reconsider your intention to pet her. Try some other time when the cat may be in a different mood.
However, if the cat sniffs your hand, meows, and then rubs her chin or the side of her head against it, or brushes the side of her body on you, chances are she is open to being touched. Open the palm of your hand and softly touch her body.;
, When a cat bumps her head into your hand, it's a signal she wants attention.If you are busy at the moment, at least pet her once or twice, to let the cat know you aren't ignoring her.

, See if she fidgets. If she does, it may be that she just wants to lie there and relax, as humans are a great source of body heat. If she doesn't fidget, you can continue to lightly stroke her spine or in the spots described in Part 2.

, Cats love to be petted when they are on their sides. Lightly stroke the side that is facing up. If it meows or purrs, it may communicating enjoyment.


Avoid the belly, though (see Part 3, Step 3).

, Purring is one way a cat signals that it feels sociable and wants attention. When accompanied by hip bumps, ankle twining or head bumping, it means your cat wants you to pet it right now. Sometimes one stroke is all the cat wants, like a handshake or a greeting, rather than a long hug and snuggle session.


The loudness of a cat's purring denotes its happiness level. The louder the purring is, the happier the cat is at the time. A soft purr means that it is content, a loud purr means very happy. Excessively loud purring means over-excessive happiness, which can sometimes switch quickly to annoyance, so be careful.

, Sometimes even petting that feels good to the cat can become overstimulating or irritating, particularly if it is repetitive. If you're not paying attention, the sign to stop may come in the form of a soft, inhibited bite or scratch. Often, however, the cat gives several subtle signals before biting that she does not want to be petted anymore. Look for these advance warnings, and if you see them, stop petting:


Ears flattening against the head
Tail twitching
Fidgeting
Growling or hissing, Use your fingertips or fingernails to gently rub the chin, particularly where the jawbone connects to the skull. It's possible the cat will push into your stroke or jut out her chin, both signs of enjoyment., Use the pads of your fingers and apply gentle pressure. The base of the ears is another scent-marking spot for cats. If she bumps her head against you (called ""bunting""), she's marking you as hers., If the cat likes this, she may rotate her whiskers forward, effectively asking for more., Once the cat is warmed up, use your middle finger to stroke the cat's ""mustache"" (just above the upper lips) while encircling her whole face and stroking the top of head with your thumb. The cat is yours.

, Pet the forehead, then run your hand from forehead to the base of tail, going from head to tail repeatedly. Massage her neck muscles by pinching gently. Apply gentle pressure and make it a continuous, slow motion. Work only in one direction (forehead to tail), as some cats do not like back-to-front strokes.


Don't touch the tail or move your hand along to the side.
If the cat likes what you're doing, she'll arch her back to add more pressure to your hand. When you bring your hand back to where you started, the cat may rub her forehead firmly against your hand to encourage you to do it again. If the cat puts her ears back, cowers away from your hand, or just walks away, stop petting.
You can scratch gently as you bring your hand down along the cat's back, but don't stop at one spot and scratch there. Keep your hand moving.
Apply a little pressure at the base of the tail, though with caution. This is another scent gland area, and there are cats that like getting scratched right here.Others, however, have a habit of suddenly snapping their teeth at your hand when they've had enough.

, Some cats do not like getting stroked from tail to head.

, Some cats enjoy it, but some don't, and if you're not used to being around cats, you're better off not experimenting unless you want to risk a bite or scratch.

, When cats are relaxed, they might roll onto their back and expose their belly.Don't always take this as an invitation to rub their tummy, as many cats don't like that at all. This is because in nature cats must be careful to protect themselves from potential predators (as opposed to dogs, who are more confident in this regard – and love having their bellies scratched). The stomach is a vulnerable area where all the vital organs are located, so lots of cats will instinctively bare teeth and claws if touched here.Some cats do like it, but they interpret it as an invitation to play rough or wrestle with claw-grabbing and scratching. They'll wrap their claws around your hand or arm, bite it, and scratch at it vigorously with their front and back paws. This is not always an attack; it's how some cats ""wrestle.""
If a cat grabs you with its paws, hold still and let the cat disengage her claws. If necessary, reach over with your other hand and gently pull the paw back to unhook the claws. Cats often scratch deep when they don't intend to if their claws get stuck. They use claws to hold and grab, so when the message is for you to stop moving your hand, they'll stop if you stop.

, Don't play with a cat's feet unless you know the cat well and know she likes having her feet played with. Start just by petting the cat to get her relaxed, then ask permission to stroke her feet by touching one foot once with your finger.


If the cat doesn't object, lightly pet that foot with one finger in the direction the fur flows (from wrist toward toes). At any point the cat pulls her foot away, hisses, flattens her ears or walks away, stop.
Many cats don't like their feet handled at all, but can be trained into it for activities like claw clipping through a slow, successive reward system.

Prepare your area.,
Prepare a small amount of water.,
Apply some animal-friendly soap.,
Dry the cat immediately.",How to Pamper a Kitten1," Kittens are delicate, so you should start with a soft bath with baby soap and an extra soft cotton towel.;
, First pour about an inch of lukewarm water into your sink or tub. Carefully place your kitten in the tub and gently pour some of the existing water over the kitten's back.


Most cats don't like water. If you need to bathe your cat, use a small spray bottle to spritz the areas that need washed, then wipe down the cat with a towel.

, Add a small amount of baby soap to your hand and lightly scrub the kitten's back and legs.

, Remove the kitten from the bath and immediately wrap it in the towel. Carefully dry it off. Don't let it get cold.

Take the kittens to a veterinarian for health or behavioral concerns.",How to Monitor Newborn Kitten Growth," During the first two weeks of their lives, kittens are helpless: their eyes will still be shut, and they should spend about 90% of their time sleeping and eating.As long as the mother cat is feeding the kittens, your involvement will be minimal. Keep the kittens safe and warm by placing them in a large cat carrier—or even a cardboard box.Line the box or cat carrier with a towel which can be soiled and washed.


It’s important that the kittens be kept warm, as they’re not yet old enough to fully regulate their body temperature. The room in which you’re housing the kittens should be kept close to 80 degrees for the first two weeks.;
, The mother’s milk contains all of the nutrients that kittens need to grow and thrive, and keeps them hydrated as well as nourished. As long as the kittens are nursing regularly, your involvement at this point will be minimal. The mother cat will initiate feeding during the first two weeks, and the kittens should appear to have full, plump bellies after nursing.If the kittens are not nursing every 1–2 hours, they’re likely not getting enough nutrition. A lack of sleep and persistent crying can indicate this problem as well.
If a kitten is not eating regularly and does not appear content and plump, keep an eye on it for a couple of days. If the kitten makes no discernible improvement, you should call your veterinarian and ask for their recommendation; you may need to bring the kitten to see them.

, The kittens will be extremely small, weak, and delicate during the first two weeks of their lives.While the mother cat will frequently be around them, it’s important that you isolate the kittens from other household pets, especially if you have an energetic or large dog. You can do this by enclosing the kittens in a room that other animals will not be allowed to enter.


Even if your other pets would never intentionally harm the kittens, they could accidentally trample the tiny newborns.

, During the first two or three weeks of life, newborn kittens should be gaining weight substantially. In fact, by the time a kitten is two weeks old, it should have doubled its birth weight.You can weigh the newborns with a kitchen scale or other precise device. Make a chart of their daily weights.


If any kittens are not gaining weight daily during the first two weeks, contact your veterinarian and ask for their advice.
As a point of reference, a typical kitten will weigh 3.5 ounces when it’s born. A healthy kitten will gain .5 of an ounce each day.

, Newborn kittens will not have the muscle control to eliminate waste during the first two weeks of life. In order to stimulate waste elimination, the mother cat will lick the kittens’ genital region and stomach approximately every two hours. If the mother cat is not engaging in this behavior, you’ll need to step in: take a warm, wet washcloth and gently wipe over the kittens’ anus and stomach until the defecate and urinate.In order to confirm that the kittens are eliminating waste regularly, you’ll need to check in on them once every two hours.

, The newborn kittens’ eyes will open by the end of the second week, and during weeks three and four, they should begin to show curiosity towards their environment. During this developmental stage, kittens will leave their nest and begin to clumsily walk around the room you have contained them in.Make sure that the environment is safe for the kittens to wander through. There should be no objects on shelves that could fall on the cats.

, Kittens can begin using a litter box as early as three weeks. Often, kittens will pick up on this behavior simply by watching their mother use a litter box. If a kitten isn’t imitating this behavior, you can pick up the kitten after it has finished eating or sleeping and place it in the litter box. Use one of the kitten’s forepaws to scratch at the litter, and use a washcloth to rub its genitals and stomach. Repeating this action will train the kitten to use the litter box.Since the kittens will still be very small, they’ll need a litter box with low sides for easy access.
It’s safest to provide newborn kittens with a wood-, paper-, or sand-based cat litter. Avoid filling the litter box with clay or silica gel litter, as the kittens may try to consume these unsafe substances.

, Kittens should start initiating nursing during weeks three and four, and in weeks five and six, will be able to start eating solid food. If the kittens have been eating on a regular schedule, you can set down a dish of wet cat food in front of them at the time when they would usually nurse from the mother. To generate interest among the kittens, scoop up a small amount of food on your finger and hold it near the kittens’ face.When introducing kittens to solid food, make sure to feed them a kitten-specific product. Wet food is recommended for the initial weaning process, although kittens can be given dry food.
If you prefer to give dry food, make sure that the kibble pieces are small. To make sure kittens can eat the kibble, you can soften the food. Do this by pouring a teaspoon of water over a small saucer full of kibble.

, By weeks seven through ten, kittens will have developed coordination and will begin to react appropriately to stimuli in their environments, including frightening or dangerous objects. At this point, you can let the kittens out of the “nursery” room and let them explore your house or apartment. Kittens should show a natural curiosity and begin to play with one another.By this stage of development, the kittens will also be able to fully regulate their own body temperature, and so you won’t need to keep them in a temperature-controlled room anymore.
You may still want to return the kittens to their nest and “nursery” room every night, so that kittens will have restful sleep and plenty of opportunities to use the litter box.

, During this period, you can begin to socialize your kittens. Socialization is an important process for kittens, as it allows them to develop social bonds and understand social behaviors with other cats, and should always take place under constant supervision. If you have a friend with a cat, or know a breeder with a litter of kittens, plan a day to set aside a few hours during which the kittens and cat can cautiously get to know one another.It’s also a good idea to socialize your kittens with other people, especially if you’re planning to sell the cats to new homes. Invite your friends over, and ask them to take turns petting with, playing with, and briefly holding the kittens.

, Although kittens will have developed substantially by the time they reach 10 weeks, it’s important to continually monitor them for signs of illness. If kittens are not eating or sleeping regularly; if they appear week, lethargic, and undernourished; or if they regurgitate milk and do not respond to their environment, the kitten may be ill.Contact a veterinarian if you notice any of these behaviors in your kittens.


If kittens had contact with other pets or outdoor animals at any point during weeks one through six, they could have caught an illness. Let your veterinarian know if you suspect your cat has caught an illness.

Take lots of pictures.",How to Photograph Cats," Give your cat several minutes to sniff, look at, and check out your camera before you begin photographing. This will make her more comfortable with the equipment, so she'll be less likely to run off or be frightened by it.


Give your cat a chance to warm up to being photographed. Don't expect to immediately take amazing photographs. Your cat will probably be curious for a few minutes.;
, Your cat probably won't simply sit still while you take her portrait. Instead, give her things to play with. Consider offering her new toys to play with. If you'd like to keep her in one spot, try setting up a new stationary toy like a cat tower or post.Try giving your cat a view of something interesting. For example, offer your cat a view out of a window and scatter bird seed outside. This way, she'll be entertained by birds eating.

, Treats like cat food treats or catnip can be great photography aids. Give your cat treats to reward good behavior, like sitting still for a minute. You can also give treats as a way to direct your cat's attention. For example, hold a treat near your head so your cat looks at you. This way, you can get a photo of your cat looking directly at the camera.You may want to ration out how many treats you want to give your cat before you begin taking pictures. This way, you don't accidentally give your cat too many treats throughout the session.

, You might get great shots right away or you may need to take a lot of photos just to get a good one. Be sure to give your cat plenty of time and space. Your cat will feel more relaxed if you remain relaxed instead of stressing about taking the perfect shot.Have fun photographing your cat. Consider setting up a tripod to automatically take photos. This way you could play with your cat and just let the camera capture the fun you're having together.

, Some cats will enjoy being photographed longer than others will. Pay attention to signs that your cat no longer wants to be the subject of your attention. If your cat seems distracted, gets angry (hisses, scratches), or tries to walk away, end the photo shoot. You probably won't get good photographs if your cat isn't cooperating, so try again later.


Never force your cat into poses. These are often unnatural for cats and can lead to injury. Always consider the needs of your cat., Consider what kind of background to use when taking a photo. If you choose a background that's bright, detailed, or distracting, your cat will be competing for the focus of the shot. If you use this kind of a background, photograph only a bit of your cat (like her tail as she runs from the frame).


For a professional-style portrait, consider using a simple white backdrop or neutral sofa. This will make your cat the focus of the image.
You can keep the background natural by just photographing outside in the yard., You can add interest to a photograph by including props or other people. For example, you might photograph your cat playing with one of her favorite toys or snuggling with a member of the family. Other props might include a pile of leaves, a cozy blanket, or baskets.


Props are a good way to let your cat's personality come through. If you have an energetic cat that's constantly moving, showing her playing with balls can illustrate that energy.

, Don't forget to really think about what your cat looks like and the challenges she presents. For example, if you have a black cat, you'll need to make sure that the background you select will contrast with her dark fur. Or, realize this and make the photograph dramatic by shooting against a black background.Likewise, if you're photographing a shy cat, but need to include other cats in the photograph, don't be surprised if the shy cat tries to run off or doesn't cooperate.

, If you can, photograph your cat in natural light. This way, you can avoid harsh artificial lighting. If you photograph outside, avoid bright direct light which can make difficult shadows. Instead, try to shoot around mid-morning when the light is a little softer.


If you have to shoot indoors, avoid using a flash.Your cat will probably blink and then learn to look away from the camera when you photograph her. Flash can also make your cat's eyes take on a bright red color.

, Since most cats move around quickly, you'll need to make sure your camera can keep up. Set a high shutter speed so that your image won't be blurry if your cat is playing or moving.You should also consider how sharp or blurry you want the background to be and adjust your f-stop accordingly (a higher f-stop will make for a sharper image, while the lower f-stop will create a shallower depth of field).

, While it's a good idea to go into the photo shoot with lots of flexibility, there may be a few images you know you want to get. Consider making a short list of images you really want to get. For example, you may want:


A close up of your cat's paws or eyes
An image of your cat sleeping
A photo of your cat grooming herself
A photograph of your cat playing or doing a trick

, As with any type of photography, you should choose a focal point when taking a picture. This could be some part of your cat or something behind your cat. For example, you could have a bright red background with your cat filling most of the frame. In this case, your cat is the focal point.


If you fill the frame with your cat, decide if you want to focus on some feature of your cat. For instance, you may do a close up of your cat's eyes or whiskers.

, It's easy to start taking photos by pointing the camera down at your cat. But, for a more interesting image, get on your cat's level.You'll be able to directly photograph your cat's face, which can be great for a close up.


To get on your cat's level, you can get down on the ground or try setting her on something elevated so she's nearer to your level. Always set your cat on a safe spot where she can't injure herself.

, Try shooting from a variety of places. You might start by photographing down at your cat while your cat looks up at you. Remember to shoot at your cat's level. But, you can also try raising your cat up while you get below her. This way, you can shoot up, with your cat looking down.


There's not one perfect angle for photographing cats, so try several. You won't know what angles work best until you try photographing from them., Taking posed cat portraits can be difficult, so start by letting your cat run around and play. Take candid action shots while she does this. It's a great way to let your cat's personality really shine.Make sure your shutter is set to a high speed so the image doesn't come out blurry.

, Since cats are unpredictable, be prepared to take a lot of photos. Don't wait for your cat to do something interesting, or you may lose your opportunity for a great photo. Instead, plan on taking a lot of pictures. This way, you're likely to get good shots and you'll have a lot of images to work with later if you'd like to edit them.


If you can, set your camera to burst mode so that when you press the shutter, the camera takes several images spaced over a second or two."

Invest in a climbing post for your cat.,
Place the climbing post in an accessible spot.,
Give your cat affection and praise when it is on the post.",How to Provide High Resting Spaces for Your Cat2," A climbing post usually has a least two to three shelves or resting spots, like branches of a tree. Most cats enjoy climbing and resting on a climbing post. Some climbing posts also double as scratching posts and are made of material that can be scratched or pawed by your cat.You can find climbing posts for your cat online or at your local pet store.
If you have more than one cat, you may want to invest in more than one climbing post. This way, your cats will not need to fight over the same post and can have equal access to high resting places.

, To ensure your cat uses the climbing post for resting, place it in a spot in your home where your cat hangs out. This could be the living room by a window or in a spare room.If you have a large home, you may get more than one climbing post and place them throughout your house. This way, your cat can have access to resting spots in several rooms in your home.

, Encourage your cat to hang out and rest on the climbing post by giving verbal praise and heavy pets when it is on the post. If you notice your cat on the climbing post, go over and give it a few good pets or verbal praise like, “Good kitty” or “That’s a good cat.”Put cat toys on the post so your cat can play with the toys when it wants to. This can encourage your cat to hang out on the climbing post for playing and for resting.

Put double sided tape on inappropriate spots.,
Place shallow dishes of water by inappropriate spots.,
Get your cat to go on their climbing post instead.",How to Provide High Resting Spaces for Your Cat3," Though you want to create high resting spots for your cat in your home, there may be places that you do not want your cat to rest on. For example, maybe you have a shelf of collectibles you want to keep your cat away from or you have an antique bureau that you’d rather not have your cat rest on. To deter your cat from resting in these spots, try putting double sided tape on them.If you are worried the double sided tape will ruin furniture, try putting the tape on a piece of cardboard and then placing the cardboard on the item. This way, your cat is deterred from resting or climbing on the item and the item’s surface does not get damaged.

, You can also deter your kitty from resting on inappropriate spots by placing shallow dishes of water by these areas. Cats usually don’t like being close to water or stepping in water. The dishes of water can prevent them from climbing or resting on spots you want to keep cat-free.You can also try spraying your cat lightly with a spray bottle when they are on surfaces you don’t want them to be on. However, only do so lightly and intermittently. Over time, your cat will likely learn not to go on spots where they are going to get sprayed.

, Try to encourage your cat to climb or rest on their climbing post instead of inappropriate spots in your home. Place treats on their climbing post so they go to there instead. Pet your cat when they are on their climbing post so they know it is a good spot to be."

Give your cat a bath.,
Avoid microchipping your cat on your own.,
Visit the vet.,
Complete the paperwork.,
Verify ID number on the microchip.,
Have an assistant secure your cat.,
Have the vet perform the microchip administration.,
Verify the microchip again.,
Update your information.",How to Microchip Your Cat1," When your cat is microchipped, he should be clean. This will save your vet time from having the clean the area when she injects the microchip.;
, Never inject your cat with a microchip on your own. This is illegal in many states and can cause you to have legal measures taken against you. There are sellers who will sell you a microchip without going through a veterinary office, but you should never implant these devices yourself. Take these to your vet to have them checked out and implanted in the right way.

, When you decide it is time for your cat to be microchipped, take him to the vet. Qualified veterinary professionals should always administer microchips to your cat. They know exactly how much pressure to use, where to place the microchip, and how to combat the rare chance of side effects.


Since your cat is smaller than other animals, it is important that the microchip is injected in the right place to avoid issues., When you go to the vet to have your cat microchipped, complete the paperwork that goes along with the microchip. The paperwork acts as the registration form for the manufacturer's database, such as Homeagain, once it is sent in by the vet. Ensure that all of your contact information is correct so the database has the right information for you.


Always obtain copies of the microchip paperwork for your records. This will help you keep track of your unique ID number and manufacturer information attached to the microchip.
There might be a registration fee for the database, but the microchip is worthless without the registration., While your vet is preparing to inject your cat with the microchip, she will verify the unique ID of the chip matches the paperwork you have. She will run the microchip reader over the chip inside the applicator and make sure the reading is correct.


This also checks to make sure the microchip is emitting properly before it is injected in your cat., You will be in a normal exam room when your cat is injected with the microchip. This procedure requires two people, one being an assistant who will secure your cat. The assistant should hold your cat by the scruff of her neck, which is the skin right on the neck. He should also hold your cat's rear end steady with his other hand.


This will keep your cat from jerking when the microchip is injected., Once your cat is secured by the vet assistant, your vet will find the right area between your cat's shoulder blades for the microchip. She will then tent the skin of your cat's back and press the applicator to the area, implanting the microchip under the skin.


The microchip is around the size of a grain of rice, so it shouldn't cause too much pain.Your cat's skin around the injection site doesn't need to be sterilized as long as he is clean.

, After microchip administration, your vet will verify the microchip is still working. This will ensure that nothing went wrong with the microchip during implantation. She will run the reader over the implantation site to check that your unique ID is still emitted from the microchip.


When your cat goes in for his yearly checkup, your vet will likely recheck the device to make sure nothing has gone wrong with it., In order for your cat to be returned to you, your contact information in the microchip manufacturer's database needs to be up to date. If you change your phone number, move, or have any other contact information change, you need to contact the database to let them know. This way, they can update your information to reflect your new situation."

Discover microchips don't affect your cat's health.",How to Microchip Your Cat2," If you microchip your cat, there is an increased chance of your cat being returned to you if he runs off. Breakaway collars, which are the type that should be used on cats, can break off easily, but microchips are permanent forms of ID once they are implanted., Microchips last a long time and do not need to be charged or replaced. They require no power because they just bounce information to a scanner. This means that the microchip will last for the entire span of your cat's life, unless the chip malfunctions for some reason.


This means that you only have to implant your cat once., Microchips are devices that use radio wave emissions to project a unique ID number for your cat. There are three different frequencies that can be used, but most veterinary offices, shelters, and rescues have universal microchip readers which allow them to read all different emissions. When a vet, shelter, or rescue checks a microchip, the cat's unique ID and the manufacturer of the chip are displayed.


From this information, the person that found your cat can contact the database to find out your information.
This also means that your contact information is safe from others unless they have access to the microchip database., On average, vets charge between $25 and $50 for microchip administration. This may vary depending on the price of your vet and if you get it done in conjunction with other procedures., Microchips cause very few side effects. Only 391 cases of any side effects have been reported out of four million documented cases of animal microchipping. Pain is felt when the microchip is injected, but it is slight. There may be a little more pain for cats because they are smaller and have less padding than other animals. Your cat may react to a certain degree to the injection, but the pain is similar to that associated with any shot.


If you are worried about the pain associated with the procedure, consider having your cat's microchip put in when he is neutered (or spayed if female). This is commonly done so as to avoid an extra office visit and to save your cat from even the slight pain associated with it.
The rare extreme side effects are microchip migration that leads to abscesses or, in one case, cancerous tumor growth around the microchip."

Develop your plan according to the length of time you will be away.,
Ask the neighbors.,
Ask your family.,
Look for a pet-sitting service.,
Consider boarding your cat.,
Try a combination of some of the above suggestions.,
Find a new owner or a foster owner.,
Be realistic and plan well in advance where possible.,
Make a plan for the unknown.",How to Make Arrangements for Your Cat when You're Going Away," Clearly, it's easier to ask for local help if you're only gone for the weekend but relying on the good nature of other people for longer periods can result in worry and problems. Each of the following steps will depend on the length of time you're spending away from home.;
, The first port of call is cat-loving neighbors if you're only spending a short time from a night up to a week away. It's important to read the signs of willingness though – they must love felines, be around, not be snowed under by their own work and life challenges, and they must be asked well in advance unless it's an emergency. Listen carefully to how they respond to your request for help too – if they seem reluctant, don't hesitate to let them off the hook quickly and look for alternatives.

, If you have family members who live nearby, see if they're able to swing by regularly to help feed and tend to your cats. Again, this shouldn't be for too long but family ties might help you extend the request! Ditto friends.

, There are many pet-sitting services available now that will provide feeding, grooming, caring, etc. services in your own home for a daily fee. Always try to meet with the person beforehand to explain everything about the cat's needs. Many pet-sitters will also collect mail, water plants, etc. This service can work well for up to a month, as you're paying so you don't have to feel guilty but there will be a limit to how long your cat can stand to be alone.

, If you plan on being away for a long vacation or stay somewhere else, boarding your cat in a cattery or a vet's boarding service might be the solution. In this case, your cat will usually need to have proof of up-to-date vaccinations and please – no fleas. Some places might also have policies about neutering. This will be the most pricey option but it will give you peace of mind that your pet is being well looked after and attended to regularly. Just be sure to check out the place first and check its reputation, to satisfy yourself.

, If your budget is tight, you might try combining some pet-sitting with some neighborly help; plan out crossover dates so that everyone is clear on when they're expected to help out.

, In the case where you are going overseas for a long time, boarding your cat may prove too expensive, inconvenient or unavailable. In this case, you will need to consider either rehousing your cat permanently with a new family, or finding a foster family to care for her until you get back. Family can be helpful but don't assume they will do this for you. Call your local cats protection society or your vet for details of possible cat-lovers who have offered to help out in this situation. If you need to send your cat interstate by plane, make all necessary plans well in advance, including packing her favorite toys, blankets, etc., and getting an airworthy carrying case to travel in (check with the airline for an appropriate size/weight etc.).

, Although it can be easier to hope things will turn out all right in the rush of getting ready to go away, leaving plans for your pets to the last minute is never a good idea. Thorough planning beforehand will ease your anxieties about your pet's well being and having arrangements in place well before you go away solves last minute crises. If your cat is remaining at home, be sure to have adequate food supplies (always more than enough) and remember to leave the key with whoever is taking care of your cat. Always leave your contact details with the carer; there might be a call about health issues, emergencies etc., and you will need to be reached to make decisions.

, Even if you're not going away, owning a pet carries the responsibility of being prepared for any possibility and an emergency is one such possibility. If you are called away because of an emergency, it is a good idea to have in place already a phone tree of people who can jump in and look after your cat while you're gone (this is also wise if you have kids!). That way, instead of panicking about everything, you can calmly call about the cat needing care while you rush away on the emergency. Cats left alone can die of starvation, turn wild, or wander – they don't understand emergencies.

, After a while of sitting and petting the cat, try to pick it up. Just lift it slightly off the ground, in case it doesn't like it, so you don't get scratched. See if you can eventually pick it up and carry it.

, Before you bring the cat inside, you will want to get its shots, possibly fixed and checked for illness.

Leave the kitten with its mother until its at least 4-6 weeks old.,
Provide fresh drinking water daily.,
Make sure the bowl is easily accessible.,
Clean the cat's water bowl.,
Try drinking water fountains.,
Feed cats canned wet food.",How to Make a Kitten Like Water1," Kittens learn to eat, clean themselves, and drink water from their mothers as they grow.Kittens need to be left with their mother for at least a month before they start being weaned off of milk and onto solid food. This process usually takes about two weeks.


If your cat was taken from its mother too early, or was orphaned, you can usually start weaning around three weeks.;
, You shouldn't need to do anything to ""teach"" a cat to drink but provide plenty of fresh drinking water in an accessible location for your cat. Each day, pour out any leftover water in the cat's bowl and refill it to provide for the cat.


Don't worry if you don't see your cat drinking regularly or your cat doesn't drink just because you put some water in front of it.
Water can be room temperature. It doesn't need to be cold for the cat to be attracted to it.

, Experiment some with different sizes and shapes of cat bowls if your cat seems hesitant to eat or drink from them. Stainless steel, ceramic, and glass bowls are all easy to clean and make for fine cat dishes. If your cat has difficulty reaching into the bowl, get a smaller bowl.


Keep the cat's food and water right next to each other, and introduce them to your cat by sitting and petting the cat while you pour food and water into the bowl. The cat shouldn't have to go looking for something.
The cat's food and water should be in a separate place from its litter. Just like people, cats don't like to eat and do their business in the same place., Your cat's water bowl can get gummed up with saliva and minerals from tap water, and it needs to be rinsed out thoroughly every couple of days. Rinse the bowl with warm soapy water and a dish sponge, then rinse it thoroughly before refilling it.


No, you don't need to scour cat bowls like you might your fine china, but it's a good idea at least to rinse it out every couple of days. It only takes a minute and your cat will appreciate drinking from a clean bowl.

, Available at most pet stores, water fountains are sometimes sold for cats who are hesitant to drink water. They work like regular water fountains, which cycle water continuously in a little pond that burbles up for the cat to drink. Some cats go crazy for these products.


Typically, these range anywhere from $20-30 and are usually operated by plugging into an outlet. Most cats shouldn't need these, but it's a good way to pamper, if you want to give your cat a little extra.

, Some research shows that cats who are fed exclusively dry food are somewhat dehydrated, and sometimes suffer from urinary health issues.Feeding cats food with a higher water content is usually a good idea. If you can, try to feed your cat canned ""wet"" food a few times a week.


Wet cans of food are typically more expensive, making it difficult to feed a cat exclusively cans of Fancy Feast. Instead, try buying a few big cans and mixing a few spoonfuls into the cat's dry food every day, to make sure your pet's getting the water content it needs.
You can also add some water to the cat's dry food. When you add some dry food to the cat's bowl, add some water to the dish, mixing it in to make sure the cat gets the water it needs. Giving them about two tablespoons of water should be enough.

Get a breed that enjoys being around water.,
Introduce the cat to water early.,
Start with a gentle drip.,
Be gentle.,
Dampen a soft washcloth and wipe the kitten's paws.,
Add more water as necessary.,
Dry the cat immediately.,
Don't force the cat to interact with water.",How to Make a Kitten Like Water2," Most cats won't like to be anywhere near water, but some breeds are more accommodating than others.If you'd like your cat to be water-friendly, consider getting any of the following common cat breeds:


Bengal
Turkish angora or van
American bobtail
Maine coon

, Kittens are more likely to be calm around water the earlier you introduce them to it. Within the first few months of the cat's life, it's ok to try to introduce them to water calmly and gently, going a little at a time.


Introduce the cat to water when its calm and tired. The best time to bathe a cat? Right after its been playing, or has eaten. Cats tend to get really active just before eating, and just after is the perfect time to try to introduce your kitten to water, if necessary.
Trim the cat's claws before you try to introduce it to water, and wear long sleeves when you're trying to play with the cat in water.

, Many house cats are fascinated by dripping faucets. For a quick test, to see whether or not your cat will be water-friendly or easy to bathe, try to set your faucet to drip at a slow, even rate. Set your cat up on the counter and see if it seems interested in the dripping.


Some cats will play with faucet water, or even drink from it. Others will ignore it completely. Both are perfectly normal cat responses., Make sure to be quiet, slow and gentle and use warm water in a spray bottle. Use a calm tone of voice and hold the cat against your body with one hand firmly under its belly. Pet the cat along the back of the neck and the jaw to help it calm down some if you're trying to introduce it to water. Move extremely slowly.


In some cases, it's good to wrap the cat in a soft, fluffy, warm towel while you're doing this. You can use it to dry the cat off when you're finished, and use it to calm the cat now.
Never try to introduce a cat to water by submerging it in the tub. There's no reason to use that much water to clean a small cat, and you'll only serve to aggravate the animal.

, The best way for a cat to contact water is with its paws. Use a small spray bottle to wet a small washcloth with warm water and get the kittens paws wet. Wait a while and let the cat feel the sensation. Let the kitten groom itself and get used to the sensation of the water on its fur.

, Eventually, you can apply more water with a spray bottle, or in some cases (with very accommodating cats) bathe them. Go very slowly, gently adding a small amount of water to the cat's fur at a time. Hold the cat firmly against your chest to keep them calm and restrained.


If you just want to see if your cat will play in water, let your cat dictate the move. If it screeches and struggles to get away from you when you put some water on its paws, guess what? Your cat doesn't like water.
If the cat makes a break for it, it's usually best to just give it up. Don't force interactions if the cat's not having it.

, Always make sure the kitten is kept warm and immediately dry the kitten off with a towel followed by a warm, fluffy towel. You might be able to use a quiet blow-dryer on a very low setting, unless your cat gets scared off.


Let the cat groom itself and provide a warm sleeping area for the animal. Again, healthy cats are fully capable of grooming themselves.

, Most cats don't like water and most cats don't need to be bathed. There's little reason to force a cat to do something it doesn't want to do. If your cat doesn't like water, don't force it.


Cats generally not need to be bathed, and should only be bathed if they've gotten into something especially dirty or toxic.If you must wash your cat, trim their claws first and introduce them to water when they're tired out from playing.
Don't submerge cats in water to bathe them. Instead, use a spray bottle to wet their fur and gently wash them with a washcloth.
Dry the cat thoroughly any time they become wet. Use a fluffy warm towel to dry the cat's fur.

Your cat will love chasing the mouse around the house while batting at the toy. An automated mouse can help stimulate your cat’s hunting instincts., Feather toys usually consist of a wand with feathers attached by longer pieces of string. You can use a feather toy to mimic bird hunting for your cat. Wave the feather toy near your cat and then quickly move it away, tempting your cat to chase the feathers., You can also stimulate your cat’s hunting instincts with a laser toy. It can be as simple as a handheld laser wand, or you can buy a laser toy made specifically for cats. Shine the laser on the floor and move it around quickly. Your cat will chase the laser, much like a cat chases a bird, mouse, or other small animal., Catnip can entice your cat to utilize their hunting instincts, making the most out of playtime. For example, you can try a cork ball that incorporates catnip in its design., There are lots of automated cat toys on the market that use swift motions to stimulate your cat's hunting instincts. For example, you can try a whack-a-mole style toy., There are plenty of household items that make wonderful cat toys.

For example, you can put a plush mouse inside an empty box. You could also put some toys in a paper bag with paw-sized holes., Cats love to climb, and you can make playtime more lifelike for your cat by creating more vertical, cat-friendly in your home. Try a cat tree, or hang shelves on your wall that your cat can walk across. You can also encourage your cat to climb on existing furniture., It is important that your cat has lots of space to chase and play with its toys. Before playtime, try clearing a large space in your home like the living room floor. Remove any breakable furnishings or decorations.

Play with your cat several times a day.,
Rotate the toys regularly.,
Put the toys away when you finish.,
Make sure your house is cat proof.",How to Make Playtime Lifelike for a Cat3," Cats need regular exercise. They also need interaction with others. Play with your cat two to three times a day, for about ten to fifteen minutes during each play session.If you have an older or overweight cat, begin by playing for several minutes at a time and then gradually increase the duration of your play sessions.

, You can keep lifelike play interesting for your cat by rotating the toys. Instead of playing with the same toys all the time, put them in rotation. For example, you might play with a feather wand one week and the next week focus on an automated mouse., It is important that you put away your cat’s toys when you finish a play session. If the toys are left out all the time, they might lose their special appeal. Place the toys in a container with a lid and store the container in a place your cat can’t reach., It is important that you put all toys and toy-like items in a place your cat cannot access. For example, your cat might destroy its feather toy or your yarn collection if left unattended. Be sure to secure items like:Dental floss
String

Choose emergency caregivers.,
Identify a longer-term caretaker.,
Decide how much money to leave.,
Choose which legal document to draft.",How to Make Sure Your Cat Is Cared for After Your Death1," In the immediate aftermath of your death, people might forget about your cat. In fact, it’s not uncommon for days to pass before someone goes to your home and finds your pets left behind. To prevent this from happening, choose two people who can immediately go to your home if you die or become incapacitated.Give them keys to your home so they can immediately find your cat.
Provide them with a list of feeding instructions, as well as your vet’s name. If your cat takes medicine, provide a list of medicines as well.
Also give your neighbors the names of your emergency caretakers so they can call if necessary.;
, You’ll need someone to take your cat and love them during the remainder of their life. You should find someone who has already met the cat and is good with animals.If this person has cats, make sure your cat gets along with them.


Some people automatically assume their family will take care of their cat.However, you should talk to them first and explain your expectations for your cat’s care. They may be too busy to take care of your cat in the manner you expect.
Always name at least one backup in case the original person changes their mind or otherwise can’t take care of your cat.
If you don’t know anyone who can take your cat, you might be able to name a pet sanctuary or pet retirement home to take care of your cat. Make sure you visit first to check that animals are properly cared for.

, Ideally, you aren’t expecting someone to pay out of their own pocket to take care of your cat. Instead, you should set aside a sum of money to provide for your cat. Look up your cat’s breed online and check their average life expectancy. Then calculate how much you spend each year for your cat, realizing that expenses increase as your cat ages.


Use this website to estimate lifespan: https://www.petcarerx.com/article/the-average-lifespan-of-a-cat-breed-by-breed-chart/1698. For example, an American Shorthair lives until 15-20, whereas a Siberian lives about 11-15 years.
Don’t forget to leave payment for your cat’s guardian. It’s only fair to compensate them for taking care of your cat when you are gone.
You aren’t required to leave money. However, you can expect a better future for your cat if you do.

, You can’t leave your pet anything in your will. However, you can provide that your cat is taken care of by drafting either a pet trust or a pet protection agreement. They are different documents, so analyze your situation to see which is best for you:


You can leave detailed instructions for taking care of your cat in both a pet trust and a pet protection agreement. However, you can also name a “trustee” for a pet trust. This person can check in on the person taking care of your cat.If your caregiver is not following your directions, the trustee can sue them in court. Choose a pet trust if you want this added protection.
Pet trusts are more complicated to draft. Accordingly, it may cost $1,000 or more for a lawyer to draft a pet trust. If you don’t have this money, then a pet protection agreement is ideal. You can create one yourself.
If you are leaving a substantial sum of money, a pet trust is better. The trustee can manage the assets so that they last as long as possible.

You could keep Australian owl, shaft-tail, star, Gouldian, painted, and masked finches together.
Sometimes one variety will interfere with the breeding activity of another.If one variety is territorial, there could be injuries or even death in your bird cage.

, Although you may find it easier to purchase your finches online, there are some advantages of shopping in-person for your finches. For instance, you might find that you connect to the color or the sound of a particular type of finch at the pet store. However, you may find a wider selection of finches on bird classifieds websites and online retailers.

Some retailers specialize in finches from particular regions, such as Australasian finches.
Some online classifieds websites, such as “BirdsNow,” allow you to purchase finches from local breeders or individuals.

, Gauze, clean rags, or even a clean, flexible sock can be used as bandage material to help control bleeding and keep wounds clean until they can be treated by a veterinarian.


Non-adhesive vet wrap is also great to have in a pet first aid kit, as it does not stick to animal fur and is easier to remove. Meanwhile, duct tape can be useful for holding temporary wraps or splints.

, This is to cut tape, gauze, splints, or any other type of bandaging material. There are specially designed scissors or shears with an edge that allows you to remove bandaging near your pet's skin without accidentally cutting him or her––perhaps this is a good choice.

, Sterile saline wash is vital should your pet ever have debris or smoke in its eyes. Just apply liberally and flush the eyes until all debris is removed. You may also want to keep some sterile eye lubrication in your first aid kit, so that you can sooth your pet's eyes after using the sterile flush.

, Water is not only useful for rehydrating a pet, but also for flushing wounds, soothing burns, washing off toxins, soaking a paw, or cooling an overheated pet. Keep a gallon of water in your first aid kit along with a collapsible dish in case you are away from home.

, In addition to a small quantity of your pet's regular medications, keep styptic powder, diphenhydramine, and sugar tablets in the pet first aid kit. Styptic powder stops bleeding in cases of minor cuts or torn nails; diphenhydramine (or Benadryl) is an antihistamine that can be used temporarily for mild allergic reactions; and sugar tablets can help a diabetic pet or a small pet with low blood sugar.

, Dish soap, such as Dawn, is very effective in removing toxins from the skin and fur.Just remember to rinse and flush your pet afterwards with water.

, A thermometer is necessary in determining if your pet has a fever or is hypothermic (the normal body temperature for a cat is approximately 99.5-102.5°F).However, veterinarians typically recommend that the temperature be taken rectally, as it more accurately reflects the pet's core body temperature. To make the insertion easier on your pet, keep a petroleum or water-based lubricant in the first aid kit.

, In an emergency, don’t lose valuable time looking up the phone numbers for an animal emergency hospital, veterinarian, local police, or poison helpline (Pet Poison Helpline at 1-855-213-6680 is recommended). Keep the details all on a small index card in your wallet, along with the identification numbers for your pet's microchip and rabies tag. The Pet Poison Helpline also has a great iPhone App for toxin information and guidelines.

, Cats can become fearful, aggressive, and unpredictable when hurt. Avoid injury to yourself and keep your pet safe by having a blanket, slip-leash, muzzle, and/or mesh bag in your first aid kit. Blankets can be used to wrap injured pets up like a taco, and mesh bags (with handles) work great for transporting cats. Muzzles, meanwhile, can ensure you're not accidentally bitten when administering first aid.

, Don't forget the treats! It's a great way to calm and distract an injured pet. This is especially helpful during bandaging, but really can help in any stress-filled first aid situation.

, Bring at least a week's worth of water. You never know how long it will take until you find a stable shelter that provides pet care. If your cat eats dry food then bring a bag of it. If your pet likes wet/canned food then multiply how many times your cat eats daily by 7 for the amount of cans you'll need. Most cans of cat food have an easy-open tab that you lift and pull backwards. Brands like Friskies and Olives have several flavors and easy-open cans. Bring a pack of small soak-free plates to put thee food on.


If your cat likes dry food then you can go to your local store like Walmart and find portable pet food and water bowls.
If your cat doesn't like food from the brands mentioned then you can bring a can opener if needed.

Help your cat adjust to life in a new home.",How to Make Friends With a Stray Cat," Before you begin to try making friends with a stray cat, make sure you can identify what kind of cat it is.A free-roaming cat has an owner that takes care of it, but allows it to wander around on its own. You should probably not try and befriend a free-roaming cat; if you begin to feed it or let it in your home, it might abandon its owner.
Other cats are strays. A stray cat is one that formerly had an owner, but the owner no longer takes care of it, or abandoned the cat. Stray cats may roam widely, taking food and shelter where it can find it. Some stray cats may be willing to make friends with you, or let you pick them up and take them to an animal shelter.
Some cats are feral, meaning that they have spent all or nearly all of their lives outdoors and without any human care. Many feral cats were born and raised this way, returning to a nearly-wild state, preferring to stay away from people. Some feral cats are willing to make friends with you, but generally it is difficult to domesticate them.;
, Because it has spent time outdoors and without regular care, your stray cat might be hungry, sick, scared, or injured. Some stray cats may be friendly, walk right up to you, and allow you to pick them up and inspect them. If the cat runs away or acts scared, however, you will have to entice it to stay around.

, Letting a stray cat know that food is available is one of the most effective ways to start making friends with it.Pay attention to where you’ve seen the stray cat, and leave some food in the area.


Strong-smelling foods like tuna or canned cat food make good choices.
Leave food in the same spot everyday; this will make the cat come back and expect to treat.
Observe when the cat comes and eats the food you have left outside for it. After a few days, wait near the food, and see if the cat will come and eat while you are within sight.
Don’t try to pet or pick up the cat at first.

, Try waiting near the cat as it eats over the course of a few days. Once it seems very familiar with your presence, you can try to approach it. Move slowly, and sit on the ground. This will make you look less intimidating. Try this again and again for several days, moving a little closer to the food each time.

, These gestures can be perceived as threatening, especially for cats that are not used to being around people. Act calmly and quietly, and focus on getting the cat to trust you.

, Let it see you engaged in a non-threatening activity, such as reading or gardening. If you are lucky, the stray cat will observe you and learn that you are also not threatening.

,, The stray may feel comfortable to eat out of your hand, or it may not. In either case, do not attempt to pet or pick up the cat at first. Be patient; it takes time, sometimes weeks or more, for a stray or feral cat to begin to trust you.


You can also try letting the cat lick a small amount of soft or wet food from your finger.

, While feeding it a treat with one hand, calmly try to gently touch the cat with your other hand. If the cat acts startled and moves away, do not try to grab it. Wait a little while and try and try again.


If the cat will not let you touch it at first, just try to bring your hand close to it. Repeat this technique over and over again, bringing your hand a little closer to the cat each time, until it lets you touch it.

, If your stray cat does not seem to want to be touched, try playing with it using toy such as a laser pointer, wind-up mouse, or wand toy with feathers, ribbons, or other objects attached to it. If your cat plays with the toy, even if it won’t let you touch it or pick it up, it is a sign that it is growing accustomed to you.

, If yours reacts negatively when you try to touch or approach it, leave it alone and try later. A scared cat can become violent, and trying to handle it will only make it distrust you. Signs that a cat is scared or upset include:


Tail held straight up and stiff
Ears folded back
Paw raised, with or without exposed claws
”Striking” with its paw
Low meowing or growling
Hissing or spitting
Hair raised on end
Arched back

,


If the cat has a collar or tag, check and see if it has a name, address, or phone number on it.
A vet can check to see if there is a microchip implanted in the cat that stores information about the owner.
If you can’t find any information about the owner, you can also try posting an advertisement with the cat’s picture at various places in your neighborhood, local animal shelters, online classifieds, etc. in hopes that the owner will track down the cat.

, If you are trying to take the cat home with you, to a vet, or to an animal shelter, you will need to entice it into a cat carrier. After the cat has become used to you leaving food out for it, try the following technique:


Set the carrier near the food with the door open.
Place food near the carrier to draw the cat near it.
Place food nearer and nearer the carrier, if the cat will move closer to it.
Place food inside the carrier and wait for the cat to step in and begin eating it.
Once the cat is fully inside, close the door quickly but gently.
Carefully carry the cat to its destination.

, If you decide to “adopt” a stray cat, take it to a vet as soon as possible so that it can be checked for fleas, ticks, worms, and other parasites, have its general health assessed, and receive any vaccines that it needs., Most animal advocacy groups recommend the policy of TNR (trap, neuter, and release) for feral and stray cats.This is considered a humane way of controlling stray cat populations. You can ask your vet or an animal shelter to spay or neuter your cat, and then release it back outdoors once it has recovered. You can even continue to feed the stray.

, If you decide to permanently adopt the stray and invite it into you home, you will need to be patient and understanding; returning to indoor life can be difficult for many former strays.Keep the cat in a quiet room at first, where it won't be disturbed.
Make sure that the cat has food, water, a place to bed, and a litter box.
You might need to use garden soil in the litter box at first, then a mix of soil and litter, before using just litter. This will help the stray adjust to the texture.
Visit the cat regularly. Offer it treats, talk to it soothingly, and try playing with some toys. Pet the cat if it will let you, but leave it alone and come back later if it acts scared or aloof.
There is a good chance that the cat will feel comfortable soon, and be ready to leave its room and explore your home. Be patient, however, as the cat might get startled and hide in various places, scratch furniture, or knock things over as it gets used to its new surroundings.

Hire a lawyer.,
Choose a trustee.,
Provide detailed instructions for your cat’s care.,
Fund your trust.,
Decide who will receive any left-over money.,
Store the trust with your will.",How to Make Sure Your Cat Is Cared for After Your Death2," Because trusts are complicated, you’ll want a lawyer to draft one for you. You can get a referral from an animal welfare organization. Check with the lawyer that they have created a pet trust before.Discuss which type of trust you want. For example, you can create a traditional stand-alone trust, which allows you to leave detailed instructions for your cat’s care. However, you can also create a “statutory trust,” which might be easier but which doesn’t allow you to leave detailed instructions., The trustee manages the assets in your trust. They will invest any money and disburse it to the caregiver. They can also check up on the caregiver and make sure they are following your instructions. For this reason, the trustee and caregiver should be different people.Name more than one trustee. Your original pick might not be able to serve, so name one or more alternates.If you have a lot of money, you may want to name a professional trustee or trust company. Your attorney can help you identify an appropriate company.

, If you create a stand-alone trust, you can leave the caregiver detailed instructions about how your pet should be cared for. Even if you verbally discussed your expectations, make sure to include this information in your trust document.


You can identify the vet you want your cat to be taken to. Also identify the number of visits in a year.
Identify what food you want the caregiver to give your cat.
You can have your trustee inspect your cat each year to confirm that the caregiver is looking after your cat properly.
You can also decide to have your cat euthanized if they are not in good health. Specify what should be done with the remains.

, You can fund a trust with money from many different sources—cash, bonds, life insurance, retirement account, etc. Leave enough to take care of your cat but don’t leave too much. Your heirs might challenge any amount that seems excessive.You can fund a trust during your life or through your will, whichever is easier for you.However, if you fund it through your will, you’ll need to revise your will to reflect this fact.
If you cut a check, make sure that you identify the payee as the trustee. Include language such as the following: “Michael Jones, trustee of the Mary Smith Pet Trust, in trust.” On the check’s memo line, identify that the money is for “contribution to the Mary Smith Pet Trust.”

, The money you use to fund your trust might outlive your cat. In this situation, you will need to name someone to receive the remainder of the money. For example, you might leave the money to an animal welfare organization.However, you shouldn’t leave the money to the caregiver. If you did, then you have created an incentive for them to let your cat die early.

, You will probably sign your pet trust in the lawyer’s office, and your lawyer will keep the original. However, get a copy for your records and store it in the same place as your will. You don’t want it to be overlooked.


Also distribute copies to anyone who needs to see it. For example, share a copy with your trustee, caregiver, and vet.

Pick a finch if you enjoy beautiful birdsongs.,
Choose a finch if you want a low-maintenance bird.,
Keep two finches.,
Keep finches away from cats.,
Avoid finches if you like to hold your birds.,
Budget for both the birds and additional costs.",How to Choose a Finch2," One of the reasons people love finches is the sound of their songs in the morning! For instance, the House Finch sings a long, twittering song. Finches communicate important information to one another through song, so you’ll get to enjoy their wonderful tweets!Finches sing to their babies before they are born in order to communicate environmental conditions.

, As long as they are well fed and have enough room to fly around and socialize with one another, finches are easy to care for! In comparison to other birds, like the Parakeet, owning a finch is not a huge time commitment., Finches love to hang out with one another, so you should avoid purchasing just one finch! In contrast to companion animals that like to spend time with humans, finches mostly socialize with one another. As such, you should purchase finches in pairs of the same variety.If you buy one alone, it will be unhappy or bored.

, If you own a cat and are thinking about getting finches, you should think about how you will ensure the safety of your finches. Cats will typically hunt birds. The best way to prevent a fatal interaction is to keep the finches away from your cats. Although finches spend most of the time in their cage, you may want to avoid choosing a finch if you own cats.You can still care for a finch in your house even though you own a cat or a dog. You'll just have to make sure the cat or dog cannot access the finches at any time.

, Unlike Parrots, finches do not typically enjoy human touch. They are the type of bird that is really enjoyable to watch and listen to. If you want a bird that involves more interactivity, you should consider a Parrot., Finches can cost anywhere between $10 and $100. But you also have to consider the cost of the cage, food, water dishes, and perches. In addition, you need to budget for possible veterinarian bills in case your bird gets sick or injured. A bird cage costs between $60 and $1000.
Food and water bowls cost between $8 and $30.
Toys cost between $20 and $100.
Two perches cost between $12 and $30.
A nest will cost between $4 and $12.
A bag of bird food will cost between $9 and $20.

"
"
Get a cage with three feet of floor space for each pair of finches.,
Give your finches different kinds of perches and nests.,
Locate the bird cage in a quiet room with a stable temperature.,
Feed your finches a wholesome diet.,
Never give them avocado, chocolate or alcohol.,
Bathe your finches.",How to Choose a Finch3," You should get a cage that is wider than it is tall. It should have plenty of room for the finches to fly from one perch to another.You can determine the size of the cage based on the number of finches you want to keep, since each pair of finches will need three or four feet of floor space.If your cage is twenty-four by thirty inches, you could keep two finches.
If your cage is three by three feet, you could keep four finches.
Avoid cages that are too narrow.
You can clean the cage with warm, soapy water., Finches enjoy a variety of different perches, which will help them exercise and stay healthy. Make sure the cage has perches of different sizes, shapes and textures, rather than all the same type of perch. Give them lots of little nests, but avoid giving them a big nest that will encourage breeding.If you want to encourage breeding, you can give them larger sized nests.
In addition, you’ll need feeding and drinking dishes, bedding, bird toys, bird feed and treats.
You’ll need a cage that has room for all of the perches and swings while still allowing room for your finches to fly around.

, You’ll want to place the bird cage in a room with a consistent temperature and without any drafts. You should pick a quiet room, since finches need adequate rest in order to stay healthy.Don’t put the cage in a room that has a television on all the time, since the finches won’t be able to sleep.
Keep the cage away from open doors and windows.

, You should feed them mostly pellet foods and some seeds. In addition, give them spray millet. Make sure they always have access to fresh water. To round out their diet, give them the following foods:

Egg food.
Carrot, lettuce, dandelion, apples and oranges.

, Although you may love avocado, chocolate and alcohol, these foods are toxic to your finches! In addition, you should never expose them to meat products or dairy.If you let them out of their cage for a bit, remember to properly store these foods.

, You can put a little bathtub in the cage so your finches can clean themselves. You could also spray them with a mister. Aside from bathing, finches don’t require much grooming.Never clip their wings because they rely on them for flight.

Plant shrubs and trees for nesting or find an area near you that is already grown.,
Plant wild flowers, tall grasses, and thistles.,
Add a water feature.,
Choose an appropriate bird feeder for yellow finches.,
Fill your feeder with seeds that yellow finches prefer.,
Place your feeder in a safe and visible location where the yellow finches could easily find the feeders.",How to Attract Yellow Finches," Yellow finches are shy birds and prefer creating nests towards the top of thick shrubs that are near open fields or rivers, and generally not deep in the forest.Locate a large, secluded space in your yard suitable for planting, preferably near an open grassy field or stream, and in a location with lots of sun. Plant it in an area where cats or other predator animals can't reach the yellow finches.
Plant a mix of deciduous trees and shrubs, such as oak or elm, and evergreens, such as pine, that grow between four and 30 feet (1.2 to 9.1 m) high. These trees will attract the yellow finches for food and shelter.
Space trees and shrubs so that the finches can be easily seen and won’t feel overcrowded.;
, Yellow finches are attracted to wildflowers and thistles for food, but they also use woody material and fluffy down from thistles, milkweed, cattails, and other grasses to create their nests.

, Yellow finches prefer nesting near a water source for drinking and bathing.


Install an attractive birdbath or fountain. You may wish to use one with circulating water to keep water fresh and inviting to the finches.
Create your yellow finch habitat near a stream or river if possible.

, Finches are classified as “cling and peck” feeders, meaning that they prefer clinging to the end of flowers or grass stocks to eat in the wild. So, choose a feeder that allows them to hang or cling on the side at varying angles and avoid feeders with perches.


Use a mesh sock feeder. Sock feeders can be purchased from most pet supply shops, home improvement stores and online, or can be created at home using discarded mesh fabric or pantyhose that have been sewn or tied at the end.
Select a plastic tube feeder. A wide range of plastic tube feeders specifically designed for finches can be found at pet stores or online.

,


Add niger thistle seeds, a favorite with yellow finches.Include seeds from maximillian sunflowers, dandelions, millet, flax and goldenrod as well.

,


Protect yellow finches from predators and other animals that might eat their food or them, by hanging your feeder from a tree or pole between six and eight feet from the ground.
Hang your yellow finch feeder away from feeders for different types of birds as yellow finches are shy eaters.
Place your feeder in a location that is visible for you to watch the yellow finches from a distance without disturbing them.

Leave the egg alone if possible.,
Replace the egg.,
Find a wildlife rehabilitator.",How to Find and Take Care of Wild Bird Eggs1," In many places, it's illegal to remove bird eggs from their natural habitat. In the U.S., for example, according to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, it is illegal to take or possess any part, nest, or egg of a wild bird species. You could receive up to six months of jail time and a fine of up to $15,000., If you come across a wild bird egg and see a nest nearby that’s empty or contains similar looking eggs, you could try to return the egg to its nest. If you do not see a nest, do not go looking for one, and never assume that an egg is abandoned.


Some birds nest on the ground. The Killdeer, for instance, prefers to nest on gravel!Never take an egg from a nest.

, Wildlife rehabilitators are licensed to care for injured or orphaned wild animals. If you find wild bird eggs and suspect that something’s wrong, contact your local wildlife agency or search online for a licensed rehabilitator.


Do not take the egg(s) to a rehabilitator. Instead, be prepared to direct the rehabilitator to the egg(s).
Be aware that a rehabilitator may only be interested in the egg(s) of endangered species.

Choose a distribution representative.,
Complete a form.,
Draft your own pet protection agreement.,
Set aside funds.,
Distribute your agreement.",How to Make Sure Your Cat Is Cared for After Your Death3," Someone will oversee the release of money to your cat’s guardian. With a pet protection agreement, this is the “distribution representative.” You want to choose someone who is good with money and who you trust.


You aren’t required to name a distribution representative. Instead, you could have the guardian manage any funds left for your cat’s care.Remember that if you want someone to check up on your cat, then you should create a pet trust.

, You can use the form at LegalZoom for $39. It generally only takes fifteen minutes to fill in all of the information. You can begin by starting here: https://www.legalzoom.com/personal/estate-planning/pet-protection-agreement-overview.html.

, If you don’t want to pay the fee, then you can draft your own pet protection agreement. Make sure that it includes the following information:Your identifying information (name and address).
The guardian and any alternate guardian who will take care of your cat. Also name an organization that will take your cat if none of your guardians can care for your pet.
Name and details about your cat (gender, eye color, coat color, etc.)
Instructions for taking care of your cat.
The funds you are leaving to take care of your cat. Identify the source, such as life insurance policy number.
Name of your distribution representative and any alternates.
Amount of compensation paid to the cat’s guardian and your distribution representative.
Names of successor beneficiaries to receive left-over funds.

, You don’t have to set aside funds when you create the pet protection agreement. However, it is probably ideal to make a one-time payment so that you don’t have to revise your will. Alternately, you can fund it from a life insurance policy, retirement account, or the proceeds from the sale of your home as specified in your will., Both you and the guardian should sign the pet protection agreement in front of a notary public and two witnesses. Keep a copy of the signed agreement for your records. Store it with your other estate planning documents (wills, trust, etc.) in a safe place. Make sure the following people receive a copy of the pet protection agreement:


your vet
the distribution representative
the guardian and successor guardians
close family friends

Identify the species.,
Acquire an incubator.,
Be consistent.,
Don’t be disappointed.,
Be prepared.",How to Find and Take Care of Wild Bird Eggs2," If you choose to care for a wild bird egg, you will need to know the species’ incubation period and what to feed the nestling should the egg hatch. Fortunately, wild bird eggs are relatively easy to identify.

, If you don’t already have one, buy an electronic incubator with adjustable settings and a built-in fan. The incubation protocols for wild bird eggs are mostly unknown, so you will have to follow the protocol for domestic poultry eggs.


Set up the incubator in an area free from direct sunlight and drafts.
Before setting the wild bird egg(s), run the incubator for a couple of hours with water in the incubator’s pan. This will stabilize the incubator’s internal atmosphere.

, Successful incubation depends on four factors: temperature, humidity, ventilation, and turning. Temperature is the most important factor, and you should maintain a constant temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the duration of the incubation.


Keep the incubator’s pan full. Relative humidity within the incubator should be around 60 percent.
Maintain air flow, and rotate the egg(s) a half turn at least three times per day. This ensures that the egg is warmed evenly.

, Most wild bird eggs that you find will never hatch. Incubation could have been interrupted, or the egg’s inner membrane could have been damaged. In each case, the embryo dies.

, If the incubation is successful, you will need to feed the nestling every fifteen to twenty minutes from sunrise to sunset for about two weeks.Wild bird diets vary a great deal from species to species, so make sure you have the right kinds of food on hand.Keep in mind that hand-reared wild birds have a low probability of surviving: humans simply cannot teach wild birds to fend for themselves in the wild."

Any wood box that is wide enough for the birds to turn around in and deep enough that the adults will not be able to kick all of the nesting material out of the box will do.Nesting boxes can be wood or metal. Wood provides more warmth, but metal is easier to clean.
Fill the nest box almost to the top with pine or aspen shavings. The adults will probably kick some of the nesting material out, but this is fine as long as some remains.
Placing the nest box on the outside of the cage will make it easier for you to interact with the babies when they hatch.
Once the eggs hatch, you will need to replace the soiled wood shavings on a daily basis.;
, Watch the parents carefully both before and after the eggs hatch. They are typically capable of caring for the babies, but you may need to intervene if the babies are in danger.If the parents are not sitting on the fertilized eggs, you may need to place the eggs in an incubator to help them hatch.
If the parents are not feeding one of the babies, they may have rejected it because it is too weak. If this happens, you will probably need to take the baby away from the parents and raise it yourself. You can try reintroducing it to the parents after it has become stronger, but be sure to continue watching them closely.
Be on the lookout for parents (especially fathers) who pluck the babies' feathers. This can mutilate or even kill the baby bird if done aggressively enough. If you notice this, move the parent to a different cage. You can try letting the parent visit the babies during feeding times, but only if it does not continue to pluck the babies' feathers.

, If you want to get your baby birds used to being handled by humans, you can begin hand feeding them at around two to four weeks of age, depending on the species. You can buy formulas that are specifically designed for the species of bird you are raising and feed them using an eye dropper, syringe, or spoon. The amount you feed them will depend on the birds' species and size.Be extremely careful not to feed baby birds anything that is too hot, or you may cause serious burns. The ideal formula temperature for cockatiels is 104-106 degrees Fahrenheit.
You do not need to hand feed baby birds unless the parents do not appear to be feeding them. If you allow the parents to continue feeding them until they are weaned, the babies will develop better social skills to interact with other birds. If you start hand feeding them, they will become more tame around humans.
Starting to hand feed baby birds before this time will probably not make any difference in their tameness. They will also miss out on the healthy bacteria that is introduced into their digestive systems by their parents in the first few weeks.
If you do not hand feed the babies and allow the parents to continue feeding them, be sure to provide more seed and fresh foods than you normally would. If you notice the parents pacing around the cage, they may not have enough food.
Be sure to clean any excess food off of the baby bird's feathers and out of its mouth using a sterile cloth or cotton swab and warm water. This will prevent bacteria buildup. You can also use a small amount of Citricidal to clean the feathers.Note that if you buy a bird at a pet store, it should be old enough to feed itself, so you will not need to hand feed it at all.

, Even if you choose not to hand feed your baby birds, you can still get them used to human contact simply by handling them regularly. Begin handling them several times a day for about 15 minutes per session, starting when they are about 12 days old.Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling the babies. They are very susceptible to bacteria when they are young.
Handling the babies for too long will cause them to become cold and tired, so stick to short sessions.
Give the babies lots of love by cradling them in your palms, stroking them, and talking to them.

, If you want or need to raise the babies entirely away from their parents, you will need to use a brooder to keep them warm. You can set one up by placing a heating pad partially under the container you are keeping them in, and then covering the container with a towel to keep the heat in.The temperature should be 80-85 degrees Fahrenheit for babies that have pin feathers, 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit for babies that are fully feathered, and 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit for babies that are fully weaned.
If you are using a heating pad to heat your container, be sure to place it only partially under the container so that the babies can escape the heat if it gets too hot.
An aquarium makes and ideal container. You can also purchase special brooders or brooder tops that are designed to heat aquariums.
Line your container with a soft material like toilet paper, paper towels, or cotton diapers. Be sure to change the lining material after each feeding.
If you raise the baby birds away from their parents, it is best to allow them to socialize with them from time to time.

, Whether you have been hand feeding your baby birds or allowing the parents to feed them, you will need to start introducing them to weaning foods when they become old enough. The exact age will depend upon the species.You will know they are ready for weaning when they begin to pick things up with their mouths.Don't force the babies to wean if they're not ready. It may take several weeks for them to complete the transition.
Be sure to continue hand feeding or allowing the parents to feed until the babies begin to refuse this type of feeding. If their necks are pumping and they are making noises, they are begging for food.
You can buy weaning pellets to feed your baby birds during them time. You can moisten them to make easier to eat.
You can also start introducing other soft foods, like fruits, vegetables, and cooked grains.
If possible, move each baby to its own cage during the weaning process. This will result in optimal bonding with humans., In almost all circumstances, it is in a wild bird's best interest to be raised by its parents. Being raised by humans has numerous disadvantages for the bird, especially if you intend on releasing it back into the wild, so be sure not to intervene unless necessary.A bird that is raised by humans will miss out on important social interactions with other birds, and may not be able to pick up everything it missed.
A bird that is raised by humans will not learn many of the survival skills its parents would have taught it, such as how to find food or how to spot a predator. This will decrease the bird's chances of being able to survive in the wild.
A bird raised by humans is likely to exhibit no fear of humans, which could get it into trouble with people who are not familiar with the bird.

, Whenever you find a baby bird, you should determine whether it is injured. If so, contact a veterinarian or wildlife rehabilitator right away. Signs of injury include bleeding, wings that are drooping or twerked up, an inability to flutter its wings, shivering, and falling over.It it fine to handle the baby bird. It is not true that its parents will reject it if it has been handled by humans. Be sure to always wash your hands before and after handling a bird.If the bird was in another animal's mouth (like your cat or dog), you should assume that it is injured and get medical help for it. It may need antibiotics to protect it against dangerous bacteria acquired from the other animal, even if its skin isn't broken.Do not assume that a bird is injured just because it can't fly or seems slightly clumsy. Birds typically leave their nests before the are completely able to fly. This is a normal part of the learning experience for them., If you have determined that the bird is not injured, the next step is to determine whether it is a fledgling, which means it is learning to fly, or a nestling, which means it should still be in its nest.


Fledglings may not be able to fly, but they should be able to grip firmly on your finger or another perch. Nestlings will not be able to do this.You can also identify a nestling by its lack of feathers. If you find a less than fully-feathered bird on the ground, it is probably too young to be there., If you have found a nestling that has fallen from its nest, the best possible thing you can do for the bird is to return it to its nest as soon as possible. Look in nearby trees and bushes closely, keeping in mind that the nest may be somewhat hidden.


If you can't find the nest, you can create a new nest for the bird by placing it in a small basket or container and hanging it from or nailing it to a tree. Make sure the container has holes in the bottom for drainage and is lined with paper or cloth to prevent the bird from slipping., If you have determined that the bird you have found is a fledgling, you do not need to return it to its nest, but you should remove it from any danger that it might be in. This includes moving it out of a road or placing it in a tree if there are predators nearby.If the bird is not in immediate danger, there's nothing for you to do. Simply leave the bird alone and let it learn to fly.
If you know that you have fledglings in your yard who are just learning to fly, try to keep your pets out of their way for a few days, and ask your neighbors to do the same., If you have left a fledgling be or returned a nestling to a nest, you may still be concerned about it. If so, it's best to watch it from a distance. Its parents will not return to take care of it if you are there, so give the bird some space and wait to see if they come back for the baby.Parents should return to their babies within two hours, but they may not stay long. If you have been watching the bird and the parents do not return, you may consider intervening.

, You will need to house your baby bird in some kind of small container. A small box or bowl will suffice. Be sure to line the nest with a soft material like toilet paper to make it more comfortable.Make sure there is enough bedding in the nest that the bird can prop himself up to defecate over the edge of the container.
Keep the nest in a dark, quiet place. Too much light can damage the baby bird's eyes, and too much noise can scare it., If you are caring for a nestling, it is extremely important to make sure that it stays warm. You can do this by placing a heating pad under the bird's container and then covering it with a towel to keep the heat in.Keep the heating pad on low to avoid burning the bird.
It is a good idea to leave at least a small portion of the container off of the heating pad so the bird can escape if it gets too hot.
If you don't have a heating pad, you can fill an old sock with rice and microwave it until it is warm to the touch, but not hot.
If you have a heating lamp, you can use this, with a 40 watt bulb placed at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the bird, as a heater. If you place the bird's nest inside an aquarium, you will simulate an incubator., Once you have made sure that the baby bird is safe and warm, contact a wildlife rehabilitator to finish raising it. A trained professional will be much better prepared to care for this baby bird than you will.It is important to understand just how labor-intensive it is to raise a baby bird when deciding whether or not to contact a wildlife rehabilitator. They need to be fed approximately every 30 minutes, so it is a very big commitment.
If you can't locate a wildlife rehabilitator by searching online, you can try contacting your local game warden or conservation department. You can also try calling vets in your area. Even if they are not able to take the baby birds, they may be able to refer you to a local wildlife rehabilitator.

, The decision to provide food or water for your baby bird will depend on how long you must care for it before you can get it to a wildlife rehabilitator. If you do not need to provide food, it is best not to, as all birds have different dietary requirements, and feeding a bird the wrong thing can be very bad for it.If the bird has reddish skin or if you pinch the skin on the back of its neck and it doesn't spring back right away, it is probably dehydrated.If the bird is debilitated or dehydrated, do not attempt to provide food, even if it appears hungry.Never try to put water in a bird's mouth. The bird can aspirate the water and die. If you need to provide water, you can try giving it a small amount of dog kibble that has been soaked in water until it is soft., It is important to decide from the beginning whether or not you will attempt to release the bird back into the wild from the very beginning. If you plan on keeping it as a pet for its whole life, you will probably want it to become tame, but if you are planning on releasing it, this tameness may inhibit its survival.If you plan on keeping the bird, handle it as you would any other pet.
If you plan on releasing the bird, it is best to avoid handling it except when it is absolutely necessary. This means keeping children and pets away from the bird as well.
A single baby bird under two weeks old will always imprint on its caretaker (see that person as its mother and become very attached), so it is best to surrender these birds to professionals who can care for them for the rest of their lives.
If you have multiple baby birds, it may be possible to keep them from imprinting on you by staying away from them as much as possible. This will greatly increase their chances of survival in the wild.
If you plan on releasing the bird, it's best to give it plenty of time outside, or at least in a place where it can see and hear the outside world. This will help it learn more about its environment., Food and water requirements vary from species to species, so it is extremely important that you find out what kind of bird you are dealing with before you attempt to feed it. Once you have figured out what kind of food your bird needs, you can feed it by placing small amounts of food on the end of a drinking straw. Try cutting one side of the straw of at the end so that it resembles a scoop.Depending on the species of bird you are dealing with, you may feed it moistened dog kibble, seeds, or meal worms. If in doubt, ask a veterinarian what the appropriate diet for your bird would be.Never feed a bird bread or milk.Many birds get their water from the food they eat, rather than from drinking.The bird will be able to eat entirely on its own when it is between six and 10 weeks old, but you can begin providing small amount of food in the cage at four weeks to help it get used to the idea of self-feeding.

, Once the bird is able to get out of its box, you will need to put it in a cage. Get as large of a cage as you can so your bird has room to move around.Try to expose your bird to sunlight, either by placing the cage outside for part of the day or by placing it near a window. If you cannot offer exposure to natural sunlight, try using an artificial sun lamp.
Provide toys, like plastic wiffle balls, for your bird to play with. Perches are also important.
Be sure to allow the bird enough time out of the cage to practice flying. The bird will not need any instruction, but it will need to work at it for a while in order to become a proficient flier., Once your bird is able to fly and eat on its own, you can consider releasing it back into the wild.Let the bird make the decision to leave the nest for good on its own. You can do this by bringing the cage outside and opening it, allowing the bird to come and go as it pleases. It may return to the cage the first few times or it may leave right away.

Purchase a top opening nesting box.,
Use a plastic strawberry basket.,
Place a small mirror in the box.",How to Prevent Premature Fledging1," Although they are harder to clean out, and more difficult for shorter people to monitor, premature fledging is less likely to occur if you have a top opening nesting box. This type of nesting box is especially effective at preventing premature fledging if the entrance is covered with a sock or piece of cloth while checking the box.To make cleaning more easy, make your nesting box open multiple ways, for example from the sides, front, and top. However, only use the top opening to monitor the box.;
, Make monitoring easy by placing a plastic strawberry basket in the box before nest building occurs. Strawberry baskets allow you to smoothly and quickly slide the nest out of the box, without touching or disturbing the contents, to monitor it.It also helps with the removal of blowflies. Blowflies will drop through the basket and onto the floor of the nesting box instead of remaining in the nest with the baby birds.

, A small mirror is helpful to look inside the nest without disturbing it. Install a small mechanic’s or dental mirror just inside the entrance hole. Shine a small penlight at the mirror. The light will bounce of the mirror allowing you to see the nest with minimal disturbances.Use super glue to secure the mirror inside the box.

"
"
Check the box in the afternoon.,
Make noise before opening the box.,
Spend less than a minute checking the box.,
Keep good records.,
Look for pests.",How to Prevent Premature Fledging2," Avoid checking the box in early morning and dusk. Also, avoid checking the box during wet and/or cold weather, especially if it is less than 50 °F (10 °C) outside. Instead, check the box during calm, dry weather conditions. Remember that you only need to monitor the box during nesting season, i.e., late March through August.Avoid checking the box 12 to 14 days after the bird's eggs have hatched. Checking the box during this time can cause premature fledging.
Do not check the box too frequently, i.e., every day. Instead, check the box only once or twice a week, or every seven to 10 days.
How frequently you check the box depends on how serious predator problems are, how much data you want to collect, and how much time you have.

, Before opening the box, make your presence known. If you do not, you might startle the female, and a startled female could damage the eggs.Make your presence known by whistling, calling out, and/or lightly tapping on the side of the box.

, Once you have made your presence known, slowly open the box. Do not yank it open. Spend less than a minute when checking the box to avoid stressing the birds, or chilling the eggs or nestlings.Once you are finished checking, slowly close the box, as well. You want to close it slowly because a sitting female or one of the nestlings might decide to fly out. If they do, you do not want to inadvertently hurt the birds by closing the door too quickly.

, Every time you check the box, record what you see. This way, you can avoid checking the box during the critical period when disturbing the box could cause premature fledging. This critical period is 12 to 14 days after the nestlings have hatched. You will also be able to determine when fledging may occur, i.e., 17 to 18 days after hatching. It is ok to check the box during the official fledging period.Record the day egg hatching begins and when the last egg is laid. This will help you calculate when the critical period will take place. Remember, do not check the box during the critical period in order to avoid premature fledging.
Also record what kind of nest you see, how many eggs and nestlings there are, and any evidence of problems.

, There are a variety of pests that can make a home out of your nesting box. These pests include House Sparrows, paper wasps, fire ants, bumblebees and honeybees, blowfly larvae, mice, and snakes. When monitoring the box for these pests, always use caution and never reach in with your hands.House Sparrows are non-native birds that may attack and destroy eggs, nestlings, and incubating adults of native bird species. By identifying a House Sparrow's eggs, you can remove their nests from your box. Because these birds are non-native species, you may legally remove their nests, eggs, and young.
A House Sparrow's eggs may be cream, white, grey, or green in color. All of the eggs are speckled with irregular fine, brown speckles. The shell is also smooth with a slight gloss."

Purchase a galvanized stovepipe.,
Cut a hardware cloth circle.,
Place the hardwire cloth circle over the top of the stovepipe.,
Take your mounting pipe and hanger strips.,
Slip the stovepipe baffle over the pole.",How to Prevent Premature Fledging3," It is recommended that you use an 8” diameter by 24” long stovepipe. Along with the stovepipe you will need to purchase a slender galvanized pole/pipe (.5” in diameter and 7 feet long), hardware cloth, 7” long hanger iron straps, and two No. 8 B32 by ¾” machine screws and nuts.You can purchase these materials from your local hardware or home improvement store. Find the stovepipe in the plumbing section.
Purchase a tin snips tool to cut the hardware wire if you do not have a pair.

, Using the tin snips, cut a circle in the hardware cloth that is one inch bigger than the diameter of the stovepipe. Then, cut a small hole in the middle of the hardware cloth circle.The size of the hole should be the size of the mounting pole’s diameter. For example, if your mounting pole is .5” in diameter, then cut a .5” hole in the middle of the hardware cloth.

, Bend the edges down one inch and fit them inside the stovepipe. Slide the cloth an inch down the stovepipe, or until the cloth is fitted tightly inside it. Make sure the fit is nice and tight. Then, take your tin snips and cut three tabs in the top of the stovepipe. Bend these tabs inward and over the top of the hardware cloth., Using the machine screws and nuts, bolt the hanger strips together and securely around the center of the pole. Bolt them no more than a foot from the top of the pole—the top of the baffle needs to be at least four feet off the ground. Then, bend the edges outward. These edges will support the stovepipe baffle.Place duct tape or a radiator hose clamp around the pole and underneath the hanger straps to hold them in place better.

, Do this once the hanger claps are secure. Slip it over the pole until it rests on top of the hanger clips. To discourage predators, the baffle should wobble a little bit.When mounting the nesting box on the pole, the bottom of the box should be only three to four inches away from the top of the stovepipe baffle. This will encourage snakes to go inside of the baffle and get stopped instead of climbing over the outside of the baffle."

Look for the signs.,
Decide whether or not you'd like to breed from her.,
If you don't want to breed from your pet bird, you'll need to help her by distracting her.,
Provide her with a same gender partner.,
Change her location and her cage entertainment.,
Feed her well.",How to Help a Nesting Bird," Signs that your pet bird wants to start nesting include:


She starts to put feathers, seeds, grass, and other materials in the corner of her cage. She might also put them into her feeding dish.
The cere, or band above the beak, of a female budgie can darken.
Previously happy birds can suddenly become irritable and bite you, or refuse to move and just sit on the bottom of the cage.
The bird droppings will seem sloppier than usual, and will smell when egg laying time gets near.;
, If you do, there are two options. Find a breeding partner for her in your home environment and let them get on with it. Alternatively, if you don't want to keep another bird but you have a friend who has the same birds, lend your bird for breeding and get her back afterwards.

, Remove her nesting material regularly, along with any eggs she's laid. This will cause her to keep building a new nest. If you really don't want to remove the eggs, be patient. She'll sit on them until it becomes clear to her that they're not hatching, anywhere between 18 to 28 days.

, This may be enough to take her mind off wanting to nest.

, A nesting bird might be persuaded to distract herself from the nesting behaviour if she's placed in a different part of the house and given new toys to play with.


Put her cage in a safe location outside sometimes, so that she can enjoy the sunshine and different views.

, Include calcium in her diet if she's laying a lot of eggs.

Acquire a container.,
Put the box in some form of shelter.,
Put some bedding down.,
Keep a source of food and water in the box.,
Acquire a heat lamp.",How to Build a Small Chick Brooder," Brooders can be made out of anything such as cardboard/plastic boxes, children's pool, cage, etc. Your best bet is starting off with a cardboard box or making your own wooden box.;
, The brooder will need to be sheltered away from wind, rain, snow and the sun. The best place to keep a brooder is in a shed, garage or basement. Keep it out of reach of young children and dangerous pets., The bedding should be soft, absorbent and non-slippery. A good material to use is hay, straw, wood shavings or paper towels. Avoid using newspaper as this is a slippery material that can cause leg problems in chicks and isn't absorbent enough.

, Acquire a small shallow bowl and fill it up with water. If the water bowl is a bit deep place some marbles inside which will help avoid chicks drowning and encourages the chicks to drink. You can purchase a chick feeder or drinker which is better. Always keep chicks on a chick starter feed., Chicks require heat for the first few weeks when they are born. You can purchase a bulb that keeps a high temperature but with a heat lamp you can choose the temperature yourself. Be sure the temperature is at 95 degrees and lower it by 5 degrees every week until it reaches room temperature.

Make yourself comfortable.,
Improve your ability to see the insects.,
Use light.,
Simply watch the insects go about their business for a time.,
Consider borrowing some library books or checking online sites about insects.,
As you advance in your insect watching, you can get more sophisticated in what you record.,
Take notes of your observations.,
Take sketches of the insects.,
Take photographs of the insects.",How to Watch Insects," To begin with, there are likely to be insects in your house. What types are they and what are they doing? There are insects invested in using your house as a source of food, shelter and breeding, and learning more about them can set your mind at ease about the presence of insects. And if you happen to discover insects that are better off not being in your home, you'll be in a position to do something constructive about their removal!;
, Your backyard will be a wonderful playground for a variety of insects, such as ants, bees, flies, dragonflies, butterflies, beetles, bugs and more. Look everywhere, including on the grass and plants, under leaves, on your house walls, under the house, in the shed, on pavement, in the dirt, etc.

, There is a potential to find insects everywhere you go. Even where there are no mammals (apart from humans) or birds, there are bound to be some insects, as they're tenacious and in massive numbers.


Visit the park to find insects in similar places as your backyard.
Check out the trees, shrubs and weeds growing along street-scapes.
Look down around your feet as you walk about.
Check the walls and ceilings of buildings you enter.
Check the sand at the beach, the water of a pond, the sides of a riverbank, the ground of a forest, etc. whenever you are visiting such places. Insects abound everywhere.
Check spider's webs; there are often dead insects to be spotted here!

, Some insects prefer the day, some the night. Some prefer early morning, some prefer the evening. Some are easier to see when there is no light, such as fireflies or other glowing insects.

, Observing a mound of ants that sting or hanging around wasps or bees in a frenzy is not a good idea at all. Always keep a safe distance from insects that can cause you harm, and if you have allergies to any insects, use common sense and either don't watch those insects or watch them from somewhere safe, such as behind a window of your house.

, If you try to watch insects in too large an area, you'll only see the biggest of insects and it'll soon seem a bit dull. Zoom in on a single area, whether it's the ground, the trunk of a tree, on leaves, under a plant, etc.

, Find some insects or an area of insects that you'd like to observe. Set yourself up for a time, making your sitting or lying area comfortable for you. You might like to sit in a low chair (such as those used at the beach) or lie on a rug or tarpaulin, to keep you clean and away from the cold of the soil.

, Purchase a good quality magnifying glass (around 5 to 10x) and use this to bring the smaller insects into focus. If you can't see what the smaller insects are doing, watch their activity through the magnifying glass.


Always take care not to accidentally concentrate sunlight through a magnifying glass onto an insect, as this could burn the insect.
Give your eyes a break now and then; staring through a magnifying glass for long periods of time can tire your eyes.

, If you're watching insects at night, many are attracted to light, which makes it easy to get the insects to come to you. Set up a lamp, a flashlight or some other source of light (even the porch light will work, which is great if your comfy chair is already there) and watch the insects gravitate to the light.


If you can change the wavelength of the light, you'll get different insects. Change the bulbs to blue, red, yellow, etc. and observe what happens to the insects.
Blacklight will attract many insects, so if you have one, give it a try too; hang it against a white sheet from the clothesline.

, To begin with, it doesn't matter if you don't know what the insects are or what they're doing, just watch them and learn. The more you observe, the more curious you'll become to find out what they are and what they're up to.

, These can help you to learn more about the type of insects you're observing and the things that are known about them.


Purchase your own insect field guide. Choose one that is local to your area, so that it accounts for the insects where you are.

, You can observe ""flower visitors"", for example, at regularly set times of the day, under different conditions and begin to piece together patterns of visiting insects.This could even lead to scientific observing, depending on how dedicated you want to become.

, Perhaps you'd like to keep an insect watching notebook that you take along with you when watching the insects, or you could record the information on your smartphone or other digital device. However you choose to keep notes, here are some things that you might like to record:


The type(s) of insects
The features you can see, such as size or shape of the head, jaws, amount of legs, antennae, carapace, wings, etc.
The colors, variations, patterns, distinctive markings, etc. that you can see (and whether you see different species of the same insect, such as flies, mosquitoes or ants, showing different colors, sizes, patterns, etc.)
What the insects are doing, such as feeding, marching, flying about, mating, fighting, pouncing on prey, etc.
What their home looks like (if you can find it)
The interactions between the same species of insect and with other insects; record whether any non-insect animal is feasting on the insects, being irritated by them, or interacting with them in some way
The time of day, the temperature, the place, etc.
What plants are around the insects. This can be important for knowing what attracts the insects, which plants shelter insects and which plants they avoid.

, If you like sketching and feel comfortable with it, consider making sketches of the insects you're watching, in your notebook. These can help with future identification and make a good record of what you've seen.

, This will allow you to keep a visual record of the insects and their environment. It will also allow you to share your photographs with people online, if you wish. Insect photography is quite an art, so you will also need to learn how to take photos of small creatures, taking into account movement, camouflage, and tiny size.


If something interesting happens with the insects, be sure to catch it in a photo or video.
You could post your video or photos on social media.

Think about the process of breeding finches.,
Buy a cage to breed your finches in.,
Place the cage in a suitable environment.,
Provide a nest for the finches.,
Add nesting material to the cage.",How to Breed Zebra Finches1," Breeding finches takes time and you will need some space, the necessary equipment and some extra money on hand. Be sure you are dedicated to breeding finches and before you do start breeding, plan out everything including what you're going to do with the baby finches once they have grown.

, A 18 inches (45.7 cm) long and 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide cage is good. You must purchase a larger cage than expected since the finches will be breeding which means you will have quite a few birds in the cage. Add perches, bird toys, feed and water containers, and bedding at the bottom of the cage so that it is suitable to house finches in it.


The perches should be as thin as your finger and not too close together, otherwise the finches will jump from perch to perch and not get much exercise since they need to use their wings.





The feed and water containers should be large enough to fit four finches in it. The finches will be taking baths in the water container which is why they should fit. A Tupperware container is best to use for this.






, Since the finches will be breeding, you won't want to place the cage in a room that gets disturbed often. Instead place the cage in a low-traffic room with no pets (or predators) about., Finches prefer a covered nest to raise their chicks in. You will need one nesting box for each pair of finches you plan to breed. Nesting boxes can be found in most pet shops.
, Finches particularly like dry grass and will not hesitate to use it as their nesting material. Provide somewhere in their cage so that they can make a nest out of it.

Finches will also pick up feathers lying about in their cage and use it as nesting material.

"
"
Buy a pair of Zebra Finches.,
Feed the finches properly.,
Provide plenty of sunlight.,
Wait.,
Do not handle the chicks.",How to Breed Zebra Finches2," You must purchase one male and one female finch in order for them to breed. To distinguish males from females, observe the finches. Male zebra finches have red markings on their cheeks whilst females do not.

The pair of finches must be at least six to nine months old and in good condition to be able to breed. Remember, you don't want to inbreed because it often leads to unhealthy chicks so make sure the pair of finches you choose are in no way related to each other.
Finches can be bought from a pet shop, online, or from a reliable breeder. You should choose a pair of finches that are alert, active and making some noise.

, Since the finches will be hard at work caring and feeding their baby chicks you must make sure they are getting a proper diet. The female finch should also get some source of calcium such as crushed oyster shells or cuttle bone. The usual finch diet is good for your breeding pair. Finch seed mixtures can be found in most pet shops and grocery shops.
, Don't hide the finches away in a shed or garage, instead make sure they get plenty of sunlight. Around 14 to 16 hours of sunlight a day is needed., The finches will build their nest, start breeding, lay their eggs and sit on them. All you have to do now is wait and leave the finches undisturbed. Remember, continue caring for them properly to make sure they are happy and healthy.

After the finches sit on the eggs it will take them about 14 to 16 days to hatch so be patient. If the eggs show no signs of hatching after the 20th day you must discard them.

, The chicks are very fragile, don't handle them unless necessary. You may cause stress upon the parents.

Zebra finches make great parents and will care for the chicks themselves. Caring for the chicks is not necessary but you must provide the food and water. When the baby finches are six weeks old you must separate them from their parents or the parents will peck at them.

Before disturbing the cat, get a towel ready.,
Speak calmly to the cat and pick her up with both hands, cradling her weight in your arms.,
Make the first fold.,
Make the second fold.,
Make the final fold.,
Examine your cat or give her medicine.",How to Wrap a Cat1," To do this, shake the towel out and spread it evenly over a flat surface. A table is better than the floor as it's easier on your back and arms.


A large towel is ideal, such as a beach towel or bed sheet. If necessary you could use a closed-weave blanket of a similar size. Open weave blankets offer little protection and are not suitable because the cat will catch her claws in the fabric.;
, A regular-sized towel has a longer length and narrower width. You will want to place the cat centrally on the towel, at a right-angle to the length, with her nose touching one edge.


Let the cat rest on her belly in a natural crouching position, with her paws underneath.
There should be an equal length of towel on either side of the cat’s body.


, If you are right handed, use your left hand to grip her scruff and vice versa. This area of loose skin over the shoulders is where a mother cat holds her kittens to trigger a passive reaction. Although you may feel reticent about gripping your pet firmly, be assured you are not hurting, or harming her in any way. To make the first fold:


With your right hand, grasp the towel edge 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) from the cat.
Apply firm tension to the fabric and fold it right-over-left across the cat’s back, and include the hand restraining the cat in the wrap. You will remove your hand after the next step.
Gently lift the cat by the scruff, such that her body is raised at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal, with her bottom resting on the floor and her forequarters elevated.
Feed the fold of towel lying across her back, under her left front paw. Then lower her paws back to the table top so that her body weight anchors this first wrap in place.

, To make the second fold, do the following:


With your left hand still encased, grasp the towel on the left side of the cat. As before, apply firm tension as you cross the fabric left-to-right over the cat’s back. The cat is now enclosed in a towel cocoon with just her head sticking out.
Now free your left hand. Let go of her scruff and wriggle your fingers free of the wrap. If you applied the correct tension to the towel, the cat’s limbs will remain firmly held against her body.
Place your newly freed hand under her chest. Lift her front end up off the flat surface so that her body is angled at about 45 degrees horizontally.
Now use your right hand to grasp the trailing edge of the second wrap. Feed it under the cat and pull it firmly so she is tightly swaddled. Continue to wrap the remaining length of towel around the cat until the free length is used up.

, The cat is now rolled in a towel but, if she is determined, she could wriggle out backwards. The final, or ""burrito"" fold, involves tucking the width of the towel dangling behind her, under the body. This is as simple as it sounds:


Simply lift up her wrapped rear end and tuck the dangling tail of fabric beneath her.
Now when you lower her back end down, her body weight pins the towel beneath her and there is no backwards escape route.

, After wrapping your cat, you can immediately give her medicine. Or you can examine a leg or paw by slowly pulling the desired body part out for examination, through the opening end of the towel or blanket.

Get a thick and large towel or blanket.,
Immediately throw it over the cat.,
Immediately locate the scruff of the neck and grab it.,
Place the cat on a table with a large thick towel already spread on it.",How to Wrap a Cat2," Praise her and reassure her that no harm will be done. Act as normal as possible. If necessary, go about your day so she doesn't sense that something is going on.


If you have another person with you, this will be a lot easier. Distract that cat yourself while the other person grabs the towel or blanket to wrap them with. Have them approach from behind.

, You want that's ideally three or four times the size of the cat. A large blanket, towel, or sheet is best. Avoid those that have a loose weave, as your cat could paw or claw her way out.

Recognize the sleep stage.,
Try a light touch.,
Make a small noise.,
Use food.,
Allow your cat to get enough sleep.,
Recognize signs of a seizure.,
Do not let young children wake up a sleeping cat.,
Monitor your cat's sleeping habits.,
Decide carefully if you want to allow your cat to sleep in the bed.,
Make sure your cat has many places to sleep.,
Avoid waking very young cats.",How to Wake up a Cat," Normally, it's fine to wake a sleeping cat. However, there are two stages of sleep that are important to a cat's well-being: Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep and Non-REM (NREM) sleep, also called deep sleep. If a cat is deprived of these sleep stages, he may become irritable or lethargic. If you think your cat is in REM sleep or deep sleep, you may want to let him be.REM sleep usually comes before deep sleep. A cat may move slightly, and his eyes may twitch. His face or body may move or twitch slightly.During deep sleep, your cat will be largely motionless and appear relaxed. Your cat will be very still and spread out in a comfortable position. He may be lying down or curled up, and may not respond quickly to noise or commotion.Cats do need more sleep than most mammals. REM and deep sleep are important to restore a cat's immune system and generally repair and regenerate his body. It's a good idea to let your cat be during these sleep stages unless you feel moving him is absolutely necessary.;
, While cats sleep frequently, they are not always in REM or deep sleep. Usually, cats take light naps throughout the day. During these light naps, cats are still in tune to their environments. This is a survival mechanisms inherited from ancestors to help wild cats stay safe from predators and threats when sleeping during the day. A small touch will easily wake a sleeping cat most of the time.You can try lightly brushing your cat's head or the tip of his ear. Try to keep your touch gentle. Remember, cats sleep lightly as a way to ward off predators. You want to make sure your cat does not see you as a potential threat.
If you need to move your cat, try to get him to move right after he stirs. Cats usually fall back to sleep quickly once they see there's no real threat. As soon as you get your cat awake, coax him off the couch or pick him up and move him.

, If your cat tends to be on the skittish side, he may bite or scratch if touched in his sleep. Instead, you can try making a small noise. You can whistle, hum, or call his name to get his attention.As with touch, you want to gently coax your cat out of his slumbers rather than startling him. Try a soft, soothing noise.
You should avoid yelling at your cat to wake him up. Cats do not take well to yelling. If you yell at your cat frequently, he may become fearful and begin avoiding you., If your cat is very skittish, waking him up with sound or touch may frighten him regardless of how gentle you are. You can try to coax him awake with food. Shake his bag of cat food or open a can. You can also rattle a treat bag, or place some of his favorite table scraps near where he's sleeping. He may get up to go for the food, getting him out of the way.

, Cats need a lot of sleep, so you should not be constantly waking your cat up. Cats, on average, sleep for about 15 hours a day. House cats still retain a wild streak, and their bodies are primed to sleep on and off during much of the day as they would in the wild.Do not wake your cat up unless it's absolutely necessary. For example, you may need to wake your cat up to take him to the vets.
Accept that your cat's sleep schedule may not match yours. Cats are often most active around dusk, and may sleep a lot during the day. Cats are highly domestic. If your cat is attached to you, he may gradually adjust his sleep schedule around yours. However, cats generally do not take to a regular sleep/wake cycle like humans do.

, During REM sleep, cats may twitch and move around in their sleep. This is a normal part of the REM cycle. However, cats may also sometimes have seizures during sleep, which can last up to 5 minutes. A vast majority of health conditions, ranging from heat stroke to neurological issues, can cause seizures. If your cat has a seizure, he should be medically evaluated. Make sure you know how to recognize the difference between a seizure and REM sleep.During REM sleep, a cat will wake up if you touch him or shake him gently. Any twitching movements will stop as soon as the cat opens his eyes. You cannot wake a cat up during a seizure and the movements will continue for the duration of the episode, which can be as long as 5 minutes.
Seizure movements may be more severe than REM movements. You may also notice your cat foaming at the mouth or drooling.

, If you have young children, they may frequently want your cat's attention. They may want to know how to wake up a sleeping cat. However, you should not allow young children to wake up your cat, as they may overdo it. Cats need solitude, quiet time, and quality sleep to be healthy and happy. As a rule, do not allow children to wake up a sleeping cat., As with any other aspect of your cat's behavior, keep an eye on his sleeping habits. As cats sleep so much, it's unrealistic to time how many hours a day your cat sleeps. However, get a sense of when your cat is generally asleep and when he's generally awake. If your cat suddenly starts sleeping more often, talk to a vet. Changes in sleep habits may indicate problems like depression, boredom, or illness., Many cat owners allow their cats to sleep in the bed with them. This can be a great way to foster feelings of closeness with your cat and can increase the bond between you and your pet. However, some cats can be difficult sleepers and may keep you up at night. You may frequently have to wake up and move a cat during the night.Consider the sleep quality for both you and your cat. Both you and your pet need high-quality sleep. If your cat keeps you up at night by making noise or hogging space, you're sacrificing your own sleep. If your cat seems uninterested in getting in your bed at night, sleeping near you may cause him stress.
Some cats enjoy sleeping in the bed, and may make a lot of noise crying at the door if left out of the bedroom. You can find ways to encourage cats to fall asleep before you, like feeding or playing with them just before bed.

, You want to make sure your cat can sleep when he needs to sleep. If you're frequently waking your cat up to move him off of chairs, tables, and other spaces, he may not have space of his own.


Try investing in a few high-quality cat beds. Leave them in areas of your home where your cat frequently sleeps or hangs out. You can try putting items that your cat likes, like certain toys, in these beds.
You can also clear out space for your cat. If he keeps getting onto the bookshelf, consider letting him have a corner of the shelf to himself. Clear out a pocket of space for him, and lay down a blanket for his comfort.

, Newborn kittens and younger kittens sleep a lot. It takes quite a bit of time for a cat to grow into an adult sleeping pattern. Sleep is important for kittens, as it allows them to build their muscles and bones. If you have a kitten, avoid waking him unless it's absolutely necessary. You want to make sure your kitten gets quality sleep so he can grow up healthy and strong."

While not all spiders make good pets, these spiders are ones to consider:Tarantulas
Wolf spiders
Jumping spiders
Fishing spiders
Grass spiders;
, Consider buying a spider to keep as a pet. This option allows you to get the exact species that you want. You'll also be able to ask the seller for information on how to care for your new pet.You can purchase many types of spiders at pet stores. Tarantulas are a very popular option.
There are also many reputable online sellers. Just make sure to specify whether you are planning to breed your spider(s), and how old you want it to be.
If you live with your parents or roommates, make sure that everyone in the household agrees to house the spider.

, You can also choose to skip the store and catch a spider in the wild. Just make sure to do your research first. You should make sure that you know how to identify the different spiders that live in your area. You also want to be certain that you know how to handle the spider you catch.You can look for house spiders and widow spiders in and around your house. Check window sills and cracks in walls or windows.
Jumping spiders make interesting pets. Look for them in grass and bushes. A great way to find spiders is to look for their webs.

, When you go looking for spiders, take a glass jar with you. Make sure that your jar has a lid. You should also poke holes in the lid to make sure that your spider will have air on the way to its new home. Have an adult help you with this, as you'll need to use a sharp tool.If you see a spider hanging out on a plant, you can place your jar under the spider. Gently move the leaf or branch so that the spider will drop into the jar.
You should also carry a card or stiff piece of paper with you. You can use this to scoop a spider off the ground and gently place it in your jar.

, One of the most important parts of keeping a spider as a pet is making sure that it has a safe, comfortable home. You can purchase a ready-made habitat for your spider. An aquarium that you can buy at a pet store will work just fine.Make sure that the cage is at least 2-3 times the spider's leg span. This will ensure that it has plenty of room to move around.
Add materials to make your spider feel at home. You can place leaves, dirt, and rocks in the cage.
Spiders also like to have somewhere to hide. If you have a large enough cage, you can place a small flower pot on its side in the cage. You could use a piece of wood, too.

, If you are capturing a small spider, you might want to consider a homemade cage for your spider. You can use a glass jar. If you have a big, gallon size jar, that would be great. Ask a local restaurant if you can have one of their empty jars.Make sure to thoroughly clean the jar. Rinse it with water and mild soap and then dry with a clean cloth.
You can add the same materials to your jar that you would add to an aquarium. You can also consider adding peat or moss to make a comfortable floor for your spider.
Remember that air flow is important. Poke holes in the lid of the jar to make sure that your spider is getting enough air.

, Picking a good spot for your spider's new home is important. You want to make sure that it will be safe. Choose a stable surface such as a table or counter. You don't want your spider to accidentally get knocked to the floor.Make sure that household pets or young children won't be able to accidentally set your spider free.
Most pet spiders, such as tarantulas, don't need special heating or light. The natural light in a room will be enough. Just make sure they don't get much colder than 70 degrees.

, You can feed your spider insects. Try not to overfeed your spider as they are at a larger risk of an abdomen burst should they fall from a distance. Make sure to feed spiders about once or twice a week.If the spider's abdomen becomes crumpled, feed immediately.


You can hunt for your own bugs to feed your pets. Just make sure they come from an area without pesticides.
You can also purchase insects at most pet stores. Stock up on a supply of crickets to feed your spider.
Make sure to firmly seal the tank (or jar) after feeding your pet. Spiders (especially tarantulas) are great at escaping.

, In addition to food, you need to provide fresh water for your spider. You can use a plastic bottle cap as a water bowl if you have a small spider in a small cage. If you have room, give your spider a small bowl of water.Spiders will also drink the water off of damp webbing. But you need to make sure that your cage doesn't become damp. Spiders do not thrive in humidity.
Refill your spider's water every couple of days, or more frequently, if you notice it is empty.

, If your spider is small and fragile, you should avoid handling it. But if you have a sturdier spider, such as a tarantula, you can hold it. Just remember to be careful and handle your spider properly.Carefully pick up your tarantula by the leg between your second and third fingers. Place it in the palm of your hand. It is not a good idea to let your tarantula crawl all over your body--you might lose it.
Tarantulas do not need to be handled. Try to handle your pet as little as necessary.

, Spiders are really interesting creatures. You can keep an eye on your spider so that you can get to know it better. Keep track of what it most likes to eat, when he likes to sleep, and when he is active.Try keeping a notebook near your spider's cage. You can record its habits.

Do not remove a bird from its nest.,
Return nestlings to the nest.,
Make a makeshift nest if you can't find the real one.,
Call the professionals if no parents come.If, after waiting for an hour or so, you haven't seen any parent birds come to take care of the baby, you should reach out to experts.",How to Care for Wild Baby Birds1," If you find a baby bird all alone in its nest, don't assume its mother abandoned it. It's more likely she's off getting food for her baby and will return soon.


No matter how much it's chirping and crying, never remove a baby from its nest. Think of it as kidnapping.;
, A nestling is a young bird that hasn't grown feathers yet. They sometimes fall out of their nests, which puts them into danger. The best thing you can do for a nestling is to NOT take it home, but try to return it to its nest.


Search nearby trees and bushes for an empty nest. If you can find one, place the bird back into its nest so it can wait for its mother to return.
Remember to be gentle when handling it!

, Birds can be quite good at hiding their nests in nature. If you can't find the nest, you should still try to reunite the baby with its mother by making a manmade nest for it to wait in.


Fill a small box or bowl with dried grass or paper towels, and place the bird in its makeshift nest. Do not use fresh grass, because that could make the baby bird cold
You can also use a basket with a handle, then hang the basket from a nearby tree branch.
Leave this ""nest"" where you found the bird. Wait to see if a parent bird comes by to take care of the baby., Licensed wildlife rehabilitation specialists will be best equipped to keep the baby bird healthy and happy.


If you can’t find a rehabilitator on your own, call vets, bird stores or the local Audubon Society and ask them to put you in touch with one.
The wildlife rehabilitator will want to know where you found the bird, so he or she can return it to its home when it's healed. Be as specific as possible.

Look for feathers.,
Watch the fledgling for injuries.,
Move healthy fledglings if they are in danger.,
Watch and wait for the parents.,
Contact a wildlife rehabilitation center.Again, it's very important to remember that wildlife rehabilitators are best equipped to take care of the bird.,
Take injured fledglings to get medical treatment.",How to Care for Wild Baby Birds2," If the baby bird has feathers, it’s no longer a nestling — it’s a fledgling. These older birds are learning how to fly.

, It's quite common for fledglings to be out of the nest. As part of their flying lessons, they jump from the nest and float to the ground. Likely, the fledgling's parents are nearby, teaching it how to fly.


If the fledgling seems to be limping or favoring a wing, it may be injured.
If you see no evidence of injury, just leave it alone. Being out of its nest is a normal part of a fledgling's life.

, Scan the area — do you see dogs, cats or other threats nearby? Even if the fledgling is healthy, you may need to move it to protect it from immediate threats on the ground.


Place the bird in a bush or high enough up a tree to keep the fledgling out of predators' reach.

, Give the parents about an hour to come back and check on the fledgling. If, after that time, the parents have not appeared, you need to seek professional help for the fledgling.

, Find a licensed specialist who will be able to give it a better shot at a healthy life.


Remember to provide specific information about where the bird was found.

, If, after watching the bird for a couple minutes, you decide it looks sick or injured, you need to get it help. Gently scoop the bird up and place it in a manmade “nest.”


Do not try to treat an injured bird by yourself. The best thing you can do for any injured animal is to get professional medical attention for the animal.
Note that many veterinarians won’t treat wild animals. They can point you to people who will.

Keep your hands and area around the ""nest"" clean.,
Do not give the bird water.You might find it strange, but baby birds do not drink water.,
Ask a wildlife rehabilitation specialist for feeding advice.Contact the wildlife rehabilitation center that will be taking the bird in and ask whether you should feed the bird.,
Substitute dog kibble for seeds.Do this only if you are certain that the bird eats seeds (e.g., doves or pigeons).,
Take the bird to a wildlife specialist when the time is right.",How to Care for Wild Baby Birds3," Nests are pretty small, and enclosed spaces make baby birds feel safe and secure. Don't place a scared baby in a giant box. Give it a nice, small space to hang out in.

, Baby birds need more warmth than humans — although we're happy in a room that’s 70–75 °F (21.1–23.9 °C), a baby bird will need an environment of about 85 °F (29 °C). A heat pack or hot water bottle will do the trick. You could also use a heat lamp.


Don't use scalding hot water in the water bottle. Too much heat will hurt the bird.
You should be able to leave your hand under the lamp or on the warming device without burning yourself or feeling uncomfortable.

, Overhead lamps should be a comfortable distance from the bird to keep it from overheating. If using a direct heating method like a hot water bottle, don't put the bird in direct contact with it.Instead, arrange paper towels over the heat source in the shape of a nest, and place the bird on top of them.

, The quieter and darker you can make the ""nest,"" the safer the baby bird will feel in this strange new place. Cover the box with a light blanket or with newspaper, but make sure to leave air holes so it can breathe. You might also place the box inside a cat or dog carrier.

, Your little bird will be happiest when left alone in a quiet area. Make sure children, pets and anything else that might scare the bird stay out of the room where you place the ""nest.""

, You may think the baby bird is adorable, but it might find you terrifying. Resist the urge to hold the bird for your own pleasure. Touch it only as much as you need to get it into its makeshift nest.

, Birds can carry any number of germs and diseases. Every time you handle the bird, wash your hands immediately. Keep the bird away from the kitchen or anywhere you handle food. You don't want any fecal matter getting into your food.

, If you try to give it water through a syringe or eyedropper, water can get into its lungs and cause death.

, If the center will take the bird in soon, representatives of the center may tell you to just wait until they can feed it themselves. However, if there's a delay, follow their expert advice on what to feed the baby.


Not all birds eat the same thing. Giving it milk, bread or other foods that ""sound right"" may cause diarrhea or other health problems. Follow the wildlife specialist’s directions carefully.

, In the short term, you can replace the bird's natural food with dog kibble until the bird is under expert care.


Soak the kibble in water for an hour using a ratio of 1 part kibble to 2 parts water.
Feed the bird small, pea-sized pieces of the now-spongy kibble.
Make sure it's not too wet. Remember, you don't want water to get into the baby's lungs!
You can also take a trip to the pet store and buy baby parrot hand-feeding formula. Follow the directions on the packaging to prepare the formula.

, Once you’ve contacted a wildlife rehabilitator, you will be told when you can bring the bird in. Until then, keep it as calm and quiet as possible, and just leave it alone.


Some veterinarians will take in wild birds and transfer them to wildlife specialists for you. Ask local vets if they'll do that for you.

Fill a new spray bottle with plain water.,
Wait for your cat to do something he shouldn't.,
Pull the trigger to spray water at your cat.,
Try not to let your cat see that you are spraying him.",How to Use a Spray Bottle on a Cat for Training1," It is important to purchase a brand new spray bottle to use for spray bottle training. Do not just rinse out an old cleaning solution bottle. Otherwise, you could be spraying dangerous chemicals onto your cat.


Fill up the bottle with plain cold or room temperature water.
Do not add any soap or other chemicals to the bottle. Just use plain water in the spray bottle.;
, Never use the spray bottle on your cat when he is being good. Only use it when you catch him doing something he is not supposed to do.


For example, if you notice that your cat is walking on the kitchen counter or scratching the sofa, then you could grab the bottle and use it on him. Don't use the bottle on him after he has already gotten down from the counter.

, When you spray the water at your cat, do not aim for his face. Aim for his belly or back and only spray the water bottle once. This should be enough to get your cat to stop doing what he is doing.


Make sure that you praise your cat when he stops the unwanted behavior. Pet him or give him a treat for stopping., If your cat sees that you are the on spraying water at him, then he may start to distrust you or even fear you.This can be a serious problem for your relationship with your cat. If he distrusts or fears you, then he might not allow you to approach him or pet him.


To avoid trust issues between you and your cat, try to hide the spray bottle from his view.
Put the spray bottle away in a cupboard after you are finished using it.

Prepare an enclosure.,
Add decorations and entertainment.,
Find a good location for the terrarium.,
Gently add the spider.,
Feed the right foods at the right time.,
Only feed you spider something a third of its size.",How to Take Care of a Huntsman Spider," If you want to keep your Huntsman spider happy, you need to have a proper amount of room for them to run around in. The enclosure may be higher than it is wide, as some Huntsman spiders like to climb up rather than sideways.

Make sure there are no gaps for the Huntsman to escape through, they are swift and can fit through small gaps with ease. These spiders are said to be major escape artists.
A plastic terrarium is recommended for this animal, as glass magnifies light and causes the enclosure to heat up. Try to keep the temperature between 24-28 degrees C.;
, You don't want the spider to be in a boring container do you? You can add sand, natural-looking gravel, ground bark, soil or leaves in the bottom of the container. For decorations on top of the substrate you can add whole bark as it is ideal, or a lot of secured rocks with crevices for the spider to hide in.

Make sure that the substrate can sustain water droplets for half an hour or even longer.
Make sure the substrate chosen is clean and free of chemicals, as they might harm the Huntsman.
Follow the items listed above as they mimic the spiders natural habitat.

, Make sure to place it out of direct sunlight as it will make the enclosure hot, and make sure the light is not too bright as they come out to eat at night., If it looks cramped, make sure to buy an enclosure bigger for it to feel comfortable.

Watch the spider. If it seems to be on a particular ornament and is not moving that means it may be in hunting position, or maybe like that particular ornament.
Make sure not to move the spider too much. It might get stressed and you may damage it while transporting it.

, Choosing what to feed a Huntsman may be the hardest part; it depends on where you got it from, how big the spider is and when the last feeding was. You can feed small Huntsman spiders: wingless fruit flies, pinhead crickets and other small insects. Bigger spiders get more interesting, you can feed them adult crickets, moths, younger spiders, cockroaches and much more!

Do not feed your spider ladybirds as they may be poisonous to them.

, Anything bigger might take them on or even eat them."

Avoid using the spray bottle for litter box issues.,
Use the spray bottle while your cat is still in the act.,
Save the spray bottle for severe or persistent behavior.,
Be patient and persistent.,
Stop immediately if your cat seems distressed by the spray bottle.",How to Use a Spray Bottle on a Cat for Training2," Litter box issues can happen as a result of stress, conflict with other cats, or even due to a medical condition, such as a urinary tract infection. Litter box issues can be complex, so using a spray bottle is unlikely to solve the problem. If your cat is having litter box issues, then the best thing to do is to take her to see a veterinarian to rule out medical issues and then work on retraining your cat to use the litter box. If your cat is healthy, then you can try some different techniques to get your cat to use her box, such as:Keeping one more box than the total number of cats in your home.
Changing the litter more frequently.
Trying a different brand of litter.
Placing the litter box in a quieter place in your home.
Placing litter boxes in more rooms of your house to make using the box more convenient.
Removing the liner and/or hood from the litter box, since these can make some cats uncomfortable.
Filling your cat's litter box with only one to two inches of litter, which is what most cats prefer.
Getting a large or extra large litter box, since some cats dislike small boxes.
Getting an easy entry box if you have an older cat. These boxes have a lower edge or an opening to make it easier for your cat to get in and out of the box.

, When you use positive reinforcement training, it is important to time the reward right when the desired behavior happens.Spray bottle training may also be the most effective if you use the spray bottle right when your cat is doing something you do not want him to do. Otherwise, he will probably not make the connection.


For example, if you spray your cat a few minutes after he has finished scratching your sofa, then he will not understand why you are doing it. You have to spray him while he is still in the act.

, While you may be tempted to use the spray bottle every time your cat does something you don't want him to do, you should only use the spray bottle to train for severe or persistent behaviors. If you use the spray bottle too often, then your cat may get used to being sprayed and the bottle might lose its effect.For example, if your cat often gets up on the kitchen counter to search for treats, then spray bottle training may be a good choice. Or, if your cat scratches on your sofa despite your other efforts to deter him, then spray bottle training might be a good option. However, avoid using the spray bottle on a cat who gets up on the counter once in a great while, or who scratches on the sofa once a week instead of using his scratching post.

, Some cats will learn right away that doing a specific behavior earns them a spray of water, while other cats may take longer to make the connection. Make sure that you repeat the training every time your cat engages in the unwanted behavior.


If your cat has a routine with the unwanted behavior, then be ready with the spray bottle to deter him. Try keeping it next to you (but out of his sight) or in a convenient cupboard.

, One of the reasons why most cat behavior experts do not recommend the spray bottle method is because it can cause your cat to fear you.If you notice that your cat is hiding from you, refusing to approach you, or running away when you enter a room, then she may be responding to the spray bottle training and becoming fearful of you.


If your cat does not seem to be responding to the training after a couple of weeks, then you should also stop using the spray bottle and try a different deterrent. For example, you can place tin foil or plastic wrap on counters to discourage your cat from getting up on them. Or, you can place double sided sticky tape, foil, or plastic wrap on your furniture to discourage your cat from scratching.
You can also talk to your cat's veterinarian or a cat behavior specialist to get help for severe or persistent behaviors.

Reward your cat when she does something good.,
Acknowledge good behavior right when it happens.,
Reinforce good behavior every day.,
Skip the punishment.",How to Use a Spray Bottle on a Cat for Training3," Positive reinforcement is a much more effective way to train your cat than using punishment. To get the most out of positive reinforcement training, make sure that you identify what your cat would like best as a reward.For example, if your cat loves to be pet, then pet her as a reward. If she has a favorite treat, then offering a couple of treats might be the best motivation.

, Just as it is important to use the spray bottle right when your cat is doing the undesired behavior, you also need to reinforce the positive behavior right away. Otherwise, your cat will not know why you are rewarding her.For example, if your cat is using her scratching post instead of your sofa to scratch her claws, then reward her while she is using the post, not after she finishes.

, Reinforcing your cat’s good behavior once will probably not be enough to get her to understand what you want her to do. Instead, you will need to reward her good behavior every day to help her understand what she is supposed to do.Try to watch your cat for a little while every day to identify good behaviors that you can reward.

, While you may be tempted to yell at your cat, throw something at her, or hit her when she frustrates you, resist this urge. It will not solve the problem. In fact, it may make matters worse because your cat may become fearful of you and start avoiding you.If your cat does something you don’t want her to do, simply spray her once or clap your hands loudly to get her attention. Then, make sure that you reward her for stopping the unwanted behavior.

Look for the spiders in trees and shrubs that border open areas.,
Observe the spiders outside during the spring and summer.,
Watch for immature spiders moving inside during the late fall.",How to Identify a Yellow Sac Spider," The yellow sac spider’s legs are relatively long – slightly longer than their body. In addition, their front 2 legs are longer than the rest of their legs. Their legs are also relatively thin and do not have a muscular appearance., The tips of the yellow sac spider’s legs are black in color. The color comes from tiny black hair that cover their feet. This hair enables the spider to climb vertically – up trees and walls -- with ease. Since the spider doesn’t spin webs, this is a huge help in enabling the spider to climb., The yellow sac spider is a relatively small and slight spider. While females are somewhat larger, large spiders will only measure .4 inches (10 mm) in length (without their legs)., The yellow sac spider’s eight eyes are mostly equal in size and are arranged in two even lines. While the eyes are mostly black, the two middle ones might appear silver or gray.

Their head and eyes may be covered with tiny black or silver hairs., Most yellow sac spiders are pale yellow or tan. However, some of them range from a light green, to orange, to a light brown. This is largely dictated by the spider’s habitat and diet. As a result, be aware that the spider’s color may vary based on the region you live in., The heart mark is named so because it crosses over the area where the spider’s heart is located., They use the sacs to sleep in during the day. They tend to spin these sacs around dawn. Ultimately, the spider’s sleep-sac is one of its most characteristic qualities.

Yellow sac spiders don’t spin webs, they create sleep sacs., When outside, you’ll find sacs under sticks, logs, in rolled up leaves, or in any other area where the spider feels like it will be secure and out-of-the-way.

You may run into sleep-sacs when you’re gardening, racking leaves, or cutting hedges., Yellow sac spiders tend to create their sacs where interior walls meet the ceiling, behind pictures, or around windows. These are out-of-the-way places where they won’t be disturbed in the daytime., Yellow sac spiders are nocturnal. As a result, you can spot them hunting their prey at night time. They feed on flies and other small insects. As a result, you may be able to observe the spider hunting in an area where there are many flies or similar-sized insects., In the outdoors, yellow sac spiders are commonly found on the margins of open spaces like fields, meadows, or even parking lots. They can be found in bushy trees and large shrubs., Depending on your region, yellow sac spiders can commonly be spotted outside from April to October - warmer months when eggs hatch and young spiders mature., As the weather turns, yellow sac spiders tend to migrate into cars, buildings, dead trees, and other structures. There, they create sacs to in which they stay during the winter. They’ll emerge fully mature in the spring."

Determine if you've got a brown recluse on your hands.,
See if it's a black widow.,
Find out if it's a hobo spider.,
Rest assured that most spiders aren't dangerous.",How to Identify Spiders1," When it comes to spider identification, the first one you'll want to rule out (if you live in North America) is the brown recluse. This is the most dangerous spider in the US, and is found most often in the Southeast and Midwest.A brown recluse bite can cause infection, and medical attention is usually necessary. Here's how to know if the spider is a recluse:


Look for the tell-tale violin shape on its back. The brown recluse has a medium brown body and legs, with a slightly darker brown violin shape on the back.
Count the eyes; if there are six, it might be a recluse. The recluse's eyes are arranged in pairs, with one pair in front and a pair on either side.Analyze where you found the spider; if it's in a warm, dry place, like a shed or woodpile, it might be a recluse.
The brown recluse is known to be aggressive, rather than hanging back when it encounters someone.;
, Black widows are common in the Southern and Western states in the US. When they bite, they release a neurotoxin that causes pain and other severe effects, especially in children and the elderly.Here's what to look for:


These aptly-named spiders are a striking shiny black color, with a bright red hourglass shape on the abdomen.
Black widows commonly dwell in woodpiles and under eaves.
They have long legs that taper into points.

, This is the third major venomous spider in the US. It's commonly seen in the Pacific Northwest. It is not quite as dangerous as a brown recluse or black widow, but medical attention is still necessary when a bite occurs.


Hobo spiders are brown with chevron-shaped yellow markings.They make their webs in cracks, corners and holes, and can be found in woodpiles and other sheltered places.

, All spiders have a small amount of venom, but many spiders that look decidedly creepy won't actually cause a dangerous reaction when they bite. If you’re in North America and the spider you see can't clearly be identified as a brown recluse, black widow, or hobo spider, it probably won't cause you any harm.


In fact, having some spiders around is beneficial to the environment; they keep insect populations down so you don't have to use pesticides.
If you live outside of North America, consult one of several widely available guides to learn about the dangerous spiders in your locale."

Notice the spider's coloring.,
Look at the shape of the legs.,
Examine the eyes.,
Take a picture of the spider if you can.,
Assess the spider's behavior.,
Do research to figure out what species it is.",How to Identify Spiders2," Take note of the spider's primary color - usually a shade of brown (like the mouse spider), black (like the cobweb spider), or grey. Also look for color variations (as with the jumping spider), subtle or not so subtle, that will give you a clue as to what type of spider you're looking at.


Does the spider have spots, or coloration in a striking shape like the brown widow’s hourglass marking or the brown recluse's classic violin?
Are the legs the same color as the body?
Note that many species of spider have similar coloring, so looking at this characteristic alone won't be enough to give you a definitive answer.

, If possible, examine the spider’s eight legs a bit more closely. Look at the size of the legs in proportion to the body. Some spiders have long, thin legs (like the yellow sac), while others have stocky, thick legs (like the wolf spider). Some spiders (such as the lynx spider) have tiny hairs on their legs, while others have spikes (such as the funnel spider) or fur.

, The number and location of eyes varies widely among different spider species.If you can, get close enough to look at the spider's eye size, count and arrangement. It’s often easiest to take a picture of the spider, then zoom in to see the eye count and pattern.


While the spitting spider is one of the exceptions, most spiders have eight eyes, sometimes equal in size (like the nursery web spider), but other times with two (like the portia) or four of the eight much more prominent; the eyes can also be arranged in many different patterns.

, If you're insistent on figuring out exactly what species of spider you've spotted, take a picture of it. If possible, try to capture a picture of the spider's underside as well as the top. Since so many spiders look alike, it's impossible to know for sure what you're seeing until you compare the spider's image to those of other spiders that have been definitively classified by scientists.

, Some spiders are aggressive (like the Brazilian wanderer), and will start moving toward you when they notice your presence. Others hide (like the crab spider), and still others stay put instead of moving. Pay attention to any other behaviors you notice that could help you figure out what type of spider it is., If you have a moment after taking note of the spider's appearance and habits, you can use the World Spider Catalog,the online Journal of Arachnology,and other resources put together by experts to look up the spider and compare it to pictures of different species.

Make sure it's really a spider.,
Know what species are common in your region.,
Look at the spider's habitat.",How to Identify Spiders3," A lot of people think spiders are insects, but they're actually very different. To make sure the creature you've encountered is actually a spider, look for the following qualities:


Two body segments. Unlike insects, which have three body segments, spiders only have two.
Eight legs. Don't mistake an insect's antennae for legs.
No wings. No species of spider has wings. No matter how spider-like the creature may otherwise appear, if it has wings, it's not a spider.

, If you live in New York City, you probably won’t encounter the fearsome banana spider (although it's certainly not impossible). Familiarizing yourself with the species that live in your area is a good way to narrow down the possibilities when it comes to identifying spiders.


There are many excellent resources you can use to learn more about spiders. Check out a book from your library or look at spider databases online. You can search according to region., You can learn a lot from the place where you encountered the spider, as well as the web or burrow in which you found it. Answer the following questions regarding the spider’s habitat:


Where did you find the spider? Was it in the bathroom, the basement, the shed, outside, etc.? Was it in a dark place (as preferred by the baboon spider), or a place with plenty of light? Was it a wet place (or even in the water, like the water spider) or a dry one?
What type of web does the spider have? Is it a classic-looking spider web, a tunnel web (as made by the purse spider), or just a few strands of webbing that aren't neatly woven?

Look for a Wolf spider's physical features.,
Look at the arrangement of their eight eyes.,
See if the spider has three tarsal claws to make sure it’s a Wolf spider.,
Don’t confuse the Wolf spider with a Brown Recluse spider.,
Check for hairs covering its abdomen.This is why you may confuse the Wolf spider with a Tarantula, but most Wolf spiders are a great deal smaller than most Tarantulas.

",How to Identify a Wolf Spider1," Here are some key characteristics: Hairy, brown to gray in color with various markings or lines, females are 1-3/8” (3 4mm) and males are 3/4"" (19 mm) long.;
, Their eyes comprise three rows; the first row has four small eyes; the second row has two larger eyes and the third row has two medium-sized eyes. The two eyes in the center of their faces are distinctively larger than the other six eyes.

, A tarsal is the final segment of an insect's leg.In the Wolf Spider's case there are three claws at the end of them.

, The Wolf spider has the same brownish-grey coloration, but does not have the violin-shaped marking behind its head that a Brown Recluse has. Also, the Wolf spider has shorter legs than the Brown Recluse or any other web dwelling spider.

Get a good look if you can.,
Pay attention to the coloration.,

Gauge its size.",How to Identify Spider Egg Sacs," To determine if what you are looking at is a spider egg sac, consider the shape and texture. Spiders create egg sacs out of silk webbing, so the shape and texture may vary depending on the type of spider that created it. Some common spider egg sacs shapes include:round ball
a disc with a rounded part in the middle
squishy pillow
fluffy mass of silk
a ball with tiny spikes all over it;
, Spider egg sacs are small. They are often smaller than a quarter. Observe the size of the sac (or sacs) to determine if it might have been made by a spider.For example, if you find something that is the size of a soccer ball, then this is not likely to be a spider egg sac. However, if you find something the size of a dime, then there is a good chance that it is a spider egg sac.
A spider egg sac will be about as big as the spider that made it.For example, if you have spiders in your area that are about the size of golf balls, then the spider egg sacs may be about the same size.
Keep in mind that some spiders make just one egg sac, while others make a several small ones.

, Most spiders create egg sacs that are white or off-white. However, this is not true of all egg sacs. Some eggs sacs are brown, yellow, or even yellowish green.Observe the color to determine if what you are looking at might be a spider egg sac. For example, if the color of the sac is pink or black, then it is probably not a spider egg sac.

, While some spiders carry their egg sacs around with them, most spiders leave their egg sacs suspended in a web.If you have spotted something that you think might be a spider egg sac, check to see if it is suspended in a web or attached to a wall or other surface with some silk webbing.


Some species of spider lay their eggs in sacs that are on the ground, so there might not always be visible webbing.

, The presence of baby spiders can also indicate that you have found an egg sac. Female spiders can lay hundreds of eggs in an egg sac, and when the eggs hatch, lots of tiny spiders may start crawling out of the sac.If you see any small, pale colored spiders crawling around what you think might be an egg sac, then it probably is one.

, Different kinds of spiders weave different kinds of webs.Observing the web will not be possible in all cases, as not all spiders leave their egg sacs in their webs. However, if you can’t tell what kind of spider you’re dealing with just by looking at the egg sac, then it is a good idea to check out the web. Common spider web patterns include:Orbs. Circular patterned webs.
Cobwebs or tangle. Messy looking fluffy webs that often appear in the corners of ceilings.
Funnels. Webs in the shape of a tunnel that are located in low-traffic areas.
Sheet webs. Flat sheet-like or bowl shaped webs.
Wooly webs. Slightly sticky webs with an indistinct shape.

, Spiders make their homes in all sorts of places. You might find a web in a hole in a brick wall, the corner of a room, a tree, or a pile of dead leaves.Considering the location of a web will help you narrow down the possibilities for what type of spider’s eggs you are looking at.For example, tarantulas often live in burrows in the ground with a thin web covering the opening, disc web spiders often make their small grey webs on tree bark and brick walls, and comb footed spiders often make their webs in houseplants., Because many types of spider egg sacs look similar, it can be difficult to identify one without seeing the spider that left it. Some spiders lay their eggs and then depart, in which case you won’t see them around, but a number of them will stay close and protect the eggs until they hatch.If you do find the spider that made the egg sac you are trying to identify, getting a good look at the spider is your best chance at getting an accurate identification., Spiders come in many different colors and patterns. Some, like the distinctive Black and Yellow Garden Spider, are immediately recognizable, while others are more common looking.


Try to notice the details. For example, if the spider is brown, what shade of brown is it? Does it have any other markings? Is it the same shade of brown over her entire body?

, All spiders are covered with small hairs, but this is not always noticeable. If you do see hairs on a spider, try to think of how you would describe them.


For example, does this spider have hairs that are visible from a distance, like the Bold Jumping Spider, or are the hairs practically invisible even up close, like the hairs on a Brown Recluse?

, Many people are afraid of spiders, so it can be easy to mentally exaggerate how large one is. However, getting an accurate way to describe the size of the spider may make it easier for you to identify it.Try to be objective. Is the spider the size of a pencil eraser? A quarter? A golf ball? Your fist?
Most species of spiders have an average size range in inches or centimeters. Try to estimate its size in inches or centimeters to help you as you try to identify it.

The stingers and claws can be reddish., Emperor scorpions are relatively large in size, often approximately 8 inches (20 cm) long. This is about the size of an adult’s hand., The two pedipalps (pincers or claws) of Emperor scorpions appear quite large. The scorpions will have six smaller legs behind these. Like other scorpions, the Emperor species has a long tail (telson) that ends in a stinger.Emperor scorpions have larger pectines (sensory organs) behind their limbs, which look like combs. These are larger in males than in females.Emperor scorpions will molt frequently, which may change their body features or coloring slightly. After molting, their exoskeleton is very soft and can be easily damaged.

, If you hold or pick up an Emperor scorpion, you may be surprised at its heft. Adults can weigh around an ounce (30 g).Don’t handle a scorpion unless you know that it is a relatively safe species. Even species kept as pets, like Emperor scorpions, can become aggressive when threatened or handled.

, Like other scorpions, the Emperor species glows a fluorescent blue-green when seen in UV light. While this will not help you definitively identify a particular scorpion as an Emperor, it can help you distinguish it from pseudo-scorpions like whip scorpions and other species."

Instead, they crush food with their claws., If you are observing a scorpion in the wild, you may be able to narrow down its species by considering its habitat. Emperor scorpions are native to West Africa (in areas like Nigeria, Togo, Sierra Leone, Ghana and the Congo region). They prefer hot and humid forests, and like to be near leaf debris, bark, and termite mounds.In the wild or in captivity, Emperor scorpions may live communally in small groups.

, Emperor scorpions are basically nocturnal creatures, and will be more active at night. They will move about on the ground, but will sometimes burrow under rocks and logs., Despite their fearsome appearance, Emperor scorpions are quite timid.
