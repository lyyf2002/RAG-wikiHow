Avoid loud noises.,
Don’t make sudden movements.,
Use behavior modification exercises to make the cat feel safe.,
Try not to stare into their eyes.,
Make yourself appear less intimidating.,
Offer rewards.",How to Not Scare a Cat1," Cats are frightened by loud noises such as thunderstorms, the vacuum cleaner, hair dryers, power tools and loud voices. When possible, avoid causing a lot of noise or disruptions that will frighten the cat.


For example, have a friend or family member vacuum in a neighboring room while petting the cat. Over time, you can open the door or bring the vacuum cleaner closer to help desensitize the cat and ease their fears.;
, Avoid quick movements such as uncrossing your legs, standing up, or reaching towards them. The cat may interpret these as attempts to interact with them, which cats don’t always enjoy. Make your movements as slow and deliberate as possible until you can ease your cat into feeling comfortable with these behaviors., Find a movement that usually startles the cat, and act it out at a starting speed with which the feline is comfortable. Each time you make this move, reward the cat with a treat when he or she does not react with fear. Up the intensity or speed, rewarding the cat each time they remain calm.


If you notice anxiety, simply reduce the intensity until he or she is no longer afraid.
Repeat until the feline becomes acclimated to your movements.

, Cats use eye contact as a form of dominance, so sustained eye contact can be seen as an act of aggression. If you don’t know a cat well, it’s best to avoid staring or it could make the cat nervous.Instead, try looking at the cat and blinking slowly to win them over.You can tell that a cat is fearful because they will get a “mad look” in their eyes which is caused by dilating pupils.The cat may also wiggle their back legs in preparation to launch. It is best to avert your gaze and to give the cat some space if you see any of these behaviors.

, If the cat appears fearful, try squatting or sitting down so you seem smaller, and less threatening. Allow the cat to approach you instead of attempting to encroach on the animal’s space., Try offering the cat a small reward to win him or her over. Try shaking his or her food bag, opening a can of food, or tapping their dish on the floor. This may coax him or her out for long enough to make them feel comfortable. Even if they remain at a distance, you’re still making progress.Food is often a great motivator for felines, so always give feeding duty to the person who most intimidates the cat."

, If your cat is afraid, it will hide for it's safety in a place where the other animal can't get to them., If your cat is spitting, hissing, growling, swatting, biting, scratching, puffing up its fur, arching its back, swishing its tail, or flattening its ears at something, you must understand that these are signs that your cat is highly afraid of the animal/object that it does not like., If your cat is looking at something (for example, another cat) it may not hiss, it may just stare until the other cat leaves., Humans and cats are different in lots of ways, humans aren't scared of toilet! But if your cat needs to go and puts its waste somewhere else, and refuses the litter tray, it could be scared unless your cat already releases its waste outside and buries it in the ground., Cats and kittens are scared of quick moving things no matter who or what you are., Cats have extremely sensitive ears. If something comes banging towards it, the cat will usually run away from it in fear., If your cat is in an environment that does not seem like its home, it can become afraid and wary very quickly., If you're one of those children who just loves chasing around your kitten/cat that isn't very human friendly, it could get scared as soon as you take a step or two towards it., If your cat is stressed in a situation such as going to the vet or moving, the cat can become fearful., When you are with your cat try to avoid being loud/angry because this will make them feel bad like they've been punished., Its unnerving for a human to approach a cat and grab it's head, rather than just stroke it. The reaction could be a struggle or a swipe with it's claw or a recoil., If the cat's litterbox isn't cleaned at least once a week your cat will get highly irritated., If your cat becomes unsettled and you haven't got a clue why, try checking where you've put the litterbox, and relocate it to somewhere more preferred., Cats will not appreciate you leaving them alone for a number of days. If you're unlucky, next thing you know you'll never see them again! So if you're going on holiday, make sure you get a carer., It's so tempting to see your kitten being cute and watching it bite your finger a little, isn't it?

Avoid putting the cat in a strange environment.,
Calm the cat during stressful events.,
Provide in-home cat furniture.,
Try spraying pet pheromones.",How to Not Scare a Cat2," When possible, try not to bring strange animals or people into the environment in which the cat is accustomed.If you are assisting a cat with getting used to a new home, allow a few weeks for them to adapt to their new environment. Let them get used to you as the provider of food, shelter, and love.Keep the cat totally indoors for at least a month. Make sure doors and windows are kept closed and that screens are secure.

, Certain events, such as traveling in a carrier or a trip to the vet, can be stressful for cats.Try to calm the animal by speaking in soft, soothing tones (while avoiding whispers), rewarding good behavior, and avoiding harsh tones and punishments.When transporting a cat, opt for a top-loading carrier to make handling easier. In addition, this allows the cat to remain in the carrier during vet visits.
Prepare the carrier at home by allowing the cat to get used to it days in advance. Make it comfortable by filling it with treats, blankets, or toys that will ease the feline’s anxiety.

, Make the feline feel comfortable by filling their environment with cat furniture such as cat trees, shelves, perches, or cat beds placed on top of furniture. Often times, cats are more comfortable observing visitors from elevated landings., Local pet stores sell sprays which mimic the natural odor of cats. This can act as a soothing mechanism for a frightened cat. While you won’t be able to smell it, the cat will, and it can help to reduce fear and anxiety."

Let them have fun with clicker training.,
Shower them with catnip.,
Play with them.,
Pet the cat often.",How to Not Scare a Cat3," Not only do cats enjoy clicker training but it also reinforces wanted behaviors. The cat becomes trained to associate the click with a positive reward, and begins to reduce their fearful behaviors through positive reinforcement.Not only does the animal enjoy it, but they see the treat as a sign of love and affection.


Choose a reward that your cat will want such as fishy treats, smoked turkey cold cuts, or a toy the cat really enjoys. Reserve this incentive only for the clicker training.
Charge the clicker by showing the cat that they will receive a treat each time they hear the click.
Each time the animal displays wanted behaviors, reward them with a click and a treat. Over time, their fear will lessen as they assimilate to new environments and people, because they know they will be rewarded.
Clickers can be purchased at your local pet store.

, Catnip is a mint plant that releases a strong odor into the air when rolled or bitten. The plant is harmless to cats but gives them an enjoyable “high.” Try bribing a frightened kitty with catnap so they begin to associate you with fun instead of fear., Cats love to play, and interactive games have been known to decrease anxiety in cats. Try toys that involve human interaction such as fishing lures or feathers wands. In addition, there are also puzzle toys which allow the cat to use their brains, teeth, and noses to search out the hidden treat inside.All cats are different so find a game that your cat will enjoy.

, If a cat is comfortable enough to approach you, stay in their good graces by stroking them. Allow the animal to make contact first, and then start by rubbing their shoulders. Stroke down the animal's back in slow-motion, paying close attention to their response.Avoid making contact with their face first as this could be seen as a sign of aggression.
This method is only useful for cats who are becoming comfortable with people and their environment. This method is a form of reinforcement and should only be used when the cat approaches you first.

Give your cat a safe space to hide during the storm.,
Turn on ‘white noise’ during the storm.,
Play with your cat.,
Keep yourself calm during the storm.,
Discuss medication options with your vet.,
Administer the medication as prescribed.,
Do not give your cat acepromazine.,
Consider non-medicated alternatives.,
Do not give your cat excessive attention.,
Distract your cat during the thunderstorm.,
Desensitize your cat to the noise of a thunderstorm.,
Observing hiding behavior.,
Determine whether your cat has a thunderstorm phobia.,
Take your cat to your vet.",How to Treat Thunderstorm Anxiety in Cats," Providing a safe hiding place is probably one of the best treatment strategies for thunderstorm anxiety in cats.Ideal hiding places are dark and quiet, such as a basement, closet, or bathroom. Put your cat’s ‘creature comforts’ (e.g., food and water bowls, favorite toys, blanket) in the area to make it more comfortable.If your cat already has a usual hiding spot, such as under a bed, put its creature comforts in that area.
If the hiding space has windows, close the curtains or blinds to block the sight of the storm.Do not disturb your cat when it goes to its hiding place. Let your cat come out when it’s ready.;
, If thunderstorm noises make your cat anxious, turn on some background noise, such as the television or radio, that will serve as a distraction from the storm.If you turn on the radio, pick a station playing soothing music (smooth jazz or classical) or a talk radio station. A television news station could help your cat tune out the thunderstorm noise.


Do not crank up the volume of the white noise. Doing so could increase your cat's stress and anxiety.
Play the white noise before the storm comes so your cat can get comfortable with it.

, On the day of a storm, schedule some additional play time with your cat. The extra exercise will make your cat physically and mentally tired, which will help it remain more calm when the storm comes.Have your cat chase a laser light across the floor and play jumping games.

, Your cat will be able to sense your emotions before and during the storm. If you’re anxious, your cat will be too. Do activities, such as quietly reading or watching TV, that show calmness during the storm., Anxiety-reducing drugs, called anxiolytics, are commonly used to treat thunderstorm anxiety in cats. Long-acting anxiolytics, such as Clomicalm® (clomipramine) and Reconcile® (fluoxetine), should be given throughout storm season. Quick-acting anxiolytics, including Valium® (diazepam) and Xanax® (alprazolam), are useful when given for an individual storm event. As your cat’s anxiety reduces, your vet may taper the medication dosage, or completely discontinue the medication.Sometimes, different types of drugs can interact with each other and cause side effects.Your vet will check your cat’s current medications, if any, to make sure the anxiolytic will not interact with them.

, If your cat needs a quick-acting anxiolytic, your vet will want you to administer it before your cat starts showing behavioral signs of thunderstorm anxiety. For example, if you know in the morning that a thunderstorm is coming later in the day, start administering the medication in the morning. Long-acting anxiolytics are usually given daily.Your vet will give you specific administration instructions, depending on which medication(s) your cat needs.

, Acepromazine is a drug used for sedation. Although it has been commonly given to pets to relieve thunderstorm and fireworks anxiety, it doesn’t actually lessen the anxiety. It only lessens the ability for a pet to move or show the outward signs of anxiety. In other words, acepromazine works like a ‘chemical straitjacket’ that prevents the appearance of anxiety.If your vet recommends acepromazine for your cat, express your concerns about the use of this drug and ask about other anxiety-reducing medications.

, If you do not want to give your cat medications, consider other therapies. For example, a product called Rescue Remedy is a spray made up of flower essences. It can produce a sense of calm. In addition, you could use the cat pheromone product Feliway® to give your cat something familiar and calming to smell. Melatonin can also help relieve thunderstorm anxiety.Pheromones are chemicals secreted by the body. Your cat will rub its cheek on furniture to deposit pheromones to mark its territory. Discuss these alternative therapies with your vet before using them.

, If your cat gets really anxious during thunderstorms, your first instinct may be to hold it close and coddle it. However, this is a not a good idea. The extra comforting reinforces the idea that a thunderstorm is scary.Avoiding punishing your cat. Punishment could increase its fear even more., Get your cat do something fun and pleasurable during the thunderstorm. Called ‘counterconditioning,’ this will help your cat make a positive association with the storm, rather than feel anxious. During the storm, teach your cat to do tricks, like sitting or rolling over, and reward it with a delicious treat. Since stress can decrease appetite, consider keeping your cat a little hungry so it will be more likely to eat the treats during the storm.Tuna is a great treat for cats.
The goal of counterconditioning is to have your cat focus on an activity that’s incompatible with being anxious or fearful.

, This behavioral technique involves playing a recording of storm noises to your cat at increasingly louder volumes until it remains calm when the noise is played. This technique, which is tedious, usually works better with dogs than cats.Speak with your vet before attempting desensitization with your cat.

, A cat’s first instinct during a thunderstorm is to hide. Your cat may dash under a piece of furniture or try to hide in of your kitchen cabinets. This hiding behavior, known as avoidance, usually works quite well for cats when they are afraid of a thunderstorm. When the storm ends, your cat will emerge from its hiding place., Fear is a normal reaction to a fear-inducing event, like a thunderstorm. A phobia, on the other hand, is an extreme, irrational fear of something. If your cat has a thunderstorm phobia, rather than just normal fear, it may demonstrate some of the following behaviors:Large pupils
Fur standing up on end
Tense and ‘hunkered down’ body posture
Hissing, spitting

, Whether your cat’s thunderstorm anxiety is mild or exaggerated, a veterinary examination can help determine the most effective way to treat the anxiety. For example, your cat may have an underlying health condition that's increasing its stress and anxiety.Treating that condition, along with using other anxiety-reducing strategies, could help decrease your cat's thunderstorm anxiety.


Your vet will physically examine your cat and ask you questions about the thunderstorm anxiety. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for your vet to devise an effective treatment plan.

Don’t interact with your cat as you leave.",How to Treat Separation Anxiety in Cats," Cats with separation anxiety will act out in various ways, including defecating outside of the litter box, spraying urine on the furniture, and grooming excessively. These actions could indicate separation anxiety, or indicate a medical problem. If your cat is showing these symptoms, take it to your vet for an examination.It is important to rule out health problems before treating a cat for separation anxiety. Possible health problems include:Urinary tract infection
Intestinal disease
Hormonal disorders, such as hyperthyroidism
Skin disease (mites, fleas);
, After you tell your vet about your cat’s symptoms, allow your vet to perform a physical examination and other diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests, such as blood work, urinalysis, and skin scrapes (thin scraping of the skin with a scalpel blade) will help your vet determine if your cat has a health problem. If an illness is present, your vet will prescribe the appropriate treatment.


Treating the illness should resolve the symptoms.
If your cat is healthy, separation anxiety is the likely cause of the symptoms.

, If your cat has separation anxiety, you and your vet can discuss ways to help your cat feel less anxious. Treatment for separation anxiety typically involves environmental enrichment and, if necessary, medication to relieve anxiety. Your vet will likely advise you to try environmental enrichment first before putting your cat on medication.


Environmental enrichment is a way to make a pet’s environment more interesting and enjoyable.

, If your cat has separation anxiety, you can lessen its anxiety by enriching its environment. With plenty of things to do and focus on, your cat won’t feel so distressed when you’re not around. A window perch will let your cat look outside.If you have a front or back porch, consider placing a bird feeder on the porch where your cat could see it.Perches are available at your local pet store.
Consider moving the perch to different windows so your cat can experience different outdoor views.

, Scratching posts benefit cats in several ways. They allow cats to stretch their muscles, mark their territory, and simply do something fun.Putting several scratching posts throughout your home will give your cat a great way to keep itself entertained while you’re away.


Pick a vertical scratching post that’s about 2 feet tall. Horizontal scratching posts are available, but cats tend to prefer scratching on a vertical post.Place the post in an area where your cat spends a lot of time, such as its bed or a window perch., The more toys your cat has to play with, the better! They will keep your cat physically and mentally busy, which will lessen the separation anxiety. Rotate the toys regularly so your cat doesn’t get bored with the same set of toys. One great toy for cats is a food dispenser toy.Other great toys for cats include:Toys that make noise or vibrate
Ping pong balls
Old cotton socks stuffed with cotton balls or some catnip (make a knot at the open end of the sock)
Crumpled up paper balls

, Before you leave home, take a few of your cat’s treats and hide them in different places (e.g., under a piece of furniture, in the corner of a room).Your cat will have fun using her nose to find the food, rather than going straight to her food bowl. Place the treats in different places each day so your cat has a new daily challenge to find the treats.


Because treats can be high in fat and cause weight gain, consider hiding small amounts of your cat’s regular food instead.
At the end of the day, pick up any food your cat didn't find.
You could also put your cat’s daily food ration in a puzzle feeder., A silent home may worsen your cat’s separation anxiety when you’re not home. The sound of a radio or TV could put your cat at ease.Put the radio on a station that plays soothing music, such as a jazz or classical music station.


Find a TV station that plays nature shows. This would give your cat a chance to watch something interesting on the TV screen.
DVDs are available that are created specifically for cats.Play these DVDs for your cat.

, Animals produce substances called pheromones. They release the pheromones to communicate with each other and affect the behavior of other animals. Synthetic cat pheromone products, such as Feliway®, help cats feel less anxious in their environment.Spray Feliway® in your home to help relieve your cat’s separation anxiety.Follow product label instructions when using Feliway®.

, Spending quality time with your cat is an important part of treating separation anxiety. Playing with your cat, especially before you leave home, will tire out your cat and leave it feeling comfortable and satisfied.Having multiple play sessions with your cat each day will give it plenty of time to interact with you and get some much needed physical and mental exercise.


Play with your cat for least 10 minutes per day.With multiple play sessions, you will likely play with your cat for more than 10 minutes each day.

, Your cat will enjoy playing with interactive toys. Wands or plastic sticks with toys (e.g., little toy mouse) attached to the end are great interactive toys for cats.Laser toys are also good for playtime. Move the laser beam around on the floor and watch your cat try to ‘catch’ the beam.


Make sure you don’t flash the laser directly in your cat’s eyes.

, Surprisingly, cats are quite good at learning tricks. Teaching your cat tricks will help keep it physically and mentally active. Keep the training sessions short (about 5 minutes).When your cat masters the new trick, reward it with a scrumptious treat, like tuna.



Rolling over is a fun trick to teach your cat.

, A cat that gets rewarded for needy behavior, such as following its owner all the time, is likely to develop separation anxiety when its owner isn't home. If your cat has separation anxiety, reward it when it’s showing independent behavior, like lying quietly on a perch or entertaining itself with its toys. By rewarding independence, your cat will feel motivated to be independent, rather than clingy.When your cat is more independent, it won’t be so anxious when you leave.

, Your cat probably becomes anxious when you start getting ready to leave (e.g., picking up your keys, putting on your coat). To make your cat feel less anxious, it will need to see your departure routine as no big deal. To do this, repeat the departure activities numerous times without actually leaving. Here are some examples:Pick up your keys and set them back down
Open and close the door
Walk out of the door and come back in, gradually increasing the amount of time you stay outside
Eventually, your cat will see those activities as normal and not react with anxiety.

, Giving your cat extra attention and love when you leave will only worsen its separation anxiety—you’re actually telling your cat that your departure is a big deal. Instead, leave your home without speaking to your cat. When you come back home, wait a few minutes before interacting with your cat."

Talk with your vet.,
Expose your cat to movement early on.,
Move slowly.,
Engage your cat in play with toys.,
Invite friends and family over.,
Offer rewards.,
Desensitize with repeated movements.",How to Train a Cat to Stop Fearing Sudden Movements1," Before you begin any serious attempts to modify your cat’s behavior, make an appointment with the vet to eliminate any possible bodily causes. Your vet will ask you about your cat’s history and may request some blood tests as well. If your cat has only recently started to exhibit more fear, it is possible that there is a physical explanation, such as thyroid disease.Your vet may recommend placing your cat on some anti-anxiety medication. If this is the case, be sure to go over dosage instructions and any warnings.;
, If you have a kitten that is younger than 14 weeks of age, then you can still work on exposing and acclimating them to movement as part of their development process. This is a formative period where even small efforts on your part can reap large behavioral rewards.For example, hold your kitten securely in your hands and step outside to show them movement in nature.

, As you are walking around your house, try to keep your actions measured and controlled. This will build trust with your cat and they will feel comfortable relaxing around you. If they are less stressed overall, then they are less likely to overreact if you do make an unexpected sudden movement., Get a number of bouncy balls, feather strings, and other toys designed to entice your cat. Play with your cat multiple times throughout the day. Start by making slow movements with the toys and then increase speed and unpredictability as your cat gets more comfortable.As your cat becomes accustomed to these play sessions, move your body around as well. Walk, or even jump, while drawing designs with a laser pointer on the ground.
Take some time to simply sit quietly with your cat as well. Relaxing together helps to build trust., When you have people over, warn them about your cat’s movement fears. Ask that they just relax for a while after they first arrive in order to let your cat get used to having them around. If your friends are willing to sit on the floor, then this can give your cat a chance to approach them safely. You can also give your guests some cat toys and treats to offer, so that your cat associates their visits with positive benefits.Make sure to supervise all of your cat’s encounters with other people. This will allow you to intervene in a negative situation, such as if your cat begins to swipe at your guests out of fear., If your cat stays in a room during a busy period, such as when you have guests over, make sure to give them a few treats throughout the visit. You can also make a habit of using treats to lure your cat onto higher ground, such as their cat tree, if you know that sudden movements might occur. Pay attention to your cat’s body language to know when a treat might be most welcomed., Choose a certain type of movement, such as getting up from the couch, and gradually increase the speed and/or repetition of this action over a period of days. Start by standing up from the couch very slowly and then add speed until you are moving fast. Your cat will recognize the movement and will become increasingly comfortable with the speed of the action, too.You can also use this approach when completing everyday household tasks. For example, vacuum slowly and then build up speed.

Follow a clear schedule.,
Remove any extra clutter.,
Leave doorways open.,
Provide a safe space.,
Add relaxing scents.",How to Train a Cat to Stop Fearing Sudden Movements2," Feed your cat at the same times every day. Change the litter box every day or every other day consistently. Designated a few times during the day as ‘play periods,’ such as from 1-2 in the afternoon. Your cat is less likely to give in to their fears if they know what to expect from you and your movements., Many cats like to play with small items in the house, but your cat may see these items as blocking their exit from the room or as triggers for their anxiety. Picking up children’s toys off the ground and keeping them in a designated area will make it less likely that you will run into them and then scare your cat.

Keeping the floors of your rooms more bare will also make it possible for your cat to see what, or who, is actually making a sudden movement or causing a noise. Having this knowledge may lessen your cat’s anxieties.

, This gives your cat the option to exit a situation that they are not comfortable with. Then, they can reenter a room when they are calm and ready. When a cat is trapped in a room, their anxiety levels skyrocket and it is hard to determine whether they are simply scared of movement or fearful due to the inability to exit., Choose one spot in your household that belongs to your cat and your cat alone. Place your cat’s bedding and food and water bowls in this area. Keep a few toys in this space as well. Try to limit visitors into this room.If you place a kitty cave or other hiding options in this area, your cat will likely go here if they are afraid or anxious, making it easier to check on them.

, You can purchase a product that emits a pheromone that promotes relaxation in cats when used as a diffuser or spray. Or, you can incorporate the scents of relaxing natural oils into a room, such as lavender.While certain pheromone sprays can go directly onto your cat’s skin, make sure to read the packages carefully and consult with your vet before use. Do not place an essential oil on your cat’s skin without talking to your vet, as certain oils, like lavender, can cause irritation and burning.

View fear as a natural response.,
Get to know your cat’s personality.,
Pay attention to your cat’s body language.,
Identify any specific triggers.",How to Train a Cat to Stop Fearing Sudden Movements3," There is nothing abnormal about your cat being afraid or anxious in certain situations. The problem comes in when these fears take over your cat’s life and make them unable to function as a happy, healthy cat. You’ll want to work with your vet to determine when your cat’s behaviors begin to cross the line into concerning., Not all cats fit well into all households. Try to look objectively at your cat and determine the basics of their personality. If they are naturally shy, then they would probably prefer a calm, quiet living environment. If they are a bit wild, then a busy household will suit them just fine. Your cat may change with age, but many core personality traits will stay put over time.For example, some cats simply do better when dealing with one gender. If your cat only frightens when men or boys make sudden movements, then you may want to work on that part of the issue, too.

, Your cat may be sending out many warning signals before they finally go ‘over the edge’ with fear. Look to see if your cat’s ears are horizontal or twitching, which indicates nervousness. Your cat may also crawl close to the ground or walk with their tail low to the ground or moving rapidly.Knowing how to read your cat’s body will make it possible for you to understand when you’ve successfully helped them to calm down or cope with their fears through training. The more subtle cues of fear or anxiety, such as the dilation of pupils, may disappear.
Watching for their cues will also let you rescue them from situations that turn stressful. For example, your cat may be fine sitting next to a small child, but your cat’s ears might flatten when the child starts to run around., Does your cat respond negatively to all sudden movements or just certain types? For two weeks, keep a set of notes detailing the specific circumstances that led to moments of stress or fear for your cat. Then, look over your list to see if any patterns are present.For example, your cat may only fear sudden movements from a particular person or group of people, such as children.

Watch for decreased movement.,
Note a refusal to eat.Is your tarantula eating?,
Check for clear fluid droplets.,
Look for thinning hair or a bald spot.,
Check what position your tarantula is in.,
Leave your tarantula be.,
Remove the exoskeleton from the cage after your tarantula molts.,
Skip feedings for three to five days after your tarantula has molted.",How to Tell if Your Tarantula Is Molting," Is your spider moving around less than usual? Tarantulas often stop moving or don't move at all to conserve energy before a molt. If your tarantula has not been moving much lately, then this could be a sign that she is about to molt., Before a big molt, tarantulas will stop eating for extended periods of time, ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months. If you have noticed that your tarantula has not been eating or that she has been eating less than usual, then this could indicate that she is going to molt soon.

, Some tarantulas secrete tiny drops of a clear fluid between the joints on their legs, and this can indicate that your tarantula is getting ready to molt. Check to see if you can see these droplets, but keep in mind that not all tarantulas do this before a molt., Some tarantulas will lose hair on their abdomens leading up to a molt. You might notice less hair on your tarantula’s abdomen or even a bald spot on your tarantula’s abdomen.If you see this, then it is a good sign that your tarantula is getting ready to molt.


Your tarantula’s abdomen may also appear darker and shinier than usual before she molts., What position is the spider in? During a molt, a tarantula lays up-side down on her back or on her side to get out of the old skin easier.This happens when a tarantula is actively molting and the whole process takes just a few hours. If your tarantula is on her back or side, then she might be trying to molt her skin.


Spiders curl up their legs tightly underneath them when they die. If your tarantula is on her stomach and has curled her legs tightly inwards, then she may be dead or dying., Tarantulas can sustain injuries or even die if they are disturbed while they are molting. Therefore, it is important to leave your tarantula alone while she molts.Plan to leave your tarantula while she is showing signs of molting and for at least one week following a molt.


Wait at least one week after a molt to pick up and/or hold your tarantula., After your tarantula has completely shed her exoskeleton, you can remove it from her cage. Try using a pair of tweezers to pick the exoskeleton up., Your tarantula will be sensitive and prone to injury following a molt, which means that its normal prey might harm her. Therefore, do not feed your tarantula for at least a few days following a molt.While your tarantula cannot hunt following a molt, she will still need to drink water. Make sure your tarantula has plenty of fresh water at all times."

Act calmly.,
Press into the bite.,
Shock the cat into releasing its grip.,
Avoid physical punishment.",How to Stop a Fearful Cat from Biting1," Do not respond wildly to a cat that is biting you out of fear. If you act out in shock and pain it is likely that the cat's fear will increase and its biting will increase in response.Instead, take a deep breath and move forward calmly with a plan to get the cat to let go.
It can be hard to not respond strongly to a cat bite that you don't see coming. However, do your best so that the cat's bad behavior can eventually be overcome.;
, Instead of pulling away from the bite, which can make the cat bite down harder, press towards the cat. In many cases this will confuse the animal into releasing its grip.Pressing into the bite is the opposite response that prey in the wild would have to a cat bite. The idea is that this behavior will confuse the cat and encourage them to let go of this odd victim.

, If the cat refuses to release its grip then you can try to shock it into letting go. This can be done most easily by creating a loud noise that surprises the cat. For example, clapping very loudly can sometimes do the trick.You can also throw something across the room that will make a loud noise when it hits the floor. This should surprise the cat and give you a moment to get out of the cat's grip without resorting to force.

, Hitting a cat that has bit you or swatting at it will only serve to increase the cat's fear of you. It will do nothing to decrease future attacks and in fact it may even increase them.The same goes for screaming or yelling at a cat. This will increase the cat's anxiety and fear.

Acclimate the cat to new people slowly.,
Use gentle exposure therapy.,
Consider the use of medication.,
Seek the help of a cat behavior specialist.",How to Stop a Fearful Cat from Biting2," Cats that are fearful need a gradual adjustment period to warm up to new people. In most cases, its best to leave the cat alone, give it some space, and wait until it comes to the person instead of trying to force affection on to it.


The new person should give the cat some space and ignore the cat, but should not leave the room when the cat starts getting upset. This will show the cat that its aggressive actions will not result in the desired outcomes., A cat that is deeply fearful needs a gentle approach to behavioral modification that allows it to very gradually face its fears. Allow the cat to have space and the ability to run away but bring new people and new noises into the house regularly so that the cat can get used to them.This means that you will need to gauge how far away the thing your cat is afraid of can be from the cat without your cat reacting, and then place that thing there repeatedly. For example, if your cat is afraid of loud noises but it does not run away if you make a loud noise in a room the cat is not in, you should do that daily to get the cat used to it.
If the cat does not flee or show signs of fear to the stimuli, whatever it may be, then give it a treat. If the cat does show signs of fear, do not reassure it or give it a treat. Petting a cat that is fearful only reinforces that behavior.

, If your cat's fear response is so bad that it is affecting the cat's quality of life, and your ability to have friends and family in your home, then you may want to turn to medication. Take your cat to see its veterinarian and explain the situation. The veterinarian may be able to prescribe an anti-anxiety medication for the cat.There are a variety of medications that your veterinarian may prescribe, including benzodiazepines (such as diazepam, alprazolam, or clonazepam), tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline, clomipramine, or doxepin), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine)., If your cat is having severe anxiety and is prone to biting due to fear but no other solutions have worked, you may need to contact a behavior specialist. A good behavior specialist should be able to work with you and your cat to find treatment solutions that can decrease the cat's anxiety.Ask your veterinarian for a referral to a good pet behaviorist or look at the website of an accredited organization of animal behaviorists to find one in your area.
There are a wide variety of types of animal behaviorists, from animal trainers to veterinarians who specialize in animal behavior modification.Pick a type of behaviorist based on the severity of your cat's problems and how much money you can spend.

Don't surprise the cat.,
Leave the cat alone.,
Allow the cat to leave the room.",How to Stop a Fearful Cat from Biting3," Many cats that have a strong fear response bite when they are surprised. If you know your cat does this, or you are in a house that you know has a cat that does this, then you should try to avoid surprising the cat. Make noise as you move through the house so that the cat knows you are coming and can flee as you approach.


Also, don't pet the cat if it is sleeping and does not know you are approaching it. This is a great way to get bitten.

, If the cat is about to bite you because it is scared of you, then you should remove yourself from its area. In order to avoid getting bitten you should just leave it alone. Walk away and let the cat calm down on its own.


Trying to win a skittish cat over with attention will only backfire. Cornering a cat that is fearful invites a fear response and will make their anxiety even worse.
While exposure therapy can be used to get a fearful cat used to certain situations, this needs to be done with care and repetition. A one time visit with a scared cat where you will not leave the cat alone will not make the cat's behavior any better., A cat that responds to fear with biting should be allowed to flee situations that it finds stressful or scary. Don't try and keep a cat in an unpleasant situation to try and acclimate the cat to it. This will only heighten the cat's anxiety.Instead, put the cat in a room by itself. Provide food, water, and a litter box. Allow the cat to stay here until it wants to leave on its own.

Expect stress if you have moved recently.,
Think about any changes in the home.,
Take your cat to the vet.,
Reduce the number of cats you own.,
Make sure your cat has enough stimulation.",How to Know if a Kitten Is Stressed," Stress and anxiety in a kitten can lead to digestive issues. Diarrhea and constipation are common reactions to stress. As you clean out the litter box, notice any abnormalities or changes in their habits.They may also start defecating outside of the litter box.;
, Kittens that are stressed may stop eating as much as usual. They may eat less in volume each day, or they may stop eating completely. This can lead to problems since a cat that goes without eating for more than a day can get sick.If you notice your kitten is not eating, take them to the vet as soon as possible.

, Unclean litter boxes can lead to stress for a cat. If the litter box isn’t cleaned regularly and it is dirty, your cat may eliminate outside of it. This may also happen if there are not enough litter boxes or they are placed in high traffic areas.If you have cats that don’t get along or there have been any major changes in the house, your cat may also not use the litter box.

, Cats who are stressed may groom more than is normal. Most cats groom often, but a kitten who is stressed may groom themselves until they have bald spots or sores.Some cats may even experience hair-pulling behaviors.
Your cat may also scratch excessively.
This excessive grooming is usually centered around the abdomen.

, Stressed cats may start acting different than normal. They may isolate themselves more than usual. This means they may start hiding in rooms, running from people or other pets, or finding dark, solitary spaces to spend their time in.If your cat was solitary to begin with, they may start being needy and clingy with you.

, If your cat has started vocalizing excessively, they are probably trying to tell you something. This usually points to stress due to a huge change in the house, like a move, someone leaving or arriving, or another change.Your cat may meow, screech, whine, or make other signs.

, Cats are lazy and like to sleep. However, a stressed kitten may sleep more than is normal. They may sleep most of the day or through an excessive number of hours each day.Think about your cat’s normal sleeping habits. Look for any changes that could indicate something is wrong.

, If your kitten starts acting aggressively or violently towards you, people, or other pets, they may be stressed. This may be irritability or violence towards a person or other animal when bothered., If there are multiple cats in the house, there may be conflicts between the cats causing your kitten stress. If another cat is hostile, this can upset the cat. Notice how the cats in your house interact with your kitten.If there are cats outside, this can upset your cat because they think that a cat is encroaching on their territory.

, Moving to a new location can also cause a lot of stress to your cat. This can be because of a change in location or familiarity. Cats may also not do well if you move and expect them to go outside or inside when they are used to the opposite., Cats may become stressed if the situation in the home has changed. This may include different people moving in or leaving, or getting a new pet. Even something like remodeling your house or playing loud music can cause stress for some cats.New smells, new furniture, or too much activity in the home can also cause stress.

, Many of these symptoms may indicate a problem. Some of the symptoms, like lack of appetite or excessive grooming, can lead to other conditions or problems. If your cat shows signs of stress, you should take them to the vet for an examination.Make sure to tell your vet all the symptoms your cat has, along with any recent changes in your home.

, Having too many cats in your home can cause unnecessary stress to all of them. You should evaluate the number of cats you own and consider reducing that number. Fewer cats in your home may help lower your kitten’s stress.This is particularly important if your cats don’t all get along or you have hostile cats.

, Cats may get stressed if they don’t have their needs met. This includes keeping them busy. You should make sure your cat has the right things in your home to make them feel safe and happy.For example, you want to make sure there are enough food and water bowls and litter boxes for your number of cats.
Provide beds, hiding places, perches, scratching posts, and toys for each cat.
Shoot for around one for each cat. If you want cats to share things, like the litter box, limit it to two cats per litter box.

Understand that fear manifests itself physically in cats.,
Look for dilated pupils.,
Watch out for wet paw prints.,
Feel for an increased heart rate.,
See if the cat lowers her ears.,
Check if the cat’s whiskers are drawn back.,
Watch for movement of the cat’s mouth, lips and nose.",How to Recognize Fear in Cats1," A fearful cat is in a state of physiological arousal. She has adrenaline, the fight-or-flight hormone, racing through her bloodstream. This stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to supply extra blood to her heart and muscles so that she is prepared for action. To spot signs of adrenaline, read the following steps.;
, Cats have slit-like pupils, which become large and round either in the dark (to gather more light) or when a cat is fearful, or aroused. Her pupils become dilated to maximize her vision.


Look at your cat’s eyes; if they look predominantly black, her pupils are dilated.

, The only place cats have sweat glands is on the pads of their feet. Just as we sweat in a tense situation, so do cats. Look for wet paw prints on the floor or table top.If your cat will let you, you can also touch the pads of your cat’s feet to see if they feel wet.

, To supply blood to the muscles in preparation for action (flight or attack) your cat’s heart rate will increase. A normal heart rate is 120 to 140 beats per minute.


A frightened cat's heart rate accelerates to 180 beats per minute or above.

, A fearful cat lowers her ears against her head. As she becomes progressively more alarmed, her ears will flatten right back against her head to keep them out of the way of slashing claws.

, When your cat is afraid, she will flatten her whiskers against her face. If your cat’s whiskers are pressed against your cat’s muzzle, it is very likely that she is frightened.

, While the inner conflict remains mild, the cat's mouth and lips will remain in a neutral position. As the cat’s fear intensifies to the point where action (fleeing or fighting) is increasingly likely, the cat's mouth draws back at the corners to reveal her teeth in a snarl.


As the cat's fear arousal grows she will wrinkle her nose as part of the movement to draw her lips back in a snarl.

Keep the cats inside when the coyotes are most likely to be prowling around your property at night.,
Create an electric fence barrier.,
Create a Coyote Watch newsletter in your neighborhood.,
Love and adore your cat.,
Get your cat spayed or neutered to help curb it's instinct to roam.",How to Protect Your Cats from Coyotes," Never let your cats out after 4:00 PM; this is a safety measure is essential to take in order to completely avoid any coyote attacks.

If you live in the house, letting your beloved kitty outside at all is not recommended.;
, This should be a fence that does not hurt your cat but is positioned outside of a fence that is sufficient to prevent the cat from going outside of the backyard territory. The electric fence is to ward off the coyote should it attempt to come onto the property or area set aside for the cat.

Investigate the possibility of building a cat run and cat outdoor play area that is completely fenced off and cannot be accessed by coyote in any way. It should also be impregnable so that the cat cannot get out of this play area but can only go back inside your house.

, Use this to send out news to people if a coyote is spotted somewhere in the area. When this happens, you can then warn people to keep their animals and small children inside., Play with it often. These things give your cat a reason to stay indoors more often., A cat not driven to seek a mate will more happily stay within known, safe territory."

Be aware that purring can sometimes be a sign of mild fear or pain.,
Listen for hissing as the threat to the cat intensifies.,
Listen for growling and snarling.,
Be prepared for hissing, spitting and lashing out with the paws.",How to Recognize Fear in Cats2," In a situation where a cat feels mildly threatened, she may become silent or begin to make a deep purring sounds. This may sound counter-intuitive, but some cats do purr when they are in pain or are scared in order to comfort themselves.It is thought that purring releases chemicals called endorphins, which have a comforting effect.

, As the threat intensifies, such as when a cat is confronted with an approaching dog, the cat will begin to hiss.


The cat will open her mouth and release a hissing noise that sounds almost like she is trying to get something out of the back of her throat.

, If the hiss does not put off whatever is making the cat uncomfortable, then the fearful cat will emit a series of long, slow exhalations to make a growling sound.


This is accompanied by snarls, which involve the cat retracting her lips to fully show her powerful canine teeth.

, The previous displays are designed as ""distancing signals"". The intention of these signals is to notify the aggressor that the cat is not happy, and is preparing to defend herself. If the thing that is making the cat uncomfortable is not dealt with, and the cat sees no escape route, then she may hiss, spit and, as a last resort, lash out with her claws extended.

Understand that there are two types of fear silhouettes: submissive and aggressive.,
Recognize a submissive silhouette.,
Identify an aggressive silhouette.",How to Recognize Fear in Cats3," A fearful cat may adopt one of two body silhouettes, or stances, depending on whether she wishes to convey a submissive message (she is no threat to the would-be aggressor and she does not want to fight), or an aggressive message (she is fearful but prepared to fight)., In a submissive silhouette, or stance, cat will adopt a hunched, or crouched, sitting position with her tail tucked away between her back legs. These cats would far rather distance themselves from the danger by running away.


If the threat continues and she is unable to escape, she will be forced into aggression.

, The classic Halloween cat shape is an example of a fearful cat on the offensive. The hunched back, erect tail with a hook at the end, and erect fur are all attempts to make the cat look larger and more imposing than she really is.


The hook at the end of the tail is actually a sign that the cat is not feeling confident.

Buy crickets and other creatures.,
Size the prey.,
Make a cricket cage.,
Feed the crickets.,
Put live prey in the cage.,
Dangle prey if necessary.,
Provide a shallow dish of water.,
Feed baby tarantulas often.,
Feed adult tarantulas less frequently.,
Remove uneaten food.,
Do not feed a molting tarantula.,
Make adjustments when necessary.",How to Feed a Tarantula," Crickets are always a safe bet, as all tarantulas are insectivores. Depending on the tarantula, live grasshoppers, katydids, moths, mealworms, superworms), houseflies or cockroaches might also provide a welcome meal. Some tropical tarantulas will eat larger worms, like earthworms, and some larger tarantulas will accept live baby rodents, mice, lizards, and snakes.You can buy live crickets and other prey online or in pet stores. Buy insects in tubs or bulk orders, and keep them alive and well-fred.;
, The ideal size for your tarantula's prey is about half the tarantula's leg span, or slightly smaller than the length of its body. Though large tropical spiders sometimes eat prey as large as themselves, in most cases you should opt for smaller creatures. Large prey may fight back and exhaust your spider.


A young tarantula of about 4 weeks old may have a two-inch leg span and a one-inch body, so you would feed it a cricket of about ¾ inch in length.
Baby tarantulas are sometimes willing to scavenge dead insects, so if your crickets are too big you can cut them into appropriately sized portions.
If your insects are small, you can serve up to four at a time to a large tarantula. However, this may cause your tarantula stress, and you may wish to serve them one at a time or to buy larger insects.

, Buy a large plastic storage box with a secure lid. The box should be deep, about 14 inches, so that the crickets can't easily hop out when you take the lid off. Use a soldering iron or a sharp object to poke two hundred or more holes in the lid and along the rim of the box. The hole should be small enough that the crickets can't fit through.


Humidity will kill the crickets. Keep the box in a dry place, and don't overcrowd it. You can store about a 1000 crickets in a 18 by 14 inch box.
Put egg cartons and toilet paper tubes in the box for the crickets to climb over and hide on. This will prevent the crickets from crowding along a single surface and generating humidity.
When you want to harvest some crickets to feed your spider, put a plastic bag in the box and shake a toilet paper tube or section of egg carton into it. The crickets hidden within will fall in the bag.

, All the nutrients your tarantula gets come from its food. A well-fed cricket will nourish your tarantula better than a starved one. Keep a shallow container of dry oats in the cage, or buy bug food and cricket-specific supplements. Try to keep the food in one corner of the cricket habitat, so that it is less likely to become contaminated or moldy.


For moisture and nutrients, place a whole carrot in the cage. Remove it if it decomposes or molds.
Crickets will also eat leafy greens, such as broccoli, collards, or cabbage, as well as potatoes, fish flakes, and reptile food.Soak cotton balls in water, put them in a lid, and pop this in the cricket cage. This will let the crickets drink without drowning.

, The best practice is to place one live insect or other creature in the tarantula's cage. Let your tarantula eat at its own pace. If the insects you have are too small to make a full single-serving meal, you may put several in the cage at once. Your tarantula may attack them all in succession, rolling them up into a ""bolus"" with its webbing, then eat them all at once.


In the case of too-small insects, some tarantula owners prefer to put them in the cage one at a time over several days, so that the tarantula does not experience stress or harassment from uncaught prey.
If you have put a large creature in the cage and are worried it may harm your tarantula, keep an eye on it and remove it if you think you have overestimated your tarantula's current state of strength and appetite.

, Baby tarantulas will often scavenge, and adult tarantulas will on occasion. In most cases, however, your full-grown tarantula will not recognize food unless that food moves. If you think your tarantula has failed to recognize live prey that is holding very still, try poking the prey lightly to induce movement.


If you would like to induce your tarantula to eat food that is dead or holding still, such as a frozen pinkie mouse, you can also dangle it from the end of a string to make it seem lifelike.

, Pick a shallow dish, less than an inch in height. Fill it daily with about half an inch of water. The water should be just deep enough for your tarantula to submerge its fangs. You can buy a dish from a pet store, or use the lid of a jar.Change the water daily, and replace the dish if it is molding or rusting.
Tarantulas do not drink often, as they receive most of their moisture from their food. However, they do drink at times, and they benefit from having some water around to create environmental moisture
Tropical tarantulas, such as Avicularia Versicolor, living in dry environments may benefit from having areas of their cage misted with water every 2-3 days, then allowed to dry out entirely. Check the specifications for your species.
Do not purchase ""cricket gel"" or sponges. Though some pet stores still sell them, they have been discredited as a source of moisture for your tarantula, and will quickly mold., Offer appropriately-sized portions of food to young tarantulas once or twice a week. Underfeeding could cause your spiderling to dehydrate and die. Some tarantula owners feed baby tarantulas every day to encourage growth. It is not known whether spiderlings are harmed by over-feeding, but this practice can harm other similar animals., Your fully grown spider will likely accept prey every 10-14 days. It is not uncommon, however, for a spider to abstain from eating for a full month after a large meal. Tarantulas will keep eating until they are full. They will abstain from eating when they are soon to molt, or preparing to lay eggs.

, Clear leftovers from the cage within 24 hours of serving. This includes live insects as well as half-eaten insect parts, such as the bolus. Leaving insect corpses in a cage is unsanitary, as it attracts pests and mold. Leaving live insects in the cage will cause your tarantula stress.Try feeding your spider at night, and cleaning out the remains in the morning.

, A freshly molted baby tarantula does not need to be fed for several days. An adult tarantula that has just molted will not eat for two weeks. Be sure to remove prey from the cage of a recently molted tarantula for at least three days, as the tarantula's skin will still be soft and vulnerable enough for a cricket to harm it.Your tarantula will probably stop eating prey a few weeks before it molts.
You can tell your tarantula has molted because it will lie on its back for 15 minutes to several hours.
It may have webbing on its body, clear drops of fluid seeping from its legs, or a bald spot on its abdomen.
It will then emerge from its old skin, possibly with a regenerated limb or two.

, Tarantulas are generally good at self-regulating their meals. However, tarantulas that don't eat enough suffer malnutrition, and adult tarantulas are sometimes capable of overeating, so keep an eye on your tarantula's abdomen. If the abdomen is shriveled, it means your tarantula is underfed and dehydrated. If the abdomen is so large your tarantula has trouble getting around, you may need to feed your tarantula less frequently.

"
"
Dress appropriately.,
Be gentle.,
Use forceps and a capture cup.,
Move the tarantula on a flat surface if at all possible.,
Don’t play around.,
Determine your pet’s species.,
Keep away from a tarantula’s jaws.,
Avoid touching the tarantula’s abdomen.,
See a doctor if necessary.,
Keep them away from other pets.",How to Pick up a Tarantula," Most species of tarantulas kept as pets are not highly dangerous. However, their fangs can be quite long, and they may have special hairs that can irritate humans. To avoid a bite or other injury, wear gloves, long sleeves, and long pants tucked into your socks any time you have to handle your tarantula.You may also want to wear a face mask.


Of course, you can always attempt to pick up a tarantula without protective clothing. Keep in mind, however, that your risk of getting bit or otherwise injured will be higher.;
, Though impressive in appearance, tarantulas are fragile. If dropped or squeezed, they can be mortally wounded. Always be very careful when picking up or moving your tarantula., The best way to pick up a tarantula is to use tools that can protect it, rather than your bare hands. A pair of soft foam-tipped forceps can be used to pick up your tarantula, but be sure not to squeeze it. You can also place a capture cup or bowl over the spider, then slide a stiff card underneath, so that you can safely move it. Just be sure not to accidently clamp the capture cup down on your pet., It is much easier to handle a tarantula when it is at a safe level free from obstructions. Work on a broad, flat surface, preferably the floor or the bottom of a bathtub, whenever you need to pick up your tarantula. This will also make it easier to safely use a capture cup., When picking up or moving your tarantula, keep it away from your face and other exposed skin. If a tarantula is on you or someone else and seems about to attack, flick it away rather than trying to crush it or pick it up. Squeezing or smooshing a tarantula can trigger its bite reflex, making the situation worse.Acting calmly and speaking quietly around a tarantula is the best way to be safe and avoid bites. Noise may make it feel threatened and trigger its attack reflex.
Don’t poke your tarantula, or put or pour anything on it. Aggravating a tarantula may make it become aggressive.
Never wave a tarantula at someone else, even as a joke.
Know the signs of an impending attack: when a tarantula is threatened, it may raise its rear end and lift its front legs.

, Many tarantulas are relatively safe pets. However, some are very dangerous and should not be handled at all. Some species are more aggressive than others, so learn more about the variety that you have so that you can know what kind of behavior to expect., All tarantulas have fangs and can bite. Many species have fangs up to 0.75 inches long. The puppy-sized Goliath tarantula may have fangs up to an inch long. When picking up a tarantula, avoid getting near its jaws (located at the front of its head).Clean the wound if you are bitten. Normally, an oral painkiller such as acetaminophen will be enough to ease discomfort. Elevating the wound site can also help relieve pain. If you see signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus, etc.) at the bite site, you should contact a physician for an examination.
You may be more likely to encounter pain or other problems if you are bitten in a sensitive area, such as your face.
If you have a known allergy to tarantula bites, you should be extremely cautious when picking up a tarantula. Seek medical attention immediately if you have an allergy and are bitten, or if you experience signs of an allergic reaction, such as extreme swelling or difficulty breathing.

, Some species of tarantula have special “urticating” hairs with chemical irritants on their abdomens. They will shed these when touched, and can even shed clouds of thousands of them at a time. These can be painful to the touch, cause redness and swelling of the skin, and irritate the eyes and nose. In some cases, they will need to be surgically removed. If you see a tarantula rearing up, get away.
Always wash your hands after handling a tarantula.
Wearing a face mask and gloves can help protect you from urticating hairs.If urticating hairs do get on your skin, peel them of with tape and take an antihistamine, like Benadryl., If you get urticating hairs in your eyes, are bitten by a tarantula in a sensitive area (such as your eye), or have a bite wound that may be infected, call a doctor. Medical attention may be necessary to treat these complications., Even if they are relatively safe to humans, tarantulas can be lethal to other pets, such as dogs. Always keep your tarantula in a safe, secure enclosure. Keeping your tarantula and other pets separated from each other will help keep everyone safe."

Get a 10 gallon (37 litres) locking terrarium.,
Adapt a small fish tank.,
Spread a thin layer of substrate on the bottom of your tank.,
Make a broken pot shelter for a daytime hiding spot.,
Add bamboo and silk plants for tree-dwelling tarantulas.,
Place a water dish in the tank.,
Monitor the temperature range.,
Heat one half of the tank.,
Use a plant mister to maintain a 50% humidity level in the tank.",How to Care for a Tarantula1," Tarantulas are escape artists, so make sure the top of the terrarium locks tight! Although 10 gallons (37 liters) is the ideal size for keeping a single tarantula, you can get away with a 5 gallon (18 liter) tank.Never keep two tarantulas in the same cage, because they are territorial cannibals. One of them will eat the other.;
, Since fish tanks have feeding holes, you’ll have to seal the holes in the top to prevent the tarantula from escaping. You can use aquarium silicon sealer to seal the feeding holes. Make sure you leave two small holes in the top for ventilation, which should be a maximum of 5/32’’ (4 millimeters).If you are worried about the tarantula escaping through the top of the tank, you can place a rock on the lid.
If you are housing tree-dwelling tarantulas, you’ll want to place the tank vertically.
Any extra vertical room poses a threat to burrowing species because they are more susceptible to injuries from falling, unlike arboreal species.

, You’ll need between 1 and 3 inches (2.54 and 7.62 centimeters) of sterilized bedding on the bottom of the terrarium. Although there are many suitable substrates, you could put down a 2 centimeter layer of vermiculite, and then add a thin layer of cocoa fiber.There are many substrates to choose from, such as coconut fiber, reptile bark, sphagnum moss, peat moss, sterilized potting soil, and vermiculite.
If you choose peat moss, you need to sterilize it. Put it in the microwave for ten minutes in order to kill parasitic mites.Since some species will dig into the substrate, you might need up to 5"" (12.7 centimeters) of substrate.

, Since tarantulas are nocturnal, you’ll need to make a shelter for them to hide from the daylight and get some sleep! You can make a shelter by cutting a ceramic or plastic pot in half. Bury the broken pot in the sand to create a little hiding place. The entranceway should be just large enough for your tarantula to get inside and the interior should be nice and dark.A great hiding place is a hollowed log. Pick a hollowed log that is already dried out, since a wet log could lead to mold issues in the terrarium.You should avoid inserting any sharp objects into the terrarium, since your tarantula could injure itself.

, In contrast to burrowing tarantulas, which like to hide out in the substrate, tree-dwelling tarantulas live in grasses and trees. You can recreate this habitat by adding bamboo, branches, and silk plants to the tank.The tarantulas will make their webs in the branches.Tree-dwelling tarantulas have slightly longer legs, which include more surface area for climbing.
Ground dwelling species should be discouraged from climbing, since they could easily fall and injure themselves.
Remember, the more you put in, the more you will have to clean.
A piece of store bought driftwood might be appreciated.

, You can use a recycled plastic container, a plastic plant container or a water dish from a pet store. Put the container on the bottom of the terrarium, and add a rock so that live prey can escape. Otherwise, the crickets you feed your tarantula could drown and foul the water.If you are adding a water dish for a tree-dwelling tarantula, you should place it about two thirds of the way up the side of the tank so that it is convenient for your tarantula. Put it close to the door of the terrarium, so you can fill it up. You can glue it to the side of the tank with an aquarium silicone sealant., You can put a thermostat on the side of the tank to check the temperature. Since tarantulas normally live in a tropical or subtropical environment, you’ll need to maintain a tank temperature of between 22 and 30 Celsius (71 and 86 Fahrenheit).Avoid placing your tank near a sunny window, since the tank could easily overheat.
If the tank is located in a centrally heated room that is within the ideal temperature range, you won’t need to heat it., If the tank falls below the ideal temperature range, you can use a hot rock or an electric heat-mat to heat it. In either case, you should only heat one half of the tank, so that your spider can self regulate its temperature by moving to the warm or cool side of the tank.

You should avoid letting the tank temperature exceed 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).
If you turn the heat off in the spring or autumn, you will need to use the heat mat during those months.
If you maintain a cooler temperature during the winter months, you should use a heat-mat.

, Use a plant mister to spray the tank and keep the humidity levels up. You can put a humidity gauge on the side of the tank. Check it regularly to make sure the humidity doesn’t drop too far, which can be dangerous for tarantulas when they moult.Check the contents of the tank to make sure there is no mold.

Serve live prey less than half the size of the tarantula.,
Serve an appropriate number of prey per meal.,
Feed young tarantulas more frequently.,
Feed adult tarantulas a diet that is suited to their species.,
Don’t feed a tarantula when it is molting.,
Remove food waste after your tarantula has eaten.,
Offer fresh, chlorine-free water.",How to Care for a Tarantula2," The mainstay of the tarantula diet is crickets, which you can purchase from a good pet store or online. You can also feed them mealworms, beatles, locusts, cockroaches, and earthworms. Whatever live prey you choose, it should be less than half the size of the tarantula you are feeding. Although live food is preferable, you can also serve dead food such as thawed baby mice or 1 centimeter (1/2’’) pieces of raw beef.Don’t serve them prey items that are larger than the size of their abdomens.Tarantulas are opportunists, so they may be able to subdue small lizards, snakes, and mice.
Roaches have to be ordered online and a colony started to ensure a constant supply.

, The number of live prey you serve your tarantula will depend on the size of the prey. For instance, you could offer your tarantula a meal of two small insects or one larger insect, depending on your preference and the availability of feed. For younger tarantulas, you should just give them one prey at a time.However, adult tarantulas can handle multiple prey at once, which they will attack one at a time and then ball up into a meal of food and silk called a bolus.Since they are nocturnal animals, you’ll want to feed them at night., You should feed your tarantula a diet that is suited to their age. Very young tarantulas or “slings” require food every two or three days. Once the tarantula becomes a juvenile or reaches between 1.5 and 2 inches (25.4 and 76.2 millimeters), you can feed them one live insect, once or twice per week., Once they reach adulthood, tarantulas don’t need the same number of meals as juveniles. However, since the size and number of meals varies a lot depending on the species, you should ask the pet store for species-specific feeding information.Feed an adult Grammostola porterie or rosea tarantula four to five crickets per month.
Feed an adult Therophosa or Pamphobeteus tarantula four or five crickets twice per week.
Feed tropical tarantulas larger and more frequent meals, including Therophosa, Phormictopus, Pamphobeteus, Acanthoscurria, and Nhandu tarantulas.
Feed an adult Phamphobeteus five crickets and one cockroach per week.

, If your tarantula is lying on its back and looks comatose, it is probably molting. During the molting process, your tarantula regenerates internal organs and sheds its skin. At this time, you shouldn’t give it any live prey, which could easily injure your tarantula.Five days after molting, it is safe to feed them again.Don’t confuse molting with death. A dead tarantula will not lie on its back.
If your tarantula is very sick or dying, it will do a death curl. It will curl its legs underneath itself in an awkward position., Take out any remaining live prey after your tarantula has finished eating, since these prey could bother your tarantula when it is resting. You’ll also want to remove any food waste, such as discarded bits of crickets in their water bowl., Keep fresh water in the water bowl, which should be dechlorinated. You can give them bottled water or water that has been filtered to remove chlorine."
"
Watch your tarantula.,
Avoid handling your tarantula.,
Recognize raised front legs and fangs as signs of aggression.,
Don’t disturb your tarantula during the molting period.",How to Care for a Tarantula3," Since you aren’t advised to touch your tarantula, the best way to play with it is to watch it hang out in the terrarium. You’ll get to see it dig into the substrate and, if it is a tree-dwelling species, climb up into the folliage. In addition, it is a lot of fun to see it kill and eat live prey!, Since a short fall can easily burst the tarantula’s abdomen and lead to death, you should avoid taking them out of their terrariums. In addition, a tarantula bite can cause swelling and allergic reactions, which should be additional incentive not to handle them.If you decide to handle your tarantula, you need to exercise extreme caution. Hold it on the palm of your hand and keep your hand at a very low height., Since a tarantula bite can cause swelling and allergic reactions, you should learn to recognize when they are about to bite. If you see them raise their front legs and show their fangs, you know they are getting ready to bite!

A tarantula bite will cause swelling, redness, and mild pain.
If bitten by a tarantula, you may experience nausea and fever.
If you are bitten by your tarantula, you may want to seek medical attention.

, In order to grow, tarantulas shed their exoskeleton in a process called molting. Younger tarantulas will molt about once per month, whereas adult tarantulas will molt every year or two. During this time, your tarantula is very vulnerable and should not be disturbed in any way.For instance, don’t alter the tank or feed it any live prey.
During molting, you will see your tarantula lying on its back.

Spray a deterrent on the plants.,
Startle your cats when they begin to eat the plants.,
Move your indoor plants.,
Place noisy material near the plants.",How to Stop Cats from Eating Indoor Plants1," Purchase a non-toxic spray deterrent that is designed to repel cats. Spray this on your indoor plants. The bitter taste will quickly stop the cats from eating the plants. Just ensure that the spray you choose won't damage your plant.You may need to spray the plants every few days since the scent of the spray will disappear after a few days.;
, You want to startle the cats so they immediately stop. However, you don't want the cats to associate being startled with you punishing them. So you'll need to be sneaky about startling them or set up something to fall over if the cats get past it and begin to eat the plants.For example, you could line up empty cans or bottles near the plants. If your cats try to eat the plants, they'll end up knocking over the cans or bottles which should startle them away.
If you're paying attention to your cats, you can try to spray them with a water bottle when they begin to eat the plants. Just ensure that they don't see you spraying them.

, Pay attention to the indoor plants that your cats like to nibble on. Move those plants to a room that your cats don't have access to or place them high up so your cats can't reach them. This may mean that you'll need to place them on a tall shelf or adjust the light in the room so the plants can still thrive.


If you move the plants high up, ensure that the cats can't climb up on anything to get to the plants. You don't want to make it into a game for your cats!

, Another great way to startle your cats away from the indoor plants is to place noisy material, like aluminum foil, near the base of the plants. Lay several strips or sheets of the foil down around the plant so the cats would have to walk over it to get to the plant. The noise of walking over the foil will startle them away.You could also place bubble wrap or another material that your cats dislike walking on, like double-sided tape.

Keep your cats from getting bored.,
Play with your cats.,
Create a garden for your cats.",How to Stop Cats from Eating Indoor Plants2," Boredom is a large cause of misbehavior in cats, from scratching to meowing to eating houseplants. Prevent boredom in your cats by giving them a variety of toys and an interesting environment to explore. When you notice your cats becoming tired of their toys, swap them out for different toys.


For example, ensure your cats have climbing towers, scratching posts, access to windows, places to hide, and toys that keep them active.

, Take time out of your day to play with your cats. Keeping them active and busy will redirect their attention away from the indoor plants. Aim for several 5 to 10 minute play sessions a day or whenever your cats start to look bored.


If your cats begin to go near your plants, immediately try to distract them with a toy or a game.

, Buy a pot of cat grass that's safe for your cats to eat. If your cats begin to eat your indoor houseplants, you can redirect them to their pot of cat grass. You can also grow your own garden of cat-safe plants to keep indoors. Fill a large planting box with:Catnip
Barley
Sesame
Rye
Wheat grass

Get a mature pair of tarantulas.,Have the female in a larger cage than usual and leave her to settle down

,
Once she has settled down feed her a little bit more often.

,
About a week before the pairing, put the male in a smaller container and make sure it is concealed.

,
Put the container the male is into the female's tank.

,
Feed her 2 days before the day you let the male out.,
When you see them drumming before you plan to put him in her tank, it is a sign they are ready however still feed the female before the meeting.

,
Let the male out slowly.

,
Get a paintbrush in case a fight breaks out.

,
If there is a fight separate them slowly with the paintbrush.,
Pair them up again a week later(if the male is still alive).

",How to Breed Tarantulas," This can be a tricky part unless they are all mature. Males that are mature will have mating hooks on their first pair of legs and females have a flap of skin (spermacae) between their book lungs.;
,,,,, And again just before the pairing.

,,,,(NB: the goal is to breed tarantulas, so if the male is killed deal with it and don't kill the female.)

"
Consider and evaluate your experience level with tarantulas.,
Species like the Common Pink toe (Avicularia Avicularia), Costa Rican Stripe Knee (Aphonopelma Seemanni), Chilean Rose (Grammostola Rosea), The Curly Hair (Brachypelma Albopilosum), the Mexican Redknee Tarantula (Brachypelma Smithi), and several other members of the Brachyphelma (although not all) are great starter species.,
Determine how much room you have for your tarantula.,
Choose a reputable tarantula dealer.,
Choose a healthy tarantula.,
Check for injury.,
Research the cost of a tarantula before you buy one.,
Shop around.",How to Pick a Pet Tarantula," Some tarantulas are easier to care for than others. If you haven't owned a tarantula before, you might want to start with one that is easy to care for and not very aggressive.;
, Most are fairly docile and don't require much special attention.


Some of the more interesting tarantulas require past experience with tarantulas, but can have a lot of show quality. Species such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa Blondi), Cobalt Blue (Haplopelma Lividum), and Usambara Orange Baboon (Pterinochilus sp.) are all beautiful species of tarantulas. However along with many others they can be extremely aggressive and require a lot of special attention. Some species of tarantulas including Haplopelma and Poecilotheria have reportedly significantly dangerous venom. Side effects vary, but are usually limited to itchiness and swelling at the bite site and intense pain. Some blistering may occur as well. People with asthma should be cautious when dealing with such spiders as another side effect is labored breathing which might bring on an asthma attack. There have been reports of cardiac failure and coma as a result of bites from some tarantulas. If you are not experienced with keeping tarantulas, please, please, stick to the basic, docile, beginner species above.

, Most tarantulas don't need much room. If you purchase your tarantula as a baby (spiderling) they can live for months in a medium sized pill bottle or a small deli cup like one you would get blue cheese in from a chicken wing restaurant. Usually, if you buy a tarantula from an online dealer, they will send it in a little vial. You can keep the spider/spiderling in that vial until it reaches a molt that will make it too big for the container. As your tarantula grows, you might want to move up to a clear but clean margarine container. If you do purchase a spiderling, make sure you can adapt the heat source as it grows to the changing containers. Something else to consider is whether or not you are buying an arboreal (tree dweller) or terrestrial (ground dweller) tarantula. Arboreals need taller and larger tanks with a ""tree"" of sorts so it's able to climb, whereas terrestrials will make a small burrow for their homes in the material in the bottom. It is recommended that beginners start with terrestrials. However, a fall is much more likely to hurt and even kill a terrestrial than an arboreal (although handling is not recommended for either species).


Species like the Common Pink Toe (Avicularia Avicularia), Costa Rican Stripe Knee (Aphonopelma Seemanni), Chilean Rose (Grammostola Rosea), The Curly Hair (Brachypelma Albopilosum), Mexican Redknee Tarantulas (Brachypelma Smithi), Cobalt Blue (Haplopelma Lividum), and Usambara Orange Baboon (Pterinochilus sp.) will all fit well into a 5 gallon (18.9 L) aquarium or a medium/large Kritter Keeper when fully grown.
Some species like The Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa Blondi) can have up to a 12"" leg span, that's a spider the size of a dinner plate. It will need a significantly larger tank of 20–40 gallons (75.7–151.4 L).

, Some pet stores sell tarantulas and have great experience caring for them. Many tarantulas are available from online dealers if you can't find a local dealer with what you want. They are normally shipped as young spiderlings and are normally captive bred. If your local pet store has just 3 or 4 tarantulas (in case someone is interested in them) then you might want to look for someone with a bit more experience (unless you're experienced and want to rescue a neglected tarantula or educate the pet store).

, Tarantulas that are curled up in the corner of the tank or have their legs tucked underneath them (tarantula death pose) are not very healthy tarantulas. If you see a tarantula standing over the water dish, then there are two possibilities: it's having a drink and you will be able to see it drinking or it's too dry and the tarantula is trying to take advantage of the added humidity of the water. Tarantulas that are laying on their backs with their legs up in the air should be okay, as they are probably getting ready to molt (shed their skin). You should probably wait a few days after this happens before buying a tarantula that has molted, as they don't need the added stress. Tarantulas (depending on the species) should be standing with their legs distributed evenly around it in a circle, or with its legs pointed forward and backwards.

, Tarantulas, especially wild caught tarantulas, are easily injured when captured or while contained and shipped to stores. Some wild caught tarantulas can have parasites, so it is almost always a better idea to get a captive bred tarantula. Make sure your tarantula has all 8 legs and 2 pedipalps (like arms) at the front. Check for injuries on the body and the abdomen of the tarantula. If the pet store has a lot of experience dealing with tarantulas, they should be able to help you with this.

, Some tarantulas are inexpensive and some are very expensive. Spiderlings are much less expensive than a fully grown tarantula. Different stores often have different prices for the same species of tarantula. You may want to start with a less expensive species while you are learning, then move to a more expensive one. It's easier to take the loss of a $20 pink toe than it is a $300 Ecuadorian Birdeater Tarantula.

, Visit the website of an online dealer and print their price list. Take this with you to the pet store so you can compare prices. Maybe you will find a deal. If they don't have the price you'd like to pay, show them the internet price list to convince them to lower theirs.

Pick a deterrent designed for cats.,
Avoid commercial chemicals.,
Perform a spot test on your desired area.,
Identify items that your cat should not eat.,
Spray deterrent.,
Reapply every day for two weeks.",How to Use Taste Deterrents for a Cat," Cats have fewer taste buds than dogs and aren’t affected by many flavors that are used for dog deterrents. Pick one that is advertised as a product for both cats and dogs. Bitter apple deters cats, whereas spicy flavors do not., Opt for a natural repellent rather than a chemical one. Prolonged exposure to certain commercial chemicals can make your cat sick or cause hair loss., Some deterrents may stain carpets or upholstery. Perform a spot test by applying a small amount of the deterrent on a hidden area of your item. Let it dry to see if the item is colorfast. If there is no change, you can apply the deterrent safely., Cats are less inclined to eat things around the house than dogs, but there are some things to worry about. Particularly, cats like to eat plants, many of which can be hazardous to their health.

Examples of common plants that cats should not eat include cacti, Christmas trees, daffodil, mistletoe, tomato leaves, Hydrangea, ivy, lilies, and Chrysanthemum.
Even if it won’t hurt your cat to eat a plant, it will probably hurt the plant. It is always a good idea to spray deterrents on house plants, unless they are designed for your cat to eat, like cat grass.Electrical cords and furniture are chewing hazards for cats. Try spraying them with the deterrent as well.

, After you have introduced your cat to the deterrent, spray it on plants or other items that it likes to chew. Consider using your hands to rub it into and around the plant. After your cat is familiar with the deterrent, the smell alone should repel it, but it doesn’t hurt to be thorough., Continue spraying the item daily to ensure that the deterrent doesn’t fade. Do this for at least two weeks. After two weeks, it is likely that your cat will have lost interest in the item. If not, continue treatment until your cat no longer shows interest in it."

Avoid keeping toxic plants in the house.,
Purchase non-toxic indoor plants.,
Consider your cat's preferences.",How to Stop Cats from Eating Indoor Plants3," Although many plants aren't toxic to humans, they can be toxic to your cats. You shouldn't keep toxic plants in your house just in case your cat decides to eat them. Some common indoor plants that are toxic to cats include:Lillies
Ferns
Rubber plant
Primrose
Poinsettia

, If you're looking to buy new houseplants, check to see which plants are non-toxic. Once you've selected a few non-toxic plants, ensure that they haven't been sprayed with toxic chemicals that could harm your cats. These indoor houseplants are generally non-toxic:African violet
Orchid
Bamboo
Begonia
Spider plant
Prayer plant

, Pay attention to the types of plants that your cats try to eat and the types of plants your cats avoid. Look for indoor plants that won't attract your cats. Or if your cats don't like the smell of certain plants, buy them and place them near other plants to prevent your cats from eating them.This will make it easier to stop them from eating the plants since they won't be as interested in them.


For example, if your cats try to eat long, trailing plants, choose short, stocky plants instead.

Move plants to a safer location.,
Hang your plants.,
Cover dirt with rocks.,
Set screens on plants.,
Spray a cat deterrent.,
Reprimand your cat.,
Give kitty its own plant.,
Decorate with plants that cats don’t like.,
Make sure your cat has toys.,
Remove harmful extras.",How to Safeguard Plants from Cats," The easiest way to keeping your plants safe is by moving them to a more secure location. Keep the plants in an area your cat can’t reach or has no access, such as a bedroom. This may protect your plants from your cat’s hungry mouth and fun-seeking paws.Put plants on shelves that are too high for a jumping cat.Place your plants on a balcony, sun porch, or room that your cat can’t access. Close any doors or use a gate to keep the cat out of the space.;
, High shelves or closed rooms may not deter a curious cat from your plants. If your cat continues to disturb the plants, consider hanging them from the ceiling. Install hanging planters without parts on which your cat can land. These can keep your plants safe from your cat’s paws and mouth.Install hanging planters near a sunny window that is far enough to keep the leaves from tempting your cat’s paws.
Use tall, narrow plant stands if you don’t want to hang items. Make sure the stand doesn’t having enough space for even an athletic cat to land.

, Some cats love to dig in a plant’s dirt. They might like the adventure of hunting for something or see it as an extra litter box. Putting a layer of rocks over dirt allows you to water a plant while keeping it safe from your cat’s paws.Find rocks in your yard or local beach or buy them at a pet store. You can decide on the size, but larger rocks may work better than smaller ones your cat can move aside with its paw.Use seashells or dried wood pieces instead of rocks if you want a more decorative touch. You can also try pine cones, the scent and feel of which can also keep a cat from the plant.
Place your rocks or seashells around the dirt in the planter. Try facing sharp edges of the rock upward, which can further deter your cat from walking on or digging in the plant.

, An alternative to covering dirt with rocks is a plastic or wire screen. Use landscape screening or cloth, wire mesh, or needlepoint “fabric” to keep your cat from digging in the dirt.Poke the screening you choose down in the plant dirt. Consider covering it with a few small rocks to hold it down and further deter your cat.

, Some scents, such as pine or lemon, repel cats. Purchase or make your own spray that is safe for your plant and cat. Apply the spray to the plant leaves or around the pot to protect your plant from kitty’s paws and mouth.Buy cat-safe deterrents at a large retailer or pet store. Read the usage instructions and spray the product on your plant. Many deterrents come in scents and tastes cats don’t like. One example is bitter apple.
Mix one part either lemon, lavender, or eucalyptus oil with three parts water in a spray bottle.Spritz this on the plant’s leaves or around the pot every day for a couple of weeks. This can teach your cat to stay away from the plant., Despite your best efforts, your four footed friend may still access your plants. Some cat owners physically punish their cats to deter undesirable behavior. This has little effect on the behavior and can make your kitty fear you.Using a firm, “No!,” and looking at your cat disapprovingly can keep your cat away from your plants.Stay consistent in your scolding. Cats eventually understand that, “No!” means you don’t like her behavior.

, Before humans domesticated them, cats ate meats that contained pre-digested greens. Because of this, it’s normal for cats to want to nibble at plants occasionally. Providing a safe plant for your cat to nibble may keep it from destroying your other plants. The following types of plants are safe for cats to eat:Cat grass
Catnip
Barley
Sesame
Rye
Wheat grass
LemongrassCatmint
Valerian

, Cats are not attracted to all plants. Some types of plants are not only beautiful and purify your air, but also don’t attract cats. Consider decorating with these plants and/ or placing them around other plants you don’t want your cat to access. The following plants won’t generally attract your four-legged friend:Aloe vera
Bamboo palm
Spider plant
Snake plant or “Mother-In-Laws Tongue”
Boston fern

, Cats love to play, which may be why your pet bats at the leaves of plants. Your cat may sit and hit at plants out of boredom. Check that your cat has enough toys to keep it stimulated and entertained.This may distract your cat’s attention for otherwise tempting greenery. Your cat may like:


Toys filled with catnipStuffed toys that squeak or chirpPlastic or paper balls
Wine corks
Rope
Cardboard tubes from toilet paper or paper towels

, Toys can stimulate your cat, but some have pieces that may harm your cat. Remove any small pieces that your cat could ingest.The following toy pieces may harm your cat:


Paper clips and rubber bands
Feathers
Tinsel
Ribbons or string
Sequins or other small decorations
Pins and needles

Gently place your tarantula back into it's newly cleaned home and watch it explore!",How to Clean a Tarantula's Habitat," Depending on your comfort level and the mood of your tarantula, either remove the tarantula with your hand or by gently scooping it into a dish. Never try to remove a moody or molting tarantula as they may flick hair at you or bite.;
, If they are in a dish, remember to add air holes for proper ventilation.

, Never reuse bedding, as it may have feces or food left in it.

, Wash this well with soap and water. You can use the same soap you use on your dishes, but remember to rinse well. If you use a sponge, always use a new, clean sponge as bacteria can build up in old sponges.

, Again, dish soap is fine, but always rinse well.

, Check on your tarantula while waiting to make sure they have not escaped. Remember, tarantulas are notorious escape artists.

, Be sure to add enough to allow your tarantula to burrow as the breed needs.

, Remember to fill the water dish before placing it in the terrarium.

Mulch the garden.,
Try concrete-reinforcing wire or chicken wire with 1-inch openings.,
Use sticks or branches.,
Place spike mats in the garden.,
Use an odor repellant.,
Use citrus.,
Try other strong scents.,
Spread crushed pepper.,
Plant rue.,
Use motion detectors.",How to Prevent Cats from Pooping in the Garden1," Most cats don't like the feel of large pieces of mulch, so they will avoid the areas with it. In addition, part of the attraction of a garden is the fresh dirt, which most cats view as a litter box. By covering up the fresh dirt, you make that area less inviting., You can lay this wire across the paths that lead to your garden. Cats do not like the openings in the wire on their paws and will usually stay away.You can also lay the wire across your beds and cover it with mulch. Use wire cutters to create holes for your plants, and bend the ends of the wire down, pressing them into the ground. This wire deters cats from using the dirt as a litter box and from clawing at the dirt., Criss-cross branches across your plant beds. Cats won't like walking on the branches, and you can place plants in the openings.An alternative to branches is lattice work. Plants can grow up through the holes of the lattice, and cats won't like walking on it., Though these mats sound malicious, they are not harmful to the cats. They have small plastic spikes on the mats that cats don't like walking on. You cut the mat into pieces and then set them along your beds., These types of repellants, which you can find at local gardening and hardware stores, come in granules or sprays. Cats do not like the smell, so it will keep them out of the area.Granules are better if you need to cover a large area. If you want to keep cats away from a certain plant, the spray is easier. You will need to renew this when you see cats coming back in your yard.Lion dung is an effective repellant that you can buy online. The cat is scared off because it thinks a bigger predator is around.

, Most cats do not like the smell of citrus. One easy method is to scatter citrus peels around the yard, though you will need to replenish them frequently.Instead of peels, you can use sprays that have citrus scents. You can also dissolve citrus essential oils and spray it around your garden. Simply dissolve 10-15 drops of oil in a cup of water, and place it in a spray bottle., For instance, cats don't like the smell of pipe tobacco or coffee, so you can spread the grounds or used tobacco around your plants to keep the cats out.Alternatively, you can spray a vinegar and water solution around the yard, or you can dissolve 10-15 drops of lavender or eucalyptus oil in a cup of water to spray the yard, as well. You will need to spray these periodically to keep the cats out., Some people have had luck with spreading crushed red pepper around the garden. However, you need to spread it around again after each rainfall., Cats avoid this plant because of its odor. Though it can be poisonous to cats, they will avoid it completely rather than chewing on it., You can use either ultrasonic or water motion detectors in your garden. You place them around your garden, and when a cat comes in, the motion activates a sensor. Depending on the kind you use, it either creates an ultrasonic sound that humans can't hear or sprays the area with water, both of which deter the cats. Some even combine the two approaches.If you see a cat while you're in the garden, you can try giving him a gentle spray with the hose to run him out."
"
Hang your plants from the ceiling.,
Spritz deterrent spray on your plants.,
Train your cat to leave plants alone.,
Don’t punish the cat yourself.For example, if you spray the cat with water or shout at him, your cat will associate the punishment with you.,
Surround the plant with an unpleasant surface.,
Use noise to deter your cat.,
Sprinkle products with lion dung into the plant's soil.",How to Prevent Cats from Eating Plants1," You can purchase hanging pots and hooks from any home and garden store. Hanging plants are both attractive and cat-proof!;
, You can find deterrent sprays in the pet store that won't harm your plant, but will discourage your cat from poking around it. A good example of a safe product is “Get Off,” but always make sure to check the label before buying a deterrent product. Some of these sprays might actually hurt your plant.


You can make your own deterrent spray at home, as well. Make a mixture of one part vinegar to three parts water, and spritz it onto the leaves of your plant. Cats hate the smell, and it doesn't hurt your plant!

, This is best done with ""remote punishment.""The idea is to make the cat associate approaching the plant with something bad, like getting sprayed in the face with water. However, you don't want the cat to associate the punishment with you. You want your cat to think the punishment came out of nowhere.


Booby trap the plant by using putting a can of compressed air that's activated by a motion sensor near it. These pet-training aids can be purchased in pet stores or online.
When your cat approaches plant, he'll get a blast of compressed air. This doesn't hurt him, but it'll make him think twice about approaching the plant again.

, He may well stop eating the plant when you're around, but he'll probably keep doing what he wants when you're out of the room. Punishing the cat yourself actually makes him more devious. He also might grow a little frightened of you, which isn't the relationship you want with your pet.

, Put tin foil down around the plant, or a plastic carpet protector with the knobby side up. Your cat may not be willing to walk across an unpleasant surface to get to your plants.

, Collect and wash out empty cans — whether for canned vegetables or soft drinks. Line them up along the edge of the table where you keep your plants, then add more rows on top to form a wall. When your cat jumps up and knocks them down, the noisy clamor will send him flying. He'll think twice about approaching your plants after enough scares.

, This might sound quirky, but products like Silent Roar contain lion feces. Though you won't be able to smell it, your cat will, and he'll get the message that a powerful stranger has already claimed the plant as part of his territory.

Choose a sunny spot.,
Plant catnip.,
Create a sand patch.,
Spread fine mulch around the area.,
Try other plants cats love.",How to Prevent Cats from Pooping in the Garden2," Many cats love being in the sun, so pick an area that is sunny at least part of the day.

, Cats love catnip and cat mint, and you can distract them from your garden by planting it in another part of the yard. Cats will be drawn to that area rather than to your tomato plants. Be warned, though, that this method may draw more cats to your yard., In addition, till up an area near the catnip and spread sand on top. Cats will enjoy napping in the area, keeping them free of your garden.Cats may use this area as a litter box, so you will need to clean up the area regularly. However, it will likely keep them from going in other areas in your garden., While cats don't like heavy mulch, they do like digging in fine mulch, so it will attract them to the area., Cats also like wheat berries, flax, oat grass, barley grass, and lemongrass to name a few."
"
Check on leash laws in your areas.,
Find the owner.,
Talk to the owner.,
Call animal control.",How to Prevent Cats from Pooping in the Garden3," Most cities won't let animals be outside without leashes on. Once you know the laws, it gives you the authority to do something about the cats roaming in your garden., Check the cat collars, if possible, to find the owner, as many collars include a phone for the cat's home or, at the very least, the cat's vet office. You can also watch to see where the cat goes when she leaves your garden., If it's a neighbor's cat, talk to the neighbor about the problem. Inform him or her of the leash laws, and ask the owner to keep the cat inside. You can threaten to call animal control if the cat continues to come over., If the cat is a stray or if a neighbor's cat continues to come over, you can call animal control to pick up the animal."

Understand the possible reasons behind plant-damaging behavior.,
Have regular play-sessions with your cat.,
Use toys that will get your cat moving.Although your cat will love the attention either way, don't let your play sessions turn into cuddle sessions.,
Leave toys out for him while you're gone.",How to Prevent Cats from Eating Plants2," Your cat might just be bored to tears cooped up in your house. If moving leaves are the closest thing to toys or prey in his environment, it should be no surprise when your cat is drawn to them. To best curb plant-damaging behavior, you need to provide your cat with healthier alternatives.

, Some breeds of cat are far more active than others, so you'll be the best judge of how much play your cat needs. As a general rule, though, it's best to play with your cat at least twice a day for 5-10 minutes each time.

, You need to get your cat excited and winded to prevent him from chomping on your plants.


Use toys that are on the end of a long string, so you can make your cat run from one end of the room to the other without exhausting yourself.
Not all cats respond to laser pointers, but if your cat does, you're in luck! You can lounge on the couch and enjoy a snack while your cat runs all over the place trying to catch the little red dot!

, Your cat might get especially bored when there's nobody around to keep him company. Leaving toys out for him when he's alone gives him more constructive outlets for his boredom than plant-chewing.


Rotate the toys out so he doesn't get bored with the same ones day after day. Your cat will ignore a toy he's become too familiar with.
However, if it reappears after a long absence, he'll be excited about it again.

Observe your cat's preferences.,
Avoid buying “cat magnet” plants.,
Place ""bait"" plants around your home.You can use your cat's attraction to certain species of plants to your benefit.,
Buy plants your cat dislikes.",How to Prevent Cats from Eating Plants3," Pay attention to what kinds of plants draw his attention, then avoid plants like that in the future.


For example, your cat might love wispy, dangling leaves that flutter in the breeze.
In that case, buy plants with large, heavy leaves that don't look as much fun to play with.

, Yucca plants, for example, seem to be particularly irresistible, and your cat will chew on them without mercy. Zinnias and marigolds are other examples of ""cat magnet"" plants that you should avoid.If you already have an irresistible plant in your home, keep on a high shelf where the cat can't reach it. Make sure it's an unreachable shelf, or your nimble cat might just leap up there.

, Place trays of catnip or grass around your home for your cat. Munching on these plants will help satisfy his need to chew, and hopefully distract him from your more prized plants.

, There are also some plant species that cats just can't seem to stomach. They often have a strong smell, like lavender, rosemary, or citrus plants. While you can enjoy the pleasant aroma of these plants, the smell will discourage your cat from chomping on them.


You might also buy plants that have very high leaves that cats can’t reach, such as small trees.

Plant a tree in a shady area.,
Protect your garden bed.,
Keep an outdoor water dish.,
Install a cat flap.,
Store all chemicals in a garden shed with a good lock.,
Create a small section where your cat can go to the toilet.,
Cover your pools, fishponds and sandpits when not in use.,
Place solar lights around the garden.,
Use weedkiller that is non-toxic to cats.,
Plant flowers and plants that are cat friendly.,
Create a shady spot in your garden.,
Consider any birds who visit your garden.,
Install a high fence.,
Have a first-aid emergency kit on hand.,
Keep your garden clean.",How to Prepare Your Garden for a Cat," This will act as a scratching post for the cat so they won't scratch the grass and pull it out. Make sure the tree isn't too soft so the cat won't destroy it. Growing catnip around the tree will help getting them to scratch the tree. If you can't plant a tree or are worried about your pet damaging a tree, a small children's climbing frame or large cat centre adapted for use outdoors can work as well.;
, Place some bark around the edges of your garden bed. Cats generally don't like to jump up on to prickly surfaces.

, Ensure that you clean this often as debris can get into it. Mosquitoes breed on water, so watch out for them. Cleaning them every few hours is a good idea or disposing of the water when your cat is inside.

, The cat will be happy if there is a door to go inside and out, cats don't want to be locked in or out. Cats change their mind often. Giving them a choice will make them much happier. An electronic cat flap that recognises your cats microchip or electronic is the best to prevent outside intruders (such as neighbouring cats and wild animals) coming in to your house.

, Cats usually don't try to eat chemicals but if they happen to lean against one, they will lick it off and may become poisoned. Make sure you don't lock the cat in the shed. Check for cracks and windows in the shed. The cat may find a way to sneak in and be unable to get out. Try preventing the cat getting into the shed by:


Placing a sheet of corrugated iron over the crack or window.
Spraying a cat repellent around the shed. Tea tree and eucalyptus oil will ward them off.
Planting a strong smelling plant such as capsicum (peppers), chilli or a citrus tree.

, This will prevent them from digging up the grass and your plants. A bare patch of soft soil is ideal for this. To encourage the cat to use this area when it first starts exploring your garden, sprinkle some kitty litter on the the soil.

, Cats may accidentally fall into a pool, catch the fish and use the sandpit like their litter tray. Use netting that has very small holes -- small enough so that the cat cannot stick its paw in. If you are unable to get this kind of netting use a plastic sheet. For fishponds, use a clear plastic sheet.

, This is so if the cat were to get into any trouble at night, you would be able to see what was going on. Cats can be attacked by a neighbouring cat or wild animal at night. Having lights around the garden will help so you can quickly get your cat and deal with the situation.

, If you have many weeds in your garden, ask your local hardware store which chemical to buy that isn't poisonous to pets.

, Cats like to eat some plants but many are poisonous, always check the label to see. If you are unsure, ask your local hardware store.

, Make sure this spot is always clean and shady at all times of the day. Because cats like to hide, try using a small cubby house with a comfortable bed inside. You could even keep the water dish inside. Make sure you clean this area frequently as the cat could be spending most of its in there.

, Protect them from becoming a cat-snack by discouraging them with bird scaring devices. Try not to provide cover for your cat to stalk the birds from. If you enjoy feeding wild birds, you may want to stop to keep the birds safe. Your cat is at risk of getting worms if it eats any wild birds or animals.

, This can be very costly but will keep your cat out of danger. Especially if you live on a busy road and there are other neighbouring cats. Ensure that the fence doesn't have any holes. Cats can fit through very small holes, however, some holes are too small and the cat may suffocate trying to get through. Always check with your local council before installing any fencing.

, Read up on the different things cats are unable to eat and how to treat a wounds on a cat. You emergency kit should include:


Phone number of local vet clinic
Blanket or old towel
Medical records, identification and microchip paperwork
The cats medication
Pet carrier
Blunt scissors
Gauze pads
Bandages
Tweezers (for ticks)
Saline water (washing out wounds)

, Mow the lawn frequently, make sure the cat is inside when you mow the lawn. Remove spider webs and weeds. Remember to wash any paving and dust window sills. Prune big plants and remove fallen branches. Call a pest control company and ask them to check for rats and other pests. Rats can give diseases to cats if bitten, scratched or eaten.

Secure all balconies and fence doors.",How to Kitten Proof Your Home," You should start with one of the most used areas in most homes: the kitchen. Place child-proof locks on all cabinet doors and drawers in your kitchen as kittens can open them easily. Child-proof locks will make it more difficult for your kitten to get into the contents of your kitchen cupboards and drawers.You can find child-proof locks online or at your local hardware store. These locks are often made of plastic and will attach to the top of your cupboards and drawers. They act as a buffer to make it more difficult for small hands or paws to open a door or slide open a drawer.
You should make sure there is a child-proof lock on the cupboard that contains your garbage and your recycling bins. You do not want your kitten getting into these bins, as they may end up eating or swallowing something that will make them sick.;
, Kittens tend to curl up in small spaces or areas, especially if they are in explore mode. You should try to block off any small open areas in your kitchen, such as under the refrigerator, the oven, and the dishwasher. You may use towels to block off these areas or use a solid piece of wood to cover these areas.You should also get in the habit of keeping all appliance doors closed at all times. Your kitten may end up trying to hide in your dishwasher or your microwave, especially if they are often left open and are low to the ground.
Once your kitten in your home, you should get in the habit of checking inside these appliances before you turn them on. You do not want to end up washing your kitten with your dishes!

, Household cleaning supplies often contain ingredients that can be toxic to animals, such as bleach and ammonia. Make sure you store all cleaning supplies away in a cupboard that has a child-proof lock or that is very high up, with no surrounding ledges that the kitten can climb on. You do not want to risk your kitten eating or licking these chemicals.You should also get in the habit of keeping your kitten out of the room when you are cleaning. Secure your kitten in a fenced off area far from the cleaning area. This will ensure your kitten does not end up licking or eating any of the cleaning materials.

, Your new kitten will likely try to chew or nibble at anything that resembles a piece of string, including any electrical cords. Keep your kitten safe from electrical risks by securing all cords on the appliances in your kitchen. Do this by using an electrically safe tie around the cords so they are tight and secure behind the appliance.You can also wrap the cords in electrical tape and secure them against the counter or along a back wall so they are not loose. This will make it more difficult for your kitten to play with the cords and chew on them.

, If you tend to keep a tablecloth or table settings on your dining room table, you should remove them so the table is bare. Your curious new kitten may end up climbing on the table and scratching up the tablecloth or the table settings.If you have dining room chairs with upholstered cushions, you may want to also put plastic or a slick cover over them to protect them. Your kitten may end up scratching the cushions when she explores her new home.

, You should do a walk through of your living room and the bedrooms in your home to make sure all electrical cords are secure. Check the cords on desk lamps and alarm clocks on side tables in the room. Make sure the cords are rolled tight and secure behind the lamp or clock. You can also wrap the cords in electrical tape and secure them against a wall or on the ground to ensure they are not loose and easy to reach.If you have an office area in your home with a computer and computer equipment, take special care to secure all power cords. You should tuck any power bars in hard to reach areas on the ground and make sure all power cords are secure.

, You should also go through your living room and your bedrooms to make sure there are no loose ribbons or strings. Double knot all curtain strings so they are high up and out of reach.

This will prevent your kitten from slipping out through a loose screen when the windows are open.

, You should move any candles to high shelves in the bedrooms or store them away in drawers. You should also keep any incense in high areas or stored away so they do not create a fire hazard for your new kitten.You may also want to avoid using candles or incense around the house until your kitten is trained and less likely to try to paw the fire. This will protect your kitten from injury.

, If you tend to keep plants in the living room or the bedrooms, you should make sure they are not poisonous to cats. Lilies, sago palms, oleanders, rhododendrons, and castor beans are harmful houseplants that you should remove. It may be best to store away the plants until your kitten is house trained to avoid injury.Most cats will chew on grass and plants, especially if they are curious about a new environment. Even plants that are non-poisonous can cause vomiting and diarrhea in cats so try to keep plants out of reach or remove them.
You can find a list of toxic plants on the ASPCA's website.

, Kittens can accidentally knock over items on tables, shelves, and desks. You should prevent breakable items from getting damaged by storing them away in cupboards or drawers. Move any family heirlooms or precious glass items into a room that is off limits to your kitten or wrap them and put them away.You should also store away any items that could be ingested by your kitten. If the item is small enough to fit in your kitten’s mouth, it’s a choking hazard and should be stored away.

, You should also make sure all bedroom drawers, cupboards and closet doors are closed. Kittens love to hide in warm, dark spaces so keeping these areas blocked off will prevent you from “losing” your new pet in your home.You should also block off any spaces under your bed with boxes so your kitten cannot hide underneath the beds.

, You should always make sure the toilet seat in your bathroom is down, as you do not want your kitten to fall in and potentially drown in the water. You should also remind everyone in your home to keep the toilet seats down so they are not a hazard to your kitten., Medication can be harmful for your kitten, especially if the pills or tablets are easy to reach and ingest. Beauty products, cosmetics, and soaps can also be harmful for your kitten if they get access to these items. Keep all medications, cosmetics, beauty products and soaps in cupboards or drawers with child-proof locks.You should try to get in the habit of putting medication away once you are done using them, rather than leave them on the countertops. You should also put away all cosmetics and beauty products so they are not out and accessible to your kitten.

, If you keep any of these items in your bathroom, you should make sure they are stored away securely in drawers or cupboards with child-proof locks. You should take extra care with sharp items like shaving razors, nail clippers, and metal nail files. Keep these items in a locked drawer so they are not a hazard to your kitten.


You should also keep all jewellery in a secure box with a lock so your kitten cannot access any of your precious items. Rings, earrings, and pendants can all be swallowed by your kitten or damaged by your kitten.

, This will prevent your kitten from hiding in these areas. Try to get in the habit of always closing these doors once you are done using them or once they have been loaded with clothing.You should also make sure detergent and cleaning supplies are stored away in a secure cupboard or drawer in your laundry room. You may use child-proof locks on the cupboard so your kitten cannot access these potentially toxic products.

, Your garage may be full of cleaning supplies for your car or your home as well as chemicals for gardening and yard work. Make sure these hazardous chemicals are moved to high shelves that are difficult to access for your kitten or placed in cupboards with child-proof locks. You want to keep these products out of reach so your kitten is not at risk.If you notice any anti-freeze or oil on the floor of your garage, you should clean it up with soap and water. This will prevent your kitten from licking these hazardous chemicals and getting sick.

, You should make sure that any gardening tools or equipment are secured against a high wall or on a high shelf. You should also keep any loose parts or machinery in sealed bags so they are not at risk of falling on your kitten.You may want to keep these tools in child-proof drawers or hang them flush against a high wall. If you have too many tools to store in drawers, you may decide that the garage is an off limits area for your kitten.

, If you end up letting your kitten in the yard, make sure there are no toxic plants in the garden or yard. You may pull out plants that are toxic or cover the plants so they are more difficult to access.Ideally, you should keep your kitten indoors for most of the day. You may allow your kitten outside in an enclosure to keep her from running away or getting into the garden.
You can find a list of toxic plants on the ASPCA's website.

, Slug bait and snail pellets are fatal to cats so you should avoid using them around your kitten. You should also avoid using weed killer or fertilizer outdoors if your kitten is going to be hanging around outside., You should also fence off any balconies in your home so your kitten is not at risk of falling over the balcony or sliding through the slates on the balcony. You should make sure all fence doors are locked in your yard or garden so your kitten cannot leave your yard unattended.

Give your cat plenty of toys.,
Buy a cat tree for climbing and scratching.,
Try a food puzzle toy.",How to Prevent an Energetic Kitten from Hurting Itself2," Instead of allowing your energetic kitten to take part in potentially dangerous activities, provide your kitten with plenty of appropriate toys. There are a variety of cat toys available from pet supply stores. In many instances kittens will happily play with toys by themselves., Kittens can also expend energy by climbing and playing on a cat tree. These can be purchased at your local pet supply store and provide kittens with an opportunity to jump up to different perches. They also include scratching posts for your kitten to play with. These are fun and safe objects for kittens., If your kitten is motivated by food, try giving it a food puzzle. Place a few of your kitten’s favourite treats inside the puzzle. Then, your kitten will spend time playing with the toy in order to access the treats. This is a safe way to occupy and tire out an energetic kitten."

Try fetch.,
Activate the prey drive with moving toys.,
Avoid using your hands as a toy.,
Train your kitten.",How to Prevent an Energetic Kitten from Hurting Itself3," Throw a small ball, stuffed toy, or even a rolled up piece of aluminum foil. Your cat will chase the toy and expend energy. This is a great way to tire out your cat in a non-hazardous and controlled environment. By spending time playing with your kitten, it is less likely to be destructive or get injured., You can tire out your kitten by playing with it in a safe manner. For example, you can activate the prey drive of your cat by using moving toys, such as wand toys. Typically, these toys will consist of a short pole with a stuffed toy or feather dangling from a string.Try slowly moving the toy across the floor in front of your kitten. The kitten will likely begin to stalk and chase the toy.

, When kittens are small and their claws and teeth don't really hurt, many people will use their hands as a toy. You should avoid doing this because it can actually cause your kitten to learn to attack hands. As your kitten grows this may develop into aggressive behaviour., You can also stimulate your kitten and even modify unwanted behaviour through training. Many people believe that kittens cannot be trained. That is actually a myth. Try clicker training your cat. Eventually you will be able to prevent your cat from going on unwanted surfaces which may be dangerous."

Provide shelter outside.,
Add insulation to your cat's shelter.,
Raise the shelter off the ground.",How to Protect Cats During Winter1," Outdoor cats will need shelter to protect them during winter months. Providing somewhere for your cat, or feral cats, can mean the difference between surviving and not surviving. Yet, even if you only let your cat outside once in awhile during the cold winter months, you should still give it somewhere outside where it can take refuge from the cold. This can be an area attached to your house or a stand-alone structure that gives the cat a break from cold temperatures and precipitation.Possible shelters that you already have that can keep an outdoor cat safe and warm include a garage, a barn, or a porch or carport that blocks out the elements.
Make sure that rain or snow cannot get inside the shelter. Any moisture inside the shelter can be transferred to your cat's coat, which in turn will make it colder when it leaves the shelter.
Make sure that the entrance to whatever shelter you provide is small, so that warm air is trapped inside, and out of the path of wind and precipitation.;
, Keeping a cat warm while it is outside may require that you add insulation to the shelter you provide. Add straw, foam insulation, or mylar blankets, all of which will keep the cat warm but will not absorb and transfer moisture onto the cat.Consider transforming a foam cooler into a cat shelter. Simply cut a small circle hole on the side of it that your cat can fit through. Place the cooler in a location that your cat frequents. This will create an insulated cat shelter that instantly gives your cat some protection from the cold.

, If you have a stand-alone shelter for your cat and you live in an area that freezes, consider lifting it up off the ground. Place it at least a few inches off the ground and then insulate below it. This will stop the frozen ground from sucking the heat out of your cat's shelter. It will also make the shelter accessible even if a bit of snow piles up on the ground.Once you raise your cat's shelter off the ground, you need to be sure to insulate the bottom of it. Cold winds blowing beneath it can really make the shelter cold.

Poisonous plants are a common hazard for cats. Examples of poisonous plants are aloe, lilies, and eucalyptus.Cats who eat poisonous plants can suffer from a range of illnesses, such as heart problems (Lily of the Valley) and kidney failure (rhubarb leaves).Other poisonous houseplants include poinsettias and mistletoe, which are popular during the winter holidays. Poinsettia sap can irritate the mouth and stomach, and mistletoe can cause liver damage.There are many houseplants that can be toxic to your cat. If you are not sure which plants you have, take pictures of them or take them to your local gardening center for identification.;
, Human medications (e.g., Tylenol, ibuprofen, vitamins) and household cleaners (e.g., dish detergent, bleach, laundry detergent) can be very toxic to cats if ingested. Tightly seal the lids of medication bottles and household cleaner containers and secure the items in cabinets with childproof latches.Pick up and throw away any loose pills you see on the floor or countertops.Household cleaners can irritate the digestive system and, if toxic enough, severely burn the linings of the esophagus, mouth, or stomach.Your cat’s medication can also be toxic to her if she manages to open the bottle eat the contents. Keep her medications safely stowed away as well.
When you use household cleaners, follow the label instructions carefully. For example, if the label says “keep pets and children away until dry,” make sure your cat stays out of the room until the product has completely dried., Cats have very sharp teeth and can chew through the insulation on electrical cords. If your cat chews on a cord, she may develop severe burns in her mouth or even experience electrical shock. An electrical shock could damage your cat’s heart or lungs and would require immediate veterinary care.Place plastic cord protectors over your electrical cords or coat them with something unpleasant tasting for your cat, such as hot sauce or a non-toxic spray. The non-toxic spray is available at your local pet store.Tie up the loose cords before hiding them.Examples of good toys for cats are laser lights and wand toys (a small toy or feather is attached to the end of a plastic wand).

, Certain human foods are very toxic to cats. For example, your cat should not eat chocolate (or any form of candy), onion, onion powder, raisins, or garlic.In addition, treats and scraps from the dinner table are often full of fat and sugar, which can overwork your cat’s pancreas and cause her to develop a serious disease called pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine, which can cause nervousness, vomiting, or even death.Leftover bones can also be hazardous to cats. Bone fragments could damage your cat’s digestive tract, and may cause her to choke.Other toxic foods are coffee and tea, dairy products (adult cats only), and raw meat., Toilets are dangerous for your cat. If the toilet lid is open, she may fall in and drown if she is small. Also, some toilet bowl cleaners can leave a residue that is toxic to cats. Sinks or bathtubs could also be drowning risks for your cat. If you are filling up a sink or bathtub, keep a close watch on your cat, or keep her out of the room completely.Keep toilet lids closed at all times in case your cat wanders into the bathroom without you looking.

, Small objects, such as rubber bands, hair pins, and twist ties can be very harmful to your cat if she swallows them.Although it is quite easy to leave such small items lying around, you must keep them out of sight from your cat. It may help to do a visual ‘sweep’ of your home each day to make sure there are no small items that your cat could easily access.


Pennies minted after 1982 contain zinc, which can be toxic to cats.Keep any spare change in your wallet.

, Your front door is a hazard if it's left open, but other doors in your home can be equally dangerous, including those of your dryer, refrigerator, freezer, and oven. Close all doors promptly so your cat does not have a chance to squeeze inside.When you do your laundry, check to make sure your cat has not crawled in your dryer—cats may want to climb into a warm, cozy dryer.

, Cats are very playful animals. As much as your cat enjoys her playtime, you will need to make sure all of her toys are safe. For example, her toys should not contain ribbon or string that she could bite off and swallow. Ribbons and strings can cause serious intestinal problems that require immediate and extensive veterinary care.Toys with small plastic eyes are also unsafe, since your cat could chew these off and swallow them.

, If your cat stays outside, there are outdoor hazards from which you will need to protect her. Although several automotive supplies (e.g., gas, oil) are toxic to cats, antifreeze is, by far, the most common automotive toxin for cats.Most antifreeze contain ethylene glycol, which is extremely toxic to cats and can be fatal.Cats are attracted to antifreeze because of the sweet taste. Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning include vomiting, excessive urination, dehydration, and maybe even coma as the poisoning progresses.Ethylene glycol poisoning in cats requires immediate veterinary care.Ethylene glycol-free antifreezes are available. They contain propylene glycol instead, which is safe for pets in small amounts.Keep antifreeze and other automotive supplies safely secured.

, Products such as fertilizers and pesticides are toxic to cats. When you use them in your lawn and garden, keep your cat away from the treated away for the amount of time recommended by the manufacturer. If she steps in the area too soon and licks her paws, she could swallow toxic ingredients.Cocoa mulch is toxic to cats.When you are not using the products, keep them safely stored away.Since fertilizer bags tend to be pretty big and can be hard to close after opening them, store them in a large garbage or plastic container can with a tight-fitting lid.

, Rodenticides can cause serious or life-threatening injuries in cats.Cats can become sick by eating the rodenticide directly, or get ‘secondary poisoning’ by eating a rodent killed by rodenticide.If you have a rodent problem, place the rodenticide in areas where your cat can’t access.


Speak with your local pest control company if you are unsure where you can put the rodent traps so that your cat can’t access them.

, During the winter, de-icing salts are useful for melting snow and ice. However, these products can contain toxic ingredients that your cat may ingest when she licks her paws. When you visit your local home improvement store, look for pet-friendly de-icing products., The list of potential household hazards for cats is quite long, so it is not feasible to list clinical signs for each hazard. However, there are some general observations you can look out for that would suggest your cat has gotten into something she shouldn’t have. For example, if your cat has burn marks around her mouth, she may have been chewing on an electrical cord. If your cat suddenly starts having digestive upset (vomiting, diarrhea) or showing behavioral changes (e.g., nervousness, excitability), it is likely that she has eaten something toxic.
Some poisons can make a cat sicker the longer it stays in her system, so it is very important to act quickly when you notice sudden sickness or behavioral changes.

, If you suspect your cat has ingested something toxic, call the poison control hotline, whose number is 1-888-426-4435. When you call, provide as much information as you can, including your cat’s breed and age, what she ingested and in what amount, and what symptoms she is showing.The more information you can provide, the better the hotline staff will be able to assist you.


If you live outside of the United States, contact the animal poison control hotline in your country.

, Do not feel as if you need to treat your cat at home. The poison control hotline may be able to recommend some first aid care for your cat, but you should get your cat to a veterinary clinic as soon as possible.Some poisonings can be fatal if not treated quickly, so it is critical for your cat to receive immediate veterinary care.


When you call the veterinary clinic, provide the same information you did for the poison control hotline.

Aside from the ghoulish costumes that could frighten kitties, there are also usually spikes in animal abuse incidents during this holiday, especially against black cats. Protect your cats from any possible harm by keeping your cat indoors during Halloween season.Consider keeping your cat inside for a week before the actual Halloween holiday and for a week after. People often have Halloween parties on days other than the actual holiday and you want to keep your pet safe on those days as well.
If you plan on having a Halloween party at your home, you may want to consider putting your cat in a confined room that no one will access. This will ensure that your kitty is safe and won’t accidentally be allowed back outside by a careless party guest.;
, Make sure your cat has everything it needs inside your home. This is especially true if the cat is used to being outdoors most of the time. The cat will need indoor food, constant access to fresh drinking water, a clean litterbox, several toys, and a form of identification – like a collar with an ID tag.Be sure to show the cat where its food and water dishes are, as well as the litterbox and any toys you may have purchased for it.

, Your outdoor kitty may not be happy about being forced indoors during Halloween. The cat won’t be able to tell that this is a temporary arrangement and will make its frustrations known. When your cat appears to be unhappy, spend some time soothing the kitty by playing with it and petting it.You can also try giving your cat treats to make it feel more calm about being stuck inside.
Don’t force your cat to cuddle you if it is clearly feeling scared. Try to treat your cat as your normally would and just spend some quality time together.

, Many people like to use candles and jack-o-lanterns around their homes for Halloween. This can be a fun and festive way to enjoy the holiday, but it can be quite dangerous for curious kitties. If you decide to light candles or keep jack-o-lanterns inside, be sure to monitor them at all times.Always remember to distinguish candles and jack-o-lanterns before you go to bed or whenever you plan on leaving your cat unattended.

, If you have a lot of a trick-or-treaters visiting your home, make sure you are cautious each time you open the door. The unusual activity could startle your cat and cause it to bolt outside, especially if your cat is used to being outdoors some of the time.If you think your cat might try to run out the door, consider keeping it in a room with a closed door while you are receiving trick-or-treaters.

, Candy and chocolate can be deadly if ingested by cats, so make sure you keep your stash of Halloween candy in a place that is not easily accessible for your cat. Put the candy away in a cupboard when you aren’t using it.Halloween decorations can also be particularly dangerous for cats. They can get tangled in ribbons and fake spider webs, or even try to eat them.
Also be cautious about candy wrappers, as your cat could try eating it. This could cause your cat to choke or the wrapper to get stuck in your cat’s digestive tract.

, If you have people over to your house during the Halloween season, whether it’s for a party or just visitors, make them aware of the precautions you are taking with your cat. This will help them understand your rules so they know how to interact while they are in your home.

Remind your guests if the cat is locked in a back room, so they remember not to open the door to that room.
Tell your guests to be careful as they enter and exit your home to make sure the cat doesn’t get outside.
Ask your guests to be extra careful about storing and disposing of any Halloween candy they might have brought over.

, Children need to be taught how to interact with animals, especially during special circumstances like holidays. Tell the children in your household about how they need to be extra cautious with the kitty during the weeks surrounding Halloween.

Remind children to avoid scaring the cat by running around in their costumes or by making loud, unnecessary noises.
Ask children to be careful about leaving the doors open so the cat can’t get out.

, Halloween can be a very stressful time for cats with all the noises and visitors – whether you’re having a Halloween party or just receiving trick-or-treaters. Consider giving your cat treats to calm its nerves and distract it from the distressing noises.Try giving your cat healthy treats so that the holiday season doesn’t contribute negatively to your cat’s weight and overall health.

, Whether you are having a Halloween party or just being visited by trick-or-treaters, try to take a moment out to spend some quality time with your cat. You can play with the cat and pet it to distract the cat from all of the stressful noises happening that could startle your cat.

Your cat will be soothed by your presence and will have an easier time adjusting to the scary noises.

, Cat pheromones are chemicals that cats produce naturally. They rub off on things the cat touches and have a calming effect on most cats. There are scientifically reproduced versions of kitty pheromones that you can purchase at your local pet store, which can be used in situations (like Halloween) when your cat is feeling stressed out or agitated.The pheromones come in spray-on options, plug-in diffusers, or even special collars with pheromones on it.
Your cat doesn’t need to wear a pheromone collar all the time, or live in a house that has a pheromone diffuser in each room. But during special times where the cat may be feeling extra anxious, these can be soothing options.

, This is a good way to distract your cat from the noises happening outside and to reassure your kitty and help it feel more calm. Choose something you’re your cat has listened to before and play it for your cat. It may also help mask some of the unfamiliar sounds and keep your cat from startling.Try some classical music or something with a soothing melody.

Control when your cat goes outdoors.,
Place food and water near the cat's shelter.,
Make sure food and water don't freeze.",How to Protect Cats During Winter2," During winter it may be a good idea to make sure your cat doesn't spend all of its time outside. At minimum, make sure that it isn't outside at the coldest times of day and night. Be aware of the weather forecast and bring your cat inside if a storm is expected or the weather is going to get especially cold.

If your temperatures are below zero, consider letting even an outdoor cat spend time indoors, even if its only inside your garage. Domestic cats coats are not made to withstand really, really cold temperatures. They will need your help to stay safe and warm., If your cats are spending a lot of time outside, or you are caring for feral cats, you may need to feed them outside. If you do this, place the food and water close to a shelter area. This will make it so they don't need to go far to get access to it if weather conditions are very bad.If you have already made a small shelter for your cat, for instance out of a foam cooler, consider making a second one to house your cat's food. Placing it next to the cat's shelter will allow the cat to have easy access.

, If you are feeding cats outside during the winter, you need to keep the food and water temperature above freezing. One way to do this is to warm the food or water before putting it out. Warm up each of these things just slightly, so that your cat will have a warm dinner and the food and water won't freeze before the cat can enjoy them.You may also want to consider buying a heated water or food bowl for an outside cat. These products plug into regular outlets and are typically available for purchase online.
It is really important that you don't let your cat's water freeze. A cat can become dehydrated very quickly without access to water. This is particularly important for cats that live outside full time in climates that freeze in the winter. They may have no other access to unfrozen water.

Keep cat beds and litter boxes away from drafts.,
Buy an indoor heated cat bed.,
Keep your cat active.,
Give access to sunshine.",How to Protect Cats During Winter3," Many cats love to have their litter boxes and their beds in out of the way places where they can get a little privacy. However, during the winter you should make sure that the cat's bed and litter box are not so out of the way that they are in cold, drafty locations. Move these items closer to the warm areas of your home, so that your cat doesn't need to get cold to take a nap or go to the bathroom.Also, if you place your cat's litter box in an area that is cold and drafty, the cat is more likely to avoid using it and it might begin going to the bathroom in other places in your home.

, If you want to keep your cat really cozy during the winter, get it a heated cat bed. These beds are available at most pet stores, they plug into regular wall outlets, and they provide gentle heating for your cat.Heated cat beds are particularly good for cats that spend time in cool homes during the day. They can provide your cat a safe place to curl up if it gets chilled.

, If you keep your cat inside during the winter, or limit its time outdoors, you should make sure that it still gets regular and plentiful exercise. Make the time to play with it every day. Provide toys that it enjoys chasing after or batting at even when you are not around.Some simple toys that cats tend to enjoy include toy mice, feathers on sticks, and balls with bells in the middle.

, Even if its cold outside, your cat can benefit from the warmth of the sun. If it is a sunny day outside, make sure that your cat can get to a spot where it can take a nap in the sunshine.If your cat is particularly fond of napping in the sunshine, consider making it a special shelf in your windows for it to soak in the rays.

Enclose your balcony with plastic mesh or wire.,

Put the harness on your cat and let him onto the balcony.,
Tie the leash to an immovable object.,
Always monitor the cat.",How to Make a Balcony Safe for Cats," This is not a cage, but a ""catio"" - a cat patio - that enables your pet to see and sniff the outside in a protected space. ""Catios"" are especially good for city-dwellers and others who don't have backyards but who want their cats to have safe exposure to the outdoors and fresh air.Enclose all or part of the inside perimeter of your balcony by attaching barrier material to the posts or rails. Check carefully to be sure there are no gaps or weak places that the cat can get through.
Wire is stronger and will give better protection. Some cat owners use a wire grid set such as those sold as closet shelving to construct a sturdy barrier. Attach the sections with cable ties.
If you construct a barrier that is not totally enclosed, but adds height to the balcony rail, be aware there is still a risk that your cat may climb out. You know your cat. If he's older, chances are that he will likely just putter around. However, if he is young and hyper or gets distracted easily, he may be more likely to try to escape and potentially fall. If you have any doubts or concerns in the slightest, then make sure the barrier is totally and securely enclosed.
Just because the balcony is enclosed doesn't mean it has to be unattractive or boring for your cat. Cats like to see what's going on, so provide vantage points for your cat, such as perches and posts. Only do this if you have fully enclosed your balcony.;
, If you're handy with tools and have some spare time and basic construction materials (lumber, wire screening or heavy mesh nets, and tools), then you can create your own catio. You can construct a large open-air box, an enclosed shelter, or a long, enclosed walkway (like a catwalk).In other words, you can make it as fancy or as simple as you like.If you need building inspiration or instructions, photos and catio plans are readily available online. Many DIY cat owners who've constructed catios of all sizes have posted their building tips as well as photos and videos of the finished products.Building your own catio, enclosure or cat walk can also be a chance for you to harness your creativity, since you can use different colors and match the catio to your home or apartment.
Making your own catio will also save you the cost of purchasing a commercial catio (see the next step) or paying someone to build it for you., This is a quick fix that doesn't require too much time, money or effort. Set the crate in a place where the cat can have a good view of the outdoor scenery around your balcony and beyond.


Chose the largest crate you can fit in the balcony.
Remember that cats love to be up high to get a good view of what's going on. Consider placing a high perch inside the crate, so the cat can sit higher up.
In addition, remember that your cat cannot escape from the crate so you need to provide all facilities such as water and a litter box. Make sure there is adequate shade and a breeze during the warmer seasons, so your cat doesn't suffer heat stroke.

, There are many websites you can visit to find the one that is best for your cat. One big name in the market is Kittywalk Systems.Cat magazines will often feature ads for all kinds of cat enclosures. Keep in mind that these commercial catios can be expensive and that you could spend up to $2,000, depending on what you are looking for.One of the cheaper options for a balcony is a collapsible, stand-alone enclosure that can be purchased for as little as $40., Make sure there is fresh water available as well as a litter box. There should also be some area on the balcony with shade and a place for the cat to snuggle into when the weather turns cold.


You can even purchase pet-friendly water fountains for your balcony. These serve a dual function by both providing fresh, cool water source for pets and adding a decorative and smoothing touch to your outdoor space., You don't want your cat to ingest any plant material that could be hazardous to his healthIf you still like having plants on your balcony, consider hanging plants and planters or window boxes that can attach to the side of your balcony. This way, you can have the greenery you want and ensure that your cat can't get into the plants., This will give your cat a little more freedom and keep him safe while he is out on the balcony with you. It's important to note that your cat or kitten is never too young to begin learning to wear a harness. There can be benefits to starting young; if you start training your kitten to wear a harness at, say 8 weeks, then he will more easily accept wearing a harness as normal. With that said, it's also possible to train adult cats to wear harnesses; it just takes a bit more patience.


Buy a light-weight ""H"" shaped nylon harness which you can buckle at the neck and around your cat's stomach. Figure ""8"" harnesses tend to enable easier escapes and thus will not work as well for keeping your cat safe.Make sure to get the right size of harness. Measure the cat's neck and stomach with a measuring tape snugly but not tightly. Then purchase the harness that best approximates those measurements.Start by putting on the harness (without the leash) on its slackest setting while giving your cat lots of praise and his favorite treat. Then remove harness after a minute or two. Repeat this at least twice a day for 1-2 weeks and gradually extend the amount of time your cat wears the harness before he gets a treat and your praise. The goal is to get your cat to forget he is wearing the harness and be comfortable in it.How readily your cat accepts the harness is a matter of his individual character and how quick he learns. Male or female, neutered or un-neutered, if the cat is generally sociable and happy to be around people, then you have a good chance of training him to wear a harness.

, Attach the leash to the harness once your cat has been trained and accepts wearing the harness.Fit the harness so that it is snug, but that you are still able to insert two fingers between the straps and the cat. If the harness is too slack, the cat may be able to wriggle free. On the other hand, if the harness is too tight, this can cause discomfort or pain for your cat.Be aware that a regular harness may snap when placed under stress, which would occur if the cat falls off the balcony. Use the harness to restrict the cat's movements so that he cannot reach the balcony rail and thus put himself in a position of danger. If your intention is to use the harness as a safety restraint (e.g., to hold his weight if he falls), then you must buy a harness that is certified as suitable as a car restraint.

, If your intention is to give your cat freedom of the balcony in your absence, then tie the leash to an immovable object, and make sure the cat cannot reach the balcony rail from that position.


Make sure you tied the leash tightly. Double-check the security of your knot by pulling on it a couple of times. If the knot is sturdy, it shouldn't come apart as you tug on it.

, If you're home, keep an eye on your cat as he roams the balcony.

The ID tag should have information such as the cat's name and your phone number. You should also consider a second tag with information that shows your cat is up to date on vaccinations, provided by your vet.Breakaway collars are best because they keep your cat from getting hung up on things, which could strangle them. However, cats are more likely to lose this type of collar since they do breakaway.;
, Another option is a harness, which is a two-part collar. One part goes around the cat's neck and the other part goes under its arms. All of them have a piece that attaches the two circles together along the back and most have a piece that goes along the chest, as well, to keep the collar from choking the cat. If you choose this option, make sure it has a piece that goes along the chest, too.Cats are less likely to strangle themselves with this type of collar, but they can still get snagged by things in the yard. You can find harnesses at your local pet store.
Start by acclimating the cat to the harness. Have treats on hand so the cat associates the harness with good things (food!). Put it on for few minutes several times a day until the cat stops paying attention to it, then put it on when the cat goes outside., Another good option in addition to a collar or harness is microchipping your pet. Microchips are small (think rice-sized) chips that are implanted under your cat's skin by your vet. These chips provide your information when scanned, though you must keep it up to date online. When pets are picked up off the streets, most shelters and vets will check for a microchip so your pet can be returned to you., Another option to keep your cat from running away to danger is walking them on a leash. Just like dogs, some cats can be walked on a leash with the help of a harness. Starting when the cat is a kitten will make the process easier, though you can still try it with an adult cat.Harnesses are much harder for cats to get out of than regular collars, making them more appropriate for walking.
Once a cat is acclimated to a harness, add a leash. Let the leash drag behind the cat around the house, being sure to stay with the cat in case the leash gets caught. Next, pick up the leash and follow the cat around.
Finally, start tugging a little to help guide the cat. When your cat gets used to it, you can start going outside with the cat for short periods. Always be on the lookout for dangers to your cat when you're outside, such as dogs and cars. Also, try not to get too close to something your cat can climb, such as tree trunks, as you may find yourself holding the end of a leash with your cat up in a tree.

, Another option is to take steps to keep your cat in the yard. Having a metal fence made of planks like a wood fence is a way to keep your cat from climbing up and over it. Your cat can't dig their claws into it, so they can't climb over it.Of course, that means it has to be tall enough so your cat can't simply leap to the top and over the fence.
Also, a chain link fence won't work, as your cat can hook their claws or paws over it to climb up the fence.

, If a tree is too close to a fence, your cat may be able to use it to climb up and over. Look for any place in the yard that has things near the fence that a cat could use to get over the fence, including chairs and trellises. Also, check for any places a cat could squeeze through, as they can get through smaller openings than you'd think.To keep your cat from escaping, you might need to move things around in the yard so they aren't close enough to the fence to allow escape. In addition, you may need to cut branches or even trees if they are too close to the fence.
Try to block any escape routes near the ground with boards.

, Another option is creating an area where your cats can enjoy the outside air but not be able to leave. A screened-in porch or even a small screened-in area just for your cats is a perfect way to give your cats a taste of the outside while still protecting them from danger.Ordinary window screening is susceptible to be scratched apart by your cat.
Instead, consider chicken wire, chain link, or even wire mesh hardware cloth. All of these can be used to create an enclosure when they are nailed around a wooden frame. Remember that you will need a roof to keep your cat inside this enclosure.
In addition, you can build a cat door or tunnel that leads out to these areas. That way, your cat can go outside when he or she wants., Another option is a cage or kennel you can buy from a store. These cages are made to keep dogs and cats inside them, so you don't have to worry about strength. Additionally, some come with options for adding slings your cat can lay in. You just pop your cat inside and carry the cage outside., Another option is staying outside with your cat while he or she is out there. While you may not be able to keep the cat from escaping, you can shoo away any other cats or dangers that might enter the yard., When cats go outside, they're exposed to many more diseases than they are when they stay inside. These diseases can be carried by other cats, for instance, or insects that come in contact with your cat. Keeping your cat up on vaccinations helps prevent them from catching these diseases.Even if your cat never comes in contact with another cat, diseases can be left in places like soil, meaning your cat can still catch them.
At the least, your cat should be vaccinated against core diseases once a year. Some vets only recommend every 3 years unless your cat is at a high risk, which outdoor cats are. The core vaccinations are for rabies, feline calicivirus, feline panleukopenia (distemper), and feline viral rhinotracheitis.Make sure your vet knows your cat is an outdoor cat, so she or he can recommend the appropriate vaccinations and schedule.
While your cat is at the vet, it's good to get a checkup, too, as outdoor cats are more likely to run into trouble, including getting into fights, catching parasites and pests, and catching diseases. While you're trying to protect against these problems, your cat may still catch something., If your cat isn't spayed or neutered, he or she is much more likely to come in contact with other cats in search of mating. Contact with other cats is what can lead to diseases as well as scratches from fights. In addition, you won't end up with kittens if you have a female cat.A male cat who isn't neutered will be much more likely to try to escape the yard, as well as wander much farther than a neutered male.It's best to spay or neuter your cats when they are young, between 2 months and 5 months. Experts advise doing so before 5 months because it gives male cats less of a chance to start spraying (all over your house) and less of a chance your female cat will get pregnant.
It's a good idea to spay or neuter your cat anyway, as doing so reduces the risk of them developing cancer and several other problems later in life., If you plan to let your cats out in your yard, they need to be able to defend themselves. Therefore, you need to let your cats keep their claws instead of getting them declawed. Also, claws let the cat climb away from other predators., An outdoor cat is more likely to pick up fleas and ticks. In addition, heartworms are also a concern. Therefore, it's important to make sure that you give them their medication on time once a month. Usually, that is a a pill for fleas and ticks and a pill for heartworms.If you have trouble remembering, set a reminder on your phone.
Your vet can provide you with the appropriate medications.

, Pet insurance is relatively affordable, and it can help you pay for any medical bills that may crop up due to your cat being outside. It works much like human health insurance, where you pay so much per month depending on the coverage you want. You can get anything from catastrophic plans to plans that cover most of the bills and medications., When your cat is outside, make sure to provide access to plenty of fresh water. Though your cat may find other sources, providing clean water ensures your cat will stay hydrated even in hot weather.In the winter, consider using a thick plastic bowl or even a solar heated bowl to keep the water from freezing.
It's best to keep water underneath an overhead cover if possible, to help keep contaminants out of it.

, Believe it or not, cats can get sunburned, particularly light-colored cats. In addition, cats can overheat. Providing access to shade outdoors helps keep your cat safe from the sun., If you take care of a strictly outdoor neighborhood cat, providing shelter in the winter can help keep them alive. Basically, the shelter should be be built to trap the cat's body heat, helping them stay alive through cold winter nights and days.Keep it small. If it's too big, it will allow too much air and heat to escape, and it will be less effective. One easy solution is a storage container with a lid (35 gallon). You can also build small shelters out of wood.
You can cut a hole in the side for the cat to enter. The opening you cut should be about 6-by-6 inches and it should be a few inches from the ground. You may also want to cut one on each side. You may need a rock to hold down the shelter, especially in windy weather.
You also need to insulate the shelter. If you can check on the shelter regularly, straw or pillowcases loosely packed with shredded newspaper or packing peanuts are a good option, as they cat can sink down into it, basically making a nest. However, these types of insulation need to be replaced when they get wet or gross. Another option is adding Mylar to the shelter's walls, floor, and ceiling, which doesn't need to be replaced. Mylar is best where it's really cold. Mylar is a thin plastic sheet that is used to reflect light, but it can also reflect back heat to the outdoor cat.You can staple, tape, or glue the sheet along the walls.
While it's tempting to use things like blankets, towels, and stacks of newspaper, that's not a good idea, as it absorbs heat rather than reflects it back towards the cat.

, In addition to providing necessities, you need to make sure you don't have dangers in your yard that your cat could get into. For instance, any chemicals could be dangerous for your cat.Remove chemicals from the area your cat will be in or lock them up.
Also consider the plants in your yard. Many plants are toxic to animals, and your cat could eat part of one and become sick. Look up the plants in your yard to see if they could be toxic to your cat.

, It's a good idea to only let your cat out when the roads nearby aren't as busy. This step is especially important if you don't want to keep your cat just in your yard. By letting the cat out at low-traffic times, you reduce the risk of the cat being hit by a car.Encourage the cat to come back when things get busy.
One way you can encourage your cat to come in is to have regular meal times around the time that things get busy. Cats usually have a good sense of when dinner is, but you can also make a habit of standing outside and calling the cat home for food (""Spot! Food time!""), which the cat will come to associate with the food."

Check windows that are double-hung. These should slide smoothly up and down. Windows that do not move smoothly or at all can fall on your cat and hurt it.
Make sure latches that secure the window into one place are secure. Faulty latches may make the window fall down, which could harm your cat.
Inspect any screens for tears, rips, or wear.;
, If you discover any damage to a window or windows your cat enjoys, take the time to repair the damage. Not only can this keep your cat safe, but also maintains the integrity of your home.Replace windows, framing, latches, or screens that are severely damaged.
Line a rattling window with some caulk and hammer a few nails into the surrounding frame.
Seal any gap in window frames with some caulking and weather stripping around the frame.
Have a professional repair small window cracks. If the crack is large or there are multiple cracks, consider replacing the windowpane.
Patch holes in screens with a patch kit or according to their material. Use instant adhesive on nylon or fiberglass screens. Epoxy can fill holes in metal screens., If you don’t already have them, install window screens either throughout your home or in windows your cat likes to perch. Window screens allow your cat to enjoy a bit more of the outdoors than it would with closed windows. They also minimize the risk that your cat will fall out of the window.


Avoid sliding screens, which your cat may be able to manipulate.Get mosquito screens or pet-specific screens. You can get both types in a variety of materials such as vinyl, metal, nylon, or fiberglass.Add safety locks or screw the screen in place to prevent your cat from accidentally opening the window.Make sure the screens are securely installed before you allow your cat to enjoy them.

, Some homes have windows that open at the top and bottom. Check to see if your windows open from the top. If they do, consider letting your kitty get a smell of the outdoors and stay safe by only opening this portion of the window.Check if your windows are “hotel-style” instead of top and bottom. You can open these windows to the side instead of out, which may also minimize the risk of injury for your cat.

, Blinds or curtains on your windows can present a choking or strangling hazard for cats. Getting rid of any dangling fabric or pull cords may minimize the risk of your cat injuring itself when enjoying its window seat.Consider removing blinds completely if your cat tends to lunge at the window. This can keep your cat from getting stuck or injuring itself.

, Any time that you are not at home, close your windows. This is one of the best ways to ensure that your cat stays safe in a window.

This could be a cat tree or “catio” you make.

, Cats are able to sit in windows for hours on end. If your cat loves its window time, construct a perch or window bed—a “catio”—for your cat to enjoy. This can provide a safe, non-slippery surface to enjoy the outdoors.Use an old tray or other surface that fits your cat. Sand and scuff it up a bit. Glue on a piece of colorful fabric, wallpaper, or wrapping paper to the bottom of the tray.Sew a pillowcase or use an old pillowcase and place a pillow in it as a seat for your cat.
Add catnip-filled toys to the “catio” bed. Drill a hole in the tray and attach the toys with an eye screw.
Drill holes for brackets in the seam of the window and in the tray. Then secure the brackets with screws and let your kitty enjoy its new “catio” space.
Make any window sill into a “catio” if you don’t want to drill holes in your wall. Simply cover the sill with a piece of fabric and some batting for padding. This can provide as much enjoyment as a “catio” bed.

, Cats love to watch and hunt small animals such as birds. They can watch and “hunt” from a window but you may be concerned about your cat being in the window. Make or buy a “cat tree” so that your cat can watch birds, squirrels and other small creatures.This may be an especially great way to amuse indoor cats, or outdoor cats that may be inside.


Make your “cat tree” using things you have around the house. You may also want to consider building an actual “cat tree” with different level perches. Most pet stores also sell pre-fabricated “cat trees.”
Place the “cat tree” near a window where your cat likes to sit. Having the different perches will give her different types of enjoyment that a window seat can’t provide.
Open blinds or curtains so that your cat can watch what’s happening outside. Your cat may have so much fun that it makes noises or lunges at the window to “capture” prey.Add features such as branches or hanging toys to make the cat tree interesting., If your windows aren’t safe for your cat, try bringing some of the outdoors inside for it. Provide your cat any of the following to give it the enjoyment of the outdoors without sitting in the window or going outside:Cat grass, which you can purchase or grow yourself
Pesticide-free alfalfa
Bird seed
Catnip
Tires
Toys hanging from branches, especially life-like birds
Videos of birds or other animalsScratching pad made of natural fibers such as sisal

Keep searching.",How to Find a Lost Cat1," If you conduct an extensive search immediately, there's a good chance you'll find the cat close to the location where it was lost.The more time has passed increases the opportunity for the cat to roam further from home.


Stay calm. It is natural to feel upset, but getting into a panic won't help you or your cat. Taking action immediately can mitigate anxiety.
If you recently moved, go back to your old place and search. If you moved really far from your original home, ask friends, family, and old neighbors who are still living there to search for you.;
, Even in daylight, bring a flashlight so you can look in dark places, and catch the reflection of your cat's eyes.

, Don't assume your cat will respond to your voice as it normally does. A lost cat is usually a terrified cat, and may not want to leave its hiding spot even for you. Call for it in a soft, quiet voice, to avoid scaring the cat further., A cat that is trapped, hurt or hungry will likely meow. Whether you're searching by yourself or with a group, take a few minutes in every area you search to listen quietly and attentively for the cat's meow.

, Another cat in the area could have chased your cat away, especially if that cat or you have recently moved there.Ask other cat owners to keep their pets inside while you look for yours, and be prepared to increase the scope of your search as you cover the ground closest to home.


If you have dogs, their enthusiasm may frighten your cat during the search. However, if your dog enjoys looking for the cat or responds to ""Find the cat,"" it may be useful to bring the dog if you can't find the cat yourself.

, If your cat has a favorite toy on a string or wand, like a stuffed mouse or feather, take it with you while you search and make it very visible, like you want the cat to play with you; this may allay fears and bring the cat out of hiding.

, Warn anyone searching that if they do spot the cat, remain quiet and do not chase! It's best for the owner to approach the cat, especially since the cat it likely to be very frightened.


Trade cell phone contact information with everyone involved in the search, and supply each person with a flashlight, even in daylight.

, Whenever someone walks by, ask whether he has seen your cat, showing a photograph if you have one.


Postal workers, children, and other people who spend a lot of time outside in your neighborhood can be useful resources and scouts.
Offering a reward increases motivation, even with relatively small rewards.

, If you were searching during the day, return and repeat the steps above after it grows dark when it is more quiet. Bring a flashlight, and call softly to your cat. Lost cats are sometimes more willing to leave their hiding places at night, when they can rely on the darkness for safety.

, You may be able to catch a picture of the cat on camera so that you know they are nearby and focus your search., Most cats will hide instead of run when they're lost or in a scary situation.

Recognize signs of a fearful cat.,
Isolate the cat’s fear triggers.,
Give your cat space.,
Use food to motivate your cat.,
Provide a high perch.","How to Form a Bond With an Angry, Scared Cat1"," Cats are certainly adept at communicating when they’re angry—hissing, growling, flattening their ears, and fur standing on end is hard to miss.However, general aggression is just one of many behaviors associated with a frightened cat. Other behaviors to look for include:Hiding or running away
Freezing in place
Releasing anal glands, urine, or stool
Not using the litter box;
, Your cat may have a consistent set of triggers—such as sounds, people, etc.—that cause the fearful reaction. In many cases, you may be able to help the cat adjust by simply reducing the cat’s exposure to the trigger of the fear or aggression. Common examples include:Loud sounds or quick, unexpected movements
Strange or new environments
Unfamiliar people or animals
Active, unpredictable children
Stressful events (moving and trips to the vet, especially)

, For many stimuli that trigger a fearful response in your cat, the answer is simply to give your cat some time and space alone.If the stressful occurrence caused your cat to hide in her carrier or another favorite hiding spot, then leave her be. She’ll get over it accordingly.


Note that while a sound might make her hide for a few minutes, something like moving to a new home might make her scarce for days. Make sure she has access to food, water, and her litter box to use nearby.Trying to force your cat out of a hiding spot before she’s ready will only stress her out more and amplify the fearful response.Don’t take it personally as though she’s afraid of you.
When helping an aggressive or fearful cat after a move, you may want to introduce her to the new home one room at a time. Start with a calm secluded room where you can put her carrier, toys, food/water, and litter box (on the other side of the room from the food/water)., Cats respond to few things as well as food. If your cat has a fearful response to a friend or a new roommate who you’d really like the cat to bond with, then put that person on food and treat duty.Start by having the person fill the cat’s food dish and then simply sit on the other side of the room without making eye contact or otherwise paying any attention to the cat.Have the person move slightly closer over the course of several repetitions.


Have the person give her treats as well. Set the treat out where your cat can see it and then move away to a similar distance, moving closer over time. Your cat will begin to associate this person with good things instead of treating the person as a fear trigger.Remember to let your cat set her own pace. Luring her out is not the same as forcing her. Ultimately, she needs to choose to come toward the person.

, Cats love to be up above the action where they can look down and survey in safety. If the fearful response stems from an overactive toddler or a new animal in the house, then a cat tower where your cat can retreat is a great option.Even the option of a cat tower can help calm your cat. Your cat is much more likely to respond fearfully to a situation if she feels cornered. If she always knows that she has her tower to escape to, then she’s less likely to respond aggressively when she can just run away to her safe spot.

Search hiding spots.,
Search the area five houses out by day.,
Look in high places.,
Search in warm places.,
Search your neighbors' houses and yards.,
Think of places the cat could be trapped.,
Search inside as well.",How to Find a Lost Cat2," When a cat becomes lost and scared, it will often run to the first hiding place it sees. Search in dense foliage, under porches, in crawlspaces, and in garages and sheds. Start near the place the cat was lost and search outward.


Also check under in sewer drains, and inside pipes and vents.

, Many cats will hide and stay silent for a few days until they respond to your calls. Go back over the same ground near your house and have the person the cat will most likely respond to call out for them.

, Even a declawed cat can still climb, especially when scared. Look up trees, on rooftops, and in high corners. The cat may even have crawled into the join between the roof and the walls, if there is an opening there.

, If the weather is cold, your cat may get stuck behind a heating appliance, crawl into a heating vent, or even climb onto the engine of a car from below.

, Knock on the doors of all homes and businesses within a few doors of the location where your cat was last seen. Ask permission to search the areas around their buildings as well, again focusing on hiding places.


If there is any way for a cat to get inside those buildings, ask if the owner would be willing to search inside as well. Suggest searching for the cat yourself if they are not willing or able.

, Here are a few examples of how cats are sometimes trapped:Construction sites often contain pits, rubble, or equipment that could trap the cat.
The neighbors may have locked the cat into a garage without noticing. Phone neighbors who recently left for vacation, or have another reason for not returning their car to the garage.
Your cat may have jumped into a car, delivery truck, or moving truck and been driven away. This is more likely if your cat enjoys car rides or exploring cars.

, Your cat could be trapped or injured underneath furniture, in a locked room or closet, or in an area you rarely visit such as an attic or basement. It could even just be hiding, especially if there are currently loud, unfamiliar noises in your house or neighborhood.

Set a humane trap.,
Use catnip as bait.,
Empty your vacuum cleaner bag outside.",How to Find a Lost Cat3," Tempt your cat out of hiding or back home by calling him/her and shaking the normal box of dry food or treats. The sound of opening a can of cat food may get a response, and if the food has a really strong scent, the cat might even respond to the smell. Lost cats are usually too wary to approach sounds, even familiar ones, but this may work in the middle of the night, when it is dark and no one is around.
Pause and listen for a response after each call.

, Your cat's litter box and/or a familiar toy or blanket can help the cat pick up on the scent and hang around longer if it visits in the night. If these materials are not available, try leaving an unwashed shirt, worn next to your skin, outside the door.

, Strong-smelling food like wet cat food, tuna, or liver can attract your cat – or other cats and wildlife that could scare your cat away. This step is recommended by many pet advice organizations, but ideally you should be prepared to chase off raccoons, foxes, and other cats.

This will cause animals (hopefully your cat) to smell the food without being able to get at it, and may cause them to hang around your door longer.Leave out some sardines. Ordinary cat food won't work. The sardines will attract your cat., Cats are highly territorial and are likely to come home from time to time. However, if there's no one home, they may wander off again.

, Keep the other end of the baby monitor by your bed, loud enough that you'll be woken up if your cat shows up and meows.

, Many animal shelters will rent or lend traps that are easy to use. Feed stores even sell them. Don't forget to put some cat food in the trap, and even sprinkle liberally with treats and catnip.


Check the trap daily. If a wild animal is caught in it, contact animal control to remove it.

, Spray catnip scent or sprinkle catnip around your front door and surrounding area. This option may not be wise if your neighbors own cats.

They will use a litter box if it is provided, only eliminating waste outside this box or other designated area (like loose sand or earth in the yard) in times of distress.Peeing outside a litter box is a sign that something is wrong rather than an act of rebellion. The cat may be ill or highly stressed, and when you see this behavior, you need to pay attention.
Do not attempt to punish a cat who urinates outside its bathroom area. The cat isn’t trying to make a mess—it is trying to communicate that it needs help. Punishment will further stress and frighten the cat.
There are other reasons a cat may choose to defecate outside the litter box, such as discomforts. Make sure you eliminate these before concluding that your cat is stressed.;
, Aside from location of urination, you should watch for diarrhea and constipation. Changes in a cat’s environment cause stress, and bowel movements are often affected.


You can spot cat diarrhea by its soft, watery texture and either light brown or dark brown color.
If there is blood in the diarrhea, you actually don’t need to worry about it unless there is a very large amount of blood.Take your cat to the vet if it persists in passing diarrhea stools, or can’t pass stools at all, for more than a few days.

, One response to stress in a cat is a loss of interest in food. Cats often become solitary and avoid things they usually enjoy when stressed, including food and mealtimes.Cats don’t go on fasts like humans sometimes do, so avoiding food is a warning that something is wrong.
If you leave your cat a bowl of food as you leave the house for the day, keep an eye on how much is left in it when you get home. If someone else feeds the cat, tell them to carefully observe the cat’s eating habits each day if you suspect the cat is stressed.

, Of course we all know how often cats groom, licking themselves and their kittens most of day. But when you notice that your cat can’t seem to do anything else, you should be alarmed. This isn’t normal, and is often a sign that something is wrong; it's even a sign of depression.They can potentially lick hair off their bodies. If you notice patches of hair falling off your cat without any other signs of infection, you probably are dealing with excessive grooming.
If you determine excessive grooming is the cause of bald spots on your cat, seek out a vet for advice.

, Although cats can scratch for many different reasons, including fleas and skin infections, scratching compulsively all day is a sign of stress. Take action if you see excessive scratching by either determining a source of stress or contacting the vet.


Fleas can keep cats pawing and scratching incessantly, especially if they are allergic to flea saliva. Make an effort to keep your cat free of fleas before determining its excessive scratching is related to stress.
Check for scratches, scabs, or bumps under your cat's fur.If you don't find any of these signs of infection, tithe scratching may indeed be related to stress.

, When cats become stressed, they can reduce the amount of sleep they get.If your cat is showing signs of restlessness, pay attention.

, Even though cats aren’t known for being the friendliest creatures, often preferring to be by themselves rather than constantly in owners’ arms, they should not be constantly trying to get away from people. This can be a sign that they need a reduction in environmental stressors.If your cat consistently ducks out of the room or dodges behind furniture every time someone enters the room, you should try to figure out what’s wrong.
New cats may hide more than cats who are accustomed to their homes, so don’t be alarmed if your new cat hides for a while after moving in., If you have a cat cohabitating with other pets, it should be easy to tell if aggression is a normal behavior or not. If your cat consistently snaps at or picks fights with animals it used to play happily with, the cat very well may be stressed.Your cat may be sick instead of stressed, so identify any stressors that could be triggering this behavior before heading to the vet.

, You are also probably attuned to how your cat interacts with other humans. If your cat used to be warm toward people, or even passively accepted their presence, and suddenly starts lashing out, you have a problem.Again, if you are mystified by this aggression, take stock of your home environment and identify any stressors. If there aren’t any, the cat may be sick.

, There are many reasons why a cat may be living in a state of constant stress, and most of them have to do with changes in its environment. If you think your cat is stressed, look around for ways to Reduce Stress in Cats or help them adjust.


Stressors can include changes in routine, a new pet or person in the home (or a pet or person leaving the home), new smells, new noises, new furniture, construction in your home’s vicinity, moving, even a new cat in the neighborhood., One way to help eliminate stress if you suspect your cat is suffering is to make sure you are keeping a set schedule, at least for the cat. Changes in routine, or not having a daily routine in the first place, can keep your pet in a constant state of stress even if nothing else is going on. And if there are other stressors, making a schedule can only help.If there is only a temporary change going on, such as vacation, get back into the old routine as quickly as possible.

, The principal is true for both cats and humans—physical activity takes away stress. Playing with your cat just 20 to 30 minutes split into two segments (like morning and afternoon) may relax it.Keep playtime as part of any routine so that your cat can get out nervous energy and be distracted from fixating on any changes until they are complete.
Give the cat some toys, rotating them on a monthly basis to maintain interest.
End by offering the cat a treat, or schedule playtime just before a meal.

, For any of the symptoms listed in these steps, you can contact a vet for advice. Some of these symptoms may indicate a problem other than stress, so getting cleared by the vet first may make it easier to clear out stressors.

If you’re adopting a cat from a rescue, then you’ll likely receive this documentation with the cat. If you’re taking in a stray, then you should absolutely take her to the vet before bringing her into your house. Sick cats can potentially transmit diseases to you or your loved ones, and they’re more likely to be aggressive, which can result in injury.

, New owners, a new environment, and a disruption to the cat’s previous routine are all triggers for a fearful response from a cat. In an effort not to overwhelm the cat, isolate her to one room as she adjusts to her new home. Place her food, water, toys, and litter box all in the same area, as well as her carrier where she can hide.Leave the door open, so she can explore at her own pace, but don’t try to force her away from this space.

, Bonding over food is always a safe bet with cats. You want her to begin associating you with delicious food and treats.Don’t try to feed her by hand though. Make noise with the food bag or bag of treats so she knows you have something good for her, and then place the dish down and sit close by. Over the course of many repetitions, move closer to the dish without looking at the cat or trying to pet her. Simply help her acclimate to you being in the same space.

, Playing with a cat is another great way to bond.Don’t attempt to touch the cat. Instead, buy wand toys with dangling feathers or catnip toys attached. These will allow you to play with your cat at a distance that is more comfortable for her.


If she won’t come out of her carrier at first, try dangling the toy near the entrance and making it jiggle for several minutes to see if you can entice her out. If not, try again later.

, As you start trying to make actual contact with your cat, ensure that you allow her to approach you above all.As she gets curious and begins getting closer to you and sniffing in your general direction, you can slowly put your hand out and see if she’ll get close enough to sniff you directly. Always wait for her to rub up against you first initially, and don’t get frustrated if she backs away when you pet her.


To help increase her curiosity, sit near your cat, avoid eye contact, and talk to her in a soothing voice.Never chase your cat or try to drag her out of her hiding places.This will only stress her out and lead to another fearful response.

, Even cats that have bonded with their owners for years often do not like being picked up.You can find out if your cat minds you picking her up in due time, but never test it while you’re still in the process of acclimating her to you and your home.

, Rather than pushing your luck with your cat and risking her running away, let her set the pace and end each training session on a positive note with a treat. Just as you let her approach you and brush up against you, let her decide when to walk away as well. Don’t try to force the bonding session to last longer than your cat wants.

, Remember that your cat will adjust on her schedule, not yours. Having the patience to continuously show her that you are calm and safe goes a long way. Some cats may warm to you in days whereas others may take months. Cats enjoy routine, so stay consistent with providing her food, treats, and playtime, and she will eventually bond with you enough to approach you and sit on your lap.

, If your new cat continues to hiss, growl, or even bite and scratch at you despite your best efforts to bond with her, then call a local cat behavior specialist.A specialist may be capable of helping to determine anything wrong with your approach, as well as offering additional advice on how to proceed.


If your cat shows aggressive behavior that you fear might be a danger to you or others in your household, then isolate her to one room until you can contact the specialist.If she actually manages to bite or scratch you, then wash the area well and apply an antibiotic ointment. Also, ensure that you see a doctor at the first sign of a possible infection."

Check ""found"" sections on Craigslist, newspapers and online classifieds.,
Hire a “Cat Detective or a ""Lost Cat Finder"" who specializes in lost cats.” Pet detectives are available in most states trained in finding lost pets.",How to Find a Lost Cat4," If your cat is missing for more than a few hours, talk to your neighbors and make fliers to put under door handles. Put your name, phone number, and a photo of your cat on the flier. Describe any distinguishing marks (such as, ""triangular white spot on shoulder""), and write the coat color if you're distributing black-and-white fliers. Search for online templates for ""lost cat posters"" if you're not sure how to make one from scratch.


Include relevant information about specific dietary or medical conditions if life threatening.
Ask neighbors to kindly check their sheds, garages and basements. Closest neighbors that the cat is reasonably familiar with are good places to check with first.
Offering a reward can be good motivation and can get people out looking instead of ""keeping an eye out.""
If you receive a report of a cat sighting that doesn't quite match your cat's description, visit the location anyway to make sure. Descriptions from strangers often don't match the description you would give the cat.
Keep info on posters large, easy to read and simple. Include the relevant facts only.

, Implanting a microchip is a very common procedure and only needs to be done once in a pet’s life. Microchips are implanted by a veterinary professional under the skin over the shoulder blades of the cat. The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and carries a unique code that can be read by a scanner when the hand held scanning device is waved over the pet’s body.


When the chip is implanted in the pet, the owner provides registration information to the microchip company that will be kept on file until the owner changes that information.
The code will be linked to the owner’s information through the microchip’s database. When the scanner reveals the code, the microchip company can then be contacted with the code and the owner’s information will be available. Most veterinarians and animal shelters will check for a microchip for no charge when a stray cat is brought in.

, It's best to post as many fliers as you can within a one mile radius of your home. Beyond that, there are several strategies for using your fliers effectively, and places that may be worth walking a longer distance to cover:Give fliers to veterinary offices, in case someone takes your cat there to treat injuries or begin an adoption process.
Post fliers near schools and playgrounds, at children's eye level. Children are often more observant than adults, especially at noticing animals.
Dog runs, dog parks, pet supply stores, and pet grooming salons are all visited by pet-friendly people who are more likely to search actively.
Post on community message boards at laundromats, churches, missing pet websites, schools, pet stores, libraries, and grocery stores, or any other businesses that allows it in your neighborhood.

, Many finders of pets search for owners online; think about posting a picture of your pet or searching for it on one of numerous pet recovery websites, local community sites, the local Craigslist lost pet section, and anywhere else you can think of. Include up to date contact information on all posts.


Lost pet tracking websites include Missing Pet, Pets911, and TabbyTracker. FindToto for US residents costs money to use, but will broadcast a ""Pet Amber Alert"" to neighbors in your area.
Twitter and Facebook can be used to spread the word among your network of friends. Be sure to include a photo or two.
If your neighborhood association has an email news digest or web site, post a Lost Cat notice. Remember to include the cat's name, description and temperament.

, Pay a local newspaper to place a lost cat ad, including a description and your phone number. The more local to the area the newspaper is, the better. If no local newspaper serves your area, ask about community newsletters at a community center, a police or sheriff's station, or a local government building.

, Record a new voice mail message to make sure callers leave all relevant information. For example, say ""You've reached (name). If you're calling about my lost cat, (name), please leave a message with the date and place you last saw him, along with your name and phone number. Thank you."", Usually if someone comes across a lost cat, they'll report it to the SPCA, Animal Control or your local equivalent. Call your local animal shelter and report your cat has gone missing along with all the relevant details (sex of the cat, color, and your contact information). Visit them every day or two until your cat is found, as sometimes shelters have many cats and have a difficult time matching your description to what they have.


Some shelters keep a log of lost pet announcements so that they have records of your information should a similar animal come into their facility. It never hurts to make friends with the front staff at the shelter to make them personally aware of your situation and your pet’s description. Home baked goods break a lot of ice anywhere you ask for help.

, If your cat has been taken to a crowded shelter or local pound, they may only be able to hold cats for a few days before euthanizing the cat. If the staff know you're actively looking, they can be a great ally. Ask them to call you if a cat fitting your cat's description turns up.

, Sometimes, police get calls about found animals, especially in areas without shelters. Officers who spend their day driving around might notice your cat.


Do not call the emergency number for your police department! Call the non-emergency 311 number or just talk to your local patrolman instead. While your lost cat is an emergency to you, police need to prioritize incidents involving people.

, Check local newspapers and popular online sites daily under the ""found"" section. Many animal shelters have websites that show pictures of captured, stray animals, so check the website daily or more frequently. Search for ""lost pets"" + the name of your region to discover additional local websites.

Keep the toilet lid down at all times when it is not in use.,
Use a babyproof mechanism for the cat that lifts the lid.,
Keep the bathroom door shut.,
Lure the cat away from the toilet corner.,
Get a motion sensor statue that makes noise.,
Be sure that your cat is getting adequate water.",How to Cat Proof Your Toilet," This includes training those members of the household who prefer leaving up every part of the toilet lid. It will stop the cat from getting into the bowl and no more drinking of the toilet water.


Consider leaving reminder signs asking everyone, including yourself, to keep the lid shut. Remind people of the consequences otherwise––getting a nose rub from a kitty that has stuck its face into the bowl water.;
, If your cat is smart or simply persistent, you may need to use a babyproofing toilet seat lock to keep the lid locked down. If this is the case, be sure to show everyone in the house how to open and close this item. They're very simple to use and don't cost more than a few dollars.


The lock should be washed regularly, to prevent germ build-up.

, Make the bathroom off limits to your cat. This isn't always ideal, unless you are all used to keeping the door shut. Moreover, there may be an occasion when your cat needs to be in the bathroom, such as for a bath or if it suddenly vomits a fur ball and you'd rather save the carpet than the bathroom tiles. However, it can be a good fix for most of the time.


Consider a door that shuts itself automatically. This could be done by weighting the door or using a special lock.

, Keep a bowl of drinking water in the bathroom but at the opposite side form the toilet. Provided it's in an easily accessible spot, the cat will usually prefer the easier and more dignified option of the water bowl.

, Place it right by the toilet area, so that when the cat crosses to go there, it gets a fright from the awful noise made by the motion sensor creature. This may wear off in time, although it might provide fun fodder for YouTube videos in the meantime.

, Always keep its water bowl filled near the food supply and if possible, especially if you live somewhere hot, have several bowls around the inside of the house, and the outside, if relevant. The cat that can access sufficient water won't be so fascinated by the toilet bowl. Unless, of course, it's become a bad habit.

, Cats are nocturnal, so they are more likely to be active at night. You can try turning out all the lights in your house and sitting quietly, listening for any sounds of movement. If you can't find your cat during the day, you may also want to search again when it is dark outside.

, You can try shaking a bag of treats, but they may not hear you or be able to resist the temptation. Try finding something very fragrant, like a stinky cheese or a particularly smelly fish. Warm it up in the microwave or oven so that the smell is more pungent and carry it around the house, wafting the smell out with your hand as you search. Your cat may not be able to resist.

, If you have been searching, having looked everywhere you can think, then you might want to wait for a while. Your cat may have found a hiding spot that you have missed and may just be taking a nap there.If you can't find your indoor cat after intensive searching, try waiting for an hour before expanding the search.

Create barriers to cat access.,
Make the surface unattractive to cats.,
Use cat-repelling spray.",How to Cat Proof Your Computer2," If you don't want your cat on your desk, you can try to block the cat from jumping up on it. Make the desk unpleasant by having books, papers, or stationary act as hurdles or barriers.

Just be careful though, as a pile of papers can be enticing and can easily tip over with a cat landing on it.

, Adhesive tape can put off many cats from clambering around the desk, as they don't like stepping on the sticky side of adhesive tape. Try placing double-sided tape or loops of packing tape in their way to discourage them.

The only downside of this is when you forget and stick yourself to the desk too!

, If your cat shows an unabated interest in your computing equipment and cords, try a cat repellent spray. There are various commercial and homemade sprays available that are designed to smell bad to cats. These can be helpful in communicating which furnishings are off-limits, perhaps even including your desk chair if it serves as a step up to the desk for the ultra lazy cat.


When using any sprays or moist repellents, make sure that you keep any dampness away from the open or fragile areas of your computing equipment. A little ill-placed moisture is death to electronics.

Give your cat a designated area close to you.,
Allow your cat on your lap.,
Don't encourage your cat to play with your computer.,
Give your cat toys.,
Spend quality time with your cat.",How to Cat Proof Your Computer3," If your cat likes to snuggle with you and is less interested in playing with your computer than in getting close to you, then you may just need to give it a place to curl up than isn't your keyboard. Provide distinct ""safe zones"" for your cat, such as a basket that is located near you but not next to the computer.

Place a comfy cat basket on top of a filing cabinet situated alongside your desk. This will let your cat know it's allowed there and that it can still view the action, including eyeballing you when needed.

, Be sure there's enough space for your cat to get into your lap. Typing over its back may be just enough intimacy if what it wanted was to get your attention rather than just to get at your computer.

This will only work for certain cats. If your cat is more playful than cuddly, then it is not likely to be content with a place to curl up.

, While it's cute when a cat chases something on a computer screen or lies across a keyboard once in awhile, allowing them to keep doing this cements the habit and encourages them to do it again. Don't start the habit and your cat is likely to be attracted to your computer in the first place.Be tough and remove your cat as soon as the activity starts, and keep doing it until it gets the point.

, Be sure to give your some toys to replace the fun you are denying it by keeping it away from your computer. Some fake mice, jumping things on a stick, and small balls are all great distractions to get it interested in something more suitable than the computer.

Place toys near the desk so that your cat can play with them while you get some work done.

, If your cat keeps trying to play with your computer or walks across your keyboard, you may be able to shift its focus by playing with it somewhere else. If you leave the computer area and your cat follows you, this may be a sign it simply wants to spend time with you.

If so, take a break, and play with the cat until you've both had a good break. If your cat gets tired enough, then you can get back to your computing uninterrupted.

Give your cat short bursts of attention.,
Reward good behavior and ignore bad behavior.,
Leave and enter your home calmly.,
Hire a pet sitter.,
Do not punish your cat.",How to Fix Clinginess in Cats1," A clingy cat doesn’t necessarily need long stretches of attention from its owner. A few minutes of attention may be just enough.When your cat is being clingy, consider playing a brief interactive game with your cat, such as flashing a laser light on the floor for your cat to chase.


If your cat has trouble moving around, consider petting for it a few minutes.
If your cat is persistently clingy, it may not be practical to give frequent bursts of attention.;
, Your cat may try to get your attention in different ways, such as scratching the sofa, meowing persistently, or just rubbing up against your leg. How you react will either encourage or discourage the clinginess. For example, if you reward your cat with positive attention after it scratches the sofa, you will encourage that behavior.If your cat is doing something undesirable to get your attention, simply ignore it.Ignoring the bad clingy behavior will discourage your cat from repeating it.
It may be hard to decide whether to ignore the behavior or give your cat a short burst of attention. If the behavior is destructive or highly annoying to you, do not give your cat those few minutes of attention.

, Clinginess in cats is a sign of separation anxiety. If your cat meows loudly when you leave and nearly leaps on you when you walk in the door, try making your departures and arrivals low key.If you don't make a big deal of leaving or arriving, your cat may not feel the need to become anxious and clingy. Below are some ways to keep things low key:Leave your home quietly. When you get back home, wait for a few minutes before giving your cat attention.
Desensitize your cat to your departure. For example, pick up your keys and place them back down without leaving. Also, open and close the door without leaving. Eventually, your cat will see these as normal actions that aren’t worth getting worked up about.

, During the day, cats can become bored when their owners aren’t home. When the owners do get back home, the cats can become very clingy. If you notice your cat is more clingy when you come home, consider hiring a pet sitter who can play and interact with your cat during the day.Ask your vet or other pet owners for recommendations on pet sitters in your area.

, Clinginess in cats can be a big nuisance. Even if you are annoyed and frustrated with your cat’s clinginess, do not punish it by yelling at it or locking it away from you or your family. Harsh punishment will worsen the clinginess. Instead, be patient and gentle with your cat."

Close all doors and windows.,
Get your cat to go into a room far away from the fireworks.,
Do not try to hold her.,
Use a crate.,
Play calming music.,
Try an herbal remedy.,
Talk to your cat in calming words.,
Find or record a quality video of fireworks.,
Play the video at a low volume.,
Increase the volume.,
Continue increasing the volume each time you play the video.",How to Keep a Cat Calm During Fireworks," It is extremely important that you do not open doors or windows while your cat is highly agitated, because she may panic at the sound and bolt outside. Many pets who have run outdoors during fireworks have been lost or run over.


Additionally, closing doors and windows will stop some of the explosion-like sounds from coming into your house.;
, For example, if your bedroom is the farthest to the west of your house, and the fireworks are to the east, you would obviously pick your bedroom.


Be careful picking up the cat, as they will probably be terrified and jumpy. At the same time, they may love having someone they know there comforting and loving them. It depends on what personality type your cat has.
If your cat seems liable to claw you because she is so frightened, drop a towel or throw blanket over her body and pick her up using the blanket instead. Be sure to speak soothing words to her as you do so, to help her understand that you are trying to help.

, Except to move her to a safe location, it is unwise and unnecessary to try to hold a cat while she is panicking unless she seems to prefer being held.


Holding a panicky cat can result in scratches and bites as well as injuries to the cat herself, who might strain her muscles or hit her head trying to get away from you.

, If your cat is crate trained and does not have negative experiences in a pet crate, a small crate like a pet taxi can be a great place to keep her safe during fireworks. It keeps her from running around, escaping the house, or hurting herself or others because she is confined in a small space.


It also has the added benefit of helping her to feel secure and cozy. Try putting her favorite treat or toy in the crate along with a blanket or towel that smells like you.
However, if your cat does not like to be crated, now is not the time to try to get her to use one. A highly agitated cat will only panic more if you put her in a crate against her will.

, Don't blast it, or try to drown out the sound of the fireworks. Play the music at a normal volume level. Just enough so you can easily hear the music. Piano playing music is great.


If you typically keep a television on in your home, consider putting it on your regular programming at a slightly increased volume from what you normally use. This way the sound of the television will help drown out a bit of the fireworks while also helping her feel that everything is normal.

, There are several herbs that are tasty and appealing to cats and that have stress-reducing properties. Try one or more of these:


Catnip is a classic cat treat, which helps your cat feel less stressed by giving a slight feeling of drunkenness and calmness. Because it first works by stimulating the cat and then causes feelings of calm, you should give it to her fifteen minutes before the fireworks begin.Keep a plant of live catnip in your home for special occasions, or purchase a toy that is infused with cat nip.
Try valerian root, which has the same effect as catnip but usually results in a cat falling asleep. That should definitely calm her down!Experiment with dried flowers. There are a few types that are soothing and safe for cats: chamomile, hops, and a combination sold under the name Bach Rescue Remedy. You can find all of these online or in some health food stores., Use a calm, relaxed voice, say things along the lines of ""It's okay honey"" or ""Calm down, it's ok."" Stroke her gently.


It really doesn't matter what you say. If your cat is used to your voice and loves you, she will likely be comforted by anything you say. In fact, you could read the newspaper aloud or read your favorite novel and she wouldn't mind. It would help to reassure her that you are with her and not leaving her.

, You will need this video to play for your cat, to help her acclimate to the sound and appearance of fireworks.


You can do an internet video search for fireworks, or record a high quality video of your own if you happen to be around fireworks frequently.
Look for videos that feature a very high sound quality in particular, with clear ""booming"" sounds at irregular intervals.

, If possible, play it on your television or other large screen so that your cat can hear and see it. You want it to be loud enough to hear, but not loud enough to be frightening.


Play the video or put it on repeat for about fifteen minutes, or however long fireworks displays typically last in your area.

, Over the course of a few days, play the video once or twice a day over the next few days, increasing the volume just a bit each time.


Try to make the volume increase subtle enough that she doesn't notice it, but if you only have a few days to prepare her for a real fireworks display, you can increase it a little more each time as necessary.

, Do not burst your speakers, but eventually you want to increase as high as you can without damaging your ears or your sound system.


The goal is to get the volume of the video as close to the sound of real, booming fireworks as possible so that your cat learn to accept the sound without fear.
Reduce the volume and try again if your cat seems fearful at any time during this process.

Assess whether your cat has a jaw fracture.,
Look for the signs of a limb or pelvis fracture.,
Be aware of the symptoms of a rib fracture.,
Assess whether your cat has a broken tail.,
Take your cat to its veterinarian.,
Allow your veterinarian to take X-rays of the area.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Fractures in Cats," These include both physical and behavioral signs that your cat is having problems with its jaw. The signs of a jaw fracture include:Inability to close the mouth
Pain and swelling around the jaw and face
Reluctant to eat
Other injuries especially around the head
Bleeding from the mouth and/or nose
Obvious deformity of the jaw and/or face
Broken teeth
Drooling blood-tinged saliva;
, When either the front or back leg or the pelvis is broken, a cat will show a number of signs that indicate there is a serious problem going on. There is always a chance that in addition to the broken limb or pelvis another part of the cat’s body may be injured so keep that in mind when examining the cat for injuries and exercise caution as you do so. The signs of a limb or pelvis fracture include:Limping
Unable to bear weight on the affected leg
Swelling
Pain when area is touched or move
Refusing to walk
Hiding

, Rib fractures are very serious. This is a medical emergency and your cat will need to be taken to a veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately to assess its breathing and to help it survive. This is because the ribs can puncture the lungs, causing extreme breathing difficulties. Signs of rib fractures in cats are:Shallow breathing
Difficulty breathing
Chest looks distorted
Pain
Hiding

, The bones in the tail can be fractured like any other bone. A big cause of tail fractures is being slammed in a door. A tail that is pulled can also break.


A tail fracture presents as a limp tail, a tail unable to be swished from side to side, a bent or crooked tail, and/or a tail that is painful., A broken bone, whatever bone it is, is a serious injury. At the first sign of a fracture, call your veterinarian or emergency clinic for prompt treatment and relief of pain.


Your cat deserves medical care and treatment for a broken bone, even if that treatment simply means that the cat's pain is managed.
Your veterinarian will assess the overall health of the cat, in addition to paying attention to the area of the suspected fracture.

, This will increase the veterinary bill, so prepare yourself to deal with the financial impact of the assessment and treatment. In most cases, to get a proper X-ray the cat will need to be sedated and posed in different positions. This includes on its back, on its side, from the top of the back, and, in the case of jaw fractures, at various angles with the mouth both opened and closed.


The most common way for a veterinarian to diagnose a fracture is by use of radiographs or X-rays.Many closed fractures (those beneath the skin) are easily seen once a proper X-ray is taken.
In the case of an open fracture, the broken bone will be obviously sticking out of the body, but X-rays need to be taken of these fractures, as there may be other fractured bones beneath the skin. In most cases a number of X-rays need to be taken to properly assess the fracture.
In some cases, specialized techniques are used to catch those fractures that are not a “simple” break. Bones can fracture in any direction (diagonally, spirally) or they can shatter into pieces.

, The treatment will vary depending on the type and location of the fracture. For example, many hair-line fractures will heal on their own if they are immobilized. However, open fractures and spiral fractures will likely require in-depth surgery to correct.


Many times amputation is the only solution to a broken tail. However, a fracture which only occurs at the tip can sometimes heal on its own.Severe health problems, such as a fracture, are a good reason to invest in pet insurance. If you have pet insurance and your cat gets a devastating injury, the cost will be offset and you will not have to weigh your financial situation against the health of your pet.

Give your cat lots of toys.,
Create a treasure hunt in your home.,
Place a cat perch in one of your windows.,
Purchase cat-specific DVDs.,
Get another cat.",How to Fix Clinginess in Cats2," Your cat may be clingy because it doesn’t have enough in its environment to keep it busy and entertained. Give your cat toys that it can play with on its own.Rotate the toys at least once a week so your cat does not become bored with them. Below are some examples of independent cat toys:Puzzle toys
Treat-dispensing toys (place your cat’s favorite treat in the toys)
Crumpled pieces of paper
Empty paper bags
Ping pong balls

, Let your cat use its instinctive hunting behavior to search for things in your home. For example, hide some of its dry food kibbles or treats throughout your home.This treasure hunt will get your cat focused on something fun and decrease its clinginess toward you.


Don’t hide a lot of treats. If your cat eats a lot of treats during the treasure hunt, it could pick up some extra weight over time.
Change the hiding places each time you create a treasure hunt.

, A cat perch is another way to help your cat be more independent and less clingy. Place the perch in a window that has an interesting view of the outside. Your cat will be entertained by being able to watch birds throughout the day., Cat DVDs are a great way to keep your cat busy and entertained. They show images that would interest a cat, such as flying birds or swimming fish.Put the DVD on when you leave home or when you need some alone time while you’re at home.


Look for cat DVDs at your local pet store. You can also order them online.

, If your clingy cat is the only pet in the house, it may benefit from having another cat to play and interact with. It is important, though, for the other cat to be compatible with your cat.If they’re not compatible, your cat may cling even more closely to you and not be very nice to the other cat.


Talk with your vet before getting another cat. Here are some questions you can ask your vet: What age cat should I get? How do I introduce the cats to each other? What if they don’t get along?
If you have an older cat, you might think a kitten would be a good companion for your cat. However, the kitten may end up being a nuisance to your cat and getting more and more attention from you.If you want to adopt the new cat from a local animal shelter, the shelter staff may first want to see how the new cat interacts with your cat.

Ask guests not to approach your cat.,
Eye contact can be seen as a threat, so ask your guest to simply ignore the cat.,
Coax him out of hiding.,
Ask guests to squat or sit.,
Prepare for strangers.,
Make sure your cat has places to hide.,
Encourage him to play.,
Don't cut off his escape route.,
Try synthetic cat hormones.,
Consider anti-anxiety medication.",How to Break Your Cat's Cycle of Xenophobia (Fear of Strangers)1," When you have guests over, ask them to let your cat approach them, instead of the other way around. Cats are generally curious by nature, so letting them explore new guests without becoming startled can help to socialize them.Cats may be less likely to approach children, guests who are very tall, or people they've never encountered before.
Be especially patient with your cat when guests of this kind come by.;
, Instead, the person can take a seat and drop a few treats from their hand to help the cat build a positive association.

, If you have guests over, but your cat is nowhere to be seen, try shaking his food bag, or (if he eats canned food) running the can opener to coax him from his hiding spot. You may also try jingling a toy that he likes.If your guests are patient and calm, you may consider bringing your cat out.
However, make sure he has an escape route if he becomes overwhelmed.

, Cats tend to be afraid of particularly large and/or tall people. Ask your guests to sit down or squat to make your cat feel more comfortable around them., Having planned guests over is one thing; however, sometimes unexpected strangers (like a pizza delivery person, mailman, or missionary) may arrive at your door. Strangers are the not right people to use for breaking your cat's xenophobia. Allow your cat to run and hide if he wants to.

, It may sound counterintuitive, but if your cat has a safe bolt hole (an empty cardboard box, for instance) then he may be more willing to be brave. Make sure he has access to his hiding places when guests are over.


You can also provide vertical spaces for the cat to escape to if he feels threatened, such as tall cat trees. He can also watch and assess a situation safely, before deciding it's OK and he wants to join in.
Knowing when to hide and protect himself and when to come out and play is an excellent social skill for your cat to develop.

, When guests are over, you (or someone else the cat trusts) can sit with him nearby. You can pet him, offer him treats, and encourage him to play. If you can get him into a positive and playful mood, he’ll be more likely to interact with new people., You may be frustrated by your cat's fear or really want him to stay and play, but trapping him can cause him to panic and won't do much to cure his xenophobia. Make sure guests leave a clear route between the cat and the door or his hiding place so he can escape if necessary.

, When a cat feels safe and comfortable he will rub his face against objects, which leaves a facial pheromone. Products like Feliway mimic these pheromones, which may help reassure your cat that he is in a safe environment., If your cat is experiencing ongoing anxiety, speak to your vet about including anti-anxiety medication in your method. This may help your cat stay calm enough to gain a critical level of socialization.Your vet might recommend using zylkene, which can help pets manage stress.
Some people believe that certain flower extracts, such as Bach Flower Remedies' ""Rescue Remedy"", can help their cats relax. Give the proper dose to the cat before company arrives.
Always consult a veterinarian before administering medication to you cat.

Determine the age of your cat.,
Look for weight loss combined with increased appetite.,
Look for increased thirst and urination.,
Notice increased activity.,
Check the coat for matting and greasy appearance.,
Be aware of vomiting or diarrhea.,
Know when to take your cat to the vet.,
Expect the vet to do a physical exam.,
Let the vet order blood tests.,
Allow the vet to order more tests if needed.,
Let the vet check blood pressure and heart rate.,
Note that it is caused by an increase in thyroid hormones.,
Be aware that there may be a cancerous tumor.,
Know that cat hyperthyroidism is common in older cats.",How to Diagnose High Thyroid Levels in a Cat," Elevated thyroid levels in cats is most common as cats age. In fact, most cats who develop hyperthyroidism are over the age of 13. Only 5% of cats with hyperthyroidism are less than 10 years old. If your cat is over 10, it is more likely that symptoms may indicate hyperthyroidism than in younger cats., If your cat is eating more than usual but is actually losing weight, this is a sign that the thyroid gland is over-producing. Watch your cat’s food intake and their appearance. If they are older cats and their ribs become visible even though they are eating you out of house and home, you probably have a symptom of hyperthyroidism on your hands.Hyperthyroidism causes weight loss because increased thyroid hormone speeds up the metabolism, and when an individual doesn’t consume enough calories to keep up with this metabolic increase, weight loss is the result., Although only half of cats with hyperthyroidism have increased thirst with increased urination, it is still a very clear sign that your older cat may have hyperthyroidism. They are actually conditions in themselves; increased thirst is called “polydipsia” by veterinarians, and increased urination is called “polyuria.”The reason for polyuria and polydipsia is that thyroid hormone is a diuretic, which means it triggers the kidneys to excrete more water. Cats with increased thyroid hormone levels then have to drink more to replace the lost water.
Kidney disease is also a common secondary condition to hyperthyroidism in cats.

, As a result of the increased metabolism of hyperthyroidism, cats may become overly active and display signs of nervousness. It can be hard to label a cat as overactive unless its usual behavior is especially sedentary, but since most older cats tend to settle down, an active older cat is a sign that something is wrong., Changes in the appearance of your cat’s fur is also a sign that they have increased thyroid levels. As part of the increased metabolism, hair and nails increase their growth, and cats can’t keep up with the grooming. As a result, the fur will look matted or greasy from lack of grooming., Hyperthyroidism in cats can also cause irritation to the digestive tract, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea. Diarrhea can also occur because all the body’s systems have sped up, including the digestive system. Neither symptom occurs in all cats with hyperthyroidism, but vomiting occurs more often., If you notice a combination of symptoms like weight loss, increased appetite, and increased thirst and urination in your cat that is older than 10 years, it is time to take them to the vet. Your vet is the only one who can give a true diagnosis.

, You vet will want to start with a physical exam to see if your cat shows signs of high thyroid levels. The vet will feel along your cat’s neck for an enlarged thyroid gland. Sometimes a cat will have hyperthyroidism without having these enlarged glands, and the vet will need to run blood tests., Even if your cat has obviously enlarged thyroid glands, the vet will most likely want to order blood tests to check your cat’s blood for an increased presence of thyroid hormone. This hormone is also called T4, and should be apparent in the blood test results if the cat has hyperthyroidism., In some rare cases, the cat may have hyperthyroidism even if the levels of T4 are not elevated above normal. If this is the case with your cat and hyperthyroidism is still a probability, the vet may order more tests to confirm that thyroid levels are too high.One extra blood test may look for something called “free T4” in the blood.

, In most cases of hyperthyroidism, the cat will have increased blood pressure and heart rate due to increased metabolism. Your vet will probably take the blood pressure and heart rate of your cat.


The vet or a vet tech will take blood pressure with a small cuff on one leg., Hyperthyroidism is caused by an increase of the thyroid hormone in the bloodstream. The symptoms that you see in your cat are due to the extra thyroid hormone raising the cat’s metabolism and pushing all its organ to work faster than normal., Usually the thyroid gland swells and enlarges in cats because of a benign—a tumor that is cancerous, but not likely to spread—tumor called “adenoma.” Either one or both thyroid glands swell with extra thyroid hormone as a result., Keep in mind that raised thyroid levels in cats is more common in adults. If your cat is very young, the symptoms you see are most likely related to something else, and you should take your cat to the vet for a confirmed diagnosis.

Keep an eye out for nasal discharge.,
Pay attention to sneezing and coughing.,
Inspect your cat's eyes.,
Look for lesions or sores in the mouth.,
Pay attention to your cat's energy level.,
Gauge how much your cat is eating.,
Understand the variety of underlying causes of feline upper respiratory illness.,
Take a sick cat to the vet.,
Discuss with the veterinarian whether additional testing is necessary.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Feline Upper Respiratory Illness," Like a cold or flu in humans, a URTI will be uncomfortable for a cat because of the symptoms associated with it. A cat suffering from a URTI will usually exhibit nasal discharge and the irritation associated with that.Nasal discharge can cause the cat to have a very crusty nose. When the discharge is not wiped away, it can dry under and around the nose area.
In an effort to get rid of the moisture, the cat may use its paws to wipe away the discharge. This means that the cat's paws may also be covered in moisture.;
, While the occasional sneeze or cough is perfectly normal, repeated and excessive sneezing and coughing can be a sign of an upper respiratory tract infection. Combined with the nasal discharge, the sneezing can be very noticeable when it makes a mess all over the cat, and whatever the cat is sitting on., Watery eyes are also a symptom of an upper respiratory tract infection.This is caused by the cat's immune system trying to flush out the infection.


There may also be swelling around your cat's eyes. This is caused by inflammation in the sinuses that lay below the eyes.

, Your cat's mouth may be red, swollen, and covered in sores. You may even be able to see down a sick cat's mouth into its throat, which is likely to also be red and swollen.The lesions in the mouth can be on the tongue or the hard pallet.
These lesions will probably burst at some point. They should heal once you have the infection under control.

, If your cat is feeling unwell, it will most likely show up in it's behavior. This illness usually causes lethargy or lack of energy. , A lack of appetite is a sign of an upper respiratory tract infection. This is due to the cat feeling generally bad but it can also be caused by the lesions that can occur in the mouth. Lesions in the mouth can make eating painful, and thus the cat will avoid it as long as possible., A URTI can be caused by viruses or bacteria or, in some cases, both.This means that is a wide variety of things that could be causing your cat's illness. This is why a veterinary diagnosis may be important, especially if your cat's symptoms are severe.


The most common viruses that cause feline URTI include feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), feline calcivirus, or a feline retrovirus, such as feline leukemia.The most common bacteria that cause feline URTI include Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis, and Mycoplasmas., A cat that has severe symptoms may need veterinary care to speed and ease its recovery. After a medical examination and history taking, your veterinarian may diagnose your kitty with a URTI. Generally, a URTI is diagnosed based on clinical signs.Your vet will check to see if the cat has a fever. A high fever, which can peak at 105 degrees but usually sits between normal and 103 degrees, is a very common symptom of an upper respiratory tract infection.A blood test may be done to determine if the body is responding to an infection. This blood test would be a complete blood count (CBC) to check the white blood cell counts. White blood cells show if the body is responding to an infection.
Another blood test that may be performed is to check for feline leukemia virus infection.

, In some cases, the treatment for a URTI would be the same no matter what additional testing says about the specific cause of the illness. However, by combining examination findings with diagnostic testing your veterinarian may be better able to diagnose feline URTI and to determine a good course of treatment.


Depending on your cat, and the severity of the signs, blood chemistry tests may be done to see how the kidneys and liver are functioning. Electrolytes can also be measured with these tests to see if the cat is dehydrated.
There are also a few other diagnostic tests which can be performed to more definitively diagnose the cause of a feline URTI. However these tests generally do not change the treatment course but they are worth mentioning. These include swabbing the nasal cavity or mouth and sending the swabs to a diagnostic testing laboratory to isolate any viruses or to do further testing, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).These are highly specialized tests which require sophisticated techniques to perform.

, Most of the time, a cat's immune system will effectively eliminate the illness in a week or two. During this time it's important to ease your cat's symptoms and to make it as comfortable as possible.If the illness is severe, your veterinarian may prescribe an oral antibiotic.This will help the cat to eliminate the infection.
During treatment you need to keep your cat away from other cats. URTI can be very infectious, so try to avoid letting your cat infect other cats."

Start early.,
Introduce them slowly.,
Control the new animals and protect the kitten.,
Invite guests over for short stays.,
Invite people over for longer visits.,
Introduce the kitten to children.,
Let the kitten move at its own pace.,
Expose your kitten to a variety of sounds.,
Show your kitten a variety of landscapes.,
Introduce your kitten to the cat carrier.,
Take your kitten on car rides.",How to Introduce Your Kitten to New Experiences," The more a kitten experiences in its first few weeks of life, the more likely it is that your kitten will grow up into a well-socialized cat. The first twelve weeks are the most important for socializing your kitten, so be sure to start exposing it to new animals, people, and experiences early on.Think of all the things you assume your cat will experience in its lifetime and try to expose the cat to it during these first few weeks.
If you live on a farm, you might want to consider introducing your kitten to some of the farm animals while it is very young.
If you have other pets in your home, let the kitten meet them during these early weeks.;
, If you have other animals in the house (especially older animals), take the introductions slowly. Let the other animals smell the kitten on your clothes and hands before you bring the kitten in. And let the kitten smell the other animals on you.Don’t try to force the kitten to interact with another animal until it seems ready. Kittens are naturally curious, so it should become ready to interact after a short period of time.
Avoid forcing your other animals to interact with the kitten if they seem resistant. Let all the animals warm up to each other at their own pace.

, Remember that kittens are quite tiny, so you may need to take some precautions to ensure the safety of your kitten. This is especially true when you’re introducing the kitten to larger animals. Hold the kitten protectively in your lap or your arms and allow the other animal to sniff it (and the kitten to smell the other animal). Let them interact in supervised encounters until you are certain that the kitten will be safe with the other animal.If you have a big dog, it may mistake the kitten as prey. So be very careful with the introduction and monitor their interaction constantly. Keep your dog on a leash during the initial interactions.
If you have horses or cows, they may accidentally stomp on the kitten.

, You want your cat to get used to other people coming over to your house, so you need to start inviting guests over early. Ask some friends over for shorter periods of time – like for dinner or for a couple hours in the afternoon – so your kitten can get used to the door opening and strangers coming into the house.Ask your friends to bring treats for the kitten so that it associates strangers with a positive experience.
Practice ringing the doorbell or knocking and then giving your kitten rewards before the guest actually arrives. This way your cat will already have a positive association with the sound.

, In addition to short visits, you want your kitten to grow accustomed to having people in the home for longer visits. Ask a family member or friend to come stay for a couple of days so your kitten can experience this while it is young.

Again, ask your visitor to bring a treat for the kitten.

, Your kitten will probably encounter both adults and children during its lifetime. You should try to expose your kitten to small children while it is at the socializing age. Instruct the children to handle the kitten very gently and not to force the kitten to do anything it doesn’t want to (like sitting in their lap, being carried around, or getting dressed up in costumes).

Small children can often be a bit rough with animals, so be sure to monitor the interaction closely.
This will also help your kitten learn how to interact with children as it grows up.

, Don’t force the kitten to interact with new people if it clearly doesn’t want to. Sometimes kittens don’t like to be held by strangers and you shouldn’t force them. Let the kitten become curious on its own and start exploring while the guests are there.Encourage your kitten to interact with the guests, but never use force. Entice your kitten with treats and playtime instead.

, Think about all the sounds you expect your kitten to experience as it grows up in your home and expose your kitten to them early on. Close doors loudly, play music, use the blender, turn on the hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner, and do all the things that make noise in your home.Remember to give your kitten treats and encouragement whenever a loud noise happens so that it doesn’t get too scared or create a negative association in its mind.
Try placing your cat’s food bowl next to the washing machine so that it will grow accustomed to the loud noises the machine makes and associate it with the positive experience of eating.

, Make sure that your kitten is exposed to many different surfaces in your home. Help the kitten up and down the stairs. Show the kitten how to use the doggy door (if you have one in your home). Take your cat outside into the grass if you expect it to be an indoor/outdoor kitty.Be sure to encourage your kitten with positive reinforcement when it explores places you want it to go. And discourage the kitten from going places you want it to avoid (like on the table or kitchen counters) by removing it from the location and distracting it with a toy or a treat.

, Adult cats often don’t like being put in cat carriers, but if you introduce your kitten to the experience when it is very young it may handle it better as an adult. Put the carrier out where your kitten can see it and get inside on its own. Feed your kitten near the carrier and put treats inside. This will help your kitten associate the carrier with positive experiences.Once the kitten is used to the carrier, place it inside and carry it around for short periods at a time.

, If you live in a place where you will have to take your cat on road trips or in car rides to the vet, make sure you let your kitten experience this when it is still young. Put your kitten in its carrier and take it on short car rides. Be sure to give it treats during and after the trip and encourage it with praise during the process.If you take public transportation often, bring your kitten with you for a short ride on the train or bus in its carrier.

Provide a safe area.,
Find your cat's ""starting distance."",
Begin with a motionless guest.,
Decrease the distance by a few inches.,
Incorporate movement.",How to Break Your Cat's Cycle of Xenophobia (Fear of Strangers)2," If you’d prefer a more methodical approach, you can follow a “starting distance” methodology with your cat. Begin by creating a safe space. Before any guests arrive, provide your cat with a safe area to go. This will be an area where the cat can completely avoid guests. Provide water, food, and a litter box. Place your cat in the safe space (but don’t lock him in) and let him remain there while guests arrive. This will help your cat to stop associating the presence of guests in the home with anxiety., When you have a particularly patient guest, ask them to help you find your cat’s starting distance. When you cat emerges from the safe area, have your guest come as close as they can to your cat before the cat displays any signs of anxiety or aggression. This is your cat’s approximate starting distance., The next time a guest comes over, remove your cat from the safe area, and place him at his approximate starting distance from the guest. Ask your guest to remain motionless (standing or sitting), and allow the cat to investigate them.If the cat remains calm, reward his behavior with treats, play, or petting and attention for a few minutes, then put him back in the safe area.
You can repeat this exercise a few times while your guest is visiting.
If the cat seems uncomfortable, move him further away until he is calm, and reward him as just outlined.

, Keep doing these sessions, each time watching your cat carefully. Have the guest move slowly and with gentle motions. Your guest doesn't need to say anything, but they may choose to speak in soothing tones. Eventually, the cat will be calm enough to remain within arm's reach of the guest.Anti-anxiety medication can help with this process also.
If your cat becomes anxious, simply increase the distance until he is calm.

, Once your cat is fairly comfortable approaching a guest that is still, see what happens if your guest moves around. Ask your guest to pace back and forth or make any movement that you want your cat to get accustomed to. (You may find that the starting distance is longer as some cats are more timid about movement.) Repeat the exercises with your guest moving so that your cat becomes desensitized."
"
Know your kitten’s age.,
Provide a safe environment.,
Expose your kitten to diverse people.,
Reward him with praise.",How to Break Your Cat's Cycle of Xenophobia (Fear of Strangers)3," A kitten of any age can benefit from exposure to new people; however, kittens between two and seven weeks old have been shown to benefit immensely from socialization. If you have purchased the kitten from a breeder or pet store, you may not have the kitten until he is six or seven weeks old, so it is important to bring him around people right away., When you bring home a new kitten, give him a little time to become comfortable. (This length will vary from kitten to kitten, but a couple of days is a good rule of thumb). Once he seems comfortable around you and in your home (he is exploring on his own, snuggles with you, and is eating), begin to invite guests over., Kittens will grow accustomed to people if they are exposed to many different types of people when they are young. Invite over friends of different sizes, shapes, and ages. Invite people of various races and genders. Additionally, it is good for him to encounter people who look “unique” for one reason or another (such as people who use wheelchairs, people with beards, or people who wear hats and/or glasses).Make sure that the people around your cat are kind and gentle.
Avoid very loud noises.
Be careful with young children, who may not understand how to handle a kitten.

, Anytime your kitten actively approaches a new person and interacts with them, reward the kitten with affection and praise. It is important to teach your kitten that this is a desired behavior. You may even want to offer him a treat."

Pay attention to the signs of general illness.,
Check your cat's lymph nodes.,
Keep an eye on your cat's weight.,
Look for vomiting or diarrhea.,
Keep track of your cat's activity level.,
Be concerned if your cat is having difficulty breathing.,
Take your cat to a veterinarian.,
Confer with your veterinarian about options for testing.,
Discuss the diagnosis with your veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Feline Lymphosarcoma," Many of the signs of lymphosarcoma are vague and are the symptoms of many other illnesses. This is because lymphosarcoma can affect a variety of organs, so the symptoms can vary quite a bit.However, symptoms to look out for include diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and weight loss.


A good example of how general the symptoms are is diarrhea, which can signal a variety of illnesses. The vagueness of symptoms is why it's important to pay attention to your cat's general healthy and to get your cat checked by a vet, who can perform a clinical examination and draw up a list of possible causes.
Also, the symptoms will vary depending on what type of lymphoma the cat has.When the lymphocytes flood different areas and organs, the results differ greatly.
Most affected cats fall into the 10-12 year old age bracket, but others occur outside this range.This means that if your cat is having these general symptoms of illness, and it is also old, the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by lymphosarcoma are greater.;
, Enlarged lymph nodes are a symptom of lymphosarcoma. The nodes become swollen and easy to feel. These exist in pairs (one gland on the left and one of the right of the body) in a mirror image of each other.The easiest to feel are the submandibular (in the angle of the jaw) prescapular (in front of the shoulder blades) axillary (in the armpit) inguinal (in the groin) and popliteal (behind the knee).
These glands are usually not easy to find and unless you are a trained veterinary professional. They can vary in size from a small quail's eggs to golf ball sized.

, Make sure that it stays relatively steady. Weight loss is one symptom of lymphosarcoma, although it can signal a variety of illnesses. This is because the cat loses its appetite as a result of feeling unwell, not because of the specific disease.Even if your cat has lost its appetite, it may have an increased thirst. Cancer can change levels of certain minerals in the blood stream, which can cause the cat to be thirsty.

, This can arise in any form of lymphosarcoma, but most commonly with lymphoma in the gut. This is due to the fact that the gut has a reduced ability to absorb the nutrition from food.The vomiting and diarrhea associated with lymphosarcoma is the same as vomiting and diarrhea associated with a wide variety of illnesses. Because of this, get your cat looked at by a veterinary professional if it has these symptoms. The cat could have a simple intestinal bug or may be very ill and your veterinarian is the best person to assess this.

, Assess whether your cat is acting normally or whether it is acting strangely. Decreased activity, such as the cat being lethargic, lacking energy, and seeming unwell, can be a symptom of lymphosarcoma.This can also show itself through lack of grooming activity, so the cat's coat becomes dull looking and unkempt.

, Lymphosarcoma can get into the lungs and make it very difficult for a cat to breath.The cat may take rapid shallow breaths. The cat may also change the way it sits or lays if it is having difficulty breathing.


For example, it may not want to curl up but instead rest with its head and neck extended in order to make it easier to breath.

, If you suspect that your cat is ill and you are not sure what it causing it, get the cat looked at by a veterinary professional. Lymphosarcoma has similar symptoms to a wide variety of illnesses, so its best to let your veterinarian know about your cat's symptoms and let the vet sort out a diagnosis.Your veterinarian will give the cat a general examination and assess its general health first. Then he or she will proceed with assessment of the illness.

, After a clinical examination, the vet will decide which are the most appropriate tests to run. If you are concerned about cost, feel free to discuss with the vet the costs of certain tests. A screening blood test is required in order to check on the cat's overall health and the impact the suspected lymphoma is having on organ function. The vet will also want to know if the cat is vaccinated against FeLV or not. The vaccination protects against certain forms of this cancer.


The cat will also be screened for FeLV and FIV. While positive tests increase the chance of lymphoma, a negative test does not rule out lymphoma.The key diagnostic tool is examining cells from the swollen lymph node under a microscope. This can either be done by the vet taking a biopsy, or in some cases when the external lymph nodes are swollen it is possible to reach a diagnosis based on a fine needle aspirate. This is when the vet harvests a sample through a hypodermic needle and sprays the cells onto a microscope slide.When a pathologists looks at those cells under the microscope they can identify the type as lymphocytes and confirm they are present in abnormal numbers.
It is also important to work out if other organs are affected, so the vet will probably want to complete a scan of the internal organs included liver, spleen, and kidneys.

, Diagnosis can be difficult with certain forms of lymphosarcoma and you and your veterinarian should discuss this difficulty. The most common form of lymphoma affects the gut, with the bowel wall becoming flooded with lymphocytes. This can be more difficult to diagnose as the thickening is internal and signs of a problem tend to be nonspecific, such as vomiting or diarrhea, and can be caused by any number of problems. This is known as alimentary lymphoma.A rarer form of lymphoma affects a lymph gland inside the chest, which sits centrally between the right and left lungs. This is known as mediastinal lymphoma. Older cats can be prone to lymphoma affecting the kidneys and this is known as renal lymphoma.
The alimentary, renal, or intestinal forms can be difficult to diagnose because the swelling is internal. The vet will perform an ultrasound exam and attempt an ultrasound guided biopsy or to harvest a fine needle aspirate using the ultrasound to guide the needle placement.
The easiest to diagnose is when the lymphocytes accumulate in lymph nodes. This is because these are located external to the body cavities and are easy to feel when they are enlarged. This is known as multicentric lymphoma.

, Treatment usually involves chemotherapy. However, surgical removal of a discrete intestinal mass may be possible. These treatment options can cost quite a bit, so you should discuss the cost before scheduling the surgery.


Even with treatment, lymphosarcoma is not usually curable. Treatment can extend your cat's life for months, or even years, but does not usually eliminate the condition all together.Consider getting pet insurance while your cat is in good health. This will help to offset the cost of expensive medical treatments, such as this.

The most obvious is usually bloody diarrhea that the cat cannot control.Diarrhea is often associated with extreme dehydration. Make sure that your cat is drinking enough water and tell your veterinarian whether it is actually drinking enough water. Your cat may even just sit at its water bowl for hours but not drink, so watch the cat carefully.;
, The virus attacks the intestinal tract, so many signs are associated with the digestive system. Your cat may not be able to keep any food down due to digestive discomfort. Even a healthy cat is likely to vomit occasionally. Vomiting due to panleukopenia is different, however, as the cat will not stop vomiting or will vomit repeatedly over a short period of time., If you suspect your cat is sick, inspect its gums. Cats with feline panleukopenia usually have pale mucous membranes and gums., There are several behavioral signs of feline distemper. Problems with a cat's digestive system and overall health will impact its behavior. In the case of feline distemper, the cat will probably be exhausted. It may not move around or stick to its normal routine.This tiredness can mean that the cat won't even groom itself. Look for a lack of grooming when assessing whether you think your cat has panleukopenia.

, A cat with feline panleukopenia will have extreme stomach and intestinal discomfort. This will probably mean that the cat is uninterested in food. If you have a cat that is always excited to eat, then this will be very noticeable. On the other hand, if you have a normally finicky eater, you may not be able to spot this symptom easily.


The cat may also sit hunched over in order to alleviate digestive discomfort.

, This disease is particularly hard on them. Be aware that a kitten is less likely to survive the disease, so it needs urgent veterinary attention if you suspect that it is infected.


Many times a kitten with feline distemper will be found suddenly dead with no real signs of the disease prior to death.
Additionally, if a mother cat is infected during her pregnancy (and survives), the kittens can develop abnormally. The cerebellum of affected kittens does not form properly leading to stillbirths, weak kittens, or kittens with an abnormal gait and body tremors., If an unvaccinated cat or kitten contracts the feline panleukopenia, there are a number of diagnostic signs and tests that can be done to determine that the disease is causing the illness. Laboratory tests, particularly a complete blood count, will help the veterinarian diagnose the disease.


On the blood count test there will be a decrease in white blood cells (the cells that fight infection), low numbers of red blood cells (due to intestinal bleeding), and decreased platelets (the blood cells that cause blood to clot.)
An in-clinic test can be done on the feces of suspected cats with panleukopenia by using the canine parvovirus test as panleukopenia falls into the spectrum of parvovirus.The tests will also show that the cat is dehydrated and suffering from shock.

, There are a few other diagnostic tests that can be performed to more definitively diagnose feline panleukopenia. These are not commonly run, as with or without them the treatment your cat receives is usually the same. They are:Antibody detection tests, which detects antibodies formed by the body in response to the disease. This requires serum from the blood that is sent off to a diagnostic laboratory.
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can also be performed in a diagnostic laboratory on feces or tissues from deceased cats.
Post-mortem examination (after death) of a cat suspected of having panleukopenia along with microscopic examination of tissue can also help to diagnose the disease.

, Treatment is supportive, as there is no specific medication to kill the virus. IV fluids, anti-diarrhea medications, and nutrition are usually given to the cat to make it more comfortable and to allow its immune system to more effectively fight off the infection.Many patients do not survive the illness despite attempts at treatment.

, There is a very effective vaccine which prevents a cat from contracting the illness.It is given to kittens as young as six weeks of age, followed by vaccination at 9 and then 12 weeks of age. The vaccine is a part of the yearly cat vaccination schedule.


A vaccine is given followed by a second one in 3-4 weeks. Annual vaccination done once a year will assure the cat is fully protected against this deadly disease.

, Unvaccinated kittens need to be kept away from other cats until they are vaccinated. Vaccination usually occurs from 6 to 9 weeks of age, so your kitten should be kept isolated until that point.This isolation includes you, or another person, not bringing in the disease to the kitten on your body or clothes. You should keep from petting or interacting with other cats until your kitten is fully vaccinated.
Kittens can get some immunity from their mothers before they are vaccinated. However, just how effective these immunities are is uncertain.

, For example, keep stray cats, which may carry the disease, out of your yard by using cat deterrent sprays or water sprinklers. This is because the virus can live outside for months, or years, in cat feces.Make sure any new cats or kittens brought into your house are vaccinated.
Do not allow your cat outside without vaccinations. The disease can be spread by fighting (bites) or even sharing common water sources with unvaccinated, infected cats.

Write down when you first notice symptoms.,
Detect a decreased appetite.,
Watch for vomiting.,

Observe other symptoms of intestinal lymphoma.,
Have your vet perform a physical exam.,
Allow your vet to take blood samples.,
Agree to diagnostic imaging tests.,
Discuss options for taking a tissue sample.",How to Diagnose Feline Intestinal Lymphoma," Feline intestinal lymphoma progresses slowly, with symptoms gradually getting worse over one to three months.Knowing how long the symptoms have been going on will help your vet accurately diagnose your cat.


The symptoms of feline intestinal lymphoma are vague and occur with many other illnesses in cats.Don’t worry if lymphoma doesn’t immediately come to mind when you notice the symptoms. Your vet will be able to make the diagnosis.;
, Interestingly, a large part of your cat’s immune system is in the digestive tract. When the lymphocytes in your cat’s digestive tract become cancerous, your cat will experience digestive upset. With intestinal lymphoma, your cat will lose its appetite.Monitor your cat’s appetite by paying close attention to how much (or how little) your cat eats at meal time.


In addition to eating less, your cat will start to lose weight. Decreased appetite and weight loss are two of the most common signs of feline intestinal lymphoma., In a cat with intestinal lymphoma, vomiting usually comes after the initial loss of appetite and weight loss.It is another common sign of this cancer, occurring in about 50% of cats with feline intestinal lymphoma., Observing your cat’s feces doesn’t sound very pleasant, but it can help with diagnosing intestinal lymphoma. Your cat’s defecation could change in different ways, including diarrhea or constipation. You may also see tinges of blood in the feces. Changes in defecation are less common than appetite loss, weight loss, and vomiting.If your cat is constipated, you’ll see fewer feces in the litter box.
Diarrhea occurs in about 30% of feline intestinal lymphoma cases., Sometimes, cats with feline intestinal lymphoma will start drinking and urinating more. They might also develop a swollen abdomen. Other cats with intestinal lymphoma might start eating inedible objects, like paper or cardboard.Eating inedible objects is called pica.

, Feline intestinal lymphoma requires a veterinary diagnosis. First, your vet will perform a physical exam, paying special attention to your cat’s abdomen. Your vet may feel enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.They may also feel thickened loops of intestine and/or masses within the intestinal walls.The abdomen may feel completely normal, even if the lymphoma is advanced.Your vet will need to perform other tests to diagnose intestinal lymphoma in your cat.
Your vet will also listen to your cat’s heart and lungs.
During the physical exam, give your vet a history of your cat’s symptoms. Explain when you noticed them, how long you’ve noticed them, and if they’ve gotten worse over time.

, After the physical exam, your vet will recommend other diagnostic tests. Blood work can be useful for diagnosing feline intestinal lymphoma. For example, your vet will use a blood sample to test your cat for feline leukemia (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Cats that are positive for either of these viruses are at risk for developing lymphoma.Your vet will also analyze your cat’s blood work for anemia, which is the most common blood work abnormality in cats with intestinal lymphoma.Anemia is a decrease in red blood cells.
Your vet will also check your cat’s blood for levels of Vitamin B12 and folate. Blood levels of these two nutrients are commonly reduced in cats with intestinal lymphoma.Thyroid testing is also useful to rule out hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) as a cause for your cat’s symptoms.Hyperthyroidism can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss., Imaging techniques, such as ultrasounds and x-rays, are also useful in diagnosing feline intestinal lymphoma. Abdominal x-rays will help your vet identify intestinal problems, such as intestinal wall thickening and obstructions. Chest x-rays will show whether the lymphoma has spread to the lungs.An abdominal ultrasound will show intestinal wall thickening and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.Your vet can use ultrasound to take a sample of affected tissue to confirm the diagnosis. This is called an ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA). An FNA is a collection of cells taken with a thin needle., The most definitive way to diagnose feline intestinal lymphoma is with a sample of affected tissue. This sample can either be a biopsy (large piece of tissue) or ultrasound-guided FNA.Your vet can take a biopsy using endoscopy or surgery. Each procedure, which require anesthesia, has its advantages and disadvantages:Endoscopy is less invasive and faster than surgery, making it a good option for very sick cats. However, the endoscopy tube can reach only limited sections of the intestines. Also, the sample taken via endoscopy will not be as thick as that taken during surgery.
Surgery allows for a thicker tissue sample that can be analyzed more thoroughly. However, surgery is invasive.
Discuss the pros and cons of each procedure with your vet to decide which procedure would be best for your cat.

Have your vet take a small liver sample.",How to Diagnose Feline Hepatic Lipidosis," Anorexia is a common sign of feline hepatic lipidosis. In fact, a cat with this disease may refuse to go near its food bowl.Anorexia leads to weight loss, which can be drastic—25% or more of body weight—in cats with hepatic lipidosis.A cat may stop eating because of a stressful event (new pet, moving to a new location) or underlying health problem (cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammation of the pancreas).A hormonal imbalance may also cause anorexia. A hormone called leptin is produced in a cat’s fat and causes a cat to feel full. Leptin levels may increase with hepatic lipidosis, causing a cat to feel full and not want to eat.;
, When the liver stops working properly, different parts of the body start to turn yellow. Take a close look at your cat’s skin, eyes, ears, and gums. If you see yellow, that is a strong indication of hepatic lipidosis.The yellowing is due to increased levels of bilirubin, a yellow-brown substance that's found in the bile. Bilirubin levels go up when the liver isn’t working properly.The yellowing, called ‘jaundice’ or ‘icterus,’ occurs in about 70% of cats with hepatic lipidosis., Hepatic lipidosis can cause vomiting and diarrhea in cats.This disease can also slow down the movement of food through the GI tract. If food is getting ‘stuck’ in your cat's GI tract, your cat may develop abdominal pain.If your cat has abdominal pain, it may become more vocal. Also, it may not want you to touch its belly.
Hepatic lipidosis can also cause constipation in cats., If your cat has hepatic lipidosis, it may start drooling more than usual.The increased drooling could indicate nausea.Interestingly, you might notice your cat sit near its food bowl and start salivating, but refuse to approach the bowl., Cats with hepatic lipidosis become very weak and lethargic.If your cat is eating less than usual, or not eating anything at all, it won’t have the energy to move around and play like it used to. Be aware of your cat not playing with its toys or engaging in playtime with you.

, Hepatic lipidosis can make a cat withdraw from its normal activities.You may notice your cat wanting to be by itself more than usual. For example, if you have other pets, your cat may no longer want to interact with them. It may not feel like spending much time with you, either.

, Cats with hepatic lipidosis can suffer from very low levels of the electrolytes potassium and phosphate. If the levels of these two nutrients drop too low in your cat, your cat may hunch over and bend its head and neck downwards (‘ventroflexion’).Electrolytes are substances that help the body function properly.

, Fortunately, cats can recover from hepatic lipidosis. However, if the disease is not promptly diagnosed and treated, the disease becomes irreversible and possibly even fatal.If you notice signs of hepatic lipidosis in your cat, take it to your vet as soon as you can.

, Before running diagnostic tests, your vet will perform a physical exam of your cat. During the physical exam, give your vet a history of your cat’s symptoms, including when the symptoms started and what they look like. Below are some signs of hepatic lipidosis that your vet will look for on the physical exam:Severe weight loss
Jaundice
Enlarged liver
Dehydration

, A blood sample is an important tool for diagnosing hepatic lipidosis. When your vet takes a blood sample, they will look for several abnormalities that can indicate hepatic lipidosis:Elevated alkaline phosphatase (a liver enzyme) and bilirubin
Elevated blood cholesterol
Low red blood cell count
Low levels of several electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and phosphate

, An abdominal ultrasound will allow your vet to look at your cat’s liver. On ultrasound, a liver affected by hepatic lipidosis will be hyperechoic, meaning that it will look brighter than usual on the ultrasound screen.The liver may also look enlarged.An ultrasound machine sends ultrasound waves through the skin. When these waves get reflected back from inside the body, images of different organs form on a screen. Echogenicity (hyperechoic, hypoechoic) refers to how these ultrasound waves get reflected back., The only way to confirm hepatic lipidosis is to analyze a small liver sample. To take the sample, your vet will use the ultrasound image to guide a long, thin needle into your cat’s liver.They will draw up a very small liver sample into the needle, then examine the sample under a microscope.


Your vet will anesthetize your cat to take the sample.
In the liver sample, your vet will look for a large buildup of fat in the liver cells.Usually, a liver biopsy is not needed to make a diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis."

Be aware that if your cat eats grass a lot, she may be a ‘happy’ vomiter.,
Understand that commercial cat food does not necessarily go with a cat’s normal digestion process.,
Recognize signs of a ‘poor’ vomiter.",How to Diagnose Chronic Vomiting in Cats1," A key sign of a happy vomiter is a cat that is otherwise well but has a tendency to eat grass and make herself sick.This is a predictable chain of events that you can generally observe on more than one occasion. Some cats make themselves sick once every two or three days, while others only make themselves sick once a week. Once they have induced vomiting they are content to wander off and perhaps even look for a snack. Other habits that may go along with eating grass include:


Eating normally, keeping her food down at mealtime, maintaining weight, being active, and having a glossy coat.;
, Wild cats will eat all of their prey—including bones, fur, and stomach contents. When they do this, they digest what they can, and then vomit up the indigestible parts. Commercial cat foods lack the stimulus that causes cats to vomit, so some cats may make themselves vomit by eating grass.


If your cat is a ""happy"" vomiter and seems otherwise perfectly well, mention this habit at the next veterinary checkup so that your vet can confirm there is no problem.

, These cats do need a medical workup to make a diagnosis. A ""poor"" or “poorly” vomiter is one who is losing weight, has difficulty keeping food down, has lost her appetite, has a dull starry coat, is drinking excessively, or becomes lethargic.Another reason to get your cat checked is if the vomiting becomes more frequent than it used to, for example if it goes from once a week to daily. If in doubt and your cat vomits regularly, it is always safest to get her checked by a veterinarian.

Schedule a physical exam for your cat.,
Know that your vet will check your cat’s mucus membranes.,
Look at the capillary refill time.,
Check hydration status.,
Know that your cat’s heart rate will be checked.,
Understand that the cat’s temperature will be tested.,
Understand what an abdominal palpation is.,
Update your cat’s worming medications if the physical exam does not help you determine what is wrong with your cat.,
Treat your cat for hair balls.",How to Diagnose Chronic Vomiting in Cats2," During a physical exam, the veterinarian will examine the cat to look for signs of ill health that could cause vomiting, and also to feel the abdomen for masses or blockages. The following steps discuss the various aspects of a physical exam.

, Your vet will lift your cat’s lip to look at the color of the gums. These should be pink, much like our own gums. Pallor (very pale pink or even white) gums indicate anemia, and a yellow stain suggests jaundice. These give the clinician clues as to where to look to identify the problem.

, A useful way to assess if the cat's circulation is coping, or if the cat is in a state of shock because of fluid loss, is the capillary refill time. This is the amount of time it takes for the gum to become pink again after the blood is pressed out of it.A normal capillary refill time is under two seconds, and usually the refill is too brisk to count. A refill of more than two seconds is delayed.


To measure the capillary refill time lift the lip and press a fingertip firmly to the gum, such that the gum goes pale or white. Release the finger and watch closely to see how many seconds it takes for the gum to become pink again.

, Lift the scruff away from the shoulders and then let it go. The skin should return to its normal position instantaneously. Dehydration decreases the skin's elasticity which means that it returns slowly when released. Severe dehydration results in ""tenting"" which is when the skin remains in a peak, rather than sliding back down.In the case of a vomiting cat, this may indicate that the cat is losing more fluid than she is taking in. This finding indicates a cat in need of urgent replacement fluid, such as being put on an intravenous drip.


Intravenous fluids are given via a catheter which is placed in the vein in the cat's front leg. A giving set and bag of saline is attached to the catheter and the fluids drip directly into the bloodstream. Typically it takes 24 to 48 hours to slowly correct an underlying fluid deficit, during which time the cat will need to be hospitalized.

, Although this sounds like a strange thing to do when investigating vomiting, there is an underlying connection. Conditions such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) can cause vomiting, and is also associated with a racing heart.


A resting heart rate of 180 beats per minute is abnormal, and the vet will feel the cat's throat area to see if an obviously enlarged thyroid is palpable.

, A cat's temperature should be below 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit), and if it is above this, it is an indication of fever.


A vomiting cat with a fever may be suffering from an infection.

, To do an abdominal palpation, the veterinarian uses his fingertips to gently feel the cat's abdomen. He or she is checking that the gut, kidneys, bladder, spleen and liver feel like they are a normal size and shape, and are not painful. Organ enlargement can indicate infection, inflammation, cancer, or a blockage to outflow from that organ. He or she will also feel for any abnormal formations.

, If your cat is not unduly ill, not running a fever, is well hydrated and keeping most of her food down, the vet may suggest getting her up to date with preventative treatments such as worming.


A heavy worm burden can cause a physical obstruction in the bowel, or irritate the stomach lining and cause vomiting.

, The treatment for hair balls includes a gentle liquid paraffin based laxative that you put on your cat's paw. One such typical product is Lax-a-paste, of which you put about ½ an inch onto the cat's paw twice a day for two to three days.


The idea is that this seeps in through your cat's paw and gently lubricates any hairballs that are rattling around in your cat’s stomach and causing inflammation, and helps them to either be passed out in the feces, or vomited up.

"
"
Get a blood test for your cat.,
Use radiography to figure out what is going on with your cat.,
Get an ultrasound of your cat’s digestive system.",How to Diagnose Chronic Vomiting in Cats3," Blood tests are run either if no specific reason for the vomiting is found on a physical exam, or to back up suspicions raised on the physical. The panel of bloods usually looks at biochemistry and hematology. Biochemistry gives a measure of organ function, such as whether the kidneys are working well.


Hematology gives information about the blood cells, such as whether the cat has a raised white cell count (fighting an infection) in which case antibiotic therapy is indicated, or is anemic (the result of some infections and cancer) which should prompt a search for the cause of the anemia.

, If there is still not explanation for the vomiting then radiography of the abdomen is appropriate. A plain x-ray is taken without the cat being given any contrast agent such as barium.


The information gained on plain x-ray is limited because the soft tissue structures of the abdomen are all of similar radiodensity which means the thickness of the stomach wall, or presence of ulcers, is almost impossible to see.
However, x-rays are useful when looking for a foreign body (something the cat has swallowed that she shouldn't have) that is causing a blockage. If an obstruction is found then the decision needs to be made about whether it needs surgical removal, or if there is a chance it will pass through of its own accord. Radiographies also can help look for tumors, and check the size of organs.

, Ultrasound uses high frequency waves to produce a grey-scale image of the objects in its path. Ultrasound is particularly useful for vomiting issues because the ultrasound can look into your cat’s stomach for growth and foreign bodies. The pattern of the contractions and movement of fluid within the bowel can also give clues about any blockages that may be causing your cat trouble.


With ultrasounds your vet can measure the thickness of the stomach and bowel wall, and look for craters that could indicate an ulcer. Ulcers are usually treatable with oral medications that protect the stomach lining and decrease acid production. It is also possible to see discrete lumps such as may suggest a tumor or cancer.

"
Understand that trial treatment is the next step if no results have been gained from the tests.,
Try feeding your cat a hypoallergenic diet.,
Understand why a hypoallergenic diet might work.",How to Diagnose Chronic Vomiting in Cats4," If all tests to date come back as normal or negative, then the next step is either diagnosis by treatment, or biopsy.


The latter is discussed in the next section, but if the cat is not seriously ill, you may want to consider trial treatment first, because bowel biopsy does carry a risk of peritonitis and a high complication rate.

, If the presenting symptom is vomiting, and all tests prove negative or normal, then the veterinarian may suggest putting the cat on a hypoallergenic diet. The reason for this is that sensitivity to a food ingredient can cause inflammation that leads to vomiting.


A hypoallergenic diet is a food restricted to one protein source and one carbohydrate, or may be a hydrolyzed diet. The latter means that the protein molecules have been broken down so that they are too small to bridge receptors in the bowel wall that trigger allergic reactions.

, The theory behind a hypoallergenic diet is that the bowel gets a chance to settle down because it is not being inflamed by the food. Thus, a chronic vomiter with a food allergy should stop vomiting on a hypoallergenic diet.


If however, the vomiting persists, then bowel biopsy may be necessary.

"
"
Understand that a definitive diagnosis can often be made through biopsy.,
Understand that there is a high complication rate.,
Take your time discussing your options with your veterinarian.",How to Diagnose Chronic Vomiting in Cats5," A small portion of the bowel is harvested and then examined by a histologist who looks at the cells under a microscope. Samples can be taken by endoscope, in which case only pinches of tissue from the lining are obtained.


Full-thickness bowel wall biopsies can be taken surgically during laparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen).

, Full thickness biopsies are associated with a high complication rate. This is nothing to do with the skill of the surgeon, but a reflection of the bowel wall's tendency to swell in response to injury, which can cause sutures to cheese-wire through and loosen, allowing gut contents to leak out into the abdomen.

, If you are considering bowel biopsies discuss them fully with your veterinarian so that you are aware of all the risks and advantages.

Look for decreased mobility in the neck and limbs.,
Notice if your cat has trouble grooming itself.,
Look for weight loss and decreased appetite.,
Check for loose teeth and gum disease in kittens.,
Have a vet examine your cat.",How to Diagnose and Treat Vitamin A Toxicity in Cats1," Since its neck vertebrae and other joints are stiff or fused, a cat suffering from vitamin A toxicity has trouble moving. It might struggle walking, have trouble reaching its food and water, or become aggressive when touched or moved.It might also sit in a strange, kangaroo-like pose with its forelimbs outstretched.;
, Reduced self-grooming often results when a cat suffers from mobility issues. Look for signs such as an unkempt or messy coat, matting, and lots of loose, dead hair in the coat. Its feet might also be stained from the litter box, and it might constantly have food on its muzzle., While decreased mobility is the most noticeable symptom of vitamin A toxicity, it can also lead to weight loss and poor appetite. Too much vitamin A causes metabolic changes that cause weight loss, and your cat might have difficulty accessing its food bowl.In kittens, vitamin A toxicity can prevent normal growth and weight gain.

, In addition to weight loss or problems gaining weight, vitamin A toxicity in kittens also causes dental issues. Look for loose teeth, abnormally formed teeth, and gingivitis.Dental issues don’t occur when adult cats eat too much vitamin A.

, Symptoms associated with vitamin A toxicity can also occur in a number of other disorders, so only a vet can make an accurate diagnosis. The vet will ask you about your cat’s diet, the types of treats you offer, and if it has any related symptoms. They’ll administer an x-ray or ultrasound to check for abnormal bone growth and joint fusion.The vet will also order blood work to test its vitamin A levels and rule out other conditions. In addition, vitamin A toxicity can lead to kidney and liver issues, so the vet will likely check these organs’ functions."

Look for wounds.,
Look for crusting skin or dandruff.,
Watch your cat’s behavior.,
Check for bald spots.,
Look for color changes.,
Look for sores or lesions.",How to Diagnose Feline Skin Problems1," Wounds might be painful, moist, oozing, or discharging. Alternately, they might already by scarred over, and you might find only spots or scabs left behind by a nasty feline skin problem.When you detect a wound on your cat, monitor it regularly. If it changes color or begins to ooze, stink, or discharge, the wound is infected. Contact your vet for further instructions.;
, Dry, flaky, or crusting skin is a common problem in felines. The condition could be due to any one of a variety of medical conditions. For instance, your cat might have mange, a condition caused by parasitic mite infestations.Diabetes is also a possible cause. Abnormal skin growths (neoplasia) or cancers are also a potential culprit., Irritation is best detected by watching your cat’s behavior. If your cat shakes its head, bites, or excessively licks a particular part of its body, it’s probably due to skin irritation.Your cat will probably not scratch itself with its paws. This behavior is common in dogs, but not in cats.Conditions commonly associated with itching and skin irritation include epitheliotropic lymphoma (a rare cancer), pemphigus foliaceus (an autoimmune condition), and fleas., If your cat has an area of irritation – a wound, abscess, or other skin problem – they will probably reveal the irritated area by licking it excessively, leading to hair loss. In the course of normal interactions with your cat, check it regularly for wounds and areas of hair loss.Before the area is completely denuded of fur, you might be able to see matted areas on your cat’s fur. This is also a sign that your cat has a skin problem.

, Macules – areas of the skin that change color – are common in feline cases of inflammation or injury. Redness is the most common macule discoloration. If your cat’s fur is thin and you can see its skin, check for red skin. Other color changes are also possible, though, including brown, red, black, yellow, and reddish purple.Yellow, or jaundiced, skin often results from liver disease.
Redness, the most common type of discoloration, is produced by a vast number of conditions, including malassezia (a yeast infection) or cancer.
Wheals – raised areas of the skin, sometimes referred to as “cat hives” – might appear whitish or red.

, Sores and lesions are feline skin problems associated with raised, discolored bumps on the skin. They might be filled with pus or fluid. Like other feline skin problems, sores and lesions can originate due to a diverse array of different conditions. For instance, your cat might have:Bowen’s disease, a sort of carcinoma (cancer)
Mosquito bite hypersensitivity, a sort of mosquito allergy
Burns, which can produce lesions if the cat is burned badly
Cold agglutinin disease, a condition caused by proteins that block blood vessels, damaging them

, C. felis enters a cat’s body as sporozoites (spore-like stage of parasite development). These sporozoites invade large white blood cells (WBCs) and develop into schizonts (a type of cell). Infected WBCs go to a cat's veins and block blood flow.If schizonts block blood flow in the lungs, a cat can develop breathing trouble.


If your cat has breathing troubles, it will start breathing rapidly or exert a lot of effort to take deep breaths.

, A cat with cytauxzoonosis will feel pain all over its body. To demonstrate this pain, a cat will vocalize loudly.If you hear your cat wailing loudly, it's probably in a lot of pain from the disease.

, Jaundice is a yellowing of various parts of the body due to liver problems. Cytauxzoonosis can cause jaundice.Look at your cat’s eyes, ears, and gums to see if they are turning yellow.


Instead of looking yellow, the gums may look pale due to low levels of red blood cells (RBCs)., Cats with cytauxzoonosis are frequently depressed.Signs of depression in cats are below:Loss of appetite
Avoiding human interaction
Sleeping more than usual
Less playful
Strange behavior (no longer using the litter box, becoming more aggressive, grooming less often)

, Cats with cytauxzoonosis develop very high fevers, indicating a severe infection. A cat’s normal body temperature is 100‒102.8 degrees Fahrenheit (38‒39 degrees Celsius).With cytauxzoonosis, the temperature can go as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).You can take the temperature by ear or rectally. Ear temperatures are usually less reliable than rectal temperatures.To take the rectal temperature, coat the thermometer with lube, such as KY jelly. Holding your cat with its hind end facing you, gently insert the thermometer about 2 inches (5 cm) into the rectum and hold it there until you hear it beep.
If you’re not comfortable taking the temperature (or your cat won't let you), your vet can do so.
As cytauxzoonosis gets worse, a cat can become very cold., As cytauxzoonosis progresses, a cat can start showing neurologic signs. For example, a cat may have trouble walking or start having seizures. A cat’s pupils may also start moving rapidly and uncontrollably.Look for these neurologic signs in your cat.


Signs of seizures in cats include body twisting, muscle twitching, salivating, and rigid limbs., Cytauxzoonosis causes severe illness very quickly and is often fatal.If your cat is showing signs of this disease, do not delay in taking it to your vet for diagnosis and treatment.

, Before running any diagnostic tests, your vet will perform a thorough physical examination of your cat. In addition to the physical signs mentioned above, your vet will touch your cat to feel for an enlarged spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. They will also see if your cat is dehydrated.The disease-causing tick may or may not be on your cat at the time of your appointment., Analyzing your cat’s blood will help your vet diagnose cytauxzoonosis. First, they will look at blood cell counts (complete blood count) and levels of other substances in the blood (blood chemistry). On the results, your vet will see low counts of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. They will also see elevated liver enzyme levels.Your vet will also look at your cat’s blood with a microscope (blood smear).
On the blood smear, your vet will be able to see schizonts in WBCs. They may also see merozoites (what gets released from the schizonts) in RBCs.RBCs are usually not infected until late in the disease. If your vet doesn’t see infected RBCs on one day, they may want to take blood samples each day after that to continue looking at the cells., Frequently, seeing C. felis on a blood smear is enough to diagnose cytauxzoonosis. Sometimes, though, blood smears don’t show C. felis. If this happens, your vet will want to take a tiny tissue sample from your cat’s spleen, liver, or lymph nodes to look for the organism. This sample is called a fine needle aspirate (FNA).To take an FNA, your vet will anesthetize your cat. They will then use an ultrasound machine to identify the affected organ. Your vet will use the image of the affected organ to guide a long, thin needle into the organ and pull up a tissue sample into the needle.
Your vet will analyze the tissue sample with a microscope.

Change your cat’s diet.,
Take your cat to a follow-up visit.,
Have bone growths surgically removed.",How to Diagnose and Treat Vitamin A Toxicity in Cats2," The primary way to treat vitamin A toxicity is to remove the source of excess vitamin A from your cat’s diet. If caught early, most symptoms improve soon after switching to a more balanced diet of commercial cat food. Discuss your cat’s current diet and any necessary dietary changes with its vet.Most vets recommend switching cat food gradually by first mixing old and new food together. However, since vitamin A toxicity usually occurs in cats with liver-based diets, the vet will likely advise you eliminate liver and switch to a commercial cat food more abruptly.If you give your cat animal liver, liver-based treats, fish liver oil, or any supplements, stop doing so immediately.

, After switching its food, you’ll likely need to bring your cat back to the vet for a follow-up visit within one to two weeks. This will allow the vet to retest your cat’s vitamin A levels to ensure switching its diet was an effective treatment.Total costs of vitamin A toxicity treatment vary by location and severity of poisoning. In the United States, the average cost is $500., In rare cases, a vet might recommend removing new bone formations surgically. However, this procedure is only advised in cases of severe vitamin A toxicity.If your cat’s vet believes it’s a surgical candidate, they’ll inform you about risks, costs, and pre- and postoperative care.

"
"
Ask the vet about anti-inflammatory medication.,
Make food, water, and litter boxes more accessible.,
Help your cat groom itself.",How to Diagnose and Treat Vitamin A Toxicity in Cats3," While changing your cat’s diet can resolve some symptoms, most cases of established bone growth and fused joints are irreversible. Ask the vet to recommend an anti-inflammatory drug or topical ointment to help manage your cat’s pain.Depending on bone and joint issues’ severity, your cat might need medication to manage pain for the rest of its life.

, Limited mobility can prevent your cat from easily climbing into its litter box or bending its neck to access food and water. Elevate its food and water bowls so they’re closer to its mouth level to make feeding easier. Get a litter box with lower sides and, if your cat goes upstairs or downstairs, provide a box on all of your home’s floors., If vitamin A toxicity resulted in limited mobility, self-grooming will also be difficult for your cat. Help it groom itself by wiping down its coat daily with a warm, damp washcloth. Be sure to clean areas like the lower spine and hind legs that your cat might have trouble reaching.

If your cat has long fur, brush it weekly to prevent matting. Consider trimming fur that’s prone to matting and soiling around its hind legs and rear end.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Get a blood test.,
Share information about your cat’s lifestyle.,
Follow the vet’s treatment recommendations.",How to Diagnose Feline Skin Problems2," If you notice any indication of skin problems, take your cat to the vet for a proper diagnosis. Your vet will be able determine the cause of your cat’s skin problems and provide a remedy.Your vet will first initiate a visual examination to check for fleas and examine the area of irritation.
If they don’t immediately find something, they will take a biopsy (a skin scraping) to check for mites and infections.
Your vet might also use a fungal culture to check for ringworm. This involves testing your cat’s nail clippings, fur, or body fluids for presence of the fungus that the vet suspects caused your cat’s skin problems.

, If the visual examination, biopsy, and fungal culture fail to identify anything out of the ordinary, your vet might take a blood sample from your cat. The process is not unlike that which you experience when getting blood drawn at the doctor’s office. Your vet will simply use a needle to puncture the skin and draw blood from your cat.Your vet might ask you or an assistant to reassure or restrain the cat when drawing its blood.
Blood tests might reveal allergies that could be the underlying cause of your cat’s skin problems.

, When you bring your cat to a vet for diagnosis, let them know of any recent significant changes to your cat’s lifestyle. For instance, if you recently changed your cat’s cat food or moved to a new home, share that information with your vet.Let your vet know if other cats or house pets are suffering from a similar skin condition. Whatever your cat has might be contagious.The more information about your cat you share with your vet, the better they will be able to diagnose the situation.

, Your vet will recommend an appropriate solution based on their analysis of your cat’s skin problem. For instance, you might need to apply anti-inflammatory medications or antihistamines (medications that control the immune system). Antibiotics or antifungal treatments might be necessary in the case of an infection. Non-medical solutions could include creams, ear drops, or a simple haircut for your feline friend.Always use medications as directed.
Contact your vet if you have questions regarding treatment.

Maintain flea control in your home.,
Give your cat a balanced diet.,
Worm your cat regularly.,
Treat the underlying condition.,
Provide supplements to your cat.,
Wash your cat.",How to Diagnose Feline Skin Problems3," Just like people, cats can get too much sun. Cats that spend too much time in the sun can get dry skin and sun damage. The exact amount of time your cat needs in the sun depends on its breed. Talk to your vet about your cat’s sunshine needs.Cats with white ears, noses, and eyelids are more likely to get sun-damaged skin than cats with darker skin.

, If your home gets infested by fleas, it can be hard to get rid of them. Talk to your vet about the best options for flea control in your home. Your vet will provide advice based on their knowledge of your cat’s health and breed.The most common flea prevention methods are oral medications and sprays that keep fleas away from your cat.
You can also limit the odds that your cat will contract fleas by keeping it away from stray cats and limiting its outdoors time.

, A balanced diet promotes healthy skin.A healthy feline diet contains fatty acids, vitamins, amino acids, and minerals. Look for a cat food that is labeled with an Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) statement attesting to its nutritional completeness.The best-quality cat foods will have meat, meat byproducts, or seafood listed among the first few ingredients.
Choose a cat food your cat enjoys eating. If your cat turns up its nose at a given cat food, even if it is nutritionally balanced, there are many other nutritionally balanced cat foods available that are more palatable to your kitty. For instance, canned food tends to be preferred over semi-moist food, which in turn tends to be more popular than dry cat food.
Most cats need to be fed three times daily. Your vet will let you know if your cat needs its diet adjusted based on its age and weight.

, Worming refers to the process of removing the intestinal worms that often populate the feline gut. Cats with large worm populations could develop skin problems.Tapeworms, hookworms, and roundworms are some of the most common worms in cats.To deworm your cat, consult your vet. Your vet will be knowledgeable about what sorts of feline worms are most common in your geographical area, and will be able to recommend the most effective deworming treatment based on modern veterinary science.
Your vet will let you know how often you need to deworm your cat during your regularly scheduled veterinary visits.

, If your kitty has skin problems due to an underlying condition like cancer, diabetes, or a mite infestation, treating that condition is the necessary first step in solving the skin problem. Talk to your vet about the best way to solve your cat’s underlying condition., If your cat has a balanced diet but still suffers from dry, flaky skin, consider adding omega 3 fatty acid or cod liver oil supplements to their diet. These are available from many pet stores in the form of chewable capsules that you can simply feed your cat along with its meals.Ask your vet to recommend a reputable brand and verify that such supplements would be safe and effective for your cat.
Always use supplements as directed by the manufacturer.

, Cats usually do not need to be bathed since they clean themselves regularly. But if your cat has skin problems – especially dry or flaky skin – a bath could help treat grimy and matted fur that might exacerbate skin irritation. Use a mild, nontoxic, moisturizing shampoo when washing your cat.Bathe your cat when it is relaxed. Baths after a play session are ideal.Before bathing, trim your cat’s claws and brush its fur to remove any loose hair. Place cotton balls in your cat’s ears before the bath to keep water out.
Place your cat in the tub and use a handheld hose or detachable showerhead to get your cat wet.
Massage the shampoo into your cat’s fur according to manufacturer directions. Rinse the cat off with the hose or showerhead, then dry your cat gently with a towel.

It may bob or weave its head and torso when it sits up or stands. It may also sway its head or torso around as a result of the virus., A kitten with the virus may have a difficult time standing upright without weaving or bobbing around. It may stumble from side to side when it stands, almost as if it is drunk.Kittens with the virus also have difficulty jumping or leaping to high spots. Notice if the kitten does not seem to be able to jump up on furniture or shelves on its own.

, The kitten may have a difficult time walking and running properly if it has cerebellar hypoplasia. It may stumble around when it tries to walk or run. It may also have tremors in its legs when it walks or runs, causing it to shake and sway around., The vet will be able to give you an official diagnosis on the kitten’s condition. At the appointment, start by telling the vet about the kitten’s medical history. Note if the kitten’s mother has a genetic predisposition to cerebellar hypoplasia. Discuss any other medical problems the kitten has had or currently has.You can also tell the vet if you notice any physical symptoms or issues the kitten is displaying, especially if you notice them within six months of the kitten’s birth.

, The vet will exam the kitten’s head, torso, and legs. They will note if the kitten has tremors in these areas as well as difficulty standing, walking, or jumping. They may have the kitten try to stand, walk, or jump to observe it., The vet will take a blood sample and a urine sample from the kitten. They may also do X-rays of the kitten’s abdomen and chest, as well as an MRI of the kitten’s brain. These tests will help the vet confirm the kitten’s diagnosis., Once the vet has completed the necessary exams and tests, they will confirm the kitten has cerebellar hypoplasia. They may outline how severe the kitten’s condition is as well as how the virus is affecting the kitten’s motor functions.

There is no cure for cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens. However, the virus is not painful for kittens, and many kittens with this condition live a long life. Discuss ways that you can make life easier for the kitten with the vet.

, To help the kitten live successfully with this condition, keep it indoors at all times. Do not leave the kitten outdoors unattended, as it is at risk of injury., A kitten with cerebellar hypoplasia will have difficulty with climbing stairs and doing strenuous activities like running or jumping. Create a home environment for the kitten that is accessible and calming.For example, you could place the kitten’s bed and feeding area on the same level so the kitten does not have to climb stairs. You may also avoid playing too much with the kitten, or only in ways that don't require it to run, jump, or leap.

, Kittens who have this condition and cannot perform basic functions like standing, sitting, or walking may need to be euthanized. Discuss this decision with your vet. Often this is only recommended if the kitten is very impaired by the virus."

Seek surgical removal.,
Allow time for recovery.,
Schedule follow-ups.",How to Diagnose and Treat Salivary Cysts in Cats," Swelling in the salivary glands often causes swelling around the entirety of the face, as well as blood in saliva and soft masses in the neck. Check the face and neck area to look for symptoms of salivary mucoceles.Use your finger to gently pull up on the cheeks and expose the teeth and gums. Visually check for swelling, bleeding, or discoloration. You may also want to smell for bad breath.
Run the back of your hand down the cat’s neck, applying light pressure, to feel for masses.;
, Salivary cysts can cause lethargy, loss of appetite, difficulty eating, and other behavioral changes. Watch your cat’s daily habits to see if they are eating or drinking less, or avoiding playing and other physical activity they typically enjoy.If your car is typically lethargic, maybe due to age or a disability, do not assume lethargy alone is a symptom. Look for other symptoms, as well.
Also watch your cat for vomiting. If they are eating well but throwing up regularly, it may be a sign that something is wrong.

, A salivary mucocele may cause respiratory distress such as difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing. Listen for wheezing, labored breathing, or other signs that your cat may be struggling to properly intake air.If your cat seems to be experiencing any respiratory distress, seek help from a vet immediately. Trouble breathing could cause brain damage or become fatal if not treated quickly.

, Only a trained veterinarian should diagnose and treat salivary problems for your cat. If your cat is showing symptoms of salivary swelling, make an appointment with your vet and ask them to check for mucoceles.Let your vet know what symptoms you have observed at home, and provide as much detail as you can about when you began noticing behavioral changes.

, A vet can readily distinguish between a mucocele and a more severe problem such as a tumor with some simple testing. If recommended by your vet, allow them to test the detected mass using a fine needle biopsy, as well as imaging tests like sialography.These tests are often painless and not invasive for your cat, and they help your vet rule out more extreme problems such as cancers.

, Treatment options will be different depending upon your vet’s diagnosis after testing. Ask your vet, “what treatment options do you recommend for my cat’s particular problem?” Follow your vet’s recommendations as closely as you are able.If your cat is experiencing a problem other than a salivary mucocele, they may require more intensive testing and treatment. Talk to your vet extensively about treatment options, their cost, and their overall success rates.

, Minor surgery is generally the best treatment option for masses and cysts in the salivary glands. Talk to your vet about having the masses surgically removed, or otherwise tying off damaged ducts to help stop saliva leakage.Before you have the actual procedure performed, talk to your vet about any potential risks associated with the procedure. Let them know about any pre-existing conditions your cat may have, and see if they impact your cat’s eligibility for the removal procedure.
Seek removal immediately if the masses are impacting your cat’s ability to eat or breathe.

, After surgery, your cat will need time to rest and recover. Follow your vet’s instructions for aftercare, and carefully monitor the incision site for signs of infection such as swelling, redness, or discharge.Your cat may need to be placed on soft foods until the incisions heal so that they do not aggravate the injuries.
Your cat may also be placed on antibiotics to help prevent infection. Administer them regularly according to your vet’s instructions.

, After cyst removal, be sure to schedule regular follow-up appointments as suggested by your vet. The first one should be two or so weeks after the surgery to make sure the incision has healed and no infection is present.If you think an infection may be present, don’t wait until your follow-up appointment. Contact your vet immediately to schedule a check-up.
If you move or find a new vet, let them know during your first appointment that your cat experienced salivary swelling in the past. This way, the new vet knows to monitor for any future complications.

Monitor your cat closely after surgery.,
Feel for any gland enlargements.,
Make note of any breeding behaviors.,
Watch for aggressive behavioral changes.,
Note any unusual weight loss.,
Be aware that ORS can develop slowly.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ovarian Remnant Syndrome in Cats1," Cats can develop ORS after going through an ovariohysterectomy (OHE) to remove their ovaries. This occurs when not all of the ovarian tissue is taken out as planned. After an OHE surgery, or any other surgical procedure involving a female cat’s reproductive organs, closely monitor them during the recovery period to see if they exhibit any behavioral symptoms associated with going into heat, such as loud vocalizations., Place your hands underneath your cat and locate their nipples. Gently feel around these areas to see if you notice any bulging skin or unusually firm growths. This could be a sign that your cat’s glands are enlarging, a sign of breeding that could indicate ORS., Watch for posturing actions in which your cat positions her body to attract males for breeding. This includes holding her tail up and to the side or making treading motions with her back legs. Your cat may also start to roll or crouch in unusual ways.Increased vocalizations are another sign of breeding preparations, which may point towards ORS. So, if your cat is yowling at all hours of the night, then you may want to talk with your vet.

, Cats in the midst of breeding season, and those suffering from ORS, may begin to act violently by scratching or biting caretakers. They might also display minor aggressive behaviors, such as marking or clawing furniture. The main point here is to watch for unusual changes in your cat’s actions and personality., The presence of remnant ovarian tissue can cause some cats to slow down their eating habits, resulting in sudden weight loss. If your cat is recovering from a surgery and you’ve noticed a change in their weight, then talk with your vet about how to move forward.Be aware that the weight loss and accompanying poor nutrition can also cause your cat to lose some of their fur.

, It is possible for your cat to take months to show any signs of ORS after OHE surgery. For that reason, patience and vigilance is key when diagnosing ORS. In particular, cats who develop tumors in association with OHE procedures can take up to ten years before being seen for additional treatment.It takes an average of 17 months for a cat with a problematic OHE procedures to show signs of ORS.

Talk with your vet.,
Get a vaginal cytology test.,
Agree to hormonal testing.,
Allow for diagnostic imaging.,
Do exploratory surgery.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ovarian Remnant Syndrome in Cats2," As soon as you notice that your cat is not feeling 100%, make a call to your vet and get an appointment. During the visit your vet will ask about your cat’s recent behaviors, and may take another look at any notes associated with recent surgeries. Be as honest as you can and be prepared for the possibility that the vet may ask to keep your cat overnight for additional testing., This is one way to tell if your cat is undergoing a heat cycle (or estrus). The vet will take a cotton swab sample from your cat’s vagina and then examine the results under a microscope. The presence of particular reproductive cells will indicate the presence of estrogen in your cat’s system, as a result of ovarian remnants.Be aware that most vets will not make an ORS diagnosis on the basis of a vaginal cytology test alone. This is usually just one of the first steps in the diagnostic process.

, This involves your vet drawing blood and then looking for baseline hormone levels. On a more advanced level, your vet can conduct a hormone stimulation test to see how your cat’s body responds when she is given a synthetic hormone. A blood sample drawn up to a week later will indicate if ORS is a possibility., Most vets can do an ultrasound or CT scan in their office on the same day as a visit. These scans may show the location of any remaining ovarian tissue, but they do have some limitations. If the tissue is rather small, then the result may be inconclusive., If your vet determines that your cat’s medical history and physical/clinical signs correspond with a diagnosis of ORS, then they may suggest performing an exploratory surgery to locate any remnant tissue. These surgeries have some risks, such as infection, so make sure that you discuss the procedure and recovery in detail with your vet.Exploratory surgery may have the best success when performed at least two weeks after your cat completes her heat cycle.

, If your vet suggests multiple tests or exploratory surgery, it might be a good idea to consult with another vet as well. Compare what these two professionals say about your cat’s diagnosis and treatment options. Choose the vet who you think has the best odds of treating your cat successfully."

Smell the cat's breath.,
Inspect the cat's mouth.,
Identify any unusual behavior.,
Take your cat to the vet.",How to Diagnose and Treat Periodontitis in Cats1," Sometimes, the only noticeable symptom of periodontitis is bad breath. If you notice that your cat has persistent bad breath, you should take them to the vet to be checked out.A healthy cat should not have a strong or offensive smell on their breath.
It is normal for the cat's breath to smell like their food after they eat, but it is not normal for the cat to have persistent bad breath. If you believe that your cat has periodontitis, do a smell check a few times a day for a few days to see if the bad breath is consistent.;
, There may be a few visible signs of periodontitis that you can notice by gently checking your cat’s mouth, teeth, and gums. Sit with your cat on your lap. As you pet and talk to your cat, gently tip their head back. Use a finger to part their lips to see their teeth and gums. Note that your cat may not let you inspect their mouth. If they resist your attempt, stop immediately. Take your cat to the vet instead for a full oral exam. Signs of periodontitis include:


Red gums
Gum recession
Loose teeth
Swelling around the mouth or face
Drooling
Yellowed teeth, If your cat is experiencing tooth pain, they may be acting strangely. You might notice them pawing at their face frequently. They may also have difficulty eating. Some cats may even start to lose their appetite.You may notice the cat becoming messier as they eat. This can be a sign that they are having difficulty eating.
If your cat has a decreased appetite, take them to the vet as this may be a symptom of multiple problems.

, Only your vet can diagnose for certain if your cat has periodontitis or another disease. If you suspect that your cat has periodontitis or if they are exhibiting any of its symptoms, schedule a visit with your vet.


In order to do a full oral exam, your vet may need to sedate your cat.You should take your cat to the vet annually for a dental exam and cleaning regardless of whether or not they have dental problems.

Allow your vet to perform surgery on the cat.,
Provide aftercare.",How to Diagnose and Treat Pyometra in Cats," Cats with pyometra will often develop a distended abdomen. A distended abdomen is an indication of infection, digestive issues, and other serious complications. Look for:

Decreased fat or muscle on the abdomen.
A bloated appearance around the area of the stomach.
A distended abdomen might also appear to have a tubular growth. This tubular growth is the infected area of the cat’s reproductive system.;
, Vaginal discharge is one of the most obvious signs of pyometra in cats. Ultimately, vaginal discharge is an indication of infection and other problems associated with pyometra. The discharge may:

Smell bad or foul
Be yellow or white
Contain small amounts of blood#Notice appetite loss and digestive issues. Cats with pyometra may have a variety symptoms associated with their digestive or intestinal tracks. As a result, you should take symptoms such as loss of appetite very serious. Some problems include:
Vomiting
Queasiness or nausea
Tiredness, One of the first things your vet may do is to culture your cat’s vaginal discharge or urine. This is important, as the vet will need to determine what antibiotic will aid in your cat’s recovery.

A culture is when the vet allows the bacteria from your cat’s body fluids to grow in a sterile environment., Blood diagnostics are important so your vet can check critical levels. Without running diagnostics, your vet won’t be able to rule out other conditions or problems. In the end, blood work will help confirm a diagnosis of pyometra.

Blood tests will check the level of red and white blood cells – this will give an indication of the strength of the cat’s immune system.
Blood tests can identify other problems that might exacerbate the cat’s pyometra., Your vet will likely take several X-rays of the uterus to get a better idea of the scope of the infection. Without X-rays, your vet may not be able to come to a diagnosis.

Your vet will take a minimum of 2 X-rays.
X-rays may give your vet an idea of whether they need to resort to surgical intervention as a treatment.
After examining X-rays, your vet may have to conduct other imaging diagnostics like an ultrasound to rule out other conditions., Intravenous fluids are important in keeping your cat hydrated. Without intravenous fluids, your cat’s body may not be able to fight the infection and make a full recovery. Your veterinarian may provide:

Intravenous fluids containing potassium chloride
Hartmann's solution, You vet will also prescribe you medicines to help your cat overcome infection and fight the other symptoms of pyometra. This is important, as cats with pyometra are susceptible to infection.

Your vet will likely prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic, like enrofloxacin or amoxicillin.
You should give your cat the antibiotic as prescribed. This may be once a day.
Your vet may consider prescribing prostaglandin, an enzyme that aids the body's recover from infection, over the course of 3 to 5 days.
In cases in which the infected part of the cat’s reproductive system has grown large, medicinal treatment may only have limited benefit., In many cases, your vet will need to perform surgery to remove infected parts of the cat’s reproductive system. Severe cases of pyometra may require surgical intervention.

Your vet will likely culture any part of the uterus that is removed. This will enable them to get a better idea of the type of bacteria afflicting your cat.
Some vets recommend complete removal of the uterus and ovaries. This will help promote a complete recovery.
Surgery will likely have the impact of ending the cat’s ability to reproduce., After surgical or medical treatment, you’ll have to provide your cat with a certain level of care. Without providing aftercare, your cat could relapse and develop potentially serious infections. When providing aftercare, remember:

Keep incisions clean. This may require replacing bandages on a regular basis.
Make sure to provide your cat with antibiotics and other medicines on a regular basis.
Stay in touch with your vet to make sure any complications are treated quickly."

Leave the remnant as is.,
Consent to surgery.,
Wait for any tissue results.,
Allow your cat to rest.,
Complete any follow-up appointments.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ovarian Remnant Syndrome in Cats3," It is possible that your vet will suggest simply observing the development of the remnant ovarian tissue over time. This is often the case if the tissue appears to be very small and is not overly influencing your cat’s behaviors or health. If you choose this approach, then make sure to schedule regular checkup visits with your vet., If the location of the ovarian tissue is rather specific, then a targeted surgical approach can be used. If the tissue has not been located, then exploratory surgery is the only real invasive option. Be aware that a surgery that must navigate through prior scar tissue can be more complicated, so talk over all of the benefits and challenges of the procedure with your vet.Be sure to follow all of your vet’s pre- and post-op instructions very carefully. For example, they may request that you not feed your cat on the day of the surgery., In certain cases, the ovarian tissue, or the cells surrounding it, could be cancerous. To rule this out, your vet will take a tissue sample from the surgery and send it off for testing. The wait time varies widely for these tests, so talk with your vet about the timetable., Laparoscopic ovarian remnant removal is a major surgery, so expect your cat to be on an exercise restriction and pain medications for up to two weeks. Keep your cat confined to a limited area during this period and try to limit any stress-causing factors, such as extra household visitors., Your vet will likely discharge your cat the day after surgery. Then, they will likely want to see your cat for at least one post-op appointment, usually a few weeks later. Another hormonal test may be ordered at this time, just to verify that the levels are now correct."

Talk to your vet about medical procedures.,
Give your cat their medication.,
Introduce your cat to brushing.,
Brush your cat’s teeth once a day.,
Change their diet.,
Check in with your vet periodically.",How to Diagnose and Treat Periodontitis in Cats2," If the periodontitis is severe, your cat may require surgery or another procedure. There are many different procedures used to treat cats, based on how the disease has progressed.



Root planing: In this procedure, tartar and diseased tissues are removed from the tooth. The vet may smooth over the root surface.

Subgingival curettage: This will remove diseased connective tissue from the tooth.

Gingivectomy: The vet will remove excess gum tissue to prevent bacteria from growing in the pockets between the gums and the teeth.Gingival Flap Surgery: The vet may open a flap of the gum over the root of the tooth to reach the deeper pockets so that they can be cleaned.Tooth extraction: A tooth is removed. This is done when the tooth cannot be saved or if other procedures do not work.

, The vet may prescribe your cat antibiotics to prevent or treat any infections. Follow the directions of the antibiotic carefully to make sure that your cat is getting the correct dosage., Once your cat has been treated by a vet, you will need to maintain daily dental care. Brushing your cat's teeth will help prevent future tartar build up and bone loss. Your cat may not respond well to brushing at first. Introduce brushing to your cat over a period of about four weeks.


Find a pet toothpaste in a flavor that your cat enjoys, such as fish or chicken flavor. Do not use human toothpaste, as it contains ingredients, such as fluoride, that may be harmful to cats. For a week or two, put a little toothpaste on your finger, and let the cat lick it off.
Once the cat is used to the taste of the toothpaste, rub a little bit on the cat’s front teeth. If the cat resists, stop, and try again the next day.
After a week or two, the cat may stop resisting when you touch their teeth. At this point, you can start using a brush. Start with the cat's front teeth and work your way around their mouth., Once a day, put a small amount of veterinary toothpaste or dentifrice on a brush, and brush the cat’s teeth with it. Move the brush along the outside of their teeth. Go quickly so that your cat does not wriggle away. You do not need to brush the insides of your cat's teeth.You can buy cat-specific toothbrushes from your vet or pet store. Do not use a human toothbrush as your cat may swallow the bristles.
If a feline toothbrush does not work, try a finger brush instead. Finger brushes are available at most pet stores. These will slide over your finger. This is a more comfortable method for some cats., If your cat had surgery or another medical procedure, you may need to feed them only soft foods for the first week or so after bringing them home. After that, your vet may recommend a special type of dry food that will reduce the risk of further tartar build-up. Talk to your vet to understand what dietary changes may be necessary for your cat.Some cat foods are marketed as dental diets. They contain special anti-tartar ingredients.Ask your vet if one of these is right for your cat.

, Once your cat has been treated, they may need to return to the vet every so often to have their teeth checked again.Talk to your vet to see how often they recommend you visit.After your cat has been treated, you may need to return to your vet after four to six weeks. After this first visit, depending on the severity of their condition, you may need to bring the cat in between two and four times a year.

Brush your cat’s teeth.,
Give the cat a dental rinse.,
Take your cat in for regular dental cleanings.",How to Diagnose and Treat Periodontitis in Cats3," Even if your cat does not have periodontitis, you should still brush their teeth once a day. Use a feline toothpaste or toothbrush, and apply a small amount of veterinary toothpaste before brushing their teeth., There are a few different types of oral rinses or solutions that you can give your cat to reduce tartar build-up. These come in gel and liquid form. Some may can squeezed into your cat’s mouth. Others may be sprayed.


Chlorhexidine is a common oral rinse given to pets. You can buy this in a gel or rinse form. Squeeze a little bit into the cat’s cheek. If you want, you can spread it around their mouth with a finger brush. Note, however, that some cats dislike the taste.At your pet store, you may be able to buy a liquid that you can add to your cat’s water bowl. These may be called ""dental water"" or ""liquid tartar remover."" Make sure to read the instructions carefully so that you add the right amount to their water.

, During a dental cleaning, your vet will remove any plaque or tartar on your cat’s teeth. They will also check your cat’s mouth, teeth, gums, and tongue for any problems. To do this, however, your cat will be put under general anesthesia.Dental cleanings are usually done every six months. Some vets may only ask you to come in once a year, however.Some groomers may offer “anesthesia free” dental cleanings. These cleanings are for cosmetic purposes only, and they will not help prevent periodontitis."

The habitat should be relatively warm, and the humidity should be between 60 and 80 percent.",How to Make a Praying Mantis Habitat," You can use anything that is safe for a small, delicate creature, and has plenty of light and air circulation, and will not mold or rot away. It should be at least six times the height of the length of the mantis, and four times the width, but the bigger, the better.
, You could even put some drainage holes in the bottom and grow some grass or moss on the bottom., Most praying mantises will like a green, leafy home, but some will prefer just dry sticks. You can grow live plants in the habitat, or just place branches in, and replace them regularly., This could be a shallow pool or a misting bottle., Generally if you are keeping the mantis in the same climate as where you found it, and not keeping it in extreme air conditioning or heating, the temperature and humidity should be okay."

Consider having your cat get a perineal urethrostomy.",How to Diagnose and Treat Urinary Blockages in Cats," Above all, only male cats get complete urinary tract blockages. However, there are some other risk factors that could increase your cat's risk of getting this veterinary problem.All risk factors include:Being a male cat: The urethra in a male cat, which is the tube that urine flows through to the outside of the body, is very narrow and can get obstructed easily. Female cats can get a variety of problems in their urinary tracts, such as feline idiopathic cystitis or stones, but they do not get completely obstructed urinary tracts.Being in a multi-cat household
Eating dry food
Being an indoor cat only
Being an older cat: Cats of any age can get a urinary blockage but older cats are more likely to get them.;
, Having a blocked urethra will cause your cat to show a variety of symptoms having to do with their urination. Symptoms connected to urination that your cat might have include:Strained urination
Frequent urination
Blood in the urine
Painful urination

, Trouble urinating can cause your cat to act out in problematic ways. Perhaps most problematic, many cats who have urinary blockages begin urinating in inappropriate places. This is due to the cats discomfort and inability to control its urination normally.


Also, due to the pain associated with this condition, your cat may begin to cry uncontrollably.
Your cat may hide and refuse to eat or drink. If your cat is not eating or drinking you should take it to a veterinarian right away.

, Having a urinary blockage can threaten your cat's life. In fact, within three to six days of having a blockage, your cat could die from the buildup of urine. Thus, it is important that you get it veterinary treatment as quickly as possible.


Call the veterinary office on your way to warn them that you are coming in because of an emergency. This will allow them to prepare for your arrival.
Be prepared to tell the veterinarian about all of your cat's symptoms.

, If the veterinarian suspects that the cat has a urinary tract blockage they will feel the cat's abdomen. When they do this they are feeling for the firmness of the bladder and urinary system.


If your cat is skittish or aggressive toward the veterinarian, it may need to be restrained during the exam.

, In order to get a definitive diagnosis, your veterinarian may want to do diagnostic tests on your cat. For example, the veterinarian may want to have a urine sample analyzed or they may want to do a urethrogram, which shows them a detail of the cat's urethra.The urine sample will be analyzed for the presence of crystals, which are often the culprit for a blocked urethra.

, If your cat has a severe case of urinary tract blockage, they will need immediate treatment. This immediate treatment usually includes sedation, intravenous fluids, and pain medication.These immediate treatments will make your cat much more comfortable by minimizing its pain.

, In order to clear the obstruction, your veterinarian will need to implant a catheter in the cat's urethra and flush the area. This will allow the crystals or stones to pass through.This is not a permanent catheter. It will be removed once all obstructions and infections have cleared up. This typically takes a few days.

, Your veterinarian may suggest that your cat needs to get a cystotomy, which is a procedure in which the veterinarian opens up the bladder and removes all stones. This procedure may be necessary for cats that have a lot of bladder stones and repeated obstructions.This is a common surgery and cats usually recover quickly from this procedure., A perineal urethrostomy is a veterinary surgery in which the cat's urethra is widened, minimizing the chance of it getting blocked in the future. This surgery is done most often on cats that have had repeated episodes of urinary blockages.This is a major surgery and it requires that the cat be put under anesthesia.

Find a praying mantis.,
Make it a home.,
Create the right environment.,
Feed it.,
Spray the inside of the cage with water about once a day so that the praying mantis has water to drink.",How to Keep a Praying Mantis As a Pet," There are several different ways to acquire a praying mantis. You can either buy an egg case from a gardening center or find one in your garden. If you want to find one in your garden you will have to look pretty hard since they are usually camouflaged very well. During the summer however, males are often attracted to lights at night.;
, The container for holding the praying mantis must not be too big for it to find its prey and at the same time, it must not be too small for it will become too cramped. The length of the container should be 3-4 times the length of the praying mantis and the height should be at least 2 times its length. The reason for this is so that the praying mantis can have enough room to stalk its prey yet not too big or else the praying mantis won't be able to find its prey.

, A good environment is necessary for a praying mantis to live. Punch holes at the top of the lid or container so that it will be able to breathe. There should be a few plants in the cage the same color as the insect so that it can blend in, yet the cage should not be overcrowded. The bottom of the container should be filled with about a half-inch of soil, preferably sand. Make sure that the cage isn't too humid. If the sides of the cage get foggy add a few more holes on top or on the sides.

, Food is an essential part of keeping a praying mantis as a pet. It can be fed small fruit flies, pinhead crickets, etc. As the praying mantis grows, it can be fed bottle-cap flies, bees, small spiders, etc. If the praying mantis is hatched from an egg case, keep it in the same cage as the rest of the praying mantises and they can eat each other off. While this may sound cruel, it is the easiest way to keep the strongest praying mantises and it is the easiest way to feed them as it is very hard to find small enough food for the baby praying mantises.

, The praying mantises will go up to the side of the cage and lap up the water. If you place an open container of water in the cage, then the praying mantises could fall in it and drown.

Catch the praying mantis with your hands.,
If all else fails, buy a praying mantis.",How to Catch and Keep a Praying Mantis1," Wear good clothing, especially in cold climates or places with thorny bushes. Bring water and check the weather before you go so that you'll be prepared for any bad weather. Bring a net to catch the mantis with, and bring a container to keep it in. This doesn't have to be the container it will live in permanently - anything small, portable, and with a lid will work.;
, Look around your house, making sure to check humid places and plants or other greenery. Look in places with lots of insects and bugs. Look carefully, as they are very good at camouflaging and can be colored green, yellow, brown, and even pink, depending on where you live.


Make sure not to step on or squish any praying mantises or other bugs you come across.

, Be sneaky and quick when attempting this, as they are quite fast. Use the net to catch the mantis, or put the container in front of it and try to edge it in, and firmly close the container as soon as the mantis is inside.

, Put one hand in front of the mantis and slowly coax it onto your hand. Move slowly and carefully so as not to scare the mantis, and keep it in your hand rather than letting it run up your arm. Once you're holding the mantis, put it gently into the container and close it.


Consider wearing gloves when handling a larger praying mantis, as their feet can hurt your hands and arms.

, If you can't find a praying mantis but still want one for a pet, you can simply buy one. Look online or at pet or garden supply stores near you.

Obtain a cage, aquarium, or other container.,
Clean the container.,
Make sure there are air holes in the cage.,
Furnish the cage.",How to Catch and Keep a Praying Mantis2," Buy a small aquarium or terrarium at any pet store, or use any plastic container about the size of a shoebox. Make sure the container has a lid that will stay firmly on.

, Wash it with soap and water, making sure to rinse all the soap out properly. Make sure there are no harmful chemicals or anything else that could poison your mantis.

, If you're buying a cage from a pet store, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you're making your own from a box or other container, you may have to poke small air holes so that your mantis can breathe. Make sure the holes are large enough to let air in but small enough that your mantis won't be able to escape through them.

, Add a small layer of dirt at the bottom of the container. You can also add pebbles, sticks, or leaves. Then add plants and branches that your mantis can climb on. Make sure there are plenty of fresh leaves and sticks big enough to hold or hide your mantis.


Make sure to change the leaves in the cage often. When they start to wilt, go limp, or turn brown, remove the old leaves from the cage and replace them with new, fresh ones. This will help make sure your cage is always a nice, happy place for your pet mantis.

Feed your praying mantis.,
Know that mantises molt.,
Clean up after your mantis.,
Think about releasing the mantis.",How to Catch and Keep a Praying Mantis3," Recently hatched mantises will eat small fruit flies or other mantises. Small and medium-sized ones eat crickets, grasshoppers, and other small insects or bugs. Adults can eat many things, including flies and other bugs, butterflies, and even tiny lizards. You may also be able to buy them food.

, When they don't move for a long time and their skin takes on a weird color, it means that they're going to molt, or shed their exoskeleton. When this happens, don't touch or play with them, try not to annoy them, and realize that they won't eat. Once your mantis has finished molting, you can remove its old exoskeleton from its cage and return to life as normal.

, Keep the cage neat and clean. Remove any dead or wilted plants from the cage and replace them with new, fresh ones. Mantises eat live food and can be messy, so clean away remnants of meals, poop, and anything else that might be dirtying the cage. Don't allow anything foreign or potentially harmful into the container.

, When it's an adult and big enough to fend for itself, consider releasing your praying mantis back into the wild. If you decide to do this, take it back to where you found it, if possible. Then remove the lid from its container and turn the container on its side, and simply wait for your mantis to leave on its own.

Look for the reemergence of symptoms.",How to Diagnose and Treat Pancreatitis in Cats," There are a number of known causes of feline pancreatitis. However, feline pancreatitis sometimes occurs for reasons unknown. Some of the documented causes of pancreatic inflammation in cats include:

Inflammatory bowel disease or liver disease.
Diabetes mellitus.
Abdominal trauma (such as being hit by a car).
Infections (such as toxoplasmosis or feline distemper).
Scorpion stings.;
, This two most common symptoms of pancreatitis in cats are lack of appetite and severe lethargy. If your cat has stopped eating and/or seems unusually sleepy, weak, or lethargic, take them to see the vet immediately. Pancreatitis can be lethal if not treated right away.Lack of appetite and lethargy can be symptomatic of many other conditions as well.
Any time your cat stops eating or seems listless they need to be taken to a vet right away.

, Beyond simple lethargy and loss of appetite, there are other symptoms that can indicate inflammation of the pancreas. If you observe any of these symptoms in your pet, seek the advice of a veterinarian.Other symptoms can include:

Fever.
Weight loss.
Dehydration.
Depression.
Increased heart rate.
Difficulty breathing.

, When you visit your vet, you must bring along some information. In order to properly diagnose your cat, your vet will ask a series of questions.You should be able to explain:

The complete medical history of the cat (to the best of your knowledge).
What (if any) medications your cat is taking.
What symptoms you have noticed.
When these symptoms began.
If your cat has experienced any physical trauma.

, In order to determine what is ailing your pet, the vet will need to perform a series of tests.In order to diagnose pancreatitis, these tests will likely include:

A physical examination.
Blood work.
An ultrasound.
A biopsy (if the cat is well enough to undergo the procedure).
X-rays (to rule out other problems or asses trauma).

, Pancreatitis does not have a standard cure. Instead, pancreatitis treatment is symptomatic and supportive, meaning that individual symptoms are dealt with and the cat's health is supported until the inflammation goes down. This generally involves around-the-clock care in a veterinary in-patient facility, and may also include medication. As such, the treatment of feline pancreatitis can cost thousands of dollars.Discuss the cost of treatment with your vet.
Be prepared to put down at least half of the anticipated cost prior to treatment.

, The best way for your cat's health to be supported as they heal from pancreatitis is to ensure that they stay hydrated and fed.Your vet may prescribe fluid therapy in order to keep your cat hydrated.
They may also insert a feeding tube to keep your cat fed.

, In addition to providing support, your vet will do whatever they can to treat acute symptoms. These symptoms will vary from cat to cat.Your vet my suggest any combination of the following:

Anti-nausea medication (to stop any vomiting).
Antibiotics (to treat infection).
Pain medication (to help with pain).
Corticosteriods (to reduce inflammation).

, Hopefully, after a day or two your cat will be well enough to go home. Once at home, it is imperative for you to continue monitoring their hydration for at least the first week.Provide clean water.
Make sure your cat is drinking every day.
Make sure your cat is urinating every day.
Follow any additional instructions from your vet.

, After your cat returns home, they will need to rest and heal. You may need to limit your cat’s activity level in order to accommodate this.Make food and water bowls easily accessible.
Make litter box(es) accessible.
Limit play.
Limit contact with other animals.

, It is important for cats to continue eating healthy food during recovery. Unlike dogs, cats do not need to avoid food, and they do not need to consume a low-fat diet. Canned food is your ideal choice, if your cat will eat it.Provide cat food that :

Is soft.
Is easily digestible.
Contains protein.
Contains fat.

, Your veterinarian will want to schedule one or more follow-up appointments in order to ensure that your cat is healing properly. Be sure that you attend these appointments in order to best ensure the health of your cat.The number of and time-frame for these appointments will vary from cat to cat.

, In some cats, the onset of pancreatitis results in chronic pancreatic inflammation. If you should notice the reemergence of any symptoms, take your cat to the vet right away.Once again, these symptoms may include:

Loss of appetite.
Severe lethargy.
Fever.
Weight loss.
Dehydration.
Depression.
Increased heart rate.
Difficulty breathing.

Consider breeding the praying mantises if you want to have several praying mantises over time.",How to Take Care of a Praying Mantis," The praying mantis is found in many parts of the world and some were introduced to the United States in the early nineteenth century and have since become naturalized. If you know you have them in your local area, consider collecting one from the wild. Praying mantises are usually about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in length and mostly brown or green, and they look much like sticks and leaves, making them blend in well with their environment.


Look in places where there are many green bushes, crickets, and butterflies. These are some of the mantises' favorite foods.
Look carefully. These little bugs are masters of disguise. Most are long and green. Some can be fat and gray, or even have a pinkish hue. Some look like flowers, but those are mostly found in Africa and Asia. Try to imagine how the praying mantis is likely to appear when it is pretending to be part of a plant and it'll be a bit easier to find one.;
, Get a small container to put your mantis in once you find it. It doesn't have to be very big - just a 6"" x 6"" square (15.2cm x 15.2cm) should do for most mantises. The container should be well ventilated and preferably made out of mesh, or chicken wire, to give the mantis and its prey something to cling onto. It should also have a secure top. Never use a container that had chemicals in it.

, More than likely, you won't need any gloves, unless you're squeamish about touching bugs. Simply place the opening of your container in front of the mantis. Coax the mantis into the container using a twig, or your hand if you are okay with that. Soon, he or she should willingly go into the container. Close the top, because mantises are smart, and they'll seize any opportunity to escape.

, If you can't find one or they aren't in your area, visit your local pet store and ask for advice as to whether they can get a particular praying mantis for you. This might give you wider options for different species, depending on the laws in your country as to importing insects and keeping them as pets.


If purchasing a praying mantis, they are usually sold as nymphs. Each nymph comes packed in small container., For the praying mantis to remain happy and healthy, she will need a good environment within your home. Choose a suitable structure to house your praying mantis, such as a vivarium. The structure should be large enough for a growing mantis if you've purchased a nymph and it needs to be kept warm, at around 24ºC (75ºF), and a few less degrees at night.Provide climbing items. The praying mantis needs to be able to clamber up on things such as twigs, branches, small dowel poles, etc.
Decorate with foliage, twigs, and other natural items that allow the praying mantis to climb and clamber around. Some people place a living plant or two into the display, as the mantis will enjoy being able to climb it.
Warmth can be provided by using a spot lamp or a heater pad. Speak to your pet supplies specialist to see what they have in stock.

, The food requirements of a praying mantis will vary depending on their growth stage. In general, they don't need a lot of food.


For a nymph purchased from the pet store: Feed with fruit flies, micro crickets, gnats, aphids, and other mini bugs.For a mantis that has grown and is molting or shedding, (the instar stages): Start to increase the insect size; then for each shedding period, feed normally but remove anything she ignores because she may not eat during molting.
For a fully grown praying mantis, get busy: Catch butterflies, crickets, grasshoppers or even house flies. In the wild praying mantises will consume anything they can catch and hold. They are also known to eat bees, wasps and even small birds in the wild. but you probably don't want to mess with them.
Buying crickets from the pet store is not necessary, although some people will tell you that using wild crickets could make your pet sick. This may or may not be true for store-raised mantises, but for wild-caught ones, some harm should come to them. As for store-bought crickets or some pet stores over feed their crickets, some caution should be exercised. Many pet stores do not feed or properly care for crickets, and any diseases those crickets have as a result can be passed on to your mantis. If you're not sure, spend a few days feeding store-bought or wild-caught crickets high nutrition diets to help manage the bacteria in their gut, and they should be fine.
Don't give the mantis live food that is bigger than it or your mantis might be the one that gets eaten.
Praying Mantises will not eat dead insects.

, Get a spray bottle and spray on its cage (if it's wire). If it's not wire, put it in a water bottle lid and let them drink out of that. Remember they like hanging from stuff, so give them a stick to go on or something else while drinking.

, Mantises aren't the tidiest of diners and they'll leave behind all manner of debris including legs, wings, chewy or hard bits they didn't like, etc., and you need to remove these daily. When this debris piles up, the praying mantis will stress out and won't cope well in her artificial environment.


When cleaning out the leftovers from her meals, also remove your praying mantis' fecal matter (pellet shaped).

, Praying mantises have voracious appetites for insects, including one another. They're top predators in the insect kingdom and will stalk or wait until their chance comes, so don't give them the chance to also be a cannibal.Have separate housing for each praying mantis you intend to keep.

, Your praying mantis is delicate no matter how strong she appears. Avoid picking her up as there are several risks involved; she might be crushed by an over-enthusiastic grip, or she might defend herself against your attempt by stabbing you with her forearms.It will probably surprise you more than hurt you but it will definitely stress her and put on the defensive. The answer is to allow her to climb onto your outstretched palm, finger, or top of your hand, at her leisure. Be patient!


When you clean their cage don't be afraid to pick them up, but if you prefer, you can use gloves.

,(Where the limbs connect to the body)


Praying mantises have wings once they're adults, meaning that they can fly. If you want to hold her, close all windows and doors before removing her from her home.
When molting, leave your praying mantis alone and don't touch her.She'll shed her old exoskeleton and gain a new one. Once the new one is in place, you can handle her again.

, Wash your hands after handling your praying mantis, its cages, or cage accessories.

, A praying mantis has a short lifespan, of around six months from nymph to adulthood, and another six months as an adult.With good care, this can be extended up to a year and a half in the easy home life you're providing. Identify the gender of your praying mantis first - the female has six segments on her underside while the male has eight. If a female is mated, she can produce several egg cases (ootheca), and it may eat the male (and be aware that un-mated females will probably still lay eggs, they just won't hatch).


Be prepared for nursery duty if you catch or mate a female mantis. She will grow a big belly, and lose the ability to fly. When your mantis lays eggs, it should be in the early fall, or late spring. Don't worry. You will have plenty of time to prepare for your eggs to hatch next spring.
The egg case will have a ridge along the center of it. It's not to everyone's liking to look at but shelve your squeamishness!
Come springtime, the eggs should soon hatch, and the nymphs should emerge through tiny holes in the egg case. A word of caution – they can, and will often eat each other if they are not separated, and when they reach molting stages, many mantises will stop eating for a day or two, so it's easier to squeeze out of that old shell.
Feed as outlined above.
Those you don't plan on keeping can be set free in your garden.

Buy a potted plant.Since mantises might cannibalize each other, purchase a plant for each one that you intend to keep.,
Situate your plant.,
Feed your mantis.,
Maintain the right environment.",How to Keep a Pet Praying Mantis Without a Cage1," Pick a tall plant so they have plenty of room to climb. Stick to a small pot, however, so they can find their food at the base more easily.Choose a plant with plentiful wide leaves so the mantis has adequate shade to escape the sun.Since your mantis won’t be enclosed, be sure to select a breed that doesn’t develop wings so it doesn’t fly away and escape!If the pot is circular, the diameter of the surface area should be at least three times wider than the mantis’s body length. If the pot is box-shaped, it should be twice as wide as the mantis’s body length and three times as long.;
, Place it on a windowsill so the plant receives direct sunlight and remains healthy.If your windowsill is too narrow, place your plant where sunlight can reach it. Be sure to keep it out of reach of other pets, since dogs or cats may eat your mantis., Collect or purchase other insects with soft bodies to use as pet food. Be sure to use live prey that is only a quarter of the size of the mantis itself.If possible, feed them insects that don’t fly so they don’t escape.


When using a caged enclosure to house your mantis, it’s recommended to keep a continuous supply of food. But since you’re not using a cage, be vigilant with feeding to make sure the mantis is eating regularly.
Keep the soil free of fallen leaves or other obstructions where prey can hide.
Try using tweezers to offer food.This way you can gauge how hungry your mantis is as well as use prey that is able to fly or otherwise escape.
Fruit flies are a popular food for smaller mantises, and crickets for larger ones., Keep the room temperature warm. Mist the leaves and soil regularly to maintain proper humidity. Since you’re keeping your mantis in the open instead of an enclosure, keep a sharp eye on the soil to make sure it doesn’t dry out.If prolonged sunlight dries your plant quickly on a regular basis, rotate the plant between direct sunlight (for the plant’s health) to other areas in the room where the sun doesn’t reach (to maintain moisture).
Between regular misting and the moisture received from eating prey, the mantis shouldn’t need another water source. However, for your own peace of mind if this is a concern, go ahead and give it a small water bowl."

Verify there are no other reasons your cat’s fur may appear greasy, like if another caretaker has applied medicine, or the cat is excessively dirty.;
, While all cats can develop Stud Tail, certain populations are much more prone to it. As a result, when you are trying to determine if a cat is afflicted by Stud Tail, you need to seriously consider the age and gender of the cat.

Young, unneutered cats are most susceptible to Stud Tail.
Neutered cats can sometimes develop Stud Tail.
Spayed and intact female cats can, in rare cases, develop Stud Tail., The accumulation of skin oil may result in noticeable hair changes on the affected area. As a result, try to examine your cat’s hair to see if there is any change. Some symptoms might include:

A yellowing of fur on cats that have light-colored fur.
Hair loss on the tail or near the top back of the cat’s torso., The most obvious sign of Stud Tail is changes in the skin of the cat around the tail or near the top back of the cat’s torso. Ultimately, these skin changes are a result of the accumulation of skin oil. They may irritate the cat and cause it to scratch itself around the affected area. Look for:

Reddish bumps around the tail or on it.
Red skin that appears raw or swollen.
Blackheads or other pimple-like growths around or on the tail.
The appearance of pus on or around the tail. This may only occur in the case of an infection., When you bring your cat to the veterinarian, they’ll ask you a variety of questions about your cat’s behavior, symptoms, and more. Make sure to answer these questions in detail.

Be specific. For example, let them know the first date you noticed skin problems on your cat and how quickly the problems progressed. Say, “I noticed what appeared to be some dry skin on Yoda’s tail last month, but early this month Yoda had lost hair and had some larger pimples or growths.”
Don’t hold anything back. While you may think that your cat licking their back or tail a lot over the course of the last month is unimportant, your vet might think it is important., After asking you questions, your vet will physically examine your cat. By observing the affected area, they’ll be better able to arrive at a proper diagnosis.

Your veterinarian may touch the area affected by the Stud Tail to see if it is sensitive.
The veterinarian will look to see if the skin is infected., Once your vet has concluded that the problem is Stud Tail, they may need to take a bacteria culture to determine if your cat has an infection. If so, they’ll be better able to prescribe antibiotics to target the bacteria.

Your vet will collect a skin sample or a sample of pus from the affected area.
They will introduce it to a sterile environment and allow it to grow.
Your vet will examine and identify the sample to determine if there is bacteria present and what kind of bacteria it is. This will allow them to prescribe the most effective antibiotic., After successfully diagnosing a case of Stud Tail, you will need to clean the area. By cleaning the area, you’ll make it easier for the cat’s skin to heal.

Use a vet-prescribed disinfectant or soap to clean the area the first time.
Try to remove dirt, dead skin cells, detached hair, and other debris.

, Your vet will probably recommend that you wash the affected area regularly. This will remove debris, lessen the chance of infection and, depending on the product, moisturize the area.

Your vet may recommend or prescribe an antibacterial wash, like chlorhexidine. Your veterinarian may recommend using it two to three times daily., In cases of severe infection, your veterinarian may prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics. This is important, as a bad infection could spread from the tail or back of the cat.

Follow your veterinarian’s directions carefully.
Don’t skip any doses, if possible.
Some antibiotics your vet may prescribe include amoxicillin, tetracycline and ampicillin., In addition to cleaning and washing the affected area, you may also need to apply topical medications. These medications are designed to help fight infection and promote healing of the skin. Some medications might include:

Mupirocin
Retinoids, Once you’ve started to see progress in the healing of your cat’s Stud Tail, you should take some steps to prevent future outbreaks. Ultimately, this is fairly easy to do and may be accomplished by washing your cat on a regular basis.

You may prevent future outbreaks by doing light washes of your cat’s tail or hind area. By focusing on the afflicted area, you’ll save your cat the dissatisfaction of a full bath.
You may be able to discontinue regular washes after your cat has aged. Consult your vet about this possibility.
Some cats may benefit from anti-seborrheal shampoo."

Grasp the butterfly.,
Place the butterfly in the refrigerator.,
Get your supplies ready.,
Cut to make wings even.,
Immobilize the butterfly for more severe damage.,
Prepare a splint for a bent wing.,
Replace a significantly damaged wing.",How to Care for a Butterfly with a Broken Wing1," Before touching the butterfly, make sure your hands are clean and dry. With the wings closed, grab the butterfly by the wings just above the body. You don't need to hold it very hard, just tight enough to keep it from wriggling free.Contrary to popular belief, you won't harm the butterfly simply by touching it. A butterfly can lose some scales and still fly just fine.
Holding it upside down can calm it down.;
, While this step may seem cruel, it can calm the butterfly enough so that you can work on it. You're not trying to kill the butterfly. You're just trying to sedate it a bit.Stick it in a smooth container. A glass works well for this step. You may need to partially cover it if the butterfly is still able to flutter. However, make sure to leave room for air flow.
Don't leave the butterfly in the refrigerator for longer than 10 minutes, as it could eventually kill the butterfly.

, You'll need a towel, as well as a wire clothing hanger. You'll also need tape or contact adhesive (found at auto part stores), scissors, and maybe tweezers. Toothpicks, cotton swabs, baby powder, and lightweight card stock (the kind that is different colors on each side is best) can also be helpful.You may also need extra butterfly wings if the butterfly is missing much of its wing. You can find broken pieces in places where butterflies congregate, or you can use a wing from a dead butterfly.


The contact adhesive is the type that you paint on both surfaces. You then give it a chance to dry before pushing it together.
Bend the hook on the wire clothing hanger. It should form a loop that will just fit over the butterfly's main body (not the wings)., One way to do a minor repair is to simply cut the butterfly's wings to make them even. They need to be even for the butterfly to fly, so cutting them to be even can work if one wing only has minor damage. Grasp the butterfly just above the body with the wings closed. Cut the undamaged wing to match the damaged wing.Only use this method if less than 1/3 of the wing is missing.The butterfly is not hurt when you cut the wing. It's like getting a haircut.
This option is also a good one if you're not willing to repair the wing with glue or splints. In other words, taking off damaged wings, even both of them, can help the butterfly more than just leaving it with damaged wings. It may not be able to fly, but it may still be able to lay eggs.

, Lay out a towel on a table. Place the butterfly flat on the table with its legs facing down. Place the loop of the clothes hanger over the butterfly. It should go around the body, but press down lightly on the wings. You can even lightly weigh down the other end of the hanger to hold it in place.Keep the lighting dim, as that can help calm the butterfly.
You can also use tweezers to press down around the butterfly's body, holding it down. However, that only gives you one hand to work with.Extend the wings by grasping one edge and pulling out gently.

, Cut a tiny piece of card stock. It only needs to be a few millimeters wide. For length, it needs to be long enough to go across the break in the wing (once you line it up), but that's it. In other words, you need a very small piece of card stock.Use a toothpick to add glue to one side of the card stock. Also, paint a small line of contact adhesive across the bend in the wing. Take off any extra adhesive. Let both sets of glue dry. Note that contact adhesive is not just regular glue. It is a special type of adhesive that sticks to itself when dry.
Line up the wing perfectly. Press the card stock, glue-side down, across the crack. It's easiest to use tweezers for this step. After a moment, release the butterfly. Gently lift the butterfly's wing from the towel if the glue stuck it down. Also, sprinkle a light dusting of baby powder over the glued area so it doesn't stick to the other wing as the final step of this repair. You can use a cotton swab to help spread the powder out.
Another option for a torn wing is simply a piece of scotch or duct tape. Once you immobilize the butterfly, use a small piece of tape across the bend or tear. However, this method won't provide as much structure as the small splint., If the wing is missing a significant part or is badly damaged, you can either reattach the missing part or put on a new wing. Start by cutting off the wing if it is badly damaged, leaving some at the bottom as a place to attach a new wing. Make sure the butterfly is laid out on the towel for this whole step.Line up the wing. Whether you are adding a new wing or using a part of the wing that has fallen off, it's important to line it up as close as you can to the old veins. If you are adding a new wing, try to pick one as close in size to the other wing as possible. Trim it so only a small bit overlaps.
Add glue. Use a toothpick to apply contact adhesive to both edges off the wing, the parts that will slightly overlap and stick together. Take off any extra adhesive, and let it dry. While it dries, make sure to keep the butterfly immobilized, as you don't want it to glue its wings together.
Once the glue dries, press the two edges of the wing together. You can add a small strip of card stock with the same gluing technique to help bridge the gap. Once you've glued everything in place, sprinkle baby powder over the glued area to keep it from sticking to the other wing.
Check for any mistakes before releasing the butterfly. For instance, make sure the other wing doesn't stick to the glue. Also, make sure all parts are moving.

Purchase an egg case.,
Wait for warm weather.,
Plant your egg case.,
Wait for the egg case to hatch.",How to Keep a Pet Praying Mantis Without a Cage2," Research which breed of praying mantis you wish to introduce to your garden. Then order one or more egg cases from a garden-supply retailer. Expect each egg case to produce anywhere from 50 to 200 insects. Depending on the size of your yard or garden, buy as many egg cases as needed to populate the area.One egg case should produce enough mantises to cover 1666 square feet.Plant at least a couple of egg cases in your garden, on the off-chance that one of them is infertile.Once the babies, or “nymphs,” emerge, they will scatter from the case within a couple hours. Since they’re camouflaged (and since the case will appear the same as before), it will be hard to tell when and if this has happened., Since frost and cold will kill mantises,delay hatching your egg case until the weather turns consistently warm with the approach of summer. Place the egg case in a container that allows air circulation and refrigerate it until spring. Then take it out at least a month or two before you’d like it to hatch.While cold weather kills mantises, egg cases are laid in the wild before winter,so refrigerating them is fine.

, Gently tie the egg case to a loose twig with zip-ties, wire, or twine. Handle the egg case delicately to avoid damaging it. Then find a suitable place in your garden to secure the twig and attached case. Look for an area that’s a couple feet above the ground with enough cover to hide the case from predators.Using the twig as an attachment point, secure the case to low branches or fences.Before attaching the egg case to the loose twig, locate the slits from which the babies, or “nymphs,” will emerge. Attach the case to the twig with the slits facing outward.Use zip-ties, twine, or wire. Sticky substances like glue or tape may trap the nymphs once they emerge., Expect the nymphs to emerge after three to ten weeks of consistent warm weather.Since mantises thrive on humidity, gently water the immediate area in the meantime, especially in dry weather. Lightly mist the ground and leaf-cover on a regular basis.


As long as other insect-life remains plentiful in your garden, your mantises should have an abundant food source to survive on their own. Each generation has a one-year life cycle and will die off with the approach of cold weather. However, females will lay new egg cases in the fall, so your garden should be repopulated by next spring or summer."

Find out which breed of mantis you’d like to keep as an indoor pet and/or introduce to your yard. Expect anywhere from 50 to 200 babies, or “nymphs,” to hatch from a single egg., Since mantises will not survive winter weather,wait for spring or summer to hatch them, once the weather has turned consistently warm. If you buy your egg case early, refrigerate it in a container that allows air to circulate. Then take it out four to eight weeks before you’d like it to hatch., Inspect the bag beforehand. Make sure there aren’t any holes or tears. Then place the case inside, fold the bag, and use a paper clip to seal it. Keep it near a window where it will receive direct sunlight.Do not use a ziplock bag or any other airtight seal, since the baby nymphs will need air.

, Expect the nymphs to emerge after three to ten weeks of consistent warm weather.Check inside the bag on a daily basis throughout this time. Once you see tiny nymphs crawling around inside, remove however many you wish to keep as indoor pets and release the rest outside.Check the bag regularly, since mantises will likely eat each other if left too long on their own.Nymphs are very small and delicate, so be careful how you handle them.Use a plastic spoon to transfer them from the bag to a potted plant. Insert the spoon into the bag and wait for them to climb on, then set the spoon on top of the plant’s soil.

Research your particular butterfly.,
Provide a food source.,
Create ""nectar."",
Release the butterfly.",How to Care for a Butterfly with a Broken Wing2," Different butterflies have different needs. Some butterflies do not eat at all as adults. These butterflies only eat as caterpillars. However, most do eat some type of food, usually nectar that you can substitute a sugary solution for.Try using a butterfly book or an online database of butterflies to find your butterfly, which will have more information about what the butterfly eats.
In addition, if you find the specific butterfly you have in captivity, you can learn what kind of flowers they usually visit. That way, you can provide them with those flowers instead of a sugar solution.
Monarchs, for instance, often visit milkweed flowers, among others.

, Since your butterfly had a damaged wing, it hasn't been able to get to food very well. Therefore, it may be pretty weak once you finish. Providing a food source gives the butterfly the energy it needs to move onward.One solution is to find flowers that your butterfly normally eats. Use your research to find wildflowers in your area for your butterfly.
Set them near your butterfly, then set the butterfly on the flower so it can drink the nectar.

, You can create a nectar substitute for your butterfly with things you have in your pantry. This solution will be enough to get the butterfly going again, letting it find it's own food source.In a small cup, add about half a cup of room temperature water. Add a tablespoon of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. If it doesn't dissolve, you can heat up the water to help it dissolve. Just make sure it cools before you give it to your butterfly.Add paper towel wicks. Roll up a 5-inch-by-7-inch piece of paper towel. Put one end in the water, and drape the other end over the edge of a the cup. This wick will bring the solution up to the edge of the cup, making it easier for your butter fly to drink.
Set your butterfly on the edge of the cup at the wick so it can drink.
Some butterflies, especially male butterflies, can eat fresh fruit such as peaches, plums, cherries, or oranges. Break the fruit open so that the butterfly can get to the flesh., Hold out your hand so the butterfly crawls onto your finger. If it won't crawl up, grasp it with the wings closed just above the body. You can let the butterfly loose as soon as it has regained its strength with some sugar water or nectar. You don't need to wait for it to ""heal.""Let the butterfly sit on your finger for a minute. Take it outside.
Let it sit on your finger until it is ready to fly away. The butterfly will gather warmth from your body before moving on, which is important if you chilled it. It needs to be at least 55 degrees Fahrenheit outside for the butterfly to survive.

However, some species - such as the woolly bear caterpillar - emerge in autumn. Winter is the only time of year when caterpillars cannot be found.


In the wild, caterpillar typically have a 2% survival rate, which means that for every 100 eggs a female butterfly or moth lays, only two will survive to maturity. This is due to the large number of predators who list caterpillars as a food source. Therefore, by keeping the caterpillar as a pet, you are giving it a much greater chance of survival.
Be aware that autumn caterpillars will most likely pupate for the entire winter, so you'll have to wait a lot longer for the moth or butterfly to emerge than with spring or summer butterflies, which typically emerge within 2 to 3 weeks.;
, The best place to search for caterpillars is on their host plants, as caterpillars will typically stay close to their food source. If you are not picky about the type of caterpillar you want to care for, you can check the leaves of any plant in your garden or at the park. However, if you are looking for specific caterpillars/butterflies/moths, you will need to target specific plants. Some of the most common ones are as follows:


The caterpillars of Monarch butterflies are most commonly found on the Milkweed plant.
The caterpillars of Spicebush Swallowtails are most commonly found on the Spicebush.
The caterpillars of Zebra Swallowtails are most commonly found on the leaves of the Paw Paw tree.
The caterpillars of Black Swallowtails are most commonly found on herbs such as parsley, dill and fennel.
The caterpillars of Luna Moths are most commonly found on the leaves of Walnut and Sweet Gum trees.
The caterpillars of Cecropia Moths, Viceroy butterflies and Red-Spotted Purple butterflies are most commonly found on the leaves of Cherry Trees., If there's a very specific type of caterpillar, butterfly or moth you want to care for, or if you're having difficulty finding a caterpillar outside, there is always the option to order caterpillars from special supplier, or buy butterfly kits online.


You can purchase caterpillars or order them in their larvae state, before they have even hatched. If you're just interested in the butterflies or moths, you can order pupae - then all you need to do is wait for them to emerge.
Some of the most commonly available caterpillars are Monarchs, which are available to order at www.MonarchWatch.org, and Painted Lady caterpillars. The Painted Lady caterpillars are particularly easy to keep, as they are delivered with a growth medium which sustains them until they pupate, eliminating the need to find their host plant., Once you find a caterpillar, it is very important that you handle it using the correct method. If you try to pick up a caterpillar, it can cling to the surface it's standing on with remarkable strength and if you continue to pull you may injure it, or even pull off its legs.


The best way to pick up and transport a caterpillar is to take a sheet of paper or a leaf and place it in front of the caterpillar. Then give the caterpillar a little nudge on the behind. The caterpillar will then walk forwards onto the leaf or paper, in order to avoid your touch. You can then carry the caterpillar around on its temporary perch.
Just make sure not to drop the caterpillars - dropping them from a height of even a few inches can kill them.
If you need to handle the caterpillar, it is best to wash your hands first. Caterpillars are very fragile and can pick up bacterial infections from human skin.
Some caterpillars have prickly hairs or spikes which can irritate or even sting your skin. Therefore, it's best to avoid touching these types of caterpillars with your bare hands., Caterpillars don't need to be housed in anything too fancy - a clean one-gallon jar or a small fish tank is perfect. These will be easy to clean and will allow you to see your caterpillar easily.


Cover the container with a piece of cheesecloth or mesh and secure with a rubber band. This will allow proper ventilation. Don't just poke holes in a screw-on lid (as some sites advise) as the caterpillars may attempt to escape through these holes and injure themselves on the sharp edges.
If you're housing more than one caterpillar, just make sure that each caterpillar has around three times it's body size in extra space to move around in. This will prevent overcrowding.

, It's a good idea to line the bottom of your caterpillar's home with some paper towel or tissue paper. This will soak up any excess moisture and catch any caterpillar droppings (known as frass). You can then easily clean the container by whipping out the dirty paper and replacing it with fresh stuff.


However, you should only line your caterpillar container with paper towel if you know that you have a species of caterpillar which pupates above ground.
If you have a species of caterpillar which pupates underground (or if you're not sure what species it is) you should line the bottom of the container with a two-inch layer of soil or sand. This way, the caterpillar has something to bury into.
The soil or sand should be slightly damp - but not damp enough that it causes condensation on the sides of the container. Caterpillars are quite sensitive to humidity., It's a good idea to place a couple of sticks inside the caterpillars home, for a number of reasons:


Firstly, the caterpillar will have something to climb on, which it may need to do in order to reach it's food.
Secondly, the caterpillar may choose to pupate hanging from the stick. As a result, you should make sure that the stick is in a secure position and not in danger of falling over.
Thirdly, once the butterfly or moth emerges from the pupa it will need somewhere to hang upside down in order to spread and dry its wings.

, Most caterpillars prefer a slightly humid environment. The best way to achieve this is to mist the container with a spray bottle of water every so often.


However, you will need to be careful not to make the container damp either, as too much moisture can encourage the growth of mold inside the container and on the caterpillar itself., A caterpillar's job is just to eat and eat and eat, so the most important part of caring for a caterpillar is to provide a constant supply of fresh food.


The first thing to do is provide the caterpillar with some leaves from the plant or tree on which you found it, as there is a good chance that this is its host plant.
Observe the caterpillar closely to see if eats the leaves you have provided. If it does - congratulations - you have found your caterpillar's host plant! Now all you need to do provide your caterpillar with a fresh supply of these leaves until it pupates.

, Caterpillars are very picky eaters and each species has a limited number of plants it is willing to eat. In fact, most caterpillars will starve to death before they eat the wrong food. So if the caterpillar refuses the leaves from the plant you found it on, or you found the caterpillar somewhere other than on a plant, you will need to discover the correct food source through a process of trial and error.


The best thing to do in this situation is to gather a selection of different types of leaves from the place where you found the caterpillar and put them in its container. Then observe the caterpillar closely to see if it eats any of them. If it does, you can remove the other types of leaves and simply continue to provide the winning leaf.
If you're having trouble finding a plant that the caterpillar will eat, it might be a good idea to consult a field guide such as Peterson First Guide to Caterpillars, or Caterpillars of Eastern Forests. These guides will match up caterpillar species with their favored food source, saving you a lot of time.If you can't get your hands on these field guides, try some of the most common caterpillar food sources, as follows: cherry, oak, willow, alder, poplar, apple and birch. Also try providing the flowers as well as the leaves, as some caterpillars prefer this part of the plant.If you simply cannot find the type of plant your caterpillar likes to eat, it may be best to release it in the same place where you found it. At least then it will have some chance of finding its own food source, otherwise it will probably starve.

, Caterpillars will not eat old or dried out leaves, so it's very important that you provide them with a constant supply of fresh, green leaves. How often you need to provide new leaves will depend on the plant species - some will last up to a week, while others will need to be replaced everyday.


A good way to prolong the life of the food supply is to place it in a glass jar of water inside the caterpillar's home.The water will keep the leaves fresh and green for longer.
However, sometimes caterpillars can fall off the leaves into the glass jar and drown. To prevent this, stuff around the stems of the leaves with cotton wool or paper towel. This will keep your caterpillar safe.Alternatively, you can buy floral tubes very cheaply from a florist to place the leaves in. These have very narrow brims, decreasing the chance that your caterpillar will fall in.
When you provide your caterpillar with new leaves, make sure to remove the old, dried out ones. Also make sure to keep the rest of the container clean, removing any caterpillar droppings or other debris.
One more thing to be aware of is the possibility that spiders or other predators may be hiding amongst the leaves. If they are, they might eat your caterpillar once the leaves are placed in the container, which is the last thing you want! Therefore, you should make sure to examine all leaves and branches closely before placing them in the container., Caterpillars don't need to drink - they get all the hydration they need from their food.


However, if your caterpillar does happen to look a little dried out, or you want to raise the moisture levels in the container, try rinsing the leaves in water and placing them in the container without drying them.
The droplets of water that remain on the leaves will provide any necessary moisture.

, Don't worry too much if your caterpillar suddenly stops eating, becomes sluggish or starts to change color - it is probably just preparing to molt or pupate, so this is completely normal behavior.


The caterpillar may also become more active then usual, moving around its container continuously. If this is the case, it is probably just looking for a good place to pupate.
Unfortunately, these behaviors may also be signs that the caterpillar is sick, so you should refrain from handling it at this time. Just wait to see if it successfully pupates.
If you are keeping multiple caterpillars and one of them dies, remove the dead caterpillar from the container immediately. This will prevent any disease from spreading., Once the caterpillar is ready it will pupate, thus beginning the process of turning into a moth or butterfly. Moth caterpillars will bury into the earth to make a cocoon, while butterfly caterpillars with enclose themselves in a chrysalis, hanging above ground.


While the underground cocoons do not need any attention, you may need to move or re-hang the chrysalis if it is in an unsuitable location or of it falls from its original hanging spot.
If you believe the chrysalis is in too tight a spot for the emerging butterfly to spread its wings, it may be best to move it. Handle the chrysalis very gently and hang it from a stick or attach it to the side of the container.
You can do this by threading a piece of string through the pointy end of the chrysalis, or by sticking a small pin through it and hanging it from a suitable location. , Once the pupa has formed, you should clean out the caterpillar container, removing any old food or waste. Even though the pupa is still alive, it does not require any food or water.


Leave any sticks in the container when cleaning out. These will be necessary once the butterfly or moth emerges, as it will use the stick as a perch while it spreads its wings. If the butterfly or moth has nothing to perch on, its wings will not form properly and it will die.Also try to keep the container humid by checking it every few days. If the the container is too dry the pupa will dry out, but if it is too moist the pupa can go moldy. Both of these things can prevent the butterfly/moth from emerging.
If the soil at the bottom of the container feels very dry, mist it with some water. If you see any condensation forming on the sides of the container, wipe it off.
Consult a caterpillar/butterfly guide to find exact instructions regarding the optimum temperature and humidity for your species of pupa.

, Now all that's left to do is wait! Some butterflies and moths will emerge after as little as eight days, while others may take several months or even years.


If you caught your caterpillar in the fall, chance are it will spend the winter months in its pupa and only emerge in the spring - this process is known as ""overwintering"".
Some telltale signs that a butterfly is getting ready to emerge from its chrysalis are the chrysalis turning darker in color, or even becoming clear.
Keep a close eye on the chrysalis from this point on, as butterflies can emerge from their pupa in a matter of seconds and you don't want to miss it!
As moth cocoons are underground, you will not be able to observe any changes.
If the chrysalis turns a very dark color, this may be an indication that the pupa is dead. Test it by gently bending the pupa around the abdominal region - if it stays bent this is a good indication that the pupa is dead., Once the butterfly or moth has magically emerged from its pupa, it will crawl up a stick and hang upside down until its wings dry out and unfold. This is a very important process and can take several hours.


When the butterfly or moth begins to flutter its wings and starts flapping around the cage, it's time to release it. These creatures do not like to be confined and they can damage their wings if they are continually beating them against the sides of the container, trying to escape.Take the container outside, to the location where you originally found the caterpillar, open the lid and let your butterfly happily fly away.

Look for black swallowtail caterpillars.,
Catch a caterpillar.,
Prepare a home.,
Keep your little guy fed.,
Watch for signs of cocoon readiness.,
Observe his progress and wait for him to emerge.,
Be careful in letting him go.",How to Care for a Black Swallowtail Caterpillar," They have distinctive black, yellow, and green striping and can be found around plants such as parsley, fennel, dill, and Queen Anne's lace. Plant a small herb garden in your yard, and start checking it in late summer! The caterpillars can be found on any part of the plant, including the stems.


It's easy to tell the sexes apart! Males will have yellow spots/stripes, while females will have blue. Both equally beautiful!;
, Try to catch your little guy by snipping off whatever section of the plant he's sitting on, rather than trying to pull him off with your fingers. Not only do these guys have great grip, and can be very difficult to pull off, but they emit a smelly odor as a defense mechanism when they're handled!

, Any glass jar or small plastic container will work fine for your temporary pet! Try to pick something that has enough height for a few small twigs and sticks, which will later be used by the caterpillars to hang their chrysalis/cocoon.


There's no need for substrate on the bottom of the container; if you want some because it looks nice, that's totally up to you.

, All he will need is a fresh, daily supply of his food plant (whatever plant you found him on). A small handful each day is plenty. You do not need to give him any water or mist his environment, but if you feel better giving it a spritz every few days, it certainly won't hurt him. Your growing, hungry caterpillar will happily eat... and poop. A lot. Make sure you dump the poop out each day to avoid a smelly mess.

, You'll know your little buddy is getting ready to build his cocoon when he becomes rather still for a day or two, and then one day you'll notice he's in a rather weird position on one of his twigs, sort of like a candy cane, or an upside down ""J"". Leave him alone at this point and stop feeding.


Keep an eye on him, though, because you'll get to witness the fascinating progress of his cocoon-making! At first just a few silky strands to anchor him to his stick or twig, but in a few days, he'll suddenly look very different, like a little brown leaf, all closed up.

, It generally takes a few weeks for him to emerge as a butterfly. Leave him alone for several hours at least, so that his wings can fully inflate and strengthen for flight. Touching or disturbing him too soon can be a death sentence. Once his wings are wide open, rigid, and you can see him slowly flapping them open and closed, he's ready to emerge!

, Don't just dump him out of the container, just in case he's not quite ready to fly. Many times, you can gently ease him onto your hand (but be very careful to not touch his wings!) and enjoy the thrill of holding one of the most beautiful butterflies in the world for a few moments! When he's ready, he'll take off on his own. If you can't hold him until then, gently guide him onto a bush or shrub where he can rest until he's ready to go.


Some people choose to keep the butterflies as pets as well, but since their life cycle is so brief after hatching (2-4 weeks), it's recommended to let them experience the natural freedom they were meant to have.

Plant a butterfly garden for long-term butterfly care.",How to Take Care of Butterflies," If this is your first time raising caterpillars, you might want to start with a caterpillar kit. You can order a kit online and choose from a variety of butterfly species. The kit will come with everything you need to raise the caterpillars into butterflies. If you prefer, you can instead find caterpillars in your neighborhood and provide what they need to become healthy butterflies. It's a little trickier since you'll need to find fresh food for them every day, but you'll learn a lot about a species native to your area.


If you want to buy a butterfly kit, consider getting a species that will be able to survive in your region after you release it. Do a little research to find out which butterfly populations in your area could use a boost.If you want to find your own caterpillars, go outside and look around. Look for the following host plants to find different caterpillar species:Caterpillar/Butterfly Species
Host Plant


Monarch
Milkweed


Spicebush Swallowtail
Spicebush


Zebra Swallowtail
Paw-paw


Black Swallowtail
Dill, fennel and parsley


;
, This will keep the caterpillars from crawling away and getting free while also giving them a safe, well-ventilated environment. You can fasten the cheesecloth over the mouth of the jar with a rubber band to keep it in place. If you ordered a butterfly kit, it would come with a jar and ventilated lid for you to use.


Put no more than 2 to 3 caterpillars together in a jar. If they all become butterflies, they'll need plenty of space when they emerge from their chrysalises.
The caterpillar's jar will need to be cleaned every day since caterpillars produce a lot of waste. If you just leave the waste in the jar, mold can grow, which is unhealthy for the caterpillars. Line the jar with paper towels that you can switch out for easy cleanup.
Place long sticks in the jar so that the caterpillars have a place to climb. When you change out the paper towels, be very careful not to damage the caterpillars. Wait until they're climbing on the sticks, then gently lift them out as you switch out the paper. It might be helpful to have a second jar lined with paper. so you can simply switch them back and forth.

, This won't be necessary if you're using a kit, which comes with processed caterpillar food, but caterpillars you find in the wild will need fresh leaves every day. They're picky eaters and will only consume leaves from their source plants. Remember which type of plant you found your caterpillars on and feed them fresh leaves accordingly.


Caterpillars won't eat old or dried-out leaves, so it's important to make sure that what you feed them is fresh. You might want to grow the host plant in a pot, so you always have some available.
Caterpillars get the water they need from leaves, so there's no need to add water to the jar.
If you aren't sure what type of caterpillar you have, consult a field guide to try to find out. If you can't figure it out, you should release the caterpillar, since it will die if you try to feed it the wrong food., A chrysalis is a caterpillar that has entered the pupae stage, the stage during which it goes through a transition and turns into a butterfly. The chrysalides will usually be attached to a stick since the butterfly needs to be able to hang when it emerges. During this stage, your job is to keep the environment in the jar nice and moist so that the chrysalis won't dry out. Use a spray bottle to spritz inside the jar from time to time.


The pupae stage lasts for several months, and during this time you won't see much activity, but rest assured that the pupa is alive and will eventually emerge. If you captured the caterpillar in the fall, it should emerge in time for spring.

, If the chrysalides are not attached to a stick, or not hanging in a spot where the butterflies will be able to stretch out, you'll need to move them to a better spot. If the butterflies emerge too close to the bottom of the jar, or in a cramped spot where they can't hang and stretch their wings, their wings won't properly form, and they won't be able to fly.


If a chrysalis is on a stick that's too close to the bottom of the jar; you can simply move the stick, so it's positioned in a better way. You could also tape the bottom of the stick to another stick to make it longer if you need to. The chrysalis should be positioned near the top of the jar, hanging from the underside of the stick.
If the chrysalis is resting on the bottom of the jar; you need to attach it to a stick. Use a dab of slightly cooled hot glue to glue one edge of the chrysalis to the underside of a stick, then position the stick in a good spot.

, After several months, the chrysalides will begin to turn dark or clear, indicating it's time for the baby butterflies to come out. It only takes a few seconds for them to come out and begin stretching their wings. They'll hang from the underside of the stick and slowly move their wings, giving them time to harden. Again, if they don't have space for this essential process, their wings will never fully form, and they won't be able to fly.When it looks like the butterflies are going to emerge soon, make especially sure that the environment inside the jar is nice and humid.
If a butterfly falls to the bottom of the jar, don't fret! It should be able to climb the stick and find a good spot to hang.

, When they start fluttering around the jar, it's time! Take the jar outside and place it near their host plant. Open the jar and let the butterflies go free. Enjoy the fact that you contributed to your local ecosystem by helping the butterfly population thrive.


Butterflies have the best chance of survival if you set them free, rather than trying to keep them indoors. If it's cold outside or you simply want to observe them for a few days, you can keep them inside for a bit. Put them in a huge jar with several sticks, and feed them the sugar solution detailed in the next step.

, If you want to feed the butterflies, either because it's too cold to release them or you'd like to watch them eat, you can set out a small sponge soaked with a solution of one part sugar to four parts water. Butterflies will land in the sugar water and taste it with their feet.Don't put a dish or puddle of sugar water out, since butterflies can get covered with it and end up sticky, making it difficult or impossible for them to fly.
You can also feed them sports drink or juice instead of sugar water.

, If you see a butterfly that seems to be moving slowly or stumbling around or one with a torn wing, there are measures you can take to rescue it! Always remember to handle the butterfly gently if you try one of these first aid treatments:



For a butterfly that seems weak or hungry, you can rescue it by helping it eat. Mix up some sugar water and set out a sponge soaked in it. Gently take the butterfly's wings between your thumb and forefinger, using utmost care not to pinch too hard. Set the butterfly on the sponge. Butterflies feed through a curved tube. If it doesn't unfurl, you can help it along by gently extending it toward the food using a toothpick. Once the butterfly feels restored, it will fly away.For a butterfly with a torn wing, you can tape the wing to help it heal. Use a very lightweight, clear tape. Gently hold the butterfly's body with one hand and use the other to place a small piece of tape on one side of the butterfly's wing. This will keep the wing held together and help the butterfly fly again.

, If you want your yard to be a haven for butterflies, you can help them out by planting a garden full of butterfly host plants and other plants that attract butterflies. Consider planting the following species (and many more) to keep butterflies happy and healthy in your area:Milkweed
Dill
Fennel
Parsley
Bee balm
Mint
Lavender
Lilac
Privet
Sage
Zinnia

Buy caterpillars from a supplier.",How to Raise Butterflies," Containers for caterpillars can be found in hobby and pet shops, on the Internet, or you can fashion one from items around the home. Preferably this should be one made from wire mesh, to give the caterpillar something to cling to. An aquarium or a one-gallon jar can work, too, provided it's lined with a screen or cheesecloth tightened with a rubber band at the top.


Don't use jar lids with holes in them, however, as these don't provide adequate ventilation and can also cut the delicate caterpillars with sharp edges around the holes.
Put a two inch layer of dirt and grass on the bottom of every container if you think your caterpillar may pupate below ground. If not, a layer of paper towels or newspaper will do fine.;
, Instead of spraying or squishing the caterpillar, identify it (see Warnings) and capture it to grow into a butterfly. Butterfly season is from late spring to summer, depending on your region. If you don't know of a spot that caterpillars like to frequent, consult a local field guide to determine which plants are preferred ""host"" plants for butterflies, like the Peterson First Guide to Caterpillars, Caterpillars of Eastern Forests, or on the Internet. Make sure you're not capturing an endangered species, which could be illegal. Different types of butterflies prefer different hosts. Some common host plants include:


Milkweed - Monarch Butterfly
Spice bush - Spice bush Swallowtail
Paw-Paw - Tiger Swallowtail
Thistle - Painted Lady
Parsley, dill and fennel - Black Swallowtail
Cherry - Cecropia Moth, Viceroy, Red-Spotted Purple
If it's not caterpillar season, or you simply don't have time to go caterpillar searching, consider buying them from a caterpillar supplier. We'll discuss that in the last section.

, Use a twig (preferably from the same host plant) or similar object. Handle them very gently because they can die if dropped even from a short distance.


Don't pick it up with your hands, for three reasons: it'll make it more difficult to put them in their new home (they cling tightly to surfaces they're walking on, and scraping them off your hand can hurt them); bacteria on your hands can give them infections; and some caterpillars are poisonous (see Warnings).
Place the stick with the caterpillar on it in the container. The stick is important, as it will provide the resting place for the chrysalis.

, Cut a small branch with some leaves. More than likely, it is the host plant (caterpillar's food). Be sure you know the caterpillar's preferred food before trying to feed it. Some caterpillars, like the Monarch Caterpillar will only eat one kind of plant (Milkweed). Other caterpillars will eat a from a variety of plants. However, they will starve to death before eating a strange food.


If you're not sure, however, consult a field guide and go out and get leaves from its host plant; even caterpillars like choices., Inspect it for insects and spiders before putting it into the container, because these insects can injure and kill a caterpillar. Be sure to replace the leaves daily, because caterpillars won't feed on old or dry leaves. To keep the food even fresher, put it in floral tubes (available for very cheap at most florist shops) with water. Don't use a dish, jar or vase to hold the food, however, because caterpillars can fall in them and drown.


If the caterpillar is on the food you're trying to replace, don't try to pull it off because they cling tightly and their legs could rip. Instead, put in the new branch, let them make their way to it themselves, and then take out the old branch.

, Place it in a hidden, sheltered area that is protected from intense heat or cold and away from pets or humans who might disturb the gestation. If you live in a dry environment, it may be wise to mist the cage occasionally, since caterpillars prefer a humid habitat. But misting too much can promote mold growth.


If you'd like to make their environment more humid, put some sort of clear plastic or cellophane around their home. This seals in the heat, increasing humidity. It's especially good for admirals and viceroys., Clean up after their waste, called frass, and any mold growth. Resist the urge to handle them, especially when they're lethargic or are changing color, because they might be starting to transform. Give it fresh food and watch for the caterpillar to change. It will soon turn into a chrysalis (butterfly) or cocoon (moth).


Leave the chrysalis untouched. At this point they will not need food or water, only the occasional misting to create a humid environment.
Caterpillars poop a lot. You may wish to put some newspaper in your caterpillar condo to catch the frass and make it easy to dispose of. It's very important to get rid of – if frass stays in their refuge, they could get sick and die., If you start to notice that your caterpillar is changing color or seems lethargic, he's likely about to molt or form their pupa. They are very vulnerable during this period, so do not touch them or otherwise mess with their environment. You'll notice them start curling, too.


The alternative to this is that they may be sick. If your caterpillar dies, dispose of it automatically as to not infect the other healthy caterpillars.

, Make sure that the chrysalis is hanging in an area of the container where, once it emerges, it will have enough room for its wings to fully expand without touching the ground or the sides of the container. They need enough space for their wings to develop properly and dry so that they can fly when they emerge, or else the butterfly may fall to the ground and not survive.


If necessary, move the branch or object that the chrysalis is hanging on gently to accommodate their emergence. But again, be very, very gentle. Move slowly. You do not want it to drop, hurting the to-be butterfly.
If the chrysalis falls off, attach the tip to a piece of paper with hot glue that is slightly cooled and wait until the glue hardens. Then pin the paper to cardboard or cork and place it in the container.

, The length of time it takes for a butterfly or moth to emerge depends on the species. If you are very keen and can identify the colors and other markings of the caterpillar well, try researching this information in books on butterflies or on the Internet. Some butterflies, Monarchs for example, emerge from the chrysalis in 9-14 days. Other butterflies will remain in the chrysalis stage through a Winter and emerge in the Spring.


The only thing to do during this period is to mist their container as normal. They don't need food or water, just a consistent environment.
You'll like see the chrysalis changing colors. When it becomes clear, the time is imminent. It can happen in the blink of an eye, so if you want to see it, don't go anywhere. It'll then hang for a few hours, letting its wing spread and fully form.
If the pupa becomes dark, it may be dead. Try to bend it – if it stays bent, it's likely dead., Your butterfly will not eat for several hours. It needs to pump fluid into its crumpled wings and let them dry. After you set the butterfly free, it will feed in your garden if you provide it nectar flowers. Sometimes they will drink from hummingbird feeders. Some butterflies like very ripe fruit as their food, too. Make sure your garden is ready.


Don't be dismayed if you end up raising moths instead of butterflies. Moths have markings just like a butterfly; while they will be a lot less colorful, the markings are still likely to be intricate and amazing. Even the varying shades of monotone colors are beautiful to behold in nature.

, When its wings are dry, you can put your finger under its legs and it should hop on your finger. Walk outside and set it on a flower for some great photos. If you have done your research, you may know the lifespan of your butterfly – some live as short as a day, so be mindful of this when giving it its freedom.


Butterflies need to be free to truly thrive. It's only possible to contain them if you have a large garden they can stay in. What's more, many species migrate – they can only stay with you so long if you want them to live.

, Some butterflies will live for a matter of days, some will stay a matter of days and then migrate, and others will stay for weeks. Either way, be glad you raised your butterfly successfully and watch for future generations.


If you wound up with the Luna Moth, Cecropia Moth, or Polyphemus Moth, don't worry about feeding them. These curious creatures don't have digestive systems., Most wild-caught females have already mated and are capable of laying eggs.If you catch one, you could coax her to lay eggs.


For butterflies, set them up in a cage with a water bottle and host clippings next to the light source (preferably sunlight). This will encourage her to oviposit. You may also want to keep her in a dark, cool area for a couple of days to help her acclimate to her new surroundings.Moths are much easier than butterflies. If you catch an adult female moth, you can simply place her in a large paper bag, fold it up, and leave her there for a couple of days. She'll likely deposit eggs on the inside of the bag. Tear the bag, removing the eggs without touching them, and place them into a more suitable container., Since monarch butterflies are so popular, there are Monarch farms where you can order monarch caterpillars, like from Monarch Watch.They can ship the little critters to you unharmed.


The only drawback to this is that you still have to find their food, the Milkweed. If it's not in your area, you'll have to order or grow it to successfully raise the Monarch.

, If you cannot find caterpillars in your yard or it's just the wrong time of year (it varies by locale), there are ""caterpillar suppliers"" for just this reason. Most companies have a wide variety of species to choose from and you know just what you'll end up with. Painted Ladies are probably the easiest, as you can just by growth medium for them to feast on.


However, this is a little less exciting then finding then on your own and knowing what they really like to eat. If you can, spend some time scoping out your garden. Exhaust all possibilities before you turn the the caterpillar farm.

Look at the size of the ant.,
See if there are wings on the ant.,
Look for signs the ant has shed its wings.,
Examine the thorax.,
Think about the area where you found the ant.,
Consider if you have army ants.,
Consult a specialist.",How to Identify a Queen Ant," For many types of ants, queens are much larger than regular worker ants. If you stumble upon an ant that appears unusually large, there's a good chance this is the queen.The ant will be noticeably bigger than the surrounding ants, or other ants you have seen.
Think about the type of ants you have as well. With leaf-cutter ants, the queen is particularly likely to be bigger than the worker ants.However, with fire ants and carpenter ants, workers themselves come in many different sizes.This may make it difficult to differentiate between the queen and worker ants based on size alone.;
, In many ant colonies, the queen is born with wings. During many parts of a queen's adult life, she will need to fly to find a new colony for mating. An ant with wings may very well be the queen ant.Some male ants do have wings, but they tend to be slightly less noticeable. The types of male ants that have wings will generally look more slender and wasp like than a queen, who will generally be larger.

, Queens do shed their wings at a certain point in their lifespan. If you lean down and look at the central portion of the ant's body, you may see small bumps jutting from either side of the ant's body. These are wing attachment points, a sign that the ant once had wings. As queens shed their wings, wing attachment points are a good sign you've found the queen., The thorax is the part of an ant's body that bridges the neck and abdomen. Queen ants will generally have a larger, bulkier thorax than worker ants.As a queen's thorax once supported wings, it will be much bulkier and more muscular than a worker ant's body.
A queen's thorax makes up more than half its body size. This is much larger than the thorax of a regular ant.

, If you're unsure how to identify the queen by appearance alone, consider where you found the ant. Queens tend to be found at the center of an ant's nest. Queens tend to prefer moist areas, commonly found in rotting wood. If you found an ant hiding in a damp area of your home or outside, especially in damp wood, this is more likely to be a queen., The vast majority of ant types have larger queens, with bigger thoraxes, who are easily differentiated from worker ants. However, army ants are an exception. Army ants have queens with smaller thoraxes, who look very similar to the ants in this type of ant colony. It may be difficult,to identify the queen when working with these kinds of ants.Army ants are more oval-shaped in appearance than regular ants. They have antennas on their heads, as well as mouth pieces shaped like scissors., If you cannot find the queen, consult a professional exterminator. Ants can be a real problem in your home. If you're unable to discover the queen on your own, or identify the types of ants, look in your yellow pages for an exterminator.

Feed your ants.",How to Feed Pet Ants," Ants will eat a variety of foods, such as meats, fruits, even dairy. Leftovers from your meals will also suffice. Anything to keep your ants healthy is a great choice.
, It's great to feed your ants fresh food, but you wouldn't want to feed them the most expensive food in your house, right? Keep to a budget. You can feed them whatever you want, but it's up to you to keep the costs low., Shuffle fruits and veggies together to make a small salad, or even mince meat into small bits so that your ants can carry it into their home easily. Keep the food away from chemicals that can harm your ants, such as pesticides., Slowly scrape the fruits, veggies, or meat beside or into the ant's nest to alert the ants of a possible food source being available. Watch as the workers come crawling out of the nest one by one to drag the food back into their home and to their queen."

Care for your ant farm.",How to Catch Ants for an Ant Farm," You won't need much to collect ants, but you'll want to make sure you have the necessary tools on hand before you begin. You'll need a small hand shovel to dig and scoop up ants, as well as a container to store them in. A clear, plastic food storage container or glass jar will work well for storing and transporting the ants that you collect back to your home., If you want to collect ants, you'll need to find a thriving ant colony. Start by searching the yard immediately surrounding your home. If you can't find an ant colony there, you may need to venture out into a more wooded area or try again during a more active period.Spring and summer are the best times to seek out and collect ants. You won't find very many (if any) ants in the winter.
Ants can live in a variety of different habitats, depending on the type of ant.
Good places to look for ants include in soil, in little mounds close to the ground, underneath rocks and other large objects in the dirt, or inside old wood.

, Once you've found an ant colony, you'll need to enter it using your hand shovel. When you're finished, try to restore the environment back to the way it was when you found it. Return all rocks and other objects to their original location and position so that other organisms can still use these habitats.If you're entering a colony built in the soil or in a dirt mound, simply dig about six inches (15 centimeters) into the entrance of the colony.
If you're entering a colony hidden under some object (like a rock), choose a large object approximately the size of a loaf of bread. Flip the object over to find the scurrying ants underneath.
Scoop up ants with a hand shovel and put them into your glass or clear plastic container. Make sure the lid is on tight, as ants can climb very quickly and escape.

, Some ants are capable of stinging you, and may do so if you enter the colony or attempt to collect them. Not all ants sting, but you should be able to clearly see a stinger protruding from the rear abdominal area on ants that will sting. Exercise caution as you collect your ants until you know whether or not they pose a threat.Fire ants can cause an allergic reaction if they sting you.Be very careful when searching for and collecting any insects in the wild.

, Most queen ants take flight following a summer rain, which triggers their mating period. This is when they are most active and most likely to leave a colony. Even if you can't find a queen ant ready to take flight, you will be able to find one relatively close to the surface for several days after a rainy period.Some ant species will have mating flights in late spring or after winter rains, depending on the region you live in, but the summer mating flight is the easiest and most likely time to find and catch a queen.
Be sure to bring a hand shovel in case you need to dig and a container to store and transport your queen.

, Once you've spotted a colony in the days immediately following a summer rain, you may be lucky enough to spot a queen at the entrance to the colony. If not, you'll have to do a little digging to find the queen. She will usually be fairly close to the surface during this time frame.Most of the time, the queen will be less than 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) deep in the soil.
Be careful as you dig so as not to injure the queen or any other ants with your hand shovel.

, As soon as you find a queen, carefully scoop her up into your glass jar or food storage container. A test tube will also work well, if you have one, since you'll be primarily collecting the queen and not a whole colony of worker ants. Be sure to collect any eggs the queen might have with her as well, as these will hatch if brought back to the ant farm., Ants are highly skilled at escaping from containers, no matter what precautions you may take. A store-bought ant farm will probably be safe, but if you've made your own ant farm at home you'll want to check it for any tiny gaps that might allow ants to escape.An easy way to tell if your ant farm is secure is by filling it with water, wiping the outside dry, and turning it upside down to see if anything drips out.
Only fill your ant farm with water if it's empty. Do not attempt to test your ant farm in this way if you've already filled it with dirt and/or ants.

, When you are ready to add your ants to the ant farm, they may attempt to rush out of their storage container. You can slow them down to more easily transfer them to the ant farm by placing them in a refrigerator for a very brief period of time.Store the transportation container full of ants in the refrigerator at a low setting, but only for a minute or two. This should slow the ants down sufficiently.
Anything longer than two minutes might kill the entire colony, so be sure that you don't leave them unattended for long.

, Once your ants are in their farm, they should begin exploring their new habitat and digging an extensive network of tunnels. Like all living things, your ants will have some basic needs that must be met if the ants are to survive.Ants need a source of clean drinking water, but not too much or they will drown. Use an eye dropper to add just a few drops of clean water every other day.Give your ants fresh food every two to three days, depending on how quickly they're eating.
Small insects and tiny scraps of kitchen meat are an ideal food source for young ants, while older ants will enjoy some sweet and sugary crumbs.
Keep your ants out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources. Try to maintain a steady room temperature of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius).

Write down where you found the ants, and what they were eating or collecting if anything. Note whether the ants are all the same size and shape, or whether some are significantly larger than others.


Optionally, you may observe how they carry food, how fast they run, their trail pattern, or even the postures they strike when disturbed.Most of these details will not be covered in this guide, but they may help later if you narrow down the identification to a couple species and need to perform a little outside research.;
, Tweezers or more precise, but the end of a cloth or brush dampened with rubbing alcohol or ethanol will also work., You may drop the ant in a plastic bag, seal it, and freeze it for 24 hours. Alternatively, drop the ant in a small jar with a shallow layer of alcohol, and examine after a few minutes.

, Identifying a specific ant species requires close examination of tiny body parts. A 10x or 15x lens should be strong enough, but you can use a microscope on low magnification if you happen to have one.A pair of tweezers will again be useful for investigation, for adjusting the ant's position.

, This may sound silly, but some termites and wasps are often mistaken for ants. Confirm that the specimen has these basic characteristics:Ants have ""elbowed"" antenna, with a distinct joint, and narrow waists. Termites have straight antenna and no obvious waist.
Some ants have stingers, while some wasps do not. Both insects have narrow waists, but ants have tiny ""nodes"" between the two body segments, while the segments connect directly on a wasp.
Winged ants have four wings, with the front pair larger than the rear pair. If all four wings are the same size, you most likely have a termite.

, Ants are made up of a head, central thorax, and rear abdomen. The final, large portion of the abdomen is called a gaster. Write down or make a mental note of the gaster's color.

, Ants have one or two smaller body parts between the thorax and the gaster, called nodes or petioles. These vary from tiny spikes, to relatively large square lumps, to flat segments that can only be seen once you pull apart the thorax and gaster with tweezers. These are the most distinctive part of the ant, and therefore the most useful for identification. Take note of the following:


How many nodes there are (one or two)
Shape of the node (sharp point, rounded bump, square/lump, or flat)

, Some species of ant, but not all, have a few spines on the top side of the thorax (large segment behind the head). These are often small and difficult to distinguish from hairs, so look carefully, and gently blow on them or brush with tweezers. Many species do not have thorax spines, while those that do most commonly have one to four near the rear of the thorax.


Count the number of spines, if present.

, Place the ant against a ruler and write down its size. If possible, use a ruler with millimeter markings, or 1/32 inch markings.

, There are thousands of species of ants worldwide, but typically only a few are likely to be encountered in a given region of the world. Save yourself time by knowing which ants are possibilities in your county or province, instead of reading every description.


Some tropical countries and islands have interactive guides here, but not all of these are in a usable state.

, Worldwide guides to ant species may require sifting through dozens or hundreds of species. If you can't find a local list, or if none of the ant species described below match your specimen's description, here are a couple good options:


Visit AntWeb.org. Select Regions in small text near the top of the page, then select your region from the drop-down menu. Select ""Nearctic"" for Canada, the U.S., and Baja California. Select ""Neotropical"" for the rest of Mexico and Latin America.
Alternatively, enter your specimen's information into Discover Life's database.

, The species descriptions below provide additional information whenever it may be useful. Head color, antenna shape (thin or ""clubbed""), and other information may come in handy.


Start by navigating to the section for one-node or two-node ants, depending on your specimen. In each section, the most widespread invasive ant species are listed in detail first. Other relatively common pest ant species with more restricted territories are given briefer descriptions beneath them.

, Found across most of the world, Argentine ants are dull brown and are all about ⅛"" (3 mm) long, with a pointed node. They move rapidly in tight trails, prefer sugar but will eat protein and fat, and have a musty odor when crushed.Colonies are typically in damp areas outdoors, but are also found indoors. Eradication is extremely difficult due to multiple cooperating colonies and multiple queens per colony., These ants are black, dark brown, or dark red, or a combination of these. They vary in size from ¼"" to ½"" (6 to 12 mm), and have one erect node and no thorax spines. They move in loose trails and are often found near wood, along with a strong odor and piles of sawdust, soil, and insect parts.Look for trails across lawns where vegetation has been thinned or removed.

, Crazy ants are named after their rapid changes of direction, and perhaps for their odd-looking, extra-long antenna and legs. Their slender, dark grey, black, or brown bodies are 1/16 to 1/8"" (2–3.5 mm) long, have a flat node that's difficult to see, and have no spines.


In the tropics, some crazy ant species are yellowish-brown instead and can be up to 1/5"" (5 mm) long, with a darker gaster (rear abdomen)., These one-node species are common pests in some areas, but much more limited in global distribution than the species above:


Ghost ants: Very small (1/16"" or 2 mm), with a black/brown head and pale abdomen. Flat, hidden node, no spines. Usually outdoors in tropics, or on plants from greenhouses or tropics.Odorous house ants: 1/8"" (3.5 mm) long, one flat, hidden node, no spines. Strong, unusual odor when crushed. Primarily found in trails looking for sugar, but this varies.Rover ants: male workers are 1/16"" (2 mm), small and black with unusual straight antenna. Most easily distinguished by the much larger, winged females, which are found near light or floating in standing water.White-footed ants: These 1/8"" (3.5 mm) ants are usually black with pale ""feet."" A flat, hidden node, no thorax spines.

, These are any mix of brown, red, or black, about 1/8"" (3.5 mm) or larger in size. When disturbed, these ants emit an odor and raise the stinger at the tip of the abdomen. Their nodes are slightly knobbly but not too raised.The nest is most easily found by following the trails, and looking for dead ants near holes in walls., These are easily identified by the massive head on the largest workers (1/8"" or 3.5 mm body length), accompanied by smaller workers with more normal proportions (1/16"" or 2mm). Two large, rounded nodes and two small thorax spines make these even easier to identify.


These ants prefer to forage for protein foods.

, Imported fire ants are extremely aggressive, rushing out to attack intruders with painful stings. They range from 1/16"" to 1/4"" (2–7 mm) long, with two raised nodes, and have a gaster that's a much darker brown than the rest of the body.


These often nest in electrical boxes and air conditioners, when established indoors. Outdoors, they are visible in large numbers after rainfall, rebuilding mound-shaped nests.
Californians may be able to receive assistance dealing with this species., The following two-node species are common pests in some areas, but not as widespread as the species above:


Little black ants: Tiny (1/16"" or 2mm) black ants, as you might guess. No spines and a tiny, almost invisible stinger make this ant difficult to identify. When nesting indoors, they are found in decaying wood and masonry.
Pavement ants typically nest in soil or sidewalk (pavement) cracks, with small dirt ""craters."" Slow-moving, with distinct grooves visible under magnification.Pharaoh ants. Yellow or orange ants that will happily nest almost anywhere, with a slightly thicker three-segmented ""club"" at the end of the antenna. Non-professional extermination attempts can worsen the problem.Thief ants. Extremely tiny (1/16"" or 2mm, or smaller) yellow or brown ants, with a two-segmented antenna club tip. They tend to stick to a trail once established, and may be found traveling through electrical outlets or into small holes in packaged food."

Set up your jar or container.,
Place your bait in your container.,
Leave the container for a few days.,
Transfer your ants to an enclosure.,
Try making peanut butter or honey traps.",How to Catch Ants1," Collecting ants using bait is a relatively simple process that does not require a lot of time or energy. The majority of your time will be spent gathering and preparing your materials before you set your bait. Ants are attracted to sources of food, which are generally a combination of sugar and water. You’ll also need a container to place your bait into, which can be any size, from a cup or glass to a gallon bucket.Bait can be as simple as sugar and water, but feel free to use other food like fruit, vegetables, or starch.
A general rule for collecting ants is the larger your trap, the more ants you will end up attracting.;
, The next step is to place your bait, whether it’s sugar and water or other food, into your container. Make sure your container is stable and will not fall over when left for hours at a time. Old yogurt containers or tupperware make for great ant traps. Fill your container with small amount of sugar and water, or simply place your food onto the bottom.Try using a sturdy container, like an old jar, to avoid it being disturbed or knocked over.
Choose a container that is not more than six inches high to ensure that your bait is easily accessible.

, Once you have placed your bait in a container you are ready to leave it out for a few days. Try to find a secluded place outside to place your container so that it will be less likely to be disturbed by other animals. Leaving your bait for a few days will ensure that ants swarm to it. Check on your container daily to collect ants periodically instead of dealing with a large amount of ants all at once.
Placing your container outside will mean that your bait might also attract other ground dwelling animals. Check your container frequently to make sure your bait is still intact. If it has been eaten, simply place more bait in your container and check back every few hours.

, Once you have collected your ants in a trap, collect your container and begin the process of transferring the ants to an enclosure. A enclosure can range from a larger container with soil and food to a more complex terrarium purchased at a pet store. If you are collecting ants for you first time, try making your own enclosure as terrariums are generally intended for ant farms and can be expensive.Make an enclosure for your ants by placing soil and a food source in a container, like a large tupperware. Be sure that the container is well ventilated with small holes made by a pin or needle. The holes made by a pin or needle will be small enough so that the ants will still have oxygen without being able to escape.
Look for proper terrariums at your local pet store or on websites devoted to ant collecting., Peanut butter and honey traps are simple traps that attract ants quickly. Simply coat a small paper surface, like a piece of cardboard, cardstock, or paper, with a thin layer of honey and place it indoors or outdoors for a few hours. The ants will be attracted to the sugar and will become “trapped” in the peanut butter’s or honey’s stickiness.If you don’t have a swarm of ants after a few hours, leave your trap out and continually check on it every couple hours.

Familiarize yourself with ant species in your area.,
Bring a container to place your ants into.,
Allot at least a few hours to ant hunting.,
Look for ants near rotting boards, rocks, or logs.,
Look for a queen.,
Transfer the ants you collected into a proper enclosure.",How to Catch Ants2," Familiarizing yourself with a particular ant species will help narrow down the areas you will need to search. Whether you are a novice or expert ant collector, knowing which ant you want to collect will determine where the ant can be found, how you can identify the ant, and whether any precautions need to be taken to ensure your safety. Research ant species in your area using online resources, like Myrmecos.There are many online ant collecting resources that can help you identify ants once you have located them, like the Mississippi Entomological Museum.Be sure to choose ants that don’t display aggressive behavior, bite, or sting in order to avoid injury.

, You will need a container with a lid (jar, yogurt tin, tupperware) to place your ants into once you have found them. Be sure to place some soil in the bottom the jar to keep the ants in while you continue hunting. Make sure your container is large enough to easily place ants into, which is generally around a 2 inch diameter. Remember that you might be carrying this container around for a while, so try and choose a container that is small enough to be comfortable.


There are a wide range of tools you can use to collect ants, from more professional tools geared toward preserving ants for scientific purposes to ordinary garden tools. Research which types of tools you’ll need by consulting various ant collecting blogs, like keepinginsects. , Ants are small and nests can sometimes be difficult to find. Give yourself a few hours of hunting time to ensure that you find a generous amount of ants. If you live in a densely populated urban area you may want to consider hunting for ants in a park or wooded area.


You may have to do a lot of walking, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and clothing.

, Rotting boards, rocks, and logs are common places for ants to nest. Look for fallen logs or large piles of boards around a park or wooded area and begin moving them around to search for ants. Keep your eyes out for ant trails leading to or from wood piles and follow them to their source.Once you’ve found some ants you can begin placing them in the container you brought with you. This can be done by simply having the ant crawl on your finger and transferring them to the container.

, You’ll need to find and catch a queen if you want to start an ant colony. However, before you find a queen you’ll need to be able to identify her. Queens can sometimes be difficult to find, but with enough patience and time you should be able to find one. The best time to look for a queen is when they still have their wings and are looking for a mate, as they tend to be deep in their nests after they have mated. Consult online insect collecting resources to determine when the mating season of your specific species is.Once you’ve found a queen place her in your container with the other ants.
You will need a queen if you want to start an ant colony. Most colonies will only survive 4-6 weeks without a queen.

, Once you have collected your ants and have finished hunting you can transfer them to a proper enclosure. Most proper enclosures can be purchased at pet stores or online store dedicated to insect collecting. Be sure that your container is large enough for the amount of ants you have collected.

Clean out any dried out, uneaten grass.",How to Take Care of a Grasshopper," Grasshoppers are found on every continent in the world except Antarctica.If you live in a very warm part of the world where it does not get cold even in the winter, you may be able to find grasshoppers at any time during the year. However, if you live in a part of the world with warm summers and very cold winters you will probably only be able to find grasshoppers during the warmer months of the year when the temperature no longer reaches freezing at any point during the day or night.Grasshoppers cannot move easily if they are not warm. Thus, in the morning just after the sun has come up might be the easiest time to catch them as they cannot jump away quickly. However, they may be difficult to spot since they blend in well with their environment. If you cannot find one in the early morning, try coming back in the middle of the day when they are more active and easier to notice.;
, Depending on where you live, grasshoppers may be very easy to find. Look for grasshoppers in grassy fields, empty lots, or along riverbanks in the grass. Grasshoppers like to eat leaves and grass, so anywhere you can find these you can probably also find grasshoppers.If you have a garden outside your home, you can probably find a few grasshoppers there too.

, To catch your grasshopper, you can use a fine mesh net, a t-shirt, or a flannel blanket to catch your grasshopper. Lay the net or blanket out on the ground and then walk towards the blanket, which will cause any grasshoppers in your path to jump forwards on to the blanket. If it is fuzzy enough, it will be difficult for the grasshopper to jump away quickly.Once you have the grasshopper on the blanket, quickly place a glass jar over the top of the grasshopper. Slide a thin piece of cardboard underneath the lid of the jar to keep him in while you flip the jar right side up, and place the lid on.
You may also be able to simply catch the grasshopper while he is sitting on a blade of grass. Approach the grasshopper slowly and carefully, getting as close as you can. When you are within arms reach, try to quickly place the jar over the top of him before he jumps away. This may take a few tries, but eventually you’ll catch one.

, You can use the jar you used to catch your grasshopper to take him home. A glass jar with a screw-top lid works well for this. Just make sure to poke a few holes in the lid before you go catch your grasshopper so that he can breathe inside the jar.


If you are young, ask an adult to help you poke the holes in the lid using a sharp knife or some scissors.

, If you want to have more than one grasshopper it is important to be aware of the consequences of doing so. Keeping two or more grasshoppers may result in fights, especially if you don’t give them more than enough food. If you keep males and females together, they will breed.If you want to breed your grasshoppers, then just put a male and female together in the terrarium. The female will lay her eggs in the filler of the terrarium, and these eggs will hatch into many young nymphs, which look just the same as adults, but much smaller.
If you do not want to deal with baby grasshoppers, do not keep a male and female together. If you notice that a female grasshopper has laid eggs and do not want any babies, you can dig up all the eggs and put them in the freezer, which will kill the eggs.
Do not release baby grasshoppers into the wild as it may disrupt the natural patterns of the ecosystem.

, In the wild, grasshoppers typically only live for a short time. If they are not killed by cold weather, they are usually killed by natural predators. However, in theory, a grasshopper can live for a few years in a warm and safe environment. If you are planning to keep a grasshopper as a pet, then understand that you are potentially committing yourself to caring for your grasshopper for quite awhile.This will require you to maintain their terrarium, feed them every day, and ensure that they are kept in an environment that is warm enough to keep them healthy.
If you don’t think you are ready for this commitment, look for an insect that has a naturally shorter lifespan.

, You will likely want to watch your grasshopper in action, so a clear glass terrarium is a great place to keep your grasshopper. Make sure that it is big enough for your grasshopper to have some room to move around, and that the terrarium has a plastic or metal mesh lid to cover the top.Grasshoppers can chew through fabrics, so net cages or cages with fabric mesh lids will not be able to contain your grasshopper for long.
Grasshoppers are talented jumpers so make sure that the grasshopper has a bit of space to jump around.
You can find terrariums at most pet stores.
Depending on the size of your grasshopper, a 5 to 10 gallon terrarium should be sufficient.

, There are believed to be over 10,000 species of grasshoppers on the planet with sizes of adult grasshoppers varying between 0.39 inches (1 cm) and 2.76 inches (7 cm). To get an idea of how big your grasshopper might grow, take a look at the size of the grasshoppers in the area where you caught yours. Your grasshopper is likely the same species as these, so should grow to a similar size.Female grasshoppers tend to grow larger than male grasshoppers. If you want to identify whether your grasshopper is male or female then look at their abdomen. Female grasshoppers will have four sharp points at the end of their abdomen that they use to deposit their eggs into the ground. Males will have smooth, rounded abdomens.Make sure that your terrarium is suitable for the size of your grasshopper. Small grasshoppers will not need much space to be content, but a larger grasshopper will need more space to jump around.

, You can fill the bottom with dry sand, dry oatmeal flakes, or even dry coconut fibers. This will make the terrarium more comfortable for your grasshopper. Make sure to fill it with just an inch or two so that your grasshopper still has lots of space.Place some twigs and sticks into the terrarium so that your grasshopper has a place to sit, and can jump from twig to twig.

, Grasshoppers need a dry and warm environment in order to thrive. During the day, your grasshopper’s home should be between 77 °F (25 °C) (25 Celsius) and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius). You can easily do this by having a lightbulb that shines into the terrarium during the day.You can also purchase a heat mat or a species light bulb at your local pet shop (call to see if they have reptile supplies before making the trip) to heat the terrarium, but a normal light bulb can also do the trick.
While some sunlight is OK, don’t place your grasshopper’s terrarium in a place where it will receive direct sunlight as this may cause the terrarium to overheat.
At night, it is OK for the temperature of the terrarium to drop as low as 60 °F (15.6 °C) (15 Celsius). To do this, you can just turn the light off at night, but don’t forget to turn it back on in the morning. A grasshopper that is too cold will be lethargic, and may even die.

, Grasshoppers will eat nearly any type of grass. To give them some variety, go outside and choose some different types of grass that you come across. For example, choose some grass from the lawn, as well as some wild grass that you find in empty lots or next to river banks.Don’t worry about giving them something that is poisonous. If the grass you put in their home is poisonous they simply won’t eat it. Then you know for next time.
Grasshoppers will also eat leaves, too.
Make sure to give your grasshopper plenty of fresh grass and leaves to eat every single day. Grasshoppers can eat up to 16 times their own body weight, so they may eat more than you think. Additionally, if you have more than one grasshopper in your terrarium, they make fight and kill each other if there is not enough to eat so better to have too much than too little.

, Grasshoppers do need moisture to survive, but in most cases they will get all the water they need from the grass that you feed to them. However, if you live in a very dry area, you can wet the grass with some water either by using a spray bottle to spray the leaves before placing it in the terrarium or by running the leaves quickly under the faucet to wet them.Grasshoppers don’t do well with a lot of humidity. While a few wet blades of grass won’t do any harm, a moist terrarium may cause problems. Avoid getting the filler you have placed in the bottom wet, and be sure to regularly clean out any grass that is left uneaten.

, Try to collect your grasshopper’s food from places you know are free from insecticides and other pesticides, as this may kill your grasshopper if consumed. If you get his food from your lawn, make sure that there haven’t been any insecticides sprayed on the area where you have collected the grass from.In general, if you collect his grass from a place that is not being cultivated by humans (e.g. an abandoned lot where the grass has grown up) then you will not have to worry about insecticides.

, It is OK to give the grasshopper more than you think they could possibly eat, as they eat quite a lot. However, to keep their terrarium healthy and dry, you should clean out any wilted, dried out, or moldy grass/leaves as soon as you see them. Replace with fresh food at least one time each day.Be aware that they may also eat during the night so make sure there is food available to them at all times.

Find an anthill.,
Collect the ants.,
Place a cap on the smaller jar and set it inside the larger one.,
Fill the remaining space in the jar with the dirt mixture.,
Place the ants in the jar and screw on the top lid.,
Offer them food and moisture.,
Cover the jar when you aren't watching the ants.,
Don't shake the jar.,
Store the farm in a warm room.",How to Build an Ant Farm," You'll need a large jar and a smaller one that just fits inside. The dirt and ants will be placed in the space between the small jar and the large jar. The small jar functions as a way to take up space in the middle so that the ant colony will build tunnels and lay eggs close to the outer edge, putting these processes in plain view. Skipping this step will allow the ants to burrow deep toward the middle of the jar, which they'll naturally want to do.


Different-sized canning jars are perfect for this project. But, if you want your ants to be happy, then buy a larger container.
Look for jars without etching, print or raised numbers and letters. Plain, clear glass will give you the best view of the ants.
If you'd prefer to have a flat ant farm, check out your local pet store and purchase a skinny aquarium. You can also order an ant farm setup from online retailers.;
, The ants will need a loose substrate that stays moist and allows them to dig and tunnel. If you're planning to source the ants from your yard or a nearby area, your best bet is to use dirt they already naturally live in. Dig up enough dirt to fill up the extra space in your jar. Use a fork or your fingers to loosen the dirt until it's nice and fine. Now mix 2 parts dirt with 1 part sand - less if your dirt is already naturally quite sandy.


If you aren't planning on getting your ants from a nearby location, and the dirt you have on hand doesn't seem suitable, you can buy potting soil and sand from a gardening store and mix it up to serve as your substrate.
If you order an ant farm kit, it should come with the right mixture for those particular ants.
You want the mix to be slightly moist, but not sopping wet. If it's too dry, the ants will dry out; if it's too wet, they'll drown.

, There are many species of ants, but by and large they nest in the ground.Look for anthills in slightly exposed areas in your yard. You'll know it's an anthill by observing the tell-tale volcano-shaped pile of small grains of dirt, with a tiny entrance hole near the top.


Tracking ants is another good way to find an anthill. If you see a group of ants walking, follow them back to their nest.
Observe the anthill to make sure you aren't dealing with fire ants or another type of ant that bites. Brown field ants are a good bet. If you want to be on the safe side, order your ants online as part of an ant farm kit.

, One you've identified an ant colony, bring a jar with a few holes poked in the top (not one of your ant farm jars) outside, alone with a large spoon, and scoop some ants into the jar. 20 - 25 ants should be a good amount to get your ant farm started. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


The ants probably won't reproduce unless you include a queen in your ant farm. An ant colony's queen lays all the eggs, an a group of worker ants - those you're likely to see close to the surface of an anthill - are likely to be sterile. Therefore, if you want to see ants go through the process of laying eggs, you'll need to get a queen - which can be tricky, and would require destroying the natural ant colony.
If you're set on seeing the reproductive cycle, a better bet may be to order a kit that comes with a queen ant. That way, you won't have to worry about digging deep into the ant's nest to get what you need.
If you create a farm without a queen, the ants will probably die within 3 - 4 weeks, which is their natural lifespan.

, To keep it centered in the middle of the larger jar, you can put a dab of glue or tape on the bottom before you set it inside. Make sure you put the lid on securely, since you don't want ants accidentally falling in.

, Use a funnel to neatly fill the extra space with dirt, or spoon it in. The dirt should not be tightly packed; make sure it's nice and loose, so the ants will be able to move around. Leave about an inch of empty space at the top of the jar.


You will now have created a layer of dirt that will serve as the ants' home.
The inch of empty space will keep the ants from climbing up the glass and out of the jar when you need to open the lid.

, Carefully drop the ants in the jar, making sure they all make it into the fine dirt you provided. Cover the jar and use an awl or a sharp knife to puncture it with tiny holes, to allow oxygen to reach the ants.


Make sure not to punch the holes too large, or the ants will escape and build a nest elsewhere.
Don't cover the jar with cloth, as ants will be able to chew their way out.

, In order to keep your ants happy, you can feed them every few days with a few drops of honey, jam, or pieces of fruit - ants love sugar! Don't overdo it, or you'll have mold in your ant farm. Ants get most of the moisture they need from food, but if it looks like the dirt and sand mixture is getting dry, wet a cotton ball with water and place it at the top of the jar for a few days.Don't give the ants meat or other cooked food. This will attract other types of pests to your ant farm.
Don't pour water into the jar. It'll get too wet, and the ants could drown.

, Ants do their tunneling at night, in the dark. To replicate the environment they're used to, cover the jar with black cloth or construction paper when you're not watching the ants. If you forget to do this, the ants will be stressed out and much less active. They'll also tend to stay away from the glass and spend their time as close as possible to the center of the jar.

, Ants are fragile creatures, and shaking the jar or otherwise handling it roughly can cause them to die when their tunnels collapse on them. Handle the ant farm carefully.

, Place it in a room that tends to stay at a good steady temperature. Don't place it in direct sunlight, or the glass jar might heat up too much and overheat the ants.

Provide housing with adequate space.,
Offer your crickets something to perch on or hide in/under.,
Give your crickets food and a water source.,
Clean the crickets' habitat once a week.",How to Keep Crickets Alive,"

Find a glass or plastic container to serve as the crickets' habitat. You can use an aquarium, a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket, or even a garbage can, although this is not advisable.. Use a screen to function as a lid. Good air circulation is necessary for the crickets to thrive. If there are any holes in the lid, cover them in tissue paper. This makes the tank more breathable. Remember that crickets can climb vertically, and are amazing escape artists.



 


It's important to give your crickets enough space to live. If you overcrowd the housing apparatus with crickets, you will find that they will literally eat each other. Providing enough space for each cricket to stand comfortably is necessary for their survival.





;
, You can use crumpled balls of newspaper, empty egg cartons, or cardboard tubes that have not been treated with dyes or fragrances. You can use old paper towel or toilet paper rolls as cardboard tubes.

, Keep in mind that crickets can drown very easily, so do not put standing water. Instead, wet a paper towel and place it in your enclosure. Or, purchase special water gels/crystals made to satisfy crickets thirst and naturally hydrate them. You can find these in most pet stores.


Food that has been specially formulated for crickets can be bought at pet stores. However, you can also feed them fish food flakes, dry dog kibble, carrot slices, and oats. You can also try adding cornmeal into the habitat. Buying food for made specifically for crickets has the added advantage of providing your crickets with high amounts of vitamins and nutrients.
Providing water for crickets can be tricky, since any amount of standing water can be dangerous to crickets. Give your crickets water by dampening sponges or pieces of cotton and placing them into the habitat. Some manufacturers make dry gel crystals that can take care of crickets' water needs.







,


You must also clean the habitat each time that you want to add more crickets to it.

If you are using the bottle method, put holes in the top with the knife or scissors.,
Catch the ants.,
Feed them every day, preferably every 6 hours or so.",How to Care for an Ant," Alternatively you could purchase a ready made ant farm from a scientific store or use a clean dirt filled fish bowl.;
, With the ready made ant farm or fish bowl, made sure it is clean and fill it with soil, sand or dirt up to about three to five centimeters from the top.

, To do this either find an anthill and pick as many as you want up or put the bottle over it and wait for them to go up the sides. If no ants are coming out of the anthill put a little sugar water, jam or honey in a jar or shallow dish. Leave it for an hour and when you come back it should be full of ants.

, Just a few crumbs will hold them for a while, believe me. Suitable foods are: a few drops of sugar water, jam, honey, bread or cake crumbs, bits of bread soaked in sugar water, tiny pieces of fruit etc. You will also need to water your ant farm so your ants do not die. To do this soak a ball of cotton wool in water and place it in your ant farm or very carefully sprinkle a few tiny drops of water into your ant farm.


Some people will let them out after a few hours. But the home you have created for your ants is actually suitable for a permanent abode for them so you do not have to set them free, just continue to look after them as described above.

, The container should be at least six inches tall, four inches wide and see-through. Poke small holes near the top of the container and in the lid to allow your grasshoppers to breathe.

, Add dirt or sand to cover the bottom, then add bits of grass, leaves, little slices of vegetables, and other natural objects. Make sure that they fit in the container and are not too big.


You may also want to add a wood block or some twigs.

, When you're catching them, make sure the lid is a little loose so that you can get it on and off quickly, before the grasshoppers have a chance to escape.

,, Find a male and female grasshopper, and put them in the container together. Make sure the cage is small enough that they'll find each other. Make sure you have enough food for both of them as they won't breed if they're hungry.


Remember that females have two little hooks near the end of their body, but males don't.

, Keep female grasshoppers alone in a separate container for a week or two after breeding. You can tell a female grasshopper is gravid (pregnant) when her abdomen is larger than usual. Try to have less water in the soil that you provided in her cage, as grasshoppers lay their eggs in the soil. After breeding her, or catching an adult female grasshoppers from the wild, try to watch her often and find out where she laid the eggs. She should lay about 20-160 young, preferably about 80 though. If you don't want to keep her offspring, simply release them into the wild.

, Young grasshoppers are small and eat less, but putting too many may cause fighting over food and sometimes cannibalism due to lack of vegetation. With adult grasshoppers, putting more than one in a cage can cause them to become locusts. ONLY put more than one grasshopper in a cage if breeding them.

, For younger hoppers, make sure you add tender leaves. You can also try to grow grasses or small weeds in the container to provide your hoppers with a constant source of food.

, Do not add too much water.


If the female grasshopper is pregnant, she will lay her eggs at the bottom in the dirt/sand.

, A small spray bottle can be used instead of sprinkling the water.

Find a safe place to keep your grasshopper where it cannot escape.,
Avoid placing parents with children in the same space.,
Set up the habitat before placing the grasshopper inside of it.,
Keep the habitat clean.,
Monitor grasshoppers food intake.,
Keep your grasshopper alive until maturity.,
Watch for signs of illness.,
Have fun with your new grasshopper pet!

",How to Raise Grasshoppers," A monarch butterfly habitat might be a good option. If you cover the place (with an object) it needs to have air holes so the grasshopper can still breathe. You also need to make sure the place is large enough for them to hop around. They love to jump.;
, Do not put the male parent in with the grasshopper, especially if the baby is a male. The father might kill them. Also, the female dies after laying eggs so don't expect them to meet their mommy.

, It will need a lot of fresh grass, which should be replaced daily (Replace it without letting the grasshopper out unless you have another cage/etc for this purpose.


You actually should have one in case the grasshopper gets sick and you need an isolation area for it, mainly only if you plan on giving it a companion later though.). You should also put a source of water that it won't drown in in the habitat.
A good example would be, a small bowl with a few pieces of ice in it. Replace the ice every time it melts and empty the bowl of water so they don't drown! Also, put in some things like sticks and/or mulch to climb, because they love to climb, too.
Make sure you also add some treats for the grasshopper (their favorite foods are soft plants like dandelions). Add some soft soil in as well if you plan on breeding the grasshopper; a female will lay its eggs in the soil.

, Insect poop is called ""frass"". If you find any frass in the habitat, clean it up. A grasshopper's frass is a little smaller than mouse poop and looks a lot like mouse droppings.

, Grasshoppers normally eat half their body weight in a day. This may vary depending on the species of grasshopper, and the individual insect. If they stop eating look up any illness they might have. They could be close to death especially if they are old.

, Once it reaches the stage of being an older nymph - the stage where it has wing pads but no wings yet and is big enough to see if it jumps off of you - you can let it climb on your finger. You should not do this when it is a baby or adult, because it can easily escape!


You can pick it up by putting your finger between its front legs and letting it climb on. Don't pick it up as if your fingers are tweezers or it will spit a brown liquid on you! That spit can cause eye infections, diarrhea, etc. If it jumps off find it and get it again, then place it back in the habitat.
You should socialize your insect before handling it very far away from the cage. This means you have to get it used to being held a lot. Let it sunbathe while on your finger since they like to sunbathe.

, Get to know your grasshopper. If it starts acting unlike itself, assume it's an illness and then research healing methods and try one.

Purchase a tank: Katydids require very little in terms of housing.,
Add substrate to the tank: Potting soil or topsoil purchased from any home improvement store works perfectly.,
Decorate the tank: Add leaves, branches, twigs, and any other decorations to make the home resemble the katydid's natural environment.

,
Catch a Katydid: Unlike praying mantis or butterflies Katydids are not commonly available at online bug shops.,
Feed your new pet: Grocery shopping to feed you pet is easy and inexpensive.,
Keep the tank moist: Using a spray bottle, lightly mist the tank every day.

,
Enjoy your new pet: Your katydid will give you hours of entertainment as you watch it stalk, hop, and sing in its cage.",How to Take Care of a Katydid Insect," A medium or large kritter keeper can safely house up to four katydids.;
, Fill the bottom of the tank with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of your chosen substrate.

,, Because of this the best way to acquire a katydid is to go on an insect hunt. During the hottest part of the day hunt for katydids in gardens, weedy areas with tall grasses, and crop fields.

, Give your katydid simple romaine lettuce and they will be happy for a long time. Remove spoiled food and refresh the lettuce daily.

,, You can enjoy the company of your new companion for 2 weeks - 3 months depending on the the katydid's age when you capture it.

Use your leftover vegetables.,
Learn how to prevent locust feeding behavior.,
Make sure you provide air for your grasshopper.,
Give your grasshopper some twigs.,
Put some moist sand in the enclosure.,
Give your grasshopper some light.,
Be gentle when you handle them.",How to Feed a Grasshopper," Baby grasshoppers (also called nymphs) are tiny and fragile. They can't move around much, so they are only able to eat what is nearby.Make sure you put their food as close to them as possible so that they can access it.;
, Grasshopper nymphs are so small and delicate that even the most gentle of touches can hurt or maim them. Keep them in their enclosure, but don't try to pick them up or hold them until they are larger and more durable.

, Grasshopper nymphs prefer more tender plants that they can digest easily, rather than tougher veiny plants. Some examples of plants that are good for young grasshoppers to eat are clover and fresh shoots of grass., Grasshoppers prefer to eat plants in the grass family such as alfalfa, wheat, corn, and barley.These types of plants are the easiest for grasshoppers to digest and, therefore, are their natural preference for food.

, Grasshoppers have special chemicals in their stomachs and saliva that allow them to break down the carbohydrates in drier plants and use it for energy.Try giving them tree leaves and other green plant materials to eat.

, Grasshoppers will also eat lettuce, cabbage, and other vegetables that you might have around the kitchen. So, instead of throwing your green scraps away, give them to your grasshopper.


Make sure you wash your vegetables thoroughly before giving them to your grasshopper to remove any residual pesticides.

, When too many grasshoppers exist in the same space, a chemical reaction is triggered and the grasshoppers grow much larger and lay eggs more quickly.This is what happens when grasshoppers turn into locusts. Once the locusts have formed, they are able to swarm together and consume nearly any vegetation in their path.


To keep this from happening, make sure your grasshopper has plenty of room to roam and grow in whatever container you have them in. And don't put too many grasshoppers together in the same container. As long as they have enough space and don't feel too close to other grasshoppers, your grasshopper won't turn into a locust.

, Grasshoppers need to breathe too, so don't put them in a jar and expect them to be fine. You need to at least poke some holes in the lid of the jar or put some kind of mesh on as a lid instead.

, Try to make your grasshopper's home as close to the real thing as possible. In addition to their regular food, put some twigs and grass in their enclosure.Lean some of the twigs against the wall so that the more or less stand upright. This will give your grasshopper something to stand on and jump in between just like they do out in nature.

, Female grasshoppers need to lay eggs. They prefer to do this in sand, so it is important that you include a small area of sand in their enclosure. The sand needs to remain moist (they won't lay eggs in dry sand), so you'll need to check it every day or two to see if you need to add more water.


Note: the sand should be moist, not wet or muddy.

, Grasshoppers are insects, so they don't have the ability to regulate their body temperature like mammals do. They need a light source in or near their home so that they don't freeze. Keep a lightbulb or desk lamp on near their enclosure for approximately 16 hours every day.

, Adult insects can be picked up and handled by humans, as long as you do so very carefully. Grab them gently by the thorax (this is kind of like the insect's torso). Make sure you don't try to pick them up by one of their legs as you might accidentally pull it off.

Search at peak times.,
Locate grasshoppers.,
Get a grasshopper into your container.,
Make your container inviting to grasshoppers.",How to Catch a Grasshopper1," To catch a grasshopper, start your search in the morning or at dusk when it's cooler out- they are slower in the lower temperature than they are in the afternoon heat.Since grasshoppers have the ability to leap across incredible heights and distances, this sort of advantage is very helpful; these creatures can project themselves up to one metre ahead and 25 centimeter (9.8 in) high.Grasshoppers also have the ability to fly, which they often employ when threatened, so trying to catch them when they are operating at a slower pace is an excellent idea., Grasshoppers can be found almost anywhere in the world, save for extremely cold regions like the North and South Pole. Grasshoppers generally live in meadows, fields, or anywhere else they can find food.Look for holes in the tissue and leaves of plants in order to spot where grasshoppers might be feeding. You can also listen for their ""singing"", or the chirping sound that occurs when they rub their large hind legs against their wings., Use a fine mesh net, a container with a lid and air holes, or an old shirt or sheet to catch a grasshopper in an area where you've already identified their presence.Grasshoppers are not difficult to catch; stomp the ground or rustle grass to agitate the grasshoppers and make them ""jump"" (i.e.catapult themselves off the ground)Once they are moving, position your container, net, or other trap to catch one.


When grasshoppers feel threatened, they spew a brown liquid as a defense mechanism; the liquid is harmless, but it may stain your clothes., If you're trying to catch a grasshopper in a container, fill the container with bits of food that will attract the insect. Put in a slice of apple, some bits of bread, a carrot, or some lettuce. Ideally, use food that is starting to turn, which you would not be consuming anyway."

Mix equal amounts of granulated sugar and plain breadcrumbs together.,
Sprinkle this mixture on the ground where you have seen crickets congregating.,
Cover the mixture with a single layer of newspaper.,
Choose a large jar with a lid for capturing the crickets.,
Return in the morning before the dew dries.,
Lift the newspaper and sweep the crickets into the container.",How to Catch Crickets1," This is cricket food! If you want to catch a few dozen crickets, a cup of sugar and a cup of breadcrumbs should be plenty.


Don't use spicy or flavored breadcrumbs. Plain breadcrumbs are best for catching crickets, and extra ingredients might deter them.
You can mix up a big batch of sugar and breadcrumbs and store whatever is left over in a jar for later use. This way you can catch more crickets every few days.;
, This method may be best to use outside, since sprinkling this mixture indoors may draw other pests, like roaches and mice. Sprinkle the mixture at dusk just before the nocturnal crickets will come out to play.

, Lay it out over the area where you sprinkled the sugar and breadcrumbs. Use no more than a single layer, since you want the crickets to be able to get underneath it.

, Get a big glass jar or a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Poke holes in the lid if you want to keep the crickets alive once you catch them.


There are special containers you can use for storing live crickets. Visit a bait store to check out their options, or look online and order one.
You can sprinkle some of the sugar and bread mixture in the jar to keep the crickets fed.

, This is prime time for catching crickets. Their bellies will be full and they'll be calmly waiting for you under the layer of newspaper. If you wait until the sun dries the dew, the crickets will have time to hop away.

, You can use a scoop or a small brush to nudge them into the container. Place the lid on tightly once you've caught your crickets.

Set a molasses trap.,
Set a glass and soapy water trap.,
Set a fuzzy blanket trap.,
Set a bottle trap.,
Make a yellow trap.",How to Catch a Grasshopper2," To catch a grasshopper, try laying out a bucket or small container containing a 10:1 solution of water and molasses. To catch multiple grasshoppers, fill a pond or wading pool with the same solution.Avoid this method if you wish to catch a grasshopper alive; the insect will likely drown in the solution unless retrieved right away., Another option for catching grasshoppers on a larger scale is to set up a pane of glass and a vat of soapy water in a field. Position the pane of glass vertically, with the vat in front of it. The grasshoppers will leap at the pane of glass, fall back into the soapy water, and drown- the soap cuts the surface tension of the water, causing the grasshoppers to sink., To catch a live grasshopper, to observe or keep as a pet, lay out a fuzzy blanket in a field or other grasshopper-friendly area. To attract grasshoppers to it, spray the blanket with sugar water and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.Leave the trap overnight. Grasshoppers that move across the blanket will get their legs caught in the fuzzy fibers long enough to be picked up or collected in a container.To speed things up, agitate the grass around the blanket to drive grasshoppers to leap onto it.

, Cut off the top of an ordinary plastic bottle and reinsert it upside down, so that the opening sits inside the bottle. Tape it together and insert some grass, then leave the trap outside. Grasshoppers will get into the bottle easily by way of the funnel-like top, but they will be unable to get back out., Grasshoppers seem to be attracted by the color yellow, so setting a trap that uses this color is worth a shot to catch one.Insects see in the UV spectrum, and light colors reflect more UV light, making them more appealing.Set up a molasses trap in a yellow bucket, or a fuzzy blanket trap with a yellow blanket (or yellow accessories on the blanket) to catch a grasshopper.

Cut off the the top of a 2-liter soda bottle.,
Invert the top and place it inside the bottle.,
Sprinkle sugar into the bottom through the spout.,
Place the bottle on its side in a spot where you have seen crickets.,
Return in the early morning to collect your crickets.",How to Catch Crickets2," Use a sharp knife to cut around the circumference of the bottle. Be sure to hold the bottle tightly with one hand so the knife doesn't slip.

, The pour spout should be pointing to the bottom of the bottle, and the cap should be removed. Use duct tape to seal the top edge of the bottle.

, Keep sprinkling until you have a fine layer of sugar at the bottom of the bottle.

, You can use this method either indoors or outdoors. The crickets will crawl through the spout to reach the sugar, and a surprising number of them will be unable to find the hole to get back out.

, Move them to a sealed container to store them for later use.

Place a strip of duct tape sticky side up where you have seen crickets congregating.,
Return to the tape the next day.",How to Catch Crickets3," Common areas are on the floor along the baseboards or on windowsills in rooms where you suspect crickets are hiding. This method works best indoors, since tape placed outside will collect dirt, leaves and other creatures.

, The crickets will get caught in the glue as they try to walk across, making it easy for you to pick up and dispose of them. A more expensive option would be to use the sticky traps or ""motels"" made for catching roaches.

Collect the pinhead crickets and place them in a rearing container.,
Repeat.",How to Raise Your Own Crickets," You will need a container or tank to keep your crickets in. It's easiest to have at least two containers, one for breeding adults and one for maturing young crickets. Decide how many crickets you want to raise and purchase a container(s) of suitable size.


You'll want to make sure that your container or tank is big enough for your cricket colony. One big mistake many people make when raising crickets is not buying a big enough container. When crickets breed in a very confined space, they actually eat one another so that there are fewer crickets to compete for resources. This isn't something you want. Make sure to buy a big enough tank!
Purchase a clear tote bin with a secure lid to keep the crickets in. High-sided plastic storage boxes are a common choice. A 14 gallon (53 L) container can hold a colony of over 500 crickets with sufficient cardboard or egg crates to climb on. Smooth-surfaced tote bins will reduce the number of escapees.;
, Cut one or two 6"" holes in lid of the tote bin for ventilation. Cover the top with a metal mosquito screen to prevent escapes, as crickets can chew through plastic screen. Try a hot glue gun to secure the screen. You can experiment with variable vents if you want additional control over the heat.

, Place 1-3"" of vermiculite in the bottom of the tote bin. This will give the crickets something to walk on that will keep the container dry to prevent bacteria and reduce odors. Especially with denser colonies, this will need to be replaced every 1-6 months, so get some extra.

, The females need this to lay their eggs in. Try to make it just slightly higher than the vermiculite so the crickets can get in the container. Make sure your topsoil is fertilizer- and pesticide-free.


You can put screen on the surface of the soil to prevent crickets from digging or eating the eggs. Females can deposit eggs through screen using their egg laying spike (ovipositor).

, Make sure you have enough crickets to feed your pet with 30-50 extra to breed. It's important to have a mix of male and female crickets but preferably, more females than males.


Female crickets have three long extrusions on their behind with the main one (called ovipositor) that it uses to deposit the eggs in the ground. Female crickets will also grow fully developed wings.
Male crickets have two extrusions. They have short, under-developed wings that they use to produce the familiar cricket call we hear at night.

, Place all your crickets in your completed cricket container. Place a shallow dish of commercial cricket food or substitute (crushed premium dry cat food works well) in the container away from the soil.


You can treat the colony to fruit, potato slices, greens, and other vegetable matter to supplement their diet. Be sure to remove unfinished fresh foods before they mold or rot.
Other, more bizarre foods may include tropical fish flakes, pond fish pellets, rabbit food (alfalfa pellets), or pretty much anything with high protein content.Try to mix the feeding up to keep your crickets happy. The health of your crickets will translate directly to the health of your pet(s). Try to supplement dry foods with fruits and vegetable scraps, as well as greens such as lettuce. This will ensure that your crickets are truly ready to be a nutritious snack for your pet(s).

, Crickets need near constant supplies of water to stay alive and well. Watch as your crickets swarm to water whenever you mist the container. Here are some creative ways cricket keepers keep their quarry nice and hydrated:


Try placing an inverted bottle reptile water dispenser with a sponge in the reservoir into your container. The sponge should help prevent any flooding or drowning in the tote bin.
Cut one long side of a cardboard toilet roll and unfurl it to get a rectangle. Wrap this cardboard with very absorbent paper, such as paper towel, and hoist it up vertically in a corner so that it forms a kind of fort.
A dish of water gel (also sold as soil substitute, e.g. ""polyacrylamide"") or unflavored jello kept in a corner also makes a great watering hole.

, Crickets absolutely need to be kept warm to promote breeding and incubation for their eggs. Heat can be provided by various methods such as a reptile heater, a heat pad, or a light bulb. Placing a space heater in a walk-in closet will heat the entire closet, providing heat for your crickets and incubating their eggs.


When mating to breed, males only chirp between 55–100 °F (13–38 °C). Crickets do best when kept on the warmer side of 80–90 °F (27–32 °C).

, If you've given them enough food, water, and heat, and your crickets are generally happy, they should breed profusely. Give them about two weeks to breed and lay the eggs in the soil. The crickets will burrow down about an inch below the topsoil in order to lay their eggs.After two weeks, the topsoil will be filled with little oblong eggs about half the size of a rice grain. Remove this topsoil and place it in a nesting container to incubate the eggs.


While waiting for your crickets to lay eggs, be sure to keep the topsoil damp. Eggs that are completed dried out will die and be useless to you. Fill a mister with filtered water and periodically spray the topsoil to make sure the heat doesn't dry it out completely.

, The crickets need heat to incubate the eggs until they hatch. Place the disposable container in a larger container that can be sealed tightly and place it where the temperature is 85–90 °F (29–32 °C). After about two weeks (longer at lower temps), the eggs will start hatching and pinhead crickets the size of a grain of sand will emerge by the hundreds daily for about two weeks.

, This container should be stocked with food and water to allow the baby pinheads to grow until they are an appropriate size to put back into the main container — usually about 7 - 10 more days.


Remember to moisten the soil in your rearing container every so often to make sure that the crickets have enough water.
Consider also placing the rearing container on top of a heating pad set to 80–90 °F (27–32 °C).

, Following the above steps with your new crickets will produce hundreds upon thousands of crickets, which will be plenty to feed your pet and perhaps even all your friends' pets. Pretty soon, you will be a full fledged cricket farmer! If your crickets die, pay special attention to these things:


Not enough space. Crickets need plenty of space to habitat and breed. If your crickets become too crowded, they will begin to feed on themselves in order to remove competitors from the ecosystem.
Not enough/too much water. Crickets need more water than you may think — misting the soil and filling their water reservoirs every couple days is extremely important. At the same time, do not drown your crickets in water. Regular misting and refilling is enough.
Not enough heat. Crickets like hot temperatures to live and breed in. Try to keep your container between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit for optimum temperature.

",How to Catch a Cricket Inside a Building," In order to do this you will need a quiet house. Carefully go from room to room listening for the characteristic chirping. Crickets can usually be found underneath furniture or appliances and in closets. If, however, you suddenly turn the lights on in a previously dark room they may be out in the open.;
, A large, clear drinking glass is preferable, so that the rim can safely enclose the cricket without out touching any antennae.

, If they are underneath something, you may have to rearrange furniture or shock them out. Try flourishing a long, thin object or brandishing a flashlight in the area where the cricket is hiding. Unfortunately, you will have lost the element of surprise after that.

,, If you make any jerky movements, the cricket will jump three to four feet depending on its size, so steady the hand and move down slowly until the cricket is trapped.

Buy a plastic cage.,
Place an old egg carton in the cage.,
Keep the cage warm.,
Clean the cage weekly.",How to Care for Live Crickets for Reptiles1," House your crickets in a plastic storage container.You can purchase a cricket cage from the pet store or you may use a Rubbermaid tub, garbage cab, aquarium,or an old plastic food container. Poke a hole in the top of the container to provide some ventilation.Use a smaller container if you have a few dozen crickets or less. If you have a larger number of crickets, you will need a garbage can or an aquarium sized cage.The holes should be small enough for air to flow, but not big enough for your crickets to get out. Use a thumbtack to make small holes.
You can also make a large hole in the top of the container and glue a mesh screen. Use a metal screen instead of fiberglass screen.Using a substrate is not recommended because it makes cleaning more difficult and produces more odor. However, if you do use substrate, sand, wood shavings, or coconut fiber is acceptable.;
, Your crickets need space to climb and to get away from the other crickets. If they remain on top of each other, they can suffocate. Stack an egg crate either vertically or horizontally in the cage.Depending on the size of your cage, you may need to cut the egg crate so it will fit.
You can also use old paper towel or toilet paper rolls instead of egg crates.

, Your crickets need a warm environment between 75°F - 85°F.You can use an incandescent bulb to provide heat. If you are trying to get smaller crickets (i.e. ½ inch or smaller) to grow, keep the temperature between 80°F - 90°F., Remove dead crickets, casing, and waste every week. Dead crickets release toxins that will kill the live crickets. Crickets are very sensitive to any fumes or chemicals. You should also clean the cage every time you get a new shipment of crickets.Tilt the cage to one side and move the egg crates to the other end. Your crickets will stay on the egg crates. You can then remove anything you need to from the cage.
If you need to clean the entire cage, remove the egg cartons and place them in another temporary container. Clean the cage with hot water and a mild soap/bleach solution. Rinse the cage out until you can no longer smell the soap/bleach mixture.

Catch them with cricket bait.,
Set traps.,
Use bug spray.,
Remove the eggs.,
Seal your home.,
Seal your trash.,
Cut back vegetation.,
Remove bright lights.,
Allow natural predators to thrive.",How to Get Rid of Crickets," This easy method for luring crickets from corners and crevices is the most effective immediate solution.


Place a few spoonfuls of molasses in a shallow bowl, and fill it halfway up with water. Set the bowl in the room where you have a cricket problem. Crickets love molasses, and they'll hop into the bowl when they smell it. Empty the bowl frequently.
Chemical cricket bait is sold in hardware stores, and uses the same basic method to catch crickets. If you use this type of bait, make sure your family and pets don't go near it, since it is toxic.;
, Sticky glue traps are a great non-toxic way to catch crickets. This is especially wise if you have young children or pets that will be sensitive to often poisonous bug spray. Place the cricket traps along problem areas, like walls, windows or doorways. The closer to heat and moisture these insect passages are, the more likely they are to attract the trespassing crickets.

, Most bug sprays effectively get rid of crickets. Choose an all-purpose spray or one made specifically for crickets, and spray in corners, along windowsills, and in other places where you've noticed an infestation. Be careful when you use these sprays, since they contain toxic chemicals.

, Crickets may lay eggs inside the home, which could cause the infestation to rapidly get out of control.


Try vacuuming the area with a vacuum cleaner that has a High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter. These are high-powered machines that will pull the eggs from the carpet or wherever they may have been laid. Throw away the vacuumed contents in a sealed plastic bag.
Most sprays used on live crickets will also kill the eggs. Spray along trim and baseboards, where crickets usually lay eggs.

, The easiest method for avoiding cricket infestations within your home is to prevent them from ever entering your home by sealing your windows and doors. They're able to get through the smallest cracks, so make sure you check carefully for areas where they might be able to come in or build a nest.


Eliminate tiny crevices by caulking windows and cracks in your walls.
You can buy an attachment to affix to the bottom of your doors to create a seal that prevents crickets from squeezing under them.
Make sure your vents have screens.

, Trash smells attract crickets. Covering up trash outside in a sealed container will deter crickets from breeding on your property and entering your home.

, Crickets build their nests in tall grasses and other vegetation. Keep your plants trimmed back and your lawn mowed so they won't have a place to nest.


Make sure grass-like plants are several feet from your house, so crickets that might nest there don't have easy access to your home.
Trim back ivy and other ground cover.
Wood piles, mulch piles, and compost piles should be located well away from your house.
Check your drains and roof gutters for leaves and other plant debris that might have piled up. Crickets often nest in these areas.

, Crickets are attracted to lights, and if you light your house at night with strong lamps, you might be luring them toward your house.


Lower-light ""bug lights"" or amber LED lights can be purchased at hardware stores. These are designed not to attract crickets and other bugs.
If you light your yard at night, place the lights well away from your house so that they aren't drawing crickets inside.
Draw your blinds and shades at night so the bright glow from your house won't attract crickets.

, Lizards and spiders are natural cricket predators, so if you allow them to live on your property, they will naturally control your cricket population.


Avoid spraying your property with insecticide, which is toxic to cricket predators.
Cats and birds are also natural cricket predators. Let your cat outdoors, and consider installing a bird feeder.

Feel your cat’s fur.,
Notice your cat’s size.,
Consider your cat’s facial features.,
Look at your cat’s eyes.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Still a Kitten1," There are obvious differences between an adult cat’s fur and a kitten’s fur. Kittens have more of a fluffy, downy coat, while adult cats have a more sleek and shiny look to them. Older cats can have less sleek and shiny coat due to age and inability to groom themselves. Older cats may sometimes have matted fur as well.


Pet your cat and pay attention to the feeling of the fur as well as its appearance.;
, Kittens are usually smaller-boned and may appear to have unusual proportions. For example, some kittens may have paws that seem too large for their bodies. Pay attention to your cat’s size and proportions for another clue about his or her age., Facial features provide a strong indication of how old a cat is as well. Kittens tend to have more of a round face with feathery cheeks and large, round eyes. As they grow older, their facial features become more pronounced. An adult cat’s face tends to look longer and the nose stands out more.

, All kittens have blue eyes when they are born. At around 6 weeks, a cat’s eyes will change from blue to their permanent eye color. Check your cat’s eyes. If they are still blue, then your cat may still be a kitten."

Only hang around people you like.,
When upset with someone, don't get angry immediately.,
Show the important people in your life you care about them.,
Look people in the eye.,
Keeping clean is a must.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Stretching is good for you.,
Have fun!,
Know how to be sexy.,
Facial expressions are important.",How to Learn from Cats," This may sound simple, but lots of people still remain to hang out with a crowd that either is a bad influence or treats you poorly behind your back. Cats don't tolerate this this. They only hang out with those who they trust and feel comfortable with.;
, When a cat is upset with someone, they don't just attack them or run away from them immediately (non-feral cats that is...). They may give a warning bite, prick their ears back or anything else that lets them know they don't know what you are doing. What you can do when in a situation like this is be direct with the person and tell them you don't like what they said.

, Cats love giving special attention to others they love. They show this by doing some of the following; rubbing up against you, rubbing heads, grooming you, playfully biting you, purring in your presence, blinking slowly at you, bringing home a gift from after a hunt, etc. You can be more like this in a human way by hugging them, giving them a present, telling them they are a great friend, being pleasant to them, compliment them, etc.

, A cat shows he/she is paying attention to you by looking at you directly in the eye. Do the same and it will show others you are intently listening and interested in what they are saying.

, Cats are experts at cleaning themselves and do it frequently throughout the day. Make sure you shower every day (don't wash your hair everyday however, you will wash away the natural oils), put on deodorant, keep your hair tidy and all the rest. Make sure your nails are kept neat too.

, Another thing that cats are experts at are getting plenty of rest - around 16-19 hours of it a day. It keeps them refreshed and full of energy the times they are up. Make sure you get around 8-9 hours of sleep a night (especially if you are an adolescent because your body does a lot of its growing when you are asleep).

, Cats stretch after they nap and even times in-between. This allows them to be more graceful with their movements and be able to climb and reach greater heights without hurting their muscles to much. You can do this by doing a bit of yoga after you get up in the morning or just casually stretch your arms or legs during the day.

, Cats, when wide awake, love playing games such as climbing trees, picking on other fellow cats, running around everywhere, exploring, climbing up onto high areas, etc. So you should also make sure you have time to have a bit of fun each day and a break from work. This could be by getting a hobby you enjoy, playing outside, playing with your cat, or even just reading a good book. Just as long as you are enjoying what you are doing.

, Cats have been acknowledged for being naturally sexy for many years. They have a graceful way of walking and when jumping up onto things, they are often graceful in the motion. Also, they are almost always relaxed and fully comfortable without worries when fully stretched out on the ground. This confidence and relaxation combined with their graceful, sleek movements is what makes people think of them as sexy. You can be like this just by being comfortable in your own skin. Self confidence is key. At the same time, be relaxed and never worry what others think of your body. Also, like the cat, be graceful. If you are a girl, walk with one foot being in front of the other (no duck feet or pigeon toes, you want to be like a cat, not a bird.) with a slight sway with the hips. Stand tall with your head held high and your shoulders back and relaxed. Good posture is essential to looking sexy.

, One way cats show their mood is through their facial expressions. If a cat is happy, it may blink a lot slowly and ears in their usual position. If a cat is mad however, it may show its teeth while squinting its eyes and have its ears pricked back. Make sure you use facial expressions to such as smiling when you are happy, raising your eyebrows in reaction to something or whatever goes with the situation. The point is not to always carry a poker face.

Give your crickets fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Give your crickets dry food.,
Gut load before feeding to your reptile.,
Dechlorinate the water.,
Provide water in a safe way.",How to Care for Live Crickets for Reptiles2," A healthy diet for your crickets will result in a healthy diet for your reptiles. Fresh fruits and vegetables are also a source of water for your crickets. The following foods are ideal for your crickets:Potatoes
Carrots
Greens such as romaine lettuce, collard greens, mustard greens, broccoli, and dandelion leaves
Fruits such as apples, oranges, grapefruits, berries, mango, and papaya

, A healthy diet consists of both fresh foods and dry foods. Your crickets will eat almost anything that you give them, including their fellow crickets. It is important that you always have a food bowl in their cage.Nutritious dry food includes:Cricket chow
Alfalfa
Wheat Bran
Seeds and nuts such as unsalted raw sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, and peanuts
Crushed cat food, dog food, or chicken feed that is vegetable based

, At least two days before you plan to feed the crickets to your reptile, feed them a mixture of all of the healthy foods that you have been giving them. Gut loading is different from regular feeding because you are giving them multiple foods at once. Gut loading makes sure that your reptile is getting the most nutritious cricket possible.Move the crickets that you plan to give to your reptile into a different container for gut loading.

, Only provide your crickets with dechlorinated water. You can purchase a dechlorinator from your local pet store for 5 or 10 bucks. It typically takes one or two drops of dechlorinator for every gallon of water. However always read the instructions.You can dechlorinate a gallon of water and keep it aside to give to your crickets.
It should not take more than 5 minutes for the dechlorinator to work.

, While your crickets need water, you must be careful and not drown them. Use a damp sponge, paper towel, cotton ball or fresh fruit as water sources. Do not use a water bowl or any other type of standing water. It does not take much for crickets to drown.You can also purchase a feeder cricket watering device.
Check the water supply multiple times a week to make sure that it is still damp.

"
"
Buy crickets when they are young.,
Keep their cage clean.,
Provide adequate ventilation.,
Use a safe water source.",How to Care for Live Crickets for Reptiles3," Crickets have a short life span of 8-10 weeks. Try to buy young crickets so you can use them in time. When you purchase crickets, find out how old they are.The hotter you keep their cage, the shorter their lifespan. A temperature of 80°F - 90°F will cause your crickets to die more quickly. Try to keep it between 75°F - 80°F.

, If you do not clean your cricket cage regularly, your crickets will not last as long. Remove a cricket as soon as it dies. Also, remove any uneaten food before it begins to rot.If you find that your crickets are not living for very long, you may need to clean more often.

, A screen top is best for your cricket cage. If you are poking holes in your plastic lid, you will have to poke a ton of holes.The holes should cover the entire area of the lid. If you your crickets are not living very long, poke more holes or switch to a metal screen.


Your crickets will not get enough air if they are too crowded in their space either. Use egg cartons and make sure that you have a large enough cage.

, Oranges and apples are great as a water source for your crickets. If you do use a water dish, only fill it with ¼ inch of water. Also place a sponge in the water dish so that your crickets can easily climb out of the dish."
"
Recognize the difference between male and female crickets.,
Have a separate container for egg laying.,
Allow eggs to incubate.,
Take care of the baby crickets.",How to Care for Live Crickets for Reptiles4," You can easily tell the difference between adult female and adult mate crickets. Female crickets have an ovipositor (egg laying appendage) that extends from their rear and smooth wings. Male crickets have ridges on their wings and use these ridges to make a chirping sound when they are trying to mate.It is difficult to tell the difference between males and females when the crickets are young.
Breeding is not difficult with adult crickets.

, One container should be exclusively for breeding. Place substrate (e.g. moist sand, soil, coconut husk; damp cotton wool or paper towels) in a plastic tub. The substrate gives the female crickets a place to burrow before they deposit their eggs. Remove the container once eggs have been laid.You can also place one pint (500 ml) of nesting material on top of an egg carton for burrowing as well.
The nesting container should be 2-3 inches deep so the eggs will not be disturbed.
Check the nesting material every 2 or 3 days to make sure that it has not become dry. You should see eggs in 4-7 days.

, Eggs are a whitish yellow color. Once they have been laid, move them to a different container that is between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If the substrate stays moist, the eggs should hatch in about 10 days.Once the eggs hatch, move them to a rearing container.


If the substrate dries out, your eggs will not hatch.

, The rearing container should have small holes in the lid that are 1 inch apart. Place a water dish in the container and spray it with water every two days. Watch this container more carefully than you watch the breeding container. Keep the crickets in this container until they are ½ inch long. Once they are ½ inch long, you can feed them to your reptile.


For breeding purposes, move some of the crickets to the breeding container when they are ¼ inch long. Adult crickets only live for a few weeks, and you will miss out on the breeding period if you do not set them aside.

Wait until your kitten is several months old.,
Have a female kitten spayed before its first estrus.It is a myth that you should wait until a cat has its first estrus before getting it spayed.,
Consult with your veterinarian.",How to Know if a Kitten Is Old Enough to Neuter or Spay1," There is some debate about when cats should be fixed. Some experts suggest getting a kitten spayed or neutered when the cat is as young as two months old. Others, arguing that cats need more time to develop before removing their sex organs, say that spaying and neutering should occur closer to when the cat is four months old.In general, in an effort to limit pet populations, early spaying and neutering is encouraged. Many veterinarians agree that it is better to spay or neuter your kitten a bit early rather than risking it starting its reproductive cycle and getting impregnated accidentally.;
, Instead, doing it before her first cycle can actually help her health in the future.


Having your kitten fixed before her first estrus minimizes the risk of some health conditions that could pop up in the future, for instance mammary tumors.

, Your veterinarian will have the best idea about when your kitten is ready to be spayed or neutered. Have a discussion with the vet about when the surgery should occur and why the vet believes your kitten is ready.Feel free to ask the veterinarian any questions that you have about the surgery. You should get enough information so that you are secure in your decision to get your cat spayed or neutered.

"

Inspect your cat’s teeth.,
Note your cat’s energy levels.,
Ask your veterinarian.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Still a Kitten2," Another way to tell a kitten from a cat is to look at your cat’s teeth. Up to the age of 6 months the kitten is losing its baby (deciduous) teeth and gaining its adult (permanent teeth). At the age of 3 weeks until the age of six weeks the kitten’s primary (baby or deciduous) teeth are erupting (coming through) the gums. These sharp, thin teeth remain in place until around 3 months of age when the adult (permanent) teeth start to come through the gums. Up to the age of 6 months a kitten will lose its primary teeth and gain its adult teeth.


If your cat is willing, try to open up her mouth a bit and look to see if she has all of her teeth. Note the appearance of the teeth as well. If they appear small and thin, then your cat may still be a kitten. A young adult cat will have very white adult teeth. As the cat ages the teeth will become brown stained and may start accumulating tartar and plaque.

, When cats are growing and changing, their attitude does too. Kittens are known for being very playful, naive, clumsy, and adventurous. While all cats sleep a lot, kittens are often more energetic and alert than adult cats.Keep in mind that some breeds of cat still contain those kitten characteristics in adulthood, while others don't. Many adult cats will be more laid back and calm, or they may not care for as much energetic exercise.

, Your veterinarian may be able to determine your cat’s age based on several features and other indicators such as whether or not your cat has been spayed or neutered. Cats reach puberty between the ages of 4 to 10 months of age.Veterinarians usually advise cat owners to get their cats spayed (females) or neutered (males) at around 5-6 months of age in order to keep them from breeding or becoming pregnant.


Make sure that you make a veterinary appointment for your new cat (or kitten) as soon as possible. No matter what your new pet’s age, he or she will need a check-up to ensure good health.

Consider the benefits to your kitten.,
Consider the benefits to your household.,
Consider the benefits to society.",How to Know if a Kitten Is Old Enough to Neuter or Spay2," There are a variety of health benefits to your kitten if you get it spayed or neutered. These benefits, in spite of the difficulty of surgery, make getting your kitten fixed worth the discomfort it may experience.For example, spayed cats will not suffer from ovarian or uterine cancer, or uterine infections, later in life.

, Getting a kitten spayed or neutered doesn't just affect the cat. It also can have a positive impact on you and your family. For example, spaying and neutering your kitten will eliminate the chances of an accidental pregnancy, which in turn will eliminate the chances of you having to deal with a litter of additional kittens.Spayed and neutered cats are also less likely to fight. This means that in a multi-cat household, female cats that are spayed are more likely to get along and male cats are likely to be less aggressive and less territorial. For male cats, this means they are less likely to spray in your home to mark their territory.

, Stopping your kitten from reproducing in the future helps to limit the pet population overall. Fewer cats that are capable of reproduction means that fewer cats can be produced overall.Also, if you are debating whether or not to have your kitten fixed, just remember that any kittens your kitten has in the future will take homes away from cats that live in shelters and that don't have families. In many cases, these cats are even put down due to a lack of space and resources.

Weigh your kitten.,
Look for physical clues about age.,
Assess your kitten's development.",How to Know if a Kitten Is Old Enough to Neuter or Spay3," If you want to get your kitten spayed or neutered when it is two months old, then look for signs that it is that age. In general, a kitten that is two months old should weigh approximately two pounds, as long as it has had proper nutrition and care.Two pounds is the weight that is required for your kitten to get desexing surgery. Any lighter than that and the veterinarian performing the surgery may be worried about the kitten's ability to survive the surgery.

, If you are not sure how old your kitten is, you can estimate its age by assessing its physical characteristics. Newborn kittens have closed eyes and ears that are tucked against their heads. These clues signal that you have a kitten that it only a few weeks old.However, if your kitten has open eyes and popped up ears but tiny baby teeth, then it is between one and three months old.
A cat that it getting, or already has, its adult teeth is at least four months old.

, A two month old kitten should be fully weaned from its mother. If your kitten is still nursing, then it is probably not yet two months old. If you notice the kitten's mother trying to wean the kitten, for example not letting it nurse, then the kitten is probably between one and one and a half months old.Kittens that are two months old are also working on their paw and eye coordination. If a kitten is playing a lot with toys and getting more daring, then it is probably at least two months old.

Bring your cat inside.,
Create a safe space for your cat.,
Don’t let guests enter the safe space.,
Play soft music to cover up disturbing sounds.,
Consider hanging out with your cat during fireworks.",How to Keep Your Cat Safe on Independence Day2," The best way to keep your cat safe on Independence Day is by bringing it inside. Before any guests arrive, bring your cat inside. This will help prevent your cat from getting spooked and running away as a result of fireworks and other festivities., Designate a room in your house where your cat will hang out during Independence Day celebrations. This room will serve as a comfortable retreat from holiday mayhem. For example, you can designate a room with a door, like a bedroom, as your cat’s safe space.Make sure the space has a litter box, food, water, a bed, and your cat’s favorite toys.

, Once you designate a safe retreat for your cat, you should shut the door and not let guests enter the room. Make sure you inform guests when they arrive that your cat’s safe space is off limits. You can also post a sign on the door., Many cats are afraid of the festive noises that are part of many Independence Day celebrations. Try leaving soft music playing in your cat’s safe space. This will help cover up abrupt and disturbing noises, like fireworks.You can also leave a television on to muffle the sound of fireworks.

, It might be comforting to your cat if you are present while the fireworks are going off. Some cats may want to be pet and comforted, while others might choose to isolate themselves. Do what works best for your cat."

Keep your cat away from bonfires and grills.,
Do not set off fireworks near your cat.,
Keep glow sticks in a safe space.",How to Keep Your Cat Safe on Independence Day3," If your Independence Day celebration includes a bonfire or grill, you will need to make sure your cat stays safe. Keep bonfires and grills in outdoor areas to which your cat does not have access., You should never set off firework near your cat or any other pet. Make sure your cat is safely inside before you or any of your guests decide to set off any type of fireworks., Luminescent necklaces, bracelets, and sticks can be great fun for humans celebrating Independence Day. These novelties contain chemicals that can harm your cat. Make sure these items are stored safely and kept out of your cat’s reach."
"
See if the cat approaches you.,
Approach the cat.,
Determine if the cat is alone.,
Watch its body language.,
Listen to the cat.",How to Know if a Cat Is a Stray1," A cat’s behavior towards people can be a big indicator of whether or not a cat is a stray. Since stray cats have once been socialized, meaning they’ve been around people and most likely lived in a home, they are often not as skittish as feral cats. Stand or sit near the cat and see if it approaches you on its own. If it does, it is probably a stray that is lost.


Crouch down to its level. This may be less intimidating for the cat.
Also pay attention to whether or not the cat approaches houses or cars on its own. Stray cats are more likely to do this.;
, If the cat does not come up to you on its own, try approaching it. It could be the cat is socialized, but is too frightened to come up to you. Try moving toward the cat slowly, all the while talking to it in a soothing voice. If the cat lets you get close or pet it after some coaxing, it is probably a stray., Stray cats will generally be traveling alone, while feral cats often travel as part of a group. Watch to see if the cat is travelling with any other cats. If it is not, it is most likely a stray., A cat’s body language can also give you clues as to whether or not it is a stray. Stray cats will still exhibit similar body language to a domesticated house cat. Look for the following:


Pay attention to how the cat walks. If it walks with its tail in the air, which is a friendly sign, it is probably a stray who has been a housecat at one time or another. However, if it often crawls or stays crouched to the ground, and keeps its tail low as a form of protection, it is probably a feral cat that has never had a home.
Also, a stray cat will probably make eye contact with you while a feral cat will not., The type of vocalizations a cat makes is another way to tell if it is a stray. Stray cats will meow or “answer” you when you speak to them. Depending how long they have been gone from home or on their own, they may even purr when you come near them. Feral cats, on the other hand, don’t usually make any sounds."
"
Initiate a conversation with everyone who you live with.,
Listen to everyone’s concerns.,
Avoid getting a cat if someone objects.,
Be prepared to pay for upfront costs.,
Make sure you can pay for recurring costs.,
Verify you have space.,
Make sure other pets will accept a new cat.,
Commit yourself to the cat’s life.,
Make sure you have time.,
Determine if you can be a cat caretaker.,
Avoid getting a cat if you move frequently.",How to Know if You Are Ready for a Cat," One of the first steps you need to take is to talk to everyone who lives in your household. Without the cooperation and consent of everyone you live with, you won’t be ready to adopt a cat.


Share your plans with your family, significant other, or roommates.
Call a meeting at a time everyone can attend. A good time would be around dinner time on a weekday.
Share your intent to get a cat and some of the specifics, including where the litter box will be, and where you will get the cat.
Keep a dialogue open with your roommates and/or family. They might think of problems after some reflection. In addition, you might also be able to prove to them (by acting responsibly) that you are ready for a cat.;
, Once you’ve shared your intent to get a cat and initiated a conversation about it, you should ask for feedback on the idea. This is important, as the people you live with may have helpful ideas or serious concerns about whether you are ready to get a cat.


Make it clear that you want to hear any thoughts they may have about getting a cat.
Don’t interrupt anyone as they’re sharing their ideas about you getting a cat.
If people bring up substantial concerns, you may want to make a written list of the problems they think will arise from you getting a cat. This way, you can look over the list later and address one concern at a time.

, If any of the people you live with seriously object to you getting a cat, you should not get one. This is important, as the cat will be another member of your household. Bringing a cat into the house should be a decision everyone makes together.


If you live in an apartment that does not allow pets, you should not get a cat. Even if you think you can hide the cat from your landlord, this is not fair to the cat, and could result in fines or even eviction.
If you have a roommate or family member that is allergic to cats, you shouldn’t get one.
If you live at home and your parents say no, this means you are not ready to get a cat. Ultimately, you’ll be ready to get a cat when you are independent of your parents and have your own home.
If someone objects because they think they’ll wind up taking care of the cat, you should reflect on their assertion. What this means is that the person does not believe you are ready to get a cat. You should take that concern seriously., After you’ve talked with your roommates or family and everyone has consented, you need to take stock of whether you have the money to pay for things you’ll need right away. This is important, as cats need a substantial number of items right when you get them. Make sure you can buy:


An adoption or homing fee. This could vary widely, from nothing to several hundred dollars.A water bowl, food bowl, and litter box. Depending on where you get these items, they could run up to $50.
Food and treats for the first few weeks. This should cost $20 to $40 per cat.
A vet exam and the cost of initial vaccinations. This might run you about $150.
If the cat is not spayed or neutered, you will need to budget for surgery. The cost of surgery is typically around $200, but this can vary widely depending on the type of surgery you choose and where you live.

, You’ll also need to make sure you have the money to pay for things you’ll need regularly for your cat. Ultimately, if you don’t have enough income to pay for these necessities, you shouldn’t get a cat. You’ll have to pay for:


Food costs, which may run between $100 and $200 a year, depending on the food you choose.
Litter, which could add up to $200 a year per cat.
Yearly vet exams and vaccinations, which could cost you between $100 and $300.
Parasite treatment and prevention, which is typically $100 to $200 per year.
Toys and treats, which could run up to $100 a year., Many people, especially those in urban areas, may not have the space they need to get a cat. While cats are small and can be very content living indoors, you need to reflect on your circumstances when determining if you are ready to get a cat.


How big is your home? If you live in a 500-square foot apartment in New York City with 2 roommates, squeezing a 4th living being into that space might make it way too tight., You need to make sure that all other pets that live in the home will accept a new cat. This is important, as some pets may be territorial and could react violently to a new pet.


Watch to see how your (or your roommate's or family member's) dog behaves around cats at the vet, a boarding facility, or an animal shelter.
If you, your family, or a roommate already have a pet, ask another friend if they can bring their cat to your house. Watch carefully to see how the pet that already lives in your home behaves around the visiting cat. This can hint at how your pet will behave around a new cat.
It is really important to see how pets behave at home, as that is their territory and they may react differently than if they encountered a new cat outside the home., Before getting a cat, you need to decide if you are committed to caring for that cat for the remainder of its life. This is important, as cats can live a relatively long time. When reflecting on this, remember that:


The average cat will live between 10 and 20 years.
Some breeds have increased longevity. For example, American Shorthairs live between 15 and 20 years.
If you decide to get rid of your cat, it will be very hard for you to find someone to adopt your cat. In many areas, most cats abandoned or dropped off at local animal shelters are euthanized. It is highly unlikely that you will find a caring and loving home for your cat after they’ve grown out of kittenhood., Before getting a cat, you need to take a good look at your life and schedule and make sure you have extra time that you’ll be able to share with a cat. This is important, as you’ll need to play with and socialize your cat.


If you work long hours, like 10 to 14 hours a day, you probably should not get a cat.
If you’re in a transitional time in your life and are busy with an array of work related, academic, or social activities, think before getting a cat., Just because you have time and money for a cat does not necessarily mean you should get one. You also need to make sure you have the right temperament to be a caretaker and pet parent to a cat. When determining this, consider:


Do you get frustrated easily? If so, you should consider the rigors of owning a kitten.
Do you enjoy the affection of animals? You cat is likely to walk up or walk around you for affection at the weirdest times. For instance, they may decide to sit on your keyboard while you are working.
Do you need constant affection or attention from a pet? Your cat may not provide you with constant and unconditional love. In fact, it’s more likely that your cat will only provide you with affection on their terms., If for any reason you move very often, you should think twice before getting a cat. This is important, as there are a wide variety of challenges you'll face as a pet owner who moves all the time. Consider that:


Your cat will undergo a wide variety of moving-related stresses.
You might incur animal boarding or shipping costs.
If you rent an apartment, you'll have to pay extra fees, deposits, and more. For example, a pet fee could cost up to $1,000 depending on the size of your apartment and the region you are moving to."

Most pet owners keep a collar on their cat that has their name and a phone number to call in case the cat is lost. If you think a cat might be a stray, check to see if it is wearing a collar.Just because a cat is not wearing a collar, does not mean it is not a stray. It’s possible the cat lost its collar or was never given one.

, Another clue to whether or not a cat is a stray is its general health. Is the cat skinny and malnourished? Is it injured? Does it seem to be in distress? These can all be indications that the cat is a stray and is unable to find the food or help it needs.These factors can be tough to analyze, however. For example, maybe the cat appears to be well-nourished—you cannot see its ribs and it appears to be at a healthy weight—but it also seems very hungry. It’s possible this is a stray cat that has not been lost very long, but is hungry because it is not used to hunting its own food in the wild.
On the other hand, perhaps you found a cat that seems skinny, but does not act hungry. It’s possible this cat is feral and has always lived outdoors. It does not act hungry because it knows how to find its own food, but it is not as well-nourished as a pet cat would be. Do your best to make a judgment that takes both its appearance and behavior into consideration.

, Stray cats are most likely going to look dirty and disheveled. Since they probably came from a home where they were kept inside and groomed on a regular basis, they probably won’t know how to keep this appearance up on their own. Feral cats’ coats are usually clean and well-kept, despite the fact that they live in the wild., When a cat is spayed or neutered, the doctor sometimes surgically removes the tip of one ear to signify this surgery has already been performed. This is done so that, if the cat becomes lost, it hopefully will not have to go through the trauma of an unnecessary surgery. If the cat you’ve found is missing the tip of one ear, it is possible it is a cat that has a family and is cared for."

Ask around your neighborhood.,
Check for a microchip.,
Attach a paper collar.,
Contact local animal shelters.,
Report the missing cat online.",How to Know if a Cat Is a Stray3," The only sure way to know whether or not a cat is a stray is to find its owner. A stray cat may not be far from its home. Attempt to locate its owner by asking your neighbors if they have lost a cat or know anyone who has.It may help to take a picture of the cat along with you.
Posting a photo of the cat and a location where it was found on social media can also help you find the owner. This method will allow you to reach a bigger audience in much less time than going door-to-door.
In addition, you can create a “found” poster with the cat’s picture and contact number to call if anyone recognizes the cat.

, If you are able to safely catch the cat, take it to a veterinarian to have them scan the cat for a microchip. If the cat is implanted with a microchip, it will have information about the owner and how to contact them., It is also possible that the owner of the stray cat doesn’t know it has been wandering. In this situation, it can be helpful to attach a paper collar to the cat, if possible, that includes a message like, “This cat has been visiting me lately. Please contact me if it belongs to you.” Be sure to include your phone number or email address so the person can reach you. If the cat wanders around during the day but returns home at night, this will let the owner know what it is doing.


Don’t leave the paper collar on for an extended period of time because it could be irritating to the cat. If you haven’t received any calls within a few days of placing it on the cat, remove it if the cat will allow you., Check with the animal shelters in your area to see if anyone has called about a missing cat recently. If someone has, they may be able to give you the person’s contact information or contact them on their own to try and reunite the owner and cat.


It is also a good idea to leave a description of the cat, where it was found, and your contact information with each shelter so they can get in touch with you if someone calls looking for a cat that matches your description.

, There are also online resources, like PetsLocated.com, that help reunite owners with their lost pets. This site has a “lost” database and a “found” database and it continually cross references the two to try and match up any pets that have been reported lost and also found. Enter the information you have about the cat on this database to help find the owner."

Look for the stray cat's identification.",How to Keep a Stray Cat Away from Your Cat," Bird feeders can be as popular for stray cats as they are for birds.A stray cat may see those bird feeders as a way to attack readily available prey. If you have multiple bird feeders, you may be attracting more than one stray cat to your yard, which could be very distressing to your cat.;
, If your cat is exclusively outdoors and you feed him outside, you could be attracting stray cats to your yard. Not only would the stray cat want to keep coming back for the food, he would likely fight your cat for access to the food, which could place your cat at risk of serious injury and illness. Additionally, if you grow catnip in your yard, you could be making your yard very attractive to a stray cat., If you have a female cat that has not been spayed, she could be attracting intact male cats to your yard.Your female cat would be giving off pheromones that an intact male cat would be able to smell. If you know that your female cat is not spayed, and you notice that male stray cats are on the prowl in your yard, schedule an appointment to have your cat spayed as soon as possible.


If your intact female cat comes into contact with an intact male stray cat, your cat could become pregnant.

, The stray cat may frequent a particular area of your yard, such as a garden or sandbox. He may also like to go to an area under your house that is warm and safe. If you can identify where the stray cat likes to go, then you can start coming up with ways to keep him out of those particular areas.


If keeping an eye out on the stray cat is not practical for your schedule, you could also observe how your cat is acting. If your cat starts to spray inside your house, either at the window or on the wall near the opposite window, it is likely that a stray cat is visiting your yard.Take notice if your cat becomes increasingly aggressive at you or other pets in your home (called ‘redirected aggression’) if he cannot actually get to the stray cat outside.Your cat may also become fearful inside your home if a stray cat is outside. Even though you know that the stray cat has no chance of entering your home, your cat does not know that and may resort to hiding inside the house., If the stray cat comes to your yard because he knows that your cat is in the yard as well, you should keep your cat indoors. Stray cats tend not to be fully vaccinated and can carry a variety of diseases (e.g., feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus) that could make your cat very sick, so it is primarily for safety and health reasons that you should keep your cat inside.Keep in mind that the stray may continue to come to your yard, since he knows your cat is somewhere in the vicinity.
If your cat is used to being outdoors, provide him with plenty of toys inside your home that will keep him busy and mentally stimulated.If your cat is outdoors, the techniques needed to keep a stray cat away from your cat may startle and disturb your cat. This is another reason why you should keep your cat indoors, at least until you are confident that the stray cat will not come back.

, One of the best ways to keep a stray cat away from your cat is to make your yard as undesirable as possible to him. A motion-activated sprinklers are available that are specifically designed to deter animals. The sprinkler will spray water on the stray cat when he walks near it. You could place the sprinkler where you usually see the stray enter your yard. After a few of days of getting splashed on unexpectedly, the stray cat will probably stay away from your property.


You can remove the sprinkler or spray after you notice that the stray cat is no longer coming to your yard. You should put the motion-activated devices back in your yard if he returns or if you see a different stray cat in your yard.

, Outdoor ultrasonic devices work in a similar way to a motion-activated sprinkler or spray. When the stray cat steps near it, the device will emit a high frequency sound that will you will not be able to hear, but will be very irritating to him. He may be more annoyed than startled at the sound, but the sound may be irritating enough to keep him out of your yard.


If you notice that the ultrasound device is bothersome to your own cat, consider using another type of deterrent device or another method to keep the stray cat away.

, A stray cat may treat your garden like a litter box. If you do not want to spend money on deterrent devices to keep him out of your garden, you can use what you already have at home to keep him out. To make your garden undesirable, you can put chicken wire or prickly pinecones in it to make it more difficult for the stray cat to walk through or dig in. The chicken wire can be placed either on top of the soil or just below the surface.


If you use chicken wire, make sure to cut holes in the wire that are large enough for your plants to continue growing.Cats do not like the smell of citrus, so you could also place lemon or orange peels in your garden. However, the peels could attract other wild animals to your garden, so you might end up replacing one animal problem by another.You can also sprinkle ground pepper (black pepper plus chili pepper) or coffee grounds on your annuals or perennials to keep a stray cat out of your garden.Diluted ammonia (1 part ammonia plus 9 parts water) may also keep the stray cat out of your garden. It may be a good idea to test spray some plants to see if they can withstand the solution.Try planting ‘cat-repellent’ plants, such as Coleus canina, in your garden. These plants produce a foul odor that will keep the stray cat out of your garden.Inquire about these types of plants at your local gardening store to find out if the smell is also bothersome to people.
You could also make your own cat repellent.

, If you have a sandbox in your yard, you should cover it securely to keep the stray cat from using it as a litter box.Make sure to use a covering that the stray cat cannot easily scratch or tear through, such as tarp. Visit your local home improvement store to purchase a durable material with which to cover the sandbox.

, A stray cat may keep coming back to your yard because he has found a safe area under your porch or deck where he could comfortably hide. Installing chicken wire or latticework could be very effective in preventing the stray cat from making a home under your house.If you do not have already have these materials at home, you can purchase them at your local home improvement store.

, Bird feeders and catnip can attract stray cats to your yard.If you really enjoy having birds come to your yard but do not want to remove the bird feeders, you may have to invest in a fence to keep stray cats and other animals in your yard. This could be a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor, so removing the bird feeders would be the easier and less expensive solution.

, Before attempting to trap the stray cat, try approaching him to if he is safe to get near and physically handle. If he is approachable, then you can purchase a humane trap at your local animal store and set it up in a part of your yard that has plenty of shade. Even with the stray cat being approachable, you should still contact your local animal control or feline rescue organization for instructions on how to safely trap him.Do not attempt to trap the stray cat if you cannot safely approach him. If you cannot get near him without him trying to attack you, contact your local animal control or feline rescue organization to remove him from your yard. A terrified stray cat can inflict serious injury on you, so you do not want to put yourself in danger.If you are going to trap him yourself, make sure that you are wearing thick gloves and long sleeves.If you do not have thick gloves already, you can purchase them at your local hardware store or home improvement store.
When the stray cat is trapped in the cage, immediately take him to your local animal control center. If you are not comfortable picking up the cage, contact the local animal control to pick it up for you.
Placing the cage in the shade would keep the stray cat out of direct sunlight, in case a long period of time passes between him being trapped and being transported to the animal control center.

, If you are able to approach the stray cat, check to see if he has a collar. If he has one, check the identification tag for the owner’s name and contact information. If you are able to touch him, check to see if has a microchip,which is another way to identify and contact his owner.

Consider a HEPA filter.,
Clean the house regularly.,
Switch out carpets and drapes for allergy-friendly home furnishings.,
Wash your hands after touching your cat.,
Use a dander-reducing solution on your cat weekly.,
Take OTC allergy medication regularly.,
Consider allergy shots.",How to Keep a Cat if You Are Allergic to Cats," You likely spend at least a third of your day in your bedroom sleeping. By keeping your cat out of your room, you will greatly reduce your overall exposure to cat allergens. Keep the door to your bedroom shut when you are gone, and ensure that your cat’s toys and food are located elsewhere in the house., HEPA filters are high-powered air-particle filters that can remove microscopic pet dander from the air. Place HEPA filters in the rooms you spend the most time in at home, such as your bedroom or home office, to reduce your exposure to allergens. Most HEPA filters are rated to clean a certain number of cubic feet (or meters). Aim to buy a HEPA filter the filtering capacity of which matches the size of your room., Cat hair, which is covered in allergenic saliva, and cat dander are shed in your house constantly. To keep your allergies under control, clean your house at least once a week to reduce the number of allergens in the environment. If possible, it is preferable to hire someone without allergies to clean your house, as sweeping and vacuuming can dust allergens up into the air and aggravate allergy symptoms.If you allow your cat in your bed, wash your sheets in hot water twice a week.
Certain vacuums, such as the Eureka Sanitaire True HEPA and the Sunpentown V8506 with HEPA, have HEPA filters, which can remove even more allergenic particles from the air. It may be worth investing in one if your allergies are severe.

, Cat dander is microscopic and can be difficult to draw out of rugs, drapes and upholstered surfaces even with regular cleaning. Wood, stone, and metal furnishings are all easier to clean fully than fabric surfaces. By swapping rugs for hardwoods or tile, and choosing non-upholstered chairs, you can reduce the amount of pet dander in your home., Your cat licks itself clean, which means its hair is covered in allergenic saliva. After touching your cat, be sure to wash your hands with soap and warm water, scrubbing for at least 30 seconds. This is especially important before you touch your face, which is particularly sensitive to allergens., Certain dander-reducing solutions, such as Allerpet and Nature’s Miracle Allergen Blocker, cleanse your cat and can remove some allergy-causing dander. Wet a small washcloth with the cleaner and wipe your cat’s face and body, going with the direction of the fur rather than against it. If your cat will tolerate being cleaned like this, these solutions have been shown to reduce surface dander by up to 50%., Taking an allergy medication, such as Benadryl or Claritin, can reduce allergy symptoms. One to two pills of Benadryl can be taken every 4-6 hours, and one pill of Claritin can be taken once daily. These medications block your body’s histamine reaction, which is what makes your eyes water and skin itchy in response to cat dander.If your allergies are severe, it may make sense to have a consultation with an allergist to see if prescription allergy medication is right for you.

, If you have your heart set on having a cat despite your allergies, allergy shots can actually reduce how allergic you are to cats. These shots are made from a serum of cat allergens and injected into the upper arm at incrementally increasing doses over a number of weeks until you reach a maintenance dose, which you can receive monthly. The shots increase your tolerance for cat allergens, effectively reducing your symptoms. You will need to be tested for your allergy by an allergist, who will mix an injection serum specifically for you.It often takes up to 6 months of regular injections for allergy shots to take effect. They also work better for some people than for others.
Make an appointment with an allergist to discuss your options and if allergy shots are right for you.

Providing safe toys will help dissuade cats from going for more dangerous items, but the best bet is to secure unsafe items away from the cat’s reach. Your best bet is to check any warnings on the packaging to see if they recommend against unsupervised play., In addition to allowing for movement, this allows the cat to control the motion, unlike with a laser toy or a toy that constricts the movement to a specific space. The cat can bat toy mice or little balls across the room and then chase them. It also helps if some of the toys are ones that cat can carry. This will help the cat live out its natural prey drive, and keep it entertained when it's home alone., Some toys are designed to challenge a cat before dispensing a treat.

Use these guidelines to determine the kittens’ age:Kittens less than two weeks old will have closed eyes and folded down ears.
Kittens between two and three weeks old will have open eyes and wobble or crawl.
Kittens between three and four weeks will have open eyes, erect ears, and can walk.
Kittens older than four weeks can run and most likely won’t require nesting.;
, If you’ve found a litter of wet orphaned kittens, thoroughly dry them with a towel as soon as possible. If the kittens are wet, they’re at a greater risk of developing hypothermia.If the kittens are at least a week old, you can use a blow dryer on a low setting to dry them. Make sure the air stream isn’t hot and avoid blowing the kitten’s face. It’s not recommended to use a blow dryer on kittens less than one week old.

, Touch the kittens’ ears, inside their mouths, and the pads of their feet. If any of these feel cool to the touch, that kitten’s body temperature is too low.If you have a baby or small pet rectal thermometer, you can also take the kittens’ temperatures. They should be between 101 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 to 38.9 degrees Celsius)., If a kitten is chilled, you’ll need to warm it promptly but gradually. Hold it against your bare skin and periodically rub it with your hands to raise its temperature slowly.If possible, have someone put a towel in the dryer on low heat for 10 minutes while you hold the kitten. Once the towel is warm, wrap the kitten with it.
Avoid submerging the kitten in hot water or taking any other measures to warm it too quickly.

, It’s essential to only feed a kitten once you’ve increased its body temperature. Feeding a kitten with a temperature less than 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) can be life-threatening.A kitten can’t digest food if it’s chilled. If necessary, you can syringe feed it a few drops of 5% sugar water or rub a bit of Karo syrup on its lips."

Create a nest by lining a cardboard box with towels or a blanket.,
Heat one side of the box with a heating pad.,
Keep the heating pad on low and wrap it well.,
Monitor the nest’s ambient temperature.",How to Keep Orphaned Kittens Warm2," Line the bottom of a high-sided cardboard box with clean, dry towels or a blanket. Keep the box away from drafts, air conditioning vents, or other sources of cool air.Cardboard is an insulator, so it makes a great kitten nest.
Change the bedding at least daily to maintain a clean environment.

, Place half of the box onto a heating pad. You can also place the heating pad in the box beneath the bedding. Your goal is to create a heated zone in half of the box and a cooler zone in the other half.The kittens will move from one side of the box to the other to warm or cool themselves.

, It’s best to use a heating pad specially designed for pets.If you don’t have a pet heating pad, you can use one meant for humans as long as you ensure it won’t burn the kittens. Keep it on a low setting and wrap it securely with a thick towel to make sure the kittens can’t access the pad itself.Check the pad and its wrapping regularly to make sure it’s not too hot.

, You should routinely check the nest’s temperature using an air thermometer. The ideal ambient temperature for kittens up to two weeks old is around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 30 degrees Celsius). Ambient nest temperature for three and four week old kittens should be between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius).Keep the kittens in the nest and routinely monitor the ambient temperature for four to five weeks."

Use power cord covers.,
Spray deterrents on your electrical cords.,
Wrap cords in aluminum foil.,
Block access to cords with furniture.,
Store appliances when not in use.",How to Keep Cats Safe from Electrical Shock1," Cord covers are heavy, plastic tubing that encase your electrical cords. The covers are too hard to bite or scratch through, which will ensure your cat can’t make contact with the electrical current inside. Simply guide your appliance’s cord through the cover’s opening and plug in as normal. The tubing also comes in many widths so you can bundle several cords together or just protect a single cord.Cord covers come in a variety of colors to match your home décor.;
, Many deterrent sprays, such as Grannick’s Bitter Apple, have an off-putting taste to discourage your cat from chewing. Unplug your devices and spray the solution on a washcloth. Rub the length of each cord with the cloth so it is coated fully, avoiding the plug., Many cats find the noise and texture of aluminum foil unpleasant. To deter your cat from playing with or chewing on your electrical cords, wrap them in aluminum foil. You can secure the foil around the cords with tape as necessary., The easiest way to keep your cat away from your electrical cords is to restrict access entirely. Use furniture in your home to block access to dangling power cords. It may be helpful to get down on the floor at cat level to see which cords are accessible from the ground. You can use painters’ tape to secure excess cord length to the wall behind your furniture., While some items are always plugged in, others, such as counter-top kitchen appliances, can be stored when not in use. Make an effort to unplug and store such items to keep the cords from enticing your cat."

Fill a small glass jar halfway full with rubbing alcohol.,
Find a dead insect.,
Identify and label your insect.,
Carefully put the insect in the jar.,
Fill the jar the rest of the way with rubbing alcohol.",How to Preserve Insects1," The rubbing alcohol will preserve the body of the insect and prevent it from decaying, drying out, or breaking into pieces. The jar should be larger than the insect, but not unnecessarily so. If you put a small insect in a large jar, you’ll waste rubbing alcohol.


Most rubbing alcohol is a 70% solution—this should work well for preserving your insects. Stronger rubbing alcohol—at 80 or 85%--is also appropriate, as some insects are better preserved with a stronger alcohol.Examples of insects that should be preserved in stronger alcohol include: spiders, scorpions, earthworms, and small insects including lice and silverfish.Make sure that the glass jar has a tight-fitting lid, and does not have any cracks.;
, Keep in mind that soft-bodied insects are most commonly preserved in alcohol. The insect could come from anywhere: a window inside your house, the environment near where you live, or even from a nearby spider’s web. You’ll want to preserve an insect that is still in decent shape. If the insect has been dead for days and is already decaying and breaking apart, preserving it will be less effective.


You can also trap insects yourself through a variety of methods: for example, catching moths and butterflies in a butterfly net.While some would object to the ethics of killing insects simply to preserve them, traps are an effective way to make sure you have dead insects available.

, When preserving insects, it’s important to know which specific species you are dealing with. This is an especially important part of the procedure if you are preserving insects for scientific purposes. The label should include: the genus and species of the insect, the date and location on which the insect was found, and the name of the collector.Tape the completed label to the outside of the alcohol-filled jar.


There are many helpful websites that can help you identify the dead insect.Start by checking BugGuide.net or InsectIdentification.org. If these sites aren’t helpful, try to contact a local entomologist.

, Be delicate, and handle the insect carefully: its body will be very fragile and could easily be crushed. It’s best if you handle the insect with forceps or a pair of tweezers, as your fingers could break or damage part of the insect.If the insect has a stinger (bees, wasps) or is otherwise poisonous, wear latex gloves when handling the body.

, Only do this once the body of the insect has settled to the bottom of the jar. Pour the rest of the alcohol in slowly. If you pour too fast, the liquid may damage or break the insect’s body.


Close and seal the jar, then store it in a safe location. If you’re planning on starting a large insect collection, it may be prudent to dedicate an entire tabletop to the jars.
Store the insect jars far from food, children, and animals.

Keep your cat indoors.,
Use outlet protectors.,
Ensure wiring is up to code.",How to Keep Cats Safe from Electrical Shock2," It is generally always safer for your cat to be indoors than outdoors. Cats in rural areas can come upon electric fences intended for livestock, and cats in cities can come across downed power lines or stray voltage from leaking utilities. If you want to let your cat outside, do so in a fenced backyard and supervise them to ensure their safety., Curious cats may scratch at wall outlets. While shock from this is a more minor risk, you can buy outlet protectors for peace of mind. These plastic covers—often intended for baby proofing—have prongs that plug into your outlet much like a normal plug, blocking access to the current., Faulty electrical wiring is a hazard to both you and your cat. If any wiring in your home looks suspect, perhaps tinkered with by a DIY-inclined previous homeowner, call an electrician to have it examined for safety. Always get your electrical work performed by a licensed electrician.


Signs of faulty wiring include flickering, buzzing or dimming lights, or excessive circuit-breaker trips.If there are any exposed wires in your home, cover the areas with coated electrical tape until you can call an electrician.

Fill a jar 2/3 full with hand sanitizer.,
Place your dead insect in the hand sanitizer.,
Boil the jars to remove air bubbles.,
Fill the jar completely full with hand sanitizer.",How to Preserve Insects2," Much like rubbing alcohol, the hand sanitizer will preserve the insect’s body and keep it from breaking or decaying. However, unlike alcohol, the thick consistency of hand sanitizer will suspend the dead insect, making for a more attractive display and facilitating easier viewing.Use a jar that is large enough to contain the suspended insect, but that will not require a wasteful amount of hand sanitizer to fill.

, Avoid handling the insect directly; use a pair of forceps or tweezers to pick the body up.Gently press the insect’s body down into the hand sanitizer, until it is suspended in the gel.

If you’re suspending a delicate insect, such as a bee or wasp, take care not to break the wings or body when pressing it into the gel.
Larger hard-bodied insects—such as butterflies—may be difficult to preserve in hand sanitizer, since the gel may snap off part of the body. While it’s OK to preserve other hard-bodied insects in hand sanitizer, look for ones that do not have delicate protruding wings or antennae.

, To remove the unsightly air bubbles from the hand sanitizer, fill a sauce pan with 1–2 inches (2.5–5 centimeters) of water. Boil the water, and place the jars (still 2/3 full of hand sanitizer, with the insect on top) into the boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes.Remember to leave the lid off of the jar, or it will explode.

Avoid getting water into the jars, as it could weaken or dissolve the hand sanitizer.
Many will consider the air bubbles aesthetically unpleasant and a distraction from observing the preserved insect. If you are not bothered by the air bubbles in the hand sanitizer, you can skip this step.

, Once you have removed the jar from the boiling water and let it cool to room-temperature, pour or pump the hand sanitizer gel over the insect’s body until the jar is full. Once the jar is full, you can reach into the jar with tweezers or forceps to reposition the insect’s body until it’s displayed in the desired pose. Place a label on the outside of the jar, screw on the lid, and the preservation is complete.

These jars can be handled by children (with adult supervision) and are excellent for museums or outreach events."

Look for a spotted coat.,
Notice the dark markings on the face.,
Study the head.,
Look for a medium-sized muscular body.",How to Identify an Ocicat1," Ocicats are known for their signature spots. The spots may be in tawny, chocolate, blue, lavender, cinnamon, or fawn colors. The spots cover the entire body. The spots will appear dark on a lighter colored coat. The spots make this breed seem like a wild and exotic cat.The coat is short, tight, and satiny.;
, In addition to spots, the Ocicat has dark markings on the face. They have black lines around their eyes and on their cheeks. They also have black lines over their eyes and forehead that resembles the letter M., The Ocicat has a wedge-shaped head. Their ears are large and triangular with tufts of hair coming from the inside. The eyes are large and almond-shaped, and angle upward slightly.The eyes may be any color except for blue.

, This breed is muscular and graceful, with a medium to large-sized body. They usually weigh between six to fifteen pounds. Their limbs are very powerful and strong and they generally have sleek bodies with proportionally sized heads.They also have many long features, such as a long body, long legs, and long tails with a dark tip.

Purchase insect pins and mounting foam.,
Impale the insect’s body on the pin.,
Create a label for the insect.,
Mount the insect and label on the foam.",How to Preserve Insects3," Insect pins are a specific variety of push-pin, made of tempered steel and are typically 3.5 centimeters (1.4 inches) in length. They are quite thin, to avoid damaging the insect’s body. Any type of foam should work to mount insects, as long as the foam is dense (so that the pinned insect won’t fall over).Both insect pins and mounting foam (or cork) can be purchased at a hobby store or through a biological supply company, such as BioQuip. Pins and mounting foam can also be purchased through online retailers, including Amazon.
It’s also common to mount insects on cork instead of foam.

, It’s most effective to preserve hard-bodied insects—including beetles and cockroaches—by pinning. Stick the pin through the thorax (middle section) of your dead insect. Insert the pin until it is roughly 2/3 through the insect’s body; the idea is to be able to pick up and handle the pin without touching the insect.If you’re pinning a beetle, insert the pin through the middle of the right wing sheath., Determine the insect’s genus and species, and print these clearly on a slip of paper. Also note the location and date on which the insect was found, and the individual who collected the specimen. Some collectors also note the environment from which the insect was collected: feeding on a leaf, found under a log, etc., Simply press the pin down into the foam, until it is about half an inch (1.3 centimeters) deep. Be careful not to disturb or break the insect’s body in this process.Then, using tape or small push-pins, affix the label just below the pinned insect.

If you plan to develop a large collection of pinned insects, you may wish to start with a large piece of foam or cork, so the collection has room to expand.
Protect the pinned insects by storing it in a cabinet or a set of drawers, or even by placing the pinned insects in a wooden cigar box."

Expect an active cat.,
Look for intelligence.,
Anticipate a friendly cat.",How to Identify an Ocicat2," Ocicats are very active. They are muscular and athletic and love to play. They like to climb to high surfaces, play with their owners, and amuse themselves with toys. They do not do well left alone all day without any physical activity.They are often possessive with their toys and will try to keep them away from you if you try to put them up.

, Ocicats are a very intelligent breed. They can learn tricks easily. They will play fetch, learn to come when called, and can even be taught to walk on a leash. Ocicats are known to change unwanted behavior, like jumping on counters, when told no and given an alternative, like a stool to sit on.This breed loves playing with puzzle toys.

, Ocicats are a very friendly breed. They are not independent cats who like to be left alone. They like to interact with people, including strangers. They want to be involved in anything that you do, from travelling to cooking dinner.Ocicats love sitting in your lap and even will let you carry them around. They don’t like being left alone since they are so social. They are very vocal and will use their voice to get your attention.
This cat does well with other cats, dogs, and children.

Buy one through a breeder.,
Adopt an Ocicat.,
Be patient.",How to Identify an Ocicat3," If you want to get a cat from a breeder, make sure to choose a reputable breeder. Respectable breeders will raise the litters at home and will socialize them properly. Reputable breeders for this breed are usually members of Breed Clubs or Breed Councils.Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Cat Fanciers’ Association, The Fanciers Breeder Referral List, and The International Cat Association.
If you visit breeder websites, watch for red flags of an unethical breeder. Red flags include kittens that are immediately available, the breeder having multiple litters, paying online with a credit card, and your choice of any kitten.
Make sure to choose a breed that has done health certification screening for genetic problems. Ocicats can be at risk for certain health issues, including kidney diseases (renal amyloidosis and pyruvate kinase disease), heart disease (hypertropic cardiomyopathy), and gingivitis., Consider adopting or rescuing an Ocicat. Try rescue organizations, such as The Ocicat rescue through the Breed Council. You can also try pet adoption websites, like Petfinder.


You may also check your local shelter to see if you can find one.

, Finding your perfect Ocicat may take time. Most breeders make the Ocicat available to buy after 14 weeks, when the kittens have been spayed or neutered, had basic inoculations, and developed enough physical and social stability for a new home. Make sure to search all avenues when looking for an Ocicat before deciding whether you are want to adopt or rescue an adult cat or get a kitten from a breeder."

Look for small, worm-like larvae.,
Identify common beetles and understand their role in the ecosystem.",How to Identify Beetles,";
, The exoskeleton protects most of their bodies. While its primary function is defensive, the exoskeleton also is the most distinctive feature for identification of different beetle species.

, Most adult beetles are either black or brown, but some are brightly colored. One of the most brilliantly colored is the jewel beetle. The complex cell structure of its exoskeleton reflects light at different wavelengths, enabling the beetle to appear red, yellow or green, depending on the angle it is being view from. Many other species are single, bright colors, ranging from blue to orange. Others, like the fire-colored beetle, have a splash of red on their distinctive necks.

, Many beetles have patterns on their exoskeletons that aid in identification. Some, however, are very similar to other species. The common ladybug, for example, has an orange shell with black spots. The milkweed has the same pattern on its exoskeleton. The two creatures can easily be distinguished from one another by other characteristics, including shape and pigmentation of the head.

, This reveals secondary wings capable of flight.

, Beetles in flight are easily distinguished from other insects, like flies. Beetles often fly noisily, stay near the ground, and seem to have trouble steering.

, Beetles often have large heads with mandibles, visible to the naked eye. Their jaws are powerful and are used for grasping prey or tearing at predators. Some, like the stag beetle, are named because of the distinctive shape of their jaws. (Its pincers look very much like antlers). Inside beetle jaws are smaller mouth parts that actually ingest nourishment.

, Most people think of beetles as large, shiny insects that are frequently seen foraging for food during summer months. But beetles spend a significant portion of their lifespans in the larval stage of development. Like adults, larvae are dissimilar in appearance from one beetle species to the next. At first glance, beetle larvae probably resemble worms more than the typical concept of beetles. But upon closer examination, you can see the distinctive characteristics of beetle larvae, including hard, well-developed heads with mouth parts, and distinct thorax and abdomen segments. Other features of common beetle larvae include:


Grubs: Grubs, sometimes called grub worms, have tan heads and fleshy, white bodies. They are found in rotting wood and sod, where they feed voraciously. After moving to the pupal stage of their life cycles, in which they neither move nor feed, grubs emerge as adult scarab beetles.
Wireworms and mealworms: These beetle larvae are light brown, narrow and segmented. Wireworms feed on roots and develop into click beetles; mealworms thrive on farming chaff and become darkling beetles.
Wood borers: The larvae of these types of beetles are found under loose tree bark. The larvae are legless and have broad bodies that are either plump or flat. Round-headed larvae eventually become long-horned beetles.
Leaf beetle larvae: These types are named for the host plant they feed on. (e.g., elm leaf beetle, Colorado potato beetle, Mexican bean beetle). They tend to be fleshy and soft-bodied. Like all beetle larvae, they feed constantly to store nutrients for the pupal phase of their life cycles, which is the key development stage to adulthood. These pests are of extreme concern to the farming industry, as they destroy massive amounts of crops every year.

, By developing a basic understanding of the characteristics of beetles, you can learn to identify types that thrive in your area. Some are pests that pose major economic threats, but many others perform vital functions in the ecosystem. Some of the most common beetles in North America are:


Ladybugs: Plentiful across most of North America, ladybugs are perhaps the most recognizable of all beetles, and one of the most beneficial. Bright orange with black dots, ladybugs eat plant-destroying aphids, making them welcome visitors to gardeners and farmers. They sometimes are confused with red milkweed beetles, which have orange exoskeletons and four black dots. The similarities end there, however. Milkweed beetles are long and cylindrical and, unlike ladybugs, have orange heads.
Dung beetles: Dung beetles perform an important ecological function by feeding on undigested material in animal feces and reintegrating compounds into the soil. They often are colorful, ranging from copper to metallic green. Some species live inside dung, breaking the substance down to further biodegradability. Others roll or tunnel under piles, and suck nutritious moisture from the substance.
Weevils: There are about sixty thousand species of weevils, which are some of the most destructive beetles in the world. Wheat weevils devour grain in both the field and storage facilities. Boll weevils eradicate cotton flowers. Because of their destructive capabilities, scientists strive to understand all phases of their development so that they can be controlled. Given the number of species, their physical characteristics vary widely, but all have distinctive snouts that enable them to suck nutrients from plants. Weevils have another unique structural design that covers the entire family. Entomologists have discovered that weevils have screw-like designs on their legs that enable them to climb and cling to plants more effectively. They are smaller than most of their counterparts, usually reaching lengths of only seven millimeters or one sixteenth of an inch.
Common black ground beetle: Perhaps the most abundant beetle, the common black ground beetle, inhabits a wide variety of locales searching for prey. They usually are about a half-inch or one and three-quarter centimeters in length. They feed on soft-bodied creatures like maggots and grubs, so they have a significant role in pest control. One noteworthy trait of this type of beetle is, it doesn't fly.

Inspect their shape.,
Examine their color.,
Measure them.",How to Identify Termite Larvae1," Larvae have soft bodies instead of a hard, outer shell. They have a distinct head from the rest of their body as well as six legs. Their antennae are straight.Termite larvae tend to look extremely similar to worker and nymph termites, except for their size. Larvae are much smaller than workers and nymphs.
Termites may resemble ants, but where ants’ bodies have a narrow waist, termites’ bodies are smooth and straight. Termites also have straight antennae where ants have bent antennae.;
, Termite larvae tend to be white and almost translucent in their color. Keep in mind that older worker and nymph termites also have similar pale coloring, so color alone cannot determine if it is a larva or not.If they have pale, white bodies but darker heads, they may be soldier termites. These are adult termites.
If they have a darker color, such as brown or black, they may be booklice or ants instead. If they have wings, they may be reproductive termites.

, Most termite larvae are less than 1/10 of an inch (2.5 mm) long. In comparison, an adult worker termite is usually around ¼ inch (6.4 mm) long. Some reproductive termites, known as alates, can grow to be half an inch (13 mm) large, but if the insect is larger than this, they may not be a termite at all.Termite larvae are about the same size as the eggs they emerge from. These eggs are very small and white. They may be difficult to find, as they are kept deep within the colony. That said, if you find some termites near a pile of eggs, you can compare the size. If they’re roughly the same size, you’ve found larvae."
"
Identify adult termites.,
Inspect areas where termites live.,
Listen to the walls.,
Break open mud tubes.,
Hire an exterminator.",How to Identify Termite Larvae2," If you find mature termites, there are probably larvae somewhere in the colony. While there are a few different types of adult termite, you can typically identify them by their pale, soft bodies. Worker and nymph termites look like larger versions of the larvae while soldiers have a dark, hardened head. Only the reproductive termites that lay eggs have wings.

, While you may need a professional exterminator to find most termites, you can do a basic check inspection to see if you can notice any signs of infestation. Start by inspecting window sills, window and door frames, support beams, and places where concrete structures join wooden ones. You should also check in the basement, in crawl spaces, and under the porch. Use a flashlight to peer into cracks and dark spaces.


Note that termites often live deep within the walls, and they can infest a home for years without being noticed. Just because there are no external signs of termites does not mean that you do not have them.

, Using a screwdriver, gently tap the wood or surface of a wall. Listen for any hollow or rustling noises coming from inside the wood. This may indicate that there is something living inside the wood., Termites may build mud tubes to travel between areas of their colony. These may look like branches or lines of mud crawling up the wall or foundation. You can break a tube open to see if there are any termites inside. Note that if a tube is empty, it may still mean that there are termites elsewhere in the building., Termites can live deep within a structure, and they often keep their larvae within the most protected parts of their nest. To measure the extent of the problem, you should consult with a professional pest control company. They will be able to tell you if you have termites or another pest. They can also identify the larvae for you.


When in doubt, the best way to know what type of larva or insect is infesting your home is to catch a few in a glass jar. Show them to an exterminator or local pest expert.

"
Compare ants and termite larvae.,
Learn to identify psocids or booklice.,
Determine if wood damage was caused by beetles instead.,
Make sure they are not maggots.",How to Identify Termite Larvae3," As adults, termites and ants can be easily confused.That said, the larvae of the two species are very different. If you’re uncertain if you have termites or ants, try to inspect the larvae if you can find them.


Termite larvae look like a smaller version of the adult worker and nymph termites; they have a separate segmented head, legs, and antennae.Ant larvae look like grubs. They have no legs or eyes, nor do they appear to have a separate, segmented head. They are also covered in tiny hairs., Like termite larvae, psocids (also known as booklice) are small and white. That said, booklice only grow between 1/16 and 1/8 of an inch long (between 1.6 and 3.2 mm). They do not feed on wood; rather, they eat the fungus that grows on wood, books, and other starchy objects in moist environments.If you do not have any damage to the wood or other signs of termites, you may have found psocids instead of termite larvae. To be sure, take a few insects in to your local pest control.
Places where psocids are found include books, newspapers, moldy foods and grains, old wallpaper, cardboard boxes, and other paper products. In comparison, termites are often found in walls, wood piles, stumps, crawl spaces, and other wooden areas.

, Termites are not the only insect to feed on wood. Powderpost beetles look distinctively different than termites. They have darker, harder bodies, and some may be covered with fine hairs. Powderpost larvae are white and C-shaped. They have tiny spines along their back.The best way to know if you have powderpost beetles or termites is to hire an exterminator. They may be able to identify the pest based on the pattern of damage they leave behind.

, Maggots are another type of larva, but they grow into flies instead of termites. Like termites, they are white with soft bodies. That said, unlike termite larvae, maggots do not have a distinct head or if they do, it is not visible. They may have legs, but the rest of their body is shaped like a tube.Maggots are often found in rotting material, such as old food or decaying plants.

Notice if your cat seems to have a small stature or does not seem to be developing as it gets older. A cat with liver shunts may also be underweight, partly due to a lack of appetite.You may need to compare your cat’s weight and size to the standard weight and size of its breed. You can also bring your cat into the vet to determine if it has stunted growth, possibly due to liver shunts.;
, Another common physical symptom of liver shunts is seizures and swaying around. Your cat may sway around as if drunk or imbalanced, often after eating its food. It may also circle, pace, or stumble around when it walks. These are all possible signs of liver shunts.A cat who has liver shunts may stare vacantly and appear disoriented and lethargic.

, If your cat has liver shunts, it may not be able to urinate at all or strain to urinate. Alternatively, it may urinate and defecate too often. If your cat is urinating, you may notice blood in its urine. This is a possible sign of liver shunts.You may also notice that your cat has diarrhea and seems unable to control its bowel movements. This could be a sign of liver shunts.

, If your cat has liver shunts, it may show no interest in its food or stop eating altogether. This lack of appetite may be due to a general feeling of illness or nausea due to liver shunts., Cats who have liver shunts tend to press their heads on objects, such as the floor, the wall, or an item of furniture. This is likely done to help reduce feelings of nausea, anxiety, and illness due to liver shunts., If you notice any physical or behavioral symptoms of liver shunts in your cat, bring it to your vet right away. Your vet will run a series of tests on your cat to determine if it has liver shunts, including a physical exam, a blood test, a urine test, a liver function test, and an x-ray.Most of these tests can be done during your appointment with the vet and are non invasive.
Liver function tests may require your cat to fast overnight or for several hours so your cat’s bile acids can be measured properly.

, Your vet may recommend a low impact treatment like an adjustment of your cat’s diet. Giving your cat a low-protein diet can help to reduce some of the symptoms of liver shunts. Feed your cat high quality food that is low in protein, such as cat food made of all natural ingredients.Your vet should be able to recommend cat food brands that would be ideal for the treatment of liver shunts.
Sometimes adjusting your cat’s diet will be recommended in addition to other treatments like medication or surgery.

, Your vet may suggest medication to treat liver shunts in your cat. Antibiotics can help to alter the bacteria in your cat’s intestines, which can then reduce the toxins in your cat’s blood. Lactulose medication can also help to reduce the toxins in your cat’s blood. Speak to your vet about the proper dosage for these medications.If your cat is experiencing seizures, your vet may recommend anti-seizure medication for your cat.

, If your cat’s condition is severe, your vet may recommend surgery to address the liver shunts. Surgery is a permanent solution to your cat’s issue but it can be expensive. During the surgery, blood flow will be redirected to your cat’s liver. This will help your cat’s liver work properly and prevent liver shunts in the future.The surgery can be performed in your vet’s office by your vet.
Your cat will be given a general anesthesia during the surgery.

, Post surgery, your cat will be on medication to help your cat’s body adjust to a working liver. Give your cat the required medications so your cat’s liver can regenerate and work properly again. Often, the prognosis for a cat who recovers well after the surgery is good, as the liver shunts rarely return.If your cat shows any signs of hypertension after surgery, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or difficulty breathing, bring it to the vet right away. The vet will then address the issue and check that your cat is healing properly post surgery.

Do your homework.,
Create a habitat.,
Catch your fly.,
Supervise.",How to Keep a Pet Fly," Know exactly what you're going to care for. Especially do a little bit of research on the lifespan of a fly, since most will not live over a month, even in captivity.;
, Make sure the habitat is exactly as you'd like it, as you won't be able to transfer the fly out of the jar or container once it is inside.

Choosing the right container is quite simple. A small, thoroughly cleaned pickle jar will do fine, but small pet carriers can be more pleasing to the eye, more fun to decorate, more comfortable for your fly, and even provide better ventilation.






While the flooring of your habitat won't hinder the health of your fly, it does make it more appealing to the eye. Dirt from the back yard is always an option, but some clay-based dirt may clump and make it difficult for your fly to move around. Aquarium gravel, washed thoroughly, works well in all cases. Store-purchased biome dirt for reptiles could work so long as you're not keeping larvae, as it may hinder the larva's ability to move around.






Add sticks, leaves, and other decorations. If your keeping a dirt-based flooring, add leaves over the top of it, and then add in a small twig or stick to give something for your fly to climb on. The twig can be stripped of its leaves or they may be left on.






Add food. Most flies will thrive if given a non-citrus fruit. Apples of any color will do well. A few small cubes, 2 for adults, 3 for larvae, will last their lifetime. They also eat rotting meat, but this may cause the biome to smell and possibly harbor diseases.






For jars, find a very thin cotton material and rubber band. This will work as your lid. A metal lid with holes causes poor ventilation and may cause the biome to become too hot or humid. A very thin t-shirt material will work fine.







, There are numerous ways to do it, but all are somewhat tricky. If you've got flies in your house, it would be easier, otherwise, it could take a while.

If you have flies in your house, just keep the jar open until a fly finds the fruit. Then cover the biome with the lid.






If you don't have flies in your house, you'll need to catch them outside. Leave a half of an apple out for a day, and then come back. Ants as well as flies will be eating it. Leave the open jar out until a fly lands inside. Cover the lid.






If you want larvae, that way you can raise the fly over the course of their lifetime, you'll need to do a little extra work. If they're in your house, go searching for the breeding grounds. Rotten meat or fruit, even open bottle of Yoo-Hoo or coke, are wonderful breeding grounds. If you can't find it, cut an apple in half and then make a small dip in the cut, like a cradle. Leave it out with the cradle face up. Flies will lay eggs here. You can collect the eggs or wait until they hatch into maggots or larvae. Use paper or a leaf to transport them. Do not use your hands, as it may crush them.






If you prefer not to make your house a breeding ground, cut an apple in half, and cut a cradle where the stem is. Skewer the apple with a knife from the top down. The handle of the knife should be on the same side of the apple as the cradle. Tie a string to the knife and hang it outside. This will keep the ants from eating, making perfect breeding grounds for flies. Collect the eggs or wait until they hatch into maggots or larvae. Use paper or a leaf to transport them. Do not use your hands, as it may crush them.






If all else fails, you can use flypaper and scrape the fly off with cardboard paper, but note, this may cause legs or even wings to be pulled off and the fly will take a very long time to remove the glue from itself. This method is only suggested for last-resorts. The fly will be immobile temporarily and can be transported to the jar by paper or leaf.







, Make sure your fly seems healthy and happy inside its new home. Once the fruit begins to really rot, it's a good idea to sprinkle a little bit of water through the cotton lid to give the fly a little moisture every day or so. Make sure it isn't excessive, however.

Consider traveling by car.,
Make sure your cat is prepared for air travel.,
Find a cat friendly hotel.,
Arrange for your cat's stay with your holiday host.,
Bring along the essentials.",How to Include Your Cat in Holiday Celebrations1," Traveling by car is a safe way to transport your cat to your holiday destination. You can make the trip go smoothly by placing your cat in a pet carrier and making sure you bring enough food and water for the cat. You should also take rest stops every two hours and use a leash during these breaks to let your cat defecate or urinate.


Don’t ever leave your cat alone in the car.;
, If you decide to fly with your cat, you will need to make sure they have the proper health clearances including immunizations. If possible, fly with your cat in the cabin instead of cargo. Make sure you do not feed the cat for at least four hours before flying, and do not give it tranquilizers.


Contact the airline to get details on the health requirements your cat must meet in order to travel.

, If you are staying in a hotel for the holiday, you will need to make sure it is pet-friendly. Call the hotel before you book to find out the pet policy, and be aware that many hotels will charge an additional pet fee. You can also try renting a house or apartment through a site like Airbnb, which might make for a more comfortable holiday stay for your cat., If you are staying with friends or family for the holiday, you will need to discuss the details of your cat's stay with them. Make sure they are comfortable with your cat staying at their home and ask them what you should bring to make the visit go as smoothly as possible.

, If you are taking your cat to your holiday destination, you will need to bring along its bed, food and water bowls, toys, treats, and enough food to last throughout the holiday. You will also need to take a litter box and litter for your cat. If you are flying, you can purchase these items once you arrive instead of packing them."

Look for striping on the coat.,
Notice the muscular body.,
Evaluate the head.,
Check out the legs and paws.",How to Identify a Toyger1," Toygers are a human-created breed that is meant to look like the exotic and wild tiger. Toygers have striping on their coats that resembles the striping on a tiger. The stripe pattern can be broken or branded.The stripes are a dark color while the main color of the coat is lighter. The stripes are generally black, though they may be black or tan. The main color is brown or gold.
The coloring and specific pattern of striping will vary depending on the domestic cat used to breed the Toyger.;
, Toygers have medium-sized, muscular bodies. They have bigger bones, along with high shoulders. The Toyger’s body has a rectangular shape.Males can weigh between 10 to 15 pounds (four to seven kilograms), and females generally weigh seven to ten (three to five kilograms).

, Toygers have long faces that are considered an inverted heart shape. They have broad noses and a strong chin. There are white patches above the eyes and on the lower face.They also have small ears that are rounded at the tips.

, Toygers have a rectangular body and shorter legs, which gives them a slinking tiger-like appearance as they move. Their paws are large compared to their short legs.They also have long tails in relation to the rest of their body.

Assess the size of the bug.,
Look for a yellowish brown band.,
Consider the climate you live in.,
Check for any water source nearby.,
Determine if the cockroach can fly.",How to Identify a Cockroach1," Brown Banded cockroaches grow to be about 5/8ths of an inch long. They are one of the smallest varieties of cockroaches. To put that size in perspective, a Brown Banded cockroach is a little bit smaller than the size of an American penny (not including the antennae of course).;
, Contrary to what you might think, the Brown Banded cockroach is actually named for a yellow band that can be found on the bug. Look for two bands--there should be a very thick one at the bottom of the abdomen, and a thinner band running across the mid-abdomen area., Brown Banded cockroaches generally only live in hotter, drier climates. If you are having a cockroach problem but live in a humid, mid or low temperature climate, you are probably dealing with another kind of cockroach., Brown Banded cockroaches detest the water--as such, they are not often found near any sort of water source. If you have found a cockroach living near your sink or toilet, it is more than likely not a Brown Banded cockroach., Unlike the German cockroach, the Brown Banded cockroach will fly off if disturbed. If you notice a small cockroach flying through the air, chances are it is a Brown Banded cockroach.

Take stock of their usual color.,
Look at how long the fly is.,
Notice whether it’s pointed or blunt.,
Determine if the flies look different or not.,
Look for a bristle on the forelegs.,
Use special equipment.,
Note how females choose mates.,
Be aware of their lifespan.,
Notice where they like to live.",How to Distinguish Between Male and Female Fruit Flies," Most fruit flies are a yellowish brown, or tan, color. The presence of stripes indicates a female. Males do have a few stripes, but these stripes meld together and become dark toward the back of the abdomen, giving then a darker color.These stripes actually appear as black rings.
Differences in patterns of color are what many researchers use to determine the difference between male and female fruit flies.For both genders, their eyes are large and red. They have five eyes and antennae.;
, The female fruit fly is longer than a male of the same species. Their abdomens are longer, but not any other body part.This makes females appear a bit larger than their male counterparts. In other words, when comparing two flies, the smaller, shorter fly is male., The abdomen of the female fruit fly is not only longer than that of the male fruit fly. It is also pointed. The male fruit fly abdomen is short and blunt. Therefore, when you compare two fruit flies, try to figure out which abdomen is pointed, and which is blunt., The fact is that extremely young flies have not yet developed many of the physical differences that are gender markers for adult flies. If you're comparing two flies that look the same, and you cannot determine if their body shapes or coloring are different, you may need to look for other signs of gender., Find the two legs on the front half of the flies' bodies. These are their forelegs. Now look for a bristle (also known as a sex comb). This group of tiny, dark hairs is only present on male fruit flies. If the forelegs have no bristle, it means you are holding a female., Fruit flies are very tiny. Their average length is about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm), or 3 mm. In order to locate the tiny bristles on their legs, you will need to immobilize the fly. Then use very delicate equipment to magnify the legs and identify a sex comb.

You may have to kill or freeze the fly to keep it still.
Use a magnifying glass.
Try placing the fly on white paper to make it easier to see its features.

, To further assist you in determining the sex of fruit flies, it's helpful to know how they behave in general. For example, it is useful to note their mating habits so you can identify a male fruit fly by the way he behaves in a mating scenario. Female fruit flies choose a mate within 15 minutes. They decide based on the way the male dances and brushes against the female’s body.When one fly is still while the other hops around like it is dancing, this may be a mating ritual. The male is the one moving.

, If you're studying fruit flies in a controlled environment in order to study gender differences, it's good to know how long they will live. Fruit flies only live for 1/3 of a year, or about four months. They are very sensitive to temperature. They can start reproducing within a week of being born, producing hundreds of eggs at one time., You can find fruit flies buzzing with a “buzz” sound around rotting fruit. They tend to lay their eggs in fruit that has just become ripe so that by the time the larvae hatch, the fruit is rotten enough to produce the juices the flies need to survive.Their mouths are shaped for sucking up liquids, making rotten fruit the perfect nest.
You may find more females around such fruit since they are the ones interested in laying eggs.

Designate a safe space for your cat.,
Do not let your guests enter the space.,
Fill the space with comfort items.,
Equip the space with essentials.,
Provide entertainment for your cat.",How to Include Your Cat in Holiday Celebrations2," Cats can get overwhelmed when the house fills with holiday guests. Make your cat as comfortable as possible by designating a room or part of the house that can serve as a comfortable retreat from the holiday mayhem. For example, you can designate your office as a safe space., It is important that your cat feels safe in its retreat space. Instruct your guests that they should not enter the retreat area. If your pet is comfortable with certain guests, you can allow them to enter the space with your approval., Place objects that comfort your cat in the space. For example, you can fill the space with warm blankets, your cat’s favorite toys, or a scratching post. These items will help your cat feel comfortable in the space.

, Your cat’s comfortable holiday retreat should include all the items the cat needs to survive. You should place your cat’s bed, plenty of food and water, and the litter box in the space., You should make sure your cat has plenty of ways to entertain itself while hanging out in the safe space. Place your cat’s climbing tree in the space. You can also give your cat puzzle toys or long lasting cat chews to keep it occupied."

Dress your cat in a costume.",How to Include Your Cat in Holiday Celebrations3," You can make the holidays special for your cat by making homemade treats. Try creating some tasty tuna bites for your cat. You can also make cheese treats or holiday cat cookies with chicken. Each of these treats can be made by combining simple ingredients and cooking the treat on a stove or in the oven., No matter what holiday you are celebrating, you can make it special for your feline friend with a gift or two. Try giving your cat a new climbing tree, a puzzle toy, or a fancy cat bed. You can wrap the gifts and have your cat unwrap them for extra entertainment. For example, tear a small hole in the paper of the gift and then entice your cat to claw at the paper., Who doesn’t love a cat that is all decked out in a festive costume? You can make the holiday special by dressing up your cat. Try turning your cat into a lion for Halloween. You could also dress your cat up as one of Santa’s elves for Christmas. If you celebrate Easter, try an Easter bunny outfit.Make sure your cat is safe in its costume by avoiding outfits in which they could get their claws, legs, or heads stuck.
Always supervise your cat when it is wearing a costume. This will prevent potential injuries that may result from costume malfunction.

Look for a playful cat.,
Evaluate their intelligence.,
Expect a mild-mannered cat.",How to Identify a Toyger2," Toygers love to play. They will play fetch with you if you throw a toy or balled up piece of paper, and they love chasing and batting at dangling toys. They enjoy spending time with you, so expect them to enjoy playing with you.Toygers enjoy playing in the water. They also will roam if you don’t keep them on a leash or contained indoors.

, Toygers are a very intelligent breed. They do well with puzzle toys that keep their minds active.Because they are intelligent, they are highly trainable. You can teach Toygers to walk on a leash outdoors.Toygers can also be trained in agility since they are so intelligent.

, Toygers are not wild and ferocious like people might think. They are sweet and calm cats. The breed is usually friendly and outgoing. They have a moderate activity level, so expect the Toyger to curl up on your lap or near you when they sleep.Toygers get along with cats and dogs. They are good with children as long as the interactions are supervised and the child is taught how to properly handle the Toyger.

Locate a breeder.,
Adopt a Toyger.,
Be patient.",How to Identify a Toyger3," If you want to adopt a cat from a breeder, make sure to find a reputable breeder. Toygers are extremely rare because they are a designer cat breed. There are only approximately 400 Toygers in the world. This means Toygers can be quite expensive.Since not all Toygers have the same number of characteristics, the prices vary. Pet Toygers can range from $500 to $2000, while ones that are worthy to be show cats can range from $1500 to $5000. Many pet-worthy Toygers may not have all the physical markers for a show cat, but will have the personality.
Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Fanciers Breeder Referral List, and The International Cat Association.
If you find a breeder who sells Toygers at a super cheap price, this is a red flag. It may indicate a problem in the Toyger’s breeding.

, Toygers are extremely rare, so you may not be able to find one at a shelter or rescue. You can always check with local shelters and rescues, or talk to your vet or local experts who may know of a Toyger who needs rescuing.Try pet adoption websites. You may be able to find one through one of those.

, Finding a Toyger cat may take time. If you are interested in getting a cat from a breeder, be aware that they are very rare and there is a limited supply. There may be a waiting list for the cat, or the price may be more than you are willing to pay for a cat.

Notice the size of the cockroach.,
Look for two dark stripes.,
Check to see if the roach is near water.,
Consider the number of roaches.",How to Identify a Cockroach2," German cockroaches are slightly larger than Brown Banded roaches. They can grow to ½ an inch long, which is about the exact same size as an American penny (again, minus the antenna).

, The German roach is best recognized by the two parallel lines that run from the back of the cockroach’s head down to its wings. The stripes or lines are dark brown in color and can appear almost black., German cockroaches love moist, warm areas. You can generally find them in your kitchen or bathroom, lurking next to the dishwasher or sink. They are also notoriously present in garbage, which is where they find most of their food.

, German cockroaches are the number one roaches found in homes in large numbers. If you think you have an infestation, there is a good chance that you are dealing with German cockroaches.

Look at the size of the cockroach.,
Notice the color of the roach.,
Look for a glossy exterior.,
Consider the kind of food the cockroach is munching on.",How to Identify a Cockroach3," This variety of cockroach are considered large cockroaches and can grow up to two inches in size. If you were to lay the cockroach next to an American quarter, the quarter would take up about three-fourths of the cockroach’s body.

, American cockroaches are unique from other cockroaches in that they have a red-brown color that has an amber look to it. Most other cockroaches are a muddy brown color. Check to see if the roach you are looking at has a reddish glow to it. Also look for two large dark brown spots on the shoulders of these roaches--they are the only part of the bug without that reddish color.

, Aside from their unique color, American cockroaches are also the shiniest roaches. Their exterior, including their body and wings, has a shiny quality to it that many call glossy but no one would call glamorous., American cockroaches are notorious for only eating moist foods--like human and pet food--making them a personal problem as well as a household problem. If you see a large cockroach eating your food or your dog’s food, it is very likely that it is an American cockroach."

Check out the size of the cockroach.,
Look at the color of the roach.,
Notice the wings on the Oriental cockroach.,
Observe the area where you saw the cockroach.,
Areas infested with Oriental roaches actually give off an unpleasant musty odor due to chemicals secreted by the insects that allow them to communicate with each other.

",How to Identify a Cockroach4," Oriental cockroaches are generally about one inch long, which is slightly larger than the American penny. They also have a tubular shape that doesn’t vary too much from head to foot. Female Oriental roaches are larger than their male counterparts., Oriental cockroaches are known for their deep brown color. In certain lights, this sort of cockroach can actually appear black. Other than their unique coloring, the Oriental cockroach doesn’t have any distinguishing markings., Female Oriental cockroaches are actually wingless, while male cockroaches have short, stubby wings that cover three-fourths of their body. However, despite the fact that they have wings, these cockroaches can’t fly.

, Oriental cockroaches can survive a long, cold winter outside by burying under moss or other coverings. Inside, they make their abodes in moist, dark areas. In particular, these sort of cockroaches will be found in pipes and dark, cool basements.

Look under rocks and logs to uncover small insects of every kind.,
Break apart rotting wood to search for termites and insect larva.,
Snatch bugs out of the air with a net, though make sure you have the right one for the job.,
Craft a stunning stick.,
Use a net, or even a kitchen colander, to harvest insects from streams.,
Catch ants with a simple stick and some patience.",How to Catch Small Bugs1," Bugs love dark, humid spots. Head to the nearest stream, or simply start turning over rotting logs, rocks, and other low-lying hiding spots. You can catch a large variety of insects this way as long as you're quick. In damp, loose soil, just dig 6-8"" under the surface to reveal a plethora of insects.


A net or garden shovel will make it much easier to get multiple insects at once.
For delicate bugs, like mantises, consider using tweezers to keep them safe and intact while collecting.;
, The snug, relative protection of dead wood is a great place to go searching. While not necessary, gloves and long sleeves are generally recommended to protect your skin from splinters or nasty, moldy bits of wood. Always treat your environment with respect. Breaking apart insect habitats should only be done if you need the bugs for research or survival, not purely for fun.

, Flying insects are tough to capture -- unless you have a net. If you're trying to save the bugs (such as for a collection), make sure that you have a net with a thin, light mesh, protecting valuable parts like wings and antennae.



Sweep nets are solid, and are made for insects in bushes, trees, and long grass. You can use a pillowcase attached to a pole or branch to make your own.

Butterfly nets are much thinner, and are only for aerial insects. If you want to make your own, purchase some light mesh from your local craft store., If you don't have a net and aren't worried about keeping the insects in pristine condition, you can also use a stunning stick. Get a big stick with its large, leafy end still intact. Then, walking in tall grass, use the wide leaves and branches at the end to knock bugs out of the air, stunning them temporarily. Think of it as a large flyswatter. , Slowly moving or stagnant water is a treasure trove for small insects. Using some sort of strainer, skim the top 1-2"" of the water to pull out all sorts of mayflies, water skimmers, and even dragonflies.


A net, especially one with a long reach, is almost always your best bet.
In a pinch, such as a survival setting, you can make a net with two poles and a shirt. Tie the shirt between the sticks and sweep it across the water. Once you have something, bring the sticks together to circle the ""net"" around your prey., You'll want gloves for this, especially if you are unsure if the bugs bite. Simply jam a long stick into the mound and wait. As they panic at the intrusion, ants will climb up the stick in a frenzy. Once it is filled with as many as you want, pull the stick off and use your fingers to slide the ants into a bowl for safe keeping.


Bright red ants are usually the most dangerous, so collect with caution."

Keep your cat indoors during certain times.,
Attach a bell to its collar.,
Try a cat bib.",How to Try to Reduce Your Cat's Hunting1," You can minimize the amount of hunting your cat engages in by monitoring when your cat goes outside. Keep your cat indoors when animals like birds and mice are active. Birds are most active an hour after sunrise and an hour before sunset. Therefore, try keeping your cat indoors during these times.Keeping your cat indoors at all times is a more permanent solution. Also, keeping it indoors may protect it from other dangers such as cars, hawks, and opossums.
Because birds come out and feed after bad weather, keep your cat indoors after bad weather, as well.
Mice and other rodents tend to venture out at night. Try keeping your cat indoors during the night to reduce its killing of rodents.;
, While some studies find that this method works, other studies claim that it is ineffective. Nevertheless, you can still try attaching a bell to your cat’s collar to try to curb your cat’s hunting behavior. The sound made by the bells will alert birds and other prey that your cat is nearby. This way, they can avoid your cat, as well as your backyard, when it is outside.Attach one or two bells to a snap-open collar. For the safety of your cat, choose a snap-open collar to prevent it from being snagged on branches.

, Studies show that a cat bib is a pretty effective method for curbing a cat’s hunting behavior. Attach the bib to your cat’s snap-open or elastic collar before it goes outdoors. The bib hangs loosely over your cat’s chest. A cat bib is particularly effective in protecting birds from being hunted.The bib works by gently interfering with your cat’s coordination and precise timing at the moment it decides to attack."

Find a good container for the antlion.,
Fill your environment with fine substrates such as sand or sugar.,
Prepare the habitat for your antlion’s cocoon stage.",How to Find and Care For an Antlion1," Antlions are very active diggers, so make sure they have enough space to dig out a pit for their prey.Use a plastic cup or a similar small plastic container. It should be clear so you can observe the antlion. Make sure it’s at least 4 inches across. Wash your container with lukewarm water and non-toxic detergents.
Order an antlion den or Zen garden. You can search online if you'd prefer to purchase a premade habitat, such as an antlion den.
Make sure your antlion environment has enough space. As antlions get bigger, they will need more space to dig and build their “den”.;
, Antlions can survive in any environment, though sand and dirt is its natural home.Filter out your substrate, especially if you’re using anything that may have rocks or clumps of dirt. Antlions can remove any large blockages, but it will be easier for them to have a smooth and consistent place to live.
Fill your environment about halfway with sand. Make sure the antlion is not smothered by the sand and has enough space to build a pit.
Make sure the diameter across the level of the sand is at least 4 inches. This will make sure your antlion has enough space to build their pit.

, If you want to keep an adult antlion, make sure you have covered the habitat so it won’t escape. Also, put a small stick in the sand for it to perch on so its wings will develop properly.


Recognize when your antlion stops eating. This is a clear sign that they are beginning their pupa stage.
Antlions spin a cocoon under the sand in order to become an adult. This stage will last approximately 3 weeks.
When antlions emerge as an adult, they will have wings. Make sure you have prepared their environment so they cannot fly away and have somewhere to perch.
Cover the habitat with a ventilated lid or net so the adult antlion won’t escape. They will fly out of the habitat if you’re not careful and they can hurt themselves outside of their habitat.
Free your antlion when it becomes an adult so it can procreate. Adult antlions will grow too big for your habitat. This will enable it to reproduce and live out its relatively short life.

Prepare a container with about a one inch hole on the lid with a knife or scissor for the isopod that you capture.,
Prepare a habitat for the isopods ahead of time by filling the container with one to two cups of soil.,
After you get the container ready, get a potato, cut it in half and hollow both halves out with the knife until each half is one inch thick on the inside.

,
After cutting the potato, use a rubber band or two to hold the halves together and after doing this you have to cut the potato at any end by one or two inches.

,
Go to a nearby moist log or garden with the potato and open the potato and put about two or three dead leaves in the potato.

,
After putting the leaves in the potato, close it, then put it on the wet soil in the garden or wet soil next to the log.

,
After a few days, there should be isopods in the potato.,
Before you open the potato, go home, find the container, put the potato in the container, and open it.",How to Catch an Isopod," You will need a large plastic container and a lid with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) hole on top. Most plastic containers are acceptable.;
, For short periods of time, a goldfish bowl, transparent plastic box, or even a kiddie pool will do until you get it ready. If you are planning for them to be permanent pets, you will need to set up a real terrarium.

Catch a bug; The difficulty is based on location.,
Raise your insects for competition.,
Get the proper food for your insect.,
Make sure your insects have the water they need.,
Start the fight.",How to Fight Insects,"


If you live in the great plains, or a heavy forest area, use one of the following: praying mantis, spiders, ants (black or fire ants, if you want more of a challenge), beetles, and grasshoppers.
If you live in a desert area, such as Arizona or Nevada, your choice is dangerous, but includes one of the most fierce fighters next to a stag beetle, the scorpion. Keep in mind that they are very dangerous and if you're going to handle them, wear a thick full sleeved shirt and leather gloves.
If you're in California, you could try for a trap door or jumping spider. They make for rather interesting fights. However, keep in mind that trap door spiders don't take their trap door with them, you have to fight in an arena.;
, Before you try to raise your bugs, get a plastic cage. You can get these at any decent pet store.

, For food, you have to consider what insect you are raising.


For carnivorous insects, you can use crickets, small spiders, grasshoppers (although you might kill them first in case they might kill your other insect.), flies, some types of larvae (beetle, caterpillar, grubs and maggots.) and ants.
For vegetarians, feed them leaves, and for each different species of insects, separate natural environments to live in that contain all of the resources needed to live.
Note: Do not feed your insects flowers as for many of them are poisonous to insects.
For beetles, mix some sugars into their diet, it makes them huge!

, For water, they should each get about 3mL a day. Some insects, such as grasshoppers and beetles, like to eat bread or cookie crumbs.

, The rules are very simple:


Get a cage that neither bug has lived in.
Put both bugs in the cage until they fight.
Remove the winner and return it to your cage.
The fight goes until one bug stops moving or tries to run out of the ring three times.
In a tournament, subbing out your insect per round is okay, if its the same species of bug.

Switch the cat to wet food if it is dehydrated.,
Have one set of food bowls per cat if they are territorial.,
Keep the cat’s litter box clean to prevent accidents.,
Place multiple litter boxes in your house.",How to Treat Behavior Problems in Older Cats1," Senior cats tend to get dehydrated easily and this can lead to behavioral issues like anxiety, stress, or irritation. Keep the older cat calm and healthy by giving it wet food instead of dry food. Wet food is more hydrating than dry food. It will ensure the senior cat gets enough moisture and water in its diet.If you cannot afford to switch your cat to only wet food, you can give the cat some wet food and some dry food as part of its diet. You may give the cat wet food in the morning, for example, and dry food at night.;
, Older cats can get territorial over their food bowls and may become aggressive during feeding time if they have to share a food bowl. If there is more than one cat in your household, make sure each cat gets their own food bowls. Place the food bowls in different areas of the kitchen so each cat has space while they eat.


Keep the food bowls clean so the cats are more excited to eat from them. Wash the food bowls once a day so they do not collect bacteria or germs.

, Older cats sometimes struggle with using the litter box or start soiling in other spots inside besides the litter box. Prevent this from happening by cleaning the cat’s litter box regularly. Scoop out the litter box when the cat goes to the bathroom and dispose of any waste right away. Empty the litter box once a week and rinse it down to clean and disinfect it. Then, replace the litter with fresh, clean litter.You can try sprinkling baking soda in the litter box and then add the litter on top. The baking soda will help to reduce odor in the litter box.

, Senior cats are not as agile as they once were and can struggle to make it to a litter box in another area of the house. Put out multiple litter boxes so the cat has access to them as it needs it. If your house has two floors, you may put a litter box on the lower floor and the upper floor for the cat to use. Having more than one litter box in your home can prevent accidents by your cat and encourage it to use the litter box.Having multiple litter boxes is also a good idea if you have more than one cat in your home. This way, each cat will have access to a litter box as needed.

Create a ""beat sheet"" to get lots of insects from bushes or small trees.",How to Catch Small Bugs2," The following traps can all be improved by using bait. Most bait is simple sugar and yeast in the form of rotting fruit, sugar water, corn syrup, or alcohol. While most traps will get a few insects without it, insect bait will significantly improve your collection.


Overripe fruit, fermented foods (like beer-soaked bread), peanut butter, and sugar will attract many insects.
Rotten meat will attract carrion like maggots and flies.
A mixture or fruit, rum or beer, and sugar will attract many nocturnal insects.
If you're serious about collecting insects, you can buy pheromones online or in major garden stores to attract males insects., Simple and effective. All you need is a plastic jar (like a peanut butter jar) or a soup can. Punch 4-5 holes in the bottom of your can. Dig up a hole the size of your can, then put the trap in so that the top of the can is even with ground level. Fill the trap with some dirt, leaves, and bait (optional), then wait for non-flying bugs to fall right in., A funnel trap requires little more than some scissors/knife and an old bottle. To make one, start with a soda bottle. While one liter is usually the easiest to work with, anything will do. Note, however, that this trap is not very effective in the rain. To make one:


Cut the top of the bottle off, starting just where it begins to taper in towards the cap.
Discard the cap, cutting off the small neck of the bottle.
Turn the tapered end (that you just cut off) upside down and place it in the bottle, forming a funnel. Adhere with tape if needed.
Place bait at the bottom of the trap and wait. Bugs fly into the funnel but use the walls to escape, making it impossible to leave again through the center hole., This trap, though it seems simple, will capture a fair amount of insects, especially when used with bait. All it requires is a plastic bottle and a sharp knife:


Cut a small ""U"" in the side of the bottle, with the uncut side nearest to the cap.
Pull the flap upward, so that there is an opening in the bottle shielded by the ""door.""
Place bait in the bottom of the bottle and wait. Most insects cannot find the door to get out, especially if you use sticky bait like sugar water or corn syrup.
This trap is effective in the rain, as the door prevents water from getting in., You can make your own flypaper with ease. Insects will be attracted to the sweet smell but unable to free themselves after landing. You can place the traps on the ground, though they are more effective when hung.


Take an old paper bag or piece of cardboard and lightly wipe the surface clean.
Mix equal parts sugar, water, and corn syrup on the stove until blended.
Cool the sugar mixture for a few minutes.
Spread the paste on the bag or cardboard to finish the trap., The idea is simple -- you place a collection device (a pan, inverted umbrella, box, old sheet, etc.) under a tree or bush. Then you shake it. You can then collect the bugs that fall out with your hands or tweezers.This works best on smaller trees, or locations you know that there are a lot of small, flightless bugs.

Have your cat hunt for its food.,
Play with your cat.",How to Try to Reduce Your Cat's Hunting2," Make hunting less appealing by engaging your cat in predatory behavior in order to obtain its food. To do this, hide food around the house, and have your cat seek out the food. You can also use a puzzle/scatter feeder to feed it portions of its meals. You can either buy a feeder or make one at home.Clean an empty plastic bottle. Cut out holes in the bottle that are big enough to allow cat food through, but small enough to make it a challenge. Fill ¼ of the bottle or less with dry food and treats. Place the bottle in front of your cat. You cat will have to roll and knock the feeder to obtain the food.

, Channel your cat’s hunting behavior into more acceptable activities through play. Cats generally like to play with small, lightweight objects that are easy to flick, swat, and chase. You can either buy store bought toys, or make homemade toys for your cat. It is recommended that you play with your cat at least 30 minutes per day.Store bought toys such as fishing rod-style toys, plastic balls with or without bells inside, or sisal-wrapped toys that your cat can dig its nails into are great examples of toys that will keep your cat entertained.
Alternatively, round, plastic shower curtain rings, ping-pong balls, paper bags with the handles removed, empty cardboard toilet paper or paper towel tubes, and cardboard boxes are great examples of homemade toys and devices that cats love to play with.
Remember to supervise your cat's play time to prevent it from ingesting any of the toys' parts, especially if your cat has a tendency to hunt and eat its prey.

Make sure your bird table is tall and on a pole.,
Place your bird table in open area.,
Grow prickly plants around the table.",How to Try to Reduce Your Cat's Hunting3," Make sure your bird table is high enough to prevent easy access by your cat. The bird table should be at least six feet tall. Also, having your table on single pole makes it difficult for your cat to climb up.Additionally, spread Vaseline on the poles of your bird tables to make it extra difficult for your cat to climb., Keep your bird tables away from surfaces that your cat can jump from, like fences and trees. Also, do not place the table near shrubbery that cats can hide in and attack from.If you are using a hanging bird feeder, place it on a branch that your cat cannot access, or place it on a small, weak branch that will break under a cat’s weight.

, Place spiny or prickly plants around the bottom of your bird table or feeder. These plants will make it uncomfortable and hard for your cat to get to the bird table. You can also place these plants with your bushes to make it difficult for your cat to hide in and launch a surprise attack from."

Check sandy areas such as playgrounds or beaches.,
Scoop out the pits with a sand sifter.,
Put the antlion in a temporary container.",How to Find and Care For an Antlion2," Antlions don’t like people, so avoid well-trodden areas. Instead, try to find relatively secluded areas to find antlions.Find secluded sandy areas. Antlions will not be found in the middle of a busy beach or playground.
Look for cone-shaped pits. They should look like hollow cone with a hole in the middle like a funnel. This is a clear sign of nearby antlions.
Antlions can live in many other kinds of substrates. Check out other areas with a lot of dirt if you don't have any sandy areas nearby.

, You may have to try multiple times to make sure you find a living antlion larva.


Use the scoop near the antlion pit. They may not be in the pit at the time, so you may need to try around the pit as well.
Carefully sift out the sand. Make sure you don't hurt the antlion by being too rough with the sifter.
Continue using the sifter in the area until you find the antlion. Stay attentive, since the antlion is the same color as its sandy environment.

, Make sure it’s secure and safe, so you can get it home.


Bring a small cup or other container. Fill it with sand from the area where you found the antlion. Keep your antlion habitat along with your antlion inside a dark area. These habitats may be the best designed for your antlion.
Don’t worry if the antlion is on its back and playing dead. In a few moments, it will get up and try to bury itself again. Once you get the antlion back to your home, put it in its environment. Let the insect get used to its new home for at least 24 hours.
Be careful when opening the package when it arrives. You don't want to injure the antlion.
Once the antlion is out of the box, make sure to have its habitat prepared and ready. The antlion will need time to adjust after being shipped.

Feed your antlion.,
Don’t worry about supplying the antlion with water.,
Pick up your antlion.,
Avoid antlion bites.,
Be gentle.",How to Find and Care For an Antlion3," Antlions are known most for eating ants, but they can also eat smaller insects. Make sure to feed them at least one ant twice a day.


Give your antlion ants. Ants are the most common food for antlions.
Make sure not to give them any ants that are too big. Gather relatively small ants near where you found your antlion.Supply your antlion with fruit flies or mealworms. Give them small amounts so they are able to eat and digest the smaller insects.
Feed the antlion aphids, mosquito larva, or pinhead crickets. These are also good insects that are small enough for your antlion.

, Antlions get most of the water they need from their food.


If you are worried about your antlion getting enough water, you can mist their sand every two weeks.Make sure not to flood the antlion habitat if you mist their sand. Antlions can drown, especially in their pit.
Check on your antlion to make sure it’s getting enough food. If not, it may also not be getting enough water.

, You can pick up your antlion and hold it in the palm of your hand. Just be careful to avoid being bitten or harming your antlion.


Stretch your palm and create a flat surface. Make sure you don’t have any folds of skin for antlions to grasp onto.Transfer your antlion to your other palm if they wander towards the edge of your palm. Keep your other palm flat and stretched as well.
Keep some sand on your palm so the antlion thinks it’s on the ground. Antlions feel most comfortable in sand.

, While antlions rarely bite, they occasionally bite when they feel threatened. Keep the antlion in a comfortable environment when you pick it up.


Keep them in the palm of your hand. Don’t let the antlion move to the back of your hand, since it may realize it’s not on the ground.
If the antlion does bite you, stay very calm. Put the antlion back in its habitat. Do not move your hand rapidly since you can harm the antlion.
Antlion venom causes a sharp, burning sensation. It will last for several minutes, but does not have long-term effects.

, Antlions have bodies that are very vulnerable. Try to not be too rough when handling them.


Do not pick up antlions with your fingers. You can crush the antlions by doing so.
If you want to pick up the antlion, place your hand in their habitat with some sand on it. Let the antlion come to your flat palm.
Antlions in classrooms are especially at risk. Tell children to observe proper antlion handling or do not let them touch the antlion directly.

Set up a scratching post for the cat if it is anxious or stressed.,
Have high climbing spots available for the cat.,
Play with the cat 10 minutes a day.,
Keep the cat’s sleeping area clean so it sleeps well.",How to Treat Behavior Problems in Older Cats2," Look for a scratching post that has a variety of textures at your local pet store or online. A scratching post with shelves or resting spots that are high up are an even better option for a senior cat.You may have a designated area for your cat to play, scratch, and lounge in your home. If you have more than one cat in your household, try to have one scratching post for each cat.

, Older cats do well with high climbing spots where they can rest, lounge, and nap, as this helps with stress and anxiety. Being up high can help older cats be less anxious or stressed, especially if they live in a busy household. You may set up a shelving unit with nothing on the top shelves so the cat can climb and rest up there. You can also get a shelving unit made for cats that has several different resting spots at different heights.The top of cupboards and bureaus as well as the tops of couches are also good climbing spots for cats.

, To ensure your senior cat stays relaxed and calm, make sure you spend time playing with it on a regular basis. Show the cat some love and attention by having 10 minute play sessions once a day. Use the cat’s favorite toy to play with the cat. Have the cat run and chase the toy.You can also play fetch with the cat as well as hide and go seek with the cat.

, Senior cats can have sleep issues where they are overly active at night and do not sleep as well as they used to. You can combat this behavior issue by maintaining a sleep area for the cat that is clean and calm. Wash the cat’s bedding regularly so it stays clean and attractive to the cat. Place the cat’s bed in a quiet, cool area in your home so the cat can rest in peace.


You can also have a short play session with the cat right before bed to help it go to sleep. Feeding the cat before bedtime is another good way to get the cat to sleep when you do.

Clean the cat’s teeth to avoid dental issues.,
Trim the cat’s nails to avoid paw licking or rubbing.",How to Treat Behavior Problems in Older Cats3," Older cats will stop self-grooming themselves as much as they used to. This can cause their coats to become matted, dirty, or smelly. Prevent this by brushing the older cat often. Long haired senior cats should be brushed once a week. Short haired senior cats should be brushed twice a month. Use the correct brush and comb for the cat based on their breed and the length of their hair. Spend 5-15 minutes brushing the cat from head to toe.Brushing the older cat regularly will also allow you to bond with the cat and give it some attention. This can help to maintain the cat’s emotional and mental health.

, Older cats are at a higher risk of dental issues like rotten teeth, bad breath, and sensitive gums. Spend time brushing your cat’s teeth with a small brush and toothpaste made for cats. Brush the cat’s teeth once a day or several times a week, preferably after it has eaten.You may want to wrap your cat in a towel when you brush its teeth to make the process easier for both of you.

, Senior cats are prone to ingrown nails and infected nails. This can then lead to behavior issues like licking, rubbing, or scratching at their paws. Keep the older cat healthy by trimming its nails once a week.

Birth to 2 weeks: the kitten orients towards sound and her eyes open, separation from her mother or littermates may lead to behavioral issues.
Two to seven weeks: your kitten begins socializing and playing and may wean at around 6-7 weeks, though she may continue to suckle for comfort.
Seven to 14 weeks: your kitten increasingly socializes and increases her physical coordination. Kittens shouldn’t be separated from their mothers or littermates before 12 weeks to minimize the risk of developing problematic behaviors.In addition, kittens who are gently handled for 15-40 minutes daily for their first seven weeks are more likely to develop larger brains.;
, Kittens may cry from a lot of different reasons, from being separated too early to being hungry. Recognizing the reasons for why kittens cry may help you identify her specific cries and give her the comfort she needs.Your kitten might cry because:

Gradually, move closer and closer until you are close enough to lock eyes., Avoid facing toward the cat, as this is likely to scare them away. Instead, sit as close as you can, turning your body slightly away. Watch the cat using your peripheral vision., Remain still and keep your peripheral vision focused on the cat. Anytime your cat looks in your direction, reward them with a treat. As the cat becomes more comfortable, gradually begin turning toward them., Once the cat is comfortable with you turning toward them, you can begin to demand a bit more from them before offering a treat. Begin rewarding only actual eye contact, as opposed to every glance., Whenever the cat makes eye contact with you, begin using a verbal cue that they can associate with the action. Try saying ""watch,"" each time the cat locks eyes with you. Then say, ""very good,"" and offer a treat."

Slowly introduce the cat to other people.",How to Tame a Cat," Observe the cat for a few days. This way, you can determine its nature, especially when humans come close. Is the cat afraid or scared of people? Is it angry?


If you think they may be dangerous you shouldn't try handling them. Instead, call animal control or a human society who will be able to professionally capture and handle the cat if you think they pose a danger.;
, Cats communicate their feelings with body language that can be rather obvious.For example:


An angry or upset cat will have ears that are flattened back, dilated pupils, a tail which is switching back and forth, an arched back, and fur standing on end. The cat will typically be growling. This is a sign to back off.
If it hasn’t run away, a scared cat will typically lay flat or have its tail between its legs. Proceed with caution in trying to tame these cats.
In contrast, a contented and relaxed cat’s ears will be forward and alert, and its tail will be straight up in the air. Its fur will be flat (not standing on end), and the cat may even stretch, lay down, and roll onto its back. , While you will not be close to the cat, you will be able to observe its overall health from afar. Check to see if it looks skinny or bony. It may be hungry. Look at its fur to see if it looks healthy, or if it looks matted, patchy, bald, or otherwise unhealthy. See if the cat has any other obvious issues, such as limping, cuts, sores, or other problems. , Feral cats and kittens are generally unvaccinated and carry a slight risk for carrying the deadly rabies virus. While very uncommon, rabies in cats can occur primarily in outdoor, unvaccinated cats and kittens. The symptoms of rabies can vary and may take months to develop after a cat or kitten was exposed to the virus.


Classic signs of rabies in cats and kittens include an ill cat (lethargic, not eating, weakness) and/or changes in behavior (aggressive, restless, disoriented, paralysis, seizures).If you encounter a feral cat with these symptoms, call animal control and do not attempt to handle the cat or kitten.

, If the cat seems amenable to taming, your next step is to get them used to you and your voice. Sit near them and talk to them in a soft, gentle voice., As you continue talking to the cat, set out some food for it to nibble. Try this for about three days. In the meantime, don't try approaching it.


After three days, look for positive body language to determine if the cat seems comfortable with your presence. A content cat will prick its ears forward, hold its tail up and possibly arch its back. Its fur will be flat and it may even purr.

, Use a spoonful of wet cat food or canned tuna fish and hold it out as you approach it. Call its name or say, “Kitty.” If the cat hisses at you, this can mean that the cat is just scared and it needs more time to get comfortable in your presence. Take your time letting the cat feel comfortable eating dry food around you.

, If the cat makes any signs of aggression, such as lunging or growling, this cat needs more time to get used to your presence. You may also reconsider if you should call animal control.

, If you need help making the cat feel more welcomed, you might try a cat pheromone product. These substances work by imitating cat pheromones that can calm a cat via the scent of the pheromones.There are sprays you can use to spritz the area around the cat. But be aware that the spray sound may upset or scare the cat.


There are also pheromone wipes that can be used to wipe a given area. You might even try a diffuser option if the cat is in an enclosed area.

, Get a long wooden cooking spoon or spatula. Wrap some soft cloth around it. Fleece works nicely. Slowly put a spoonful of food out close enough to you so you can reach out without startling the cat. While it is eating, slowly reach out with the spoon and pet them with it. It may take a few tries and a few days before the cat is comfortable with this process.


If the cat runs away, don’t run after it. Save the petting for later.

, Until you are able to get the cat to the veterinarian for a checkup, it is best to handle the cat while you wear protective clothing. Wear thick gloves, a long-sleeved shirt and long pants to minimize the chance of getting scratched or bitten.

, After you’ve been petting the cat with a spoon for a while, try sneaking your hand under the spoon and petting the cat. Only pet the cat’s shoulders and head.


Don’t get anywhere near its underside. A cat will be very defensive if it feels threatened. Only when your cat fully trusts you will you be able to pet its belly., Use a towel or blanket to pick up the cat.Do this after you’ve pet the cat a few times. Choose a time when the cat seems calm and relaxed.


It can take a long time to get to this stage. It really depends on the cat. Some cats will never be truly tamed enough to pick up.
If the cat struggles when you hold it, let it go. You may end up getting scratched or bitten. You might also undo all your hard work getting to this point.

, The cat will need to be placed in a carrier so that it can be transported to the vet for an important health checkup. You need to allow time for the cat to get accustomed to the carrier.


Leave the carrier open in your house so that the cat can explore it on his own.
Try placing his food dish in front of the carrier, so he will be more likely to investigate.Move the food to inside the carrier so that the cat will step inside.

, If you are able to eventually handle the cat, bring it to the veterinarian as soon as possible. You can get its health evaluated, get vaccinated, and have any other treatments that it may require.


Vaccinate the cat in order to protect it from various diseases, such as feline leukemia and others. Ask your vet which vaccines are recommended.

, Since the cat has likely been outside its entire life, it will need to be treated for and protected against fleas and worms.Your vet can apply flea and worming treatments on the spot, or she may give you a recommendation of flea and worming treatments you can administer at home.

, One of the best ways you can help is to have the cat spayed (female) or neutered (male) to prevent the birth of feral kittens. The vet will tip its ear, which is a painless procedure that is administered when the cat is under anesthesia. The very tip of the ear will be trimmed off. This serves as a sign that the cat has been spayed or neutered., When a kitten is in the weaning stage, it will respond better to taming. It is gaining independence from its mother during this stage. Once a kitten is socialized, it will be suitable for adoption., When you’re not actively working on socializing it, make sure the kitten has a small, quiet room where it can retreat and relax. This might be a bathroom or a spare bedroom.Leave a nightlight on overnight so that the room is never totally dark.

, It is helpful to increase the kitten’s exposure to humans by working with it in an area with human activity. You might try an area of your yard where other people are working or playing. Or, you might try an area in your house. , Don’t tower over the kitten by standing next to it. Sit down on the floor or ground with the kitten.

, As long as the kitten is healthy, you can use food as a way to socialize it. This way, you can entice it to approach you because it’s hungry and wants to eat the food you’ve got. Sit down near the kitten as it is eating.


You might even try putting the food dish in your lap so that the kitten is close to you.Take the food away when you’re not nearby. This way, the kitten will associate the food with being in your presence., After the kitten has become accustomed to having you nearby when it’s eating, offer it a taste of food from your hand. You can either use wet cat food or baby food (try a beef or chicken flavored baby food).


A kitten may try to gulp down food rather than lick it, since this is the natural way for it to eat. It may try to gently bite your finger as you’re feeding it.

, When the kitten is hungry and is eagerly eating, try gently petting it. Start by petting the head and shoulders only.


If it runs away, go back to the previous step for a longer period of time.

, After the kitten has gotten used to your presence and touch, you need to remove food from the equation. This will ensure that the kitten will still enjoy petting even if food is not offered. Try a petting session after the kitten has eaten and is full.

, If you are taming a cat for adoption, you’ll need to make sure the cat is socialized to other people besides you. Start allowing one person at a time spend moments with the kitten. These people should also try feeding the kitten first with a dish, then with their finger. The kitten will get used to their voices, scents and actions.

To keep your cat away from grass, contain them to a sidewalk or driveway, a back deck, or a sun porch.You may also take your cat out on a leash.;
, If your cat has become obsessed with eating grass, you may need to remove them from all sources of grass. If your cat is an outdoor cat or is allowed to go outside, you should bring them inside so they can’t eat any grass.You may need to keep your cat away from grass for days or weeks to help break the habit.

, To help keep your cat from eating grass, you may need to modify their behavior. This means trying to use negative reinforcement to train the cat not to eat the grass. Go outside with your cat and try to deter them from eating grass.For example, if the cat starts to eat grass, clap your hands loudly to scare the cat. You may also try shaking something loud, like a can full of pennies, to distract the cat from eating grass.
Eventually, the cat will connect the unpleasant, startling sound with eating grass and stop eating it.

Get a cat tree.,
Set up a baby gate.,
Provide a high perch for your cat.,
Create a separate area for each pet’s food and belongings.,
Keep your cat and dog separate.",How to Stop Your Cat from Attacking Your Dog1," A cat tree will provide your cat a safe haven from the attentions of your dog. Cats often attack dogs to get the dog to leave them alone, so providing a spot where your cat can nap in peace is essential for maintaing good pet relations.Place the cat tree in an area that is often frequented by both pets so that the cat can choose to climb to its hiding spot instead of attacking the dog.
Make sure that the dog can’t get to the cat when it’s in the cat tree.;
, Cats can easily leap over a baby gate, but most dogs can’t. Use a baby gate to allow your cat to separate itself from your dog. If the dog is bothering the cat, then the cat can leap over the gate and ignore the dog rather than scratching or hissing at the dog to get it to go away.You can also find baby gates with small holes in the bottom that would allow your cat to crawl through, but don’t choose this option if your dog is small enough to follow.

, If you have a high windowsill or a piece of furniture that your cat likes, encourage your cat to use it by rubbing it with catnip. Alternatively, if it’s large enough, put a cat bed on it. You can also install a sturdy corner shelf for your cat to use as a perch., Both cats and dogs can be territorial over food bowls, toys, and the litterbox. Make sure that each pet has its own special area so that the two don’t get into scuffles over whose food bowl is whose. Additionally, keep your dog away from your cat’s litterbox.Keep your cat’s food and water out of your dog’s reach as well to avoid conflict.

, As long as the attacks are an issue, don’t leave your cat and dog alone unattended. Your cat can seriously injure your dog by scratching its eye or causing an infection. Cat bites are especially prone to infection. You’re also risking your cat’s safety since the dog has every reason to fight back in defense.Consider locking your pets in different rooms, particularly if you are going to be away from home.
Make sure that each pet has the supplies it needs, something to stimulate it, and a comfortable place to lay.

Wait for your cat to look at you.,
Provide a verbal cue.,
Reward any eye contact.,
Anticipate looks.",How to Teach Your Cat to Make Eye Contact2," If your cat is naturally more social and already locks eyes with you from time to time, you can take a more direct approach. Begin noticing the times when your cat makes eye contact with you, such as when they want some food. Keep some cat treats with you and wait for the eye contact to occur., Whenever the cat makes eye contact with you, reinforce this behavior with a simple verbal cue. Try saying ""watch"" every time your cat makes eye contact with you., After you've provided the verbal cue, give your cat a reward for eye contact. You can praise them verbally by saying ""good job,"" as well as offering a treat., After a while, you will hopefully be able to anticipate times when your cat is going to make eye contact with you. Try to speak the verbal cue just before the cat looks at you. Continue to offer rewards for eye contact. Eventually, you should be able to compel eye contact from your cat simply by speaking the verbal cue."

Choose a ""lure."",
Get your cat's attention.,
Move the lure toward your face.,
Reward any eye contact.,
""Fade the lure.""",How to Teach Your Cat to Make Eye Contact3," If you do not feel like waiting around for your cat to look at you, you can ""lure"" them to look at you instead. Begin by selecting an object--such as a toy or treat--that is likely to attract your cat's attention., Present the lure object and try to get the cat's attention. You may need to move the object around a bit. This will work best when the cat is calm., Once your cat is locked in on the lure object, gradually move it closer to your face until they make eye contact with you. If you lose their attention, or if they do not look at your face, lower the lure and start the process again., When you successfully make eye contact with the cat, verbally praise them by saying ""good job,"" and offer a treat. You can also begin adding a verbal cue, such as ""watch,"" each time they look at you., Over time, begin hiding the lure object inside of your hand so that the cat cannot actually see it. Eventually, you should be able to attract the cat's attention by simply holding your hand in the same position, without using an actual treat or toy. This process is called ""fading the lure."" Continue to reward eye contact and use your verbal cue. Eventually, you should be able to compel eye contact from the cat simply by saying the word ""watch."""

Spend more time playing with your cat.,
Substitute plastic with similarly textured toys.,
Try using puzzle or food dispensing toys.",How to Stop Your Cat from Eating Plastic Bags2," Boredom and lack of exercise are potential causes of eating non-food items. Try playing games with toys like a feather on a string or fishing pole. Play with your cat for at least 15 minutes twice per day to make sure it gets enough exercise.Cats evolved to expend lots of energy in quick bursts while hunting, and playing with your cat will help simulate those bursts of activity.

Ask the vet if they recommend anxiety medication or pheromones.,
Consult a professional trainer.,
Perform the Heimlich maneuver if your cat is choking.,
Get emergency care if your cat has an intestinal blockage.",How to Stop Your Cat from Eating Plastic Bags3," Eating non-food items can sometimes be related to a missing nutrient in your cat’s diet. Your cat’s vet can test it for deficiencies such as anemia and recommend any dietary changes you should make.Ask the vet, “Do blood tests show any nutrient deficiencies? Should I add supplements to its diet, or increase its fat or fiber intake?”
If you don’t already, try keeping dry food out at all times so your cat can eat on its own time.
If you have multiple cats, prevent dietary deficiencies due to resource competition by putting out as many food containers as you have cats.

, Chewing or eating plastic bags could be caused by a variety of underlying medical issues, including leukemia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), diabetes, and brain disorders. Bring your cat in for an examination if you haven’t had much luck with steps like providing more exercise or more engaging toys.Ask the vet, “Do you believe this persistent behavior has anything to do with more serious medical conditions? Do you recommend testing for any specific conditions, or can you rule any out through physical examination?”

, Eating non-food items can also result from anxiety. If the vet has ruled out underlying medical causes, ask them if they recommend anti-anxiety medication.They might also recommend calming pheromones, such as Feliway.If you and the vet believe anxiety could be the issue, talk to them about reducing your cat’s stress. Stress-relieving actions include giving your cat plenty of space, making sure it has enclosed spaces to withdraw to, providing it with a cat perch, and limiting encounters with strangers and other animals.

, If the problem persists despite your efforts, you should consult a professional trainer or animal behaviorist. Ask your cat’s vet if they can recommend a local trainer or behaviorist to help you correct the behavior.You can also find a certified professional by using the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC) search tool: https://iaabc.org/consultants


, If your cat is choking, first open its mouth and see if you can remove the plastic with your hand or a sterile pair of tweezers. If that's not possible, call the vet and attempt the Heimlich maneuver. Lay the cat on its side, put one hand along its back, place your other hand on its belly just under the ribs, and push sharply up and in several times.Check its mouth, and repeat giving pushes until you can easily extract the object.
Look for signs like labored breathing, blocked air flow, and panic. Try not to confuse these signs with hairballs.

, Symptoms like vomiting after meals, weakness, weight loss, and diarrhea can indicate an intestinal blockage caused by eating non-food objects. If your cat exhibits these symptoms, bring it to the vet for an accurate diagnosis.The vet will perform an endoscopy using a tube with a tiny camera to examine the digestive system. If they find a blockage, they'll most likely perform surgery to remove it.

Provide grass indoors.,
Make sure to keep your grass pesticide free.,
Keep toxic-free houseplants.",How to Stop Your Cat from Eating Grass2," If you have an indoor cat who wants to eat grass, you may want to buy indoor grass from a florist or flower shop. Pet shops also offer cat friendly grass, such as wheat, oat, or ryegrass. This can provide your cat with a safe way to eat grass. You may also grow your own grass in a small pot or window box for your cat.Wheat, oat, or ryegrass can be very nutritional for your cat’s digestive tract.
Grass you grow yourself will be safe from any pesticides or contaminated pet waste.

, If you have an outdoor cat or your indoor cat goes outside, they may eat grass from your lawn. This grass may have pesticides, bug sprays, or weed killers on it. This grass may also contain urine or feces from your pets, or from neighborhood or wild animals.Try to keep your grass pesticide free, and clean up after your pets when they go to the bathroom.

, If your cat won’t stop eating grass, you may try to keep them inside to prevent them from being around grass.

Know that cats may eat grass to throw up.,
Understand that your cat may be getting essential nutrients.,
Notice if your cat is constipated.",How to Stop Your Cat from Eating Grass3," One theory of why a cat eat grass is that if a cat eats grass, they will throw it back up. This happens because the cat doesn’t have digestive enzymes that are needed to break down the grass and digest it. A cat may eat grass to rid their stomach of any indigestible contents that is inside it.Your cat licks their fur to groom, and this causes hair to get in their digestive tract. They may need the grass to help throw it up or pass it through defecation.
Cats often eat prey whole, which means matter that the cat is unable to digest is in their stomach, such as bones, fur, or feathers.

, Cats may eat grass because they need an essential nutrient, folic acid. Grass contains folic acid, which the cat needs for proper bodily functions. Folic acid also helps the cat produce hemoglobin.If your cat is eating a few blades of grass occasionally, they may be trying to get folic acid.

, Another reason your cat may be eating grass is because they are constipated. Grass may act as a laxative to help any indigestible material that has moved deeper in the digestive tract continue moving through so your cat can eliminate it through defecation.You cat may eat grass if they are having indigestion.

Give your cat a new toy.,
Choose playthings that have feathers.,
Use catnip to make the toys irresistible to your cat.,
Make sure your cat has opportunities for exercise.,
Address redirected aggression.",How to Stop Your Cat from Attacking Your Dog2," Cats are natural hunters and need to release their aggression. Sometimes cats choose to do that by attacking other pets or their owners. Prevent that reaction in your cat by giving them toys that allow them to chase and attack in a safe way.The novelty of the new toy should entice your cat. It may have become bored with its old toys, leading it to choose your dog as a plaything instead.

, Since your cat needs to chase and attack, feathered toys are a great option to stimulate and release those urges. If your cat has a particular affinity for your dog’s tail, then toys with feathers can help divert that urge.Toys with strings or ribbons are not advisable, as your cat can accidentally swallow the string. This can cause intestinal obstructions or other internal damage.

, If your cat has plenty of toys but still likes to pounce on the dog instead, try rubbing the toys with catnip. The catnip will draw your cat to the toys instead of your dog.Rub a few toys at a time with catnip to avoid overwhelming your cat.
Make sure that you wash your hands after using catnip; otherwise, you may accidentally rub catnip onto the dog.

, Cats need to run and play, so help your cat work off its aggression by getting in plenty of activity.Play interactive games with your cat with a feathered toy or laser pointer.
Get your cat toys that allow it to chase, such as electronic mice.
Provide your cat with a cat tower that allows it to climb.

, Some cats naturally have their innate hunter triggered by watching the outside world. If your cat becomes worked up by experiences like watching birds outside, then you may need to block out the windows with curtains, blinds, or even taped on window covers, such as newspaper or foil.Keep your cat away from your dog while it’s struggling with redirected aggression. During this time, you may also be vulnerable to scratches or bites.

Train your dog if it’s contributing to the situation.,
Know how to stop a fight.,
Spay or neuter your pets.,
Use time-outs.,
Take your cat to the vet.",How to Stop Your Cat from Attacking Your Dog3," Petting or playing with your cat can have a calming effect and can help eliminate feelings of jealousy in your cat. It’s especially important to spend plenty of time with your cat if your dog is new.Provide your cat with the type of attention it likes. Not all cats like to be petted, so do what your cat enjoys.

, Your cat may be attacking your dog because it’s stressed, especially if the dog is new to your home. You can buy a Feliway plug-in or chewy snacks called Composure soft-chews that are designed to help anxious cats calm down., Sometimes cats attack dogs because the dog is playing rough or acting aggressively toward the cat. If your dog is an equal or partial partner in the attacks from your cat, then you may need to train your dog how to act toward your cat. This will help both pets better spend time together.Try training tips from the internet.
Consider taking your dog to a dog trainer. Ask your vet for recommendations.

, If your cat and dog get into a fight, you’ll need to get them to stop. First try creating a loud noise that startles the animals, which will allow one of them to escape or may allow you time to grab one. You can also try spraying your pets with water or throwing a blanket over them.


Avoid yelling, as this can agitate your pets and encourage them to keep fighting.Don’t get in between the two animals.

, Spaying and neutering will reduce aggression in your pets and make them less likely to antagonize each other., When one of your pets starts messing with the other, tell them “no,” pick up your pet, and place them in a separate location like a bathroom. Leave them in time out for 5-10 minutes. When you let them out, treat the pet as though nothing happened., If your cat and dog have been getting along but your cat suddenly begins attacking your dog, then the cat may be ill. A sick cat can react aggressively when it’s messed with, even if it normally wouldn’t behave that way. The vet can rule out illness as a cause for your cat’s attacks on your dog."

Cover the soil with uncomfortable material.,
Place sticks in the soil of your yard.,
Offend cats’ sense of smell.,
Lay chicken wire above the soil.",How to Stop Cats From Using Your Yard As a Litterbox1," Cats will not like to dig in rough surfaces. You can cover areas of your yard with a thin layer of safe materials like:Rough-textured mulch
Prickly pinecones
Pebbles and stones;
, If cats do not have enough room to move around, scratch, and dig, they will seek another area for a litter box. Inserting plant stakes, chopsticks, or similar materials (approximately ten inches in length) every eight inches in the soil will thwart cats.Make sure that the sticks or equivalent materials are inserted to a depth of a few inches into the soil so that they will stay upright.

, Some evidence shows that cats do not like certain smells, and will avoid areas that smell offensive to them. Choose a safe, preferably organic material to sprinkle throughout your yard to discourage cats from using it as their litterbox (reapply weekly, if necessary). Do not use materials such as mothballs or poisons, as these are toxic to cats, dogs, children, etc. Good, non-toxic options include: Citrus rinds (lemon, orange, grapefruit, etc.)Garlic
Onion
Anise oil
Eucalyptus oil
Tea leaves
A mixture of two parts cayenne pepper, three parts dry mustard, and five parts flour. You can also add some lion dung (you can purchase lion manure). The lion is an alpha predator and is scary to the cat. Cats won't risk visiting in case they bump into him.

, If you have a particular area that cats are using in your yard, you can deter them by covering that area in standard chicken wire (available from hardware stores).The chicken wire will be soft enough not to hurt the cats, but strong enough to discourage them from digging.


As an alternative to chicken wire, you can lay plastic sheeting designed for use in gardens.This method works best if there are only a few particular areas of your yard that cats are using as a litterbox, since it is not convenient to cover large sections of your yard in chicken wire.

Discourage the behavior early.,
Don’t let them pounce on you during the day.,
Don’t chase the cat back.,
Give the cat time outs.,
Spray your cat.",How to Stop Your Cat from Pouncing on You1," One way that a lot of people play with kittens is by hiding their hands under fabric and having the kitten pounce on it. If you encourage your cat to play like this at a young age, they’ll keep doing it in adulthood. One way to keep your cat from pouncing on you is by teaching them early that it’s not appropriate play with you that way.Instead, encourage them to chase other toys, rather than your hands.;
, A lot of people find that their cats pounce on them while they’re sleeping, particularly on their feet. A good way to stop this is by not letting your cat pounce on you during the day. If you are already allowing this, stop it. This will eventually teach your cat it’s not okay to do at all., If your cat does pounce on you, your first reaction might be to chase your cat back. If you do this, however, your cat will think this is a fun game to play, and it will actually encourage the pouncing behavior. If they pounce on you, just walk away while saying “no.”, If your cat pounces while you’re playing, give it a “time out” by walking away. This tells your cat that certain types of play are okay, but that pouncing is bad., If all else fails and your cat keeps pouncing on you, spray them with water from a water bottle. You should spray them immediately after they pounce on you so they connect pouncing with the punishment. If your cat pounces quite a lot, you might have to carry the water bottle with you for a while.

The water bottle should be new or should never have been used for anything other than water.
Don’t spray your cat in the face when you’re using this method. Only spray their bodies."

Keep the cat inside.,
Ignore your cat if it does catch a bird.,
Get a brightly colored collar.,
Place a bell around the neck.,
Create an outdoor patio.",How to Stop Cats from Getting Birds1," Keeping your cat inside permanently is the easiest solution to this problem. However, cats like to roam and may start focusing on other items like your shoes. Your cat must be trained to enjoy the indoors exclusively. Buy your cat some new toys and play with your cat to keep it entertained. Eventually your cat will be content with staying inside all of the time.If you can't keep your cat inside all day, have a curfew. Sunset, sunrise, and around bad weather are prime time for bird hunting. Keep your cat inside at these times.;
, Cats often hunt and bring home their prey. When your cat brings home a bird, just ignore the cat. Do not yell at or chastise your cat. If you're cat hunts other prey and you do not mind, praise your cat if it brings something else home. Otherwise, just act indifferent to your cat.


Get rid of the prey when your cat is not looking.

, Have your cat wear a big, rainbow colored collar around its neck. It is important that the color is brightly colored because birds have great color vision and do not rely on their sense of smell like other animals do.Go to the pet store and look for the Birdsbesafe collars. These have actually been tested in scientific studies and were shown to be effective.If your cat is not used to wearing a collar, it may initially resist. Put the collar on right before mealtime or before you play a game to distract the cat.If your at is still growing, check in to make sure that the collar is still fitting properly.

, If your cat has a bell around its neck, birds will be alerted that your cat is coming. The bell should be placed on a fitted collar. Make sure the collar is not too tight. You should be able to stick two fingers between your cat's collar and the neck. To keep your cat safe, use a quick release collar that will snap open if it gets caught on something (e.g. fence, tree branch, etc.).See a veterinarian if you have questions about the fit of the collar.

, All cats will not want to stay inside all day but may get into trouble if allowed to roam freely. Creating an outdoor playground for your cat is a nice compromise. This outdoor space can be simple or elaborate and fully or partially enclosed. They are also easy to build. It's recommended that this space have 3-4 walls and a roof.Use 2x4s or 2x2s to build a frame. 1x2"" galvanized or chicken wire can be used for the walls.
A screened patio also works well for cats.
Fill the space with things that cats like (e.g. scratching posts, things to climb, toys, tree limbs, ramps, wood).Cats are climbers so make sure there is a roof.
Not only will this space keep your cat from hunting birds, it will also protect your cat from other animals.
If you do not want to build your own, you can purchase a catio kit."

Create a comfortable sleeping space for your cat.,
Play with your cat throughout the day.,
Feed your cat later in the evening.,
Set out breakfast for your cat.,
Keep your cat out of your room.,
Consider giving the cat melatonin.,
See if your cat is alright.,
Determine why your cat woke you.,
Ignore your cat.,
Be consistent.",How to Stop Your Cat from Waking You at Night," You should set up multiple sleeping areas for your cat throughout your house or in a room designated for your cat. This will discourage the cat from coming to your room at night for snuggles or attention. Lay out pillows, blankets, and nesting materials so your cat can choose what sleeping space it likes.


Consider putting up room-darkening curtains or blackout curtains in your cat's space. Since cats are most active in early morning and at twilight, the darkness may trick your cat into sleeping longer.;
, Your cat may be more active in the evening if it doesn't get enough physical activity throughout the day. Try to play with your cat for 5 to 10 minutes several times a day. If you see your cat sleeping for several hours during the day, wake it up and play with it for a few minutes. Wearing your cat out will help it sleep better at night.Try giving your cat food puzzles to play with before bedtime. This will use up some of your cat's energy and give it a last snack before bedtime which may prevent it from waking you at night for food.

, If your cat is in the habit of eating its dinner in the early evening, begin shifting its dinner closer to its bedtime. This will keep your cat fuller longer so it won't wake you in the middle of the night looking for food. Instead of making a sudden dinner time change, gradually shift its meal time back by half an hour at a time.You could also feed less food at dinner time and reserve the rest to give your cat as a snack before bed.

, If your cat is only waking you at night so you'll feed it, you may want to just set out its breakfast before you go to bed. You could also use a timed meal dispenser if you're worried the cat will eat its breakfast too early. For example, you could set the dispenser to feed your cat every morning at the same time. This way, it learns to associate food with the dispenser and it won't wake you.If you choose to give the cat its breakfast in the morning, wait a while after you wake up. This way, the cat doesn't associate waking you up with getting its food.

, If you give your cat access to your room and it continues to wake you, consider closing your door so it can't get in. You may find that closing your door isn't enough and your cat continues to scratch or paw at your door. This is why it may be important to give your cat its own sleeping space.


If you choose to keep your door closed but give your cat free range of the house, be prepared to deal with several nights of your cat scratching at your door. Ignore the behavior so your cat learns to find somewhere else to sleep.

, Once you've changed your cat's sleeping environment and schedule, your cat's night demands should drop off after a week or two. If your cat is still waking you, talk to the veterinarian about giving your cat melatonin, a natural sleep aid. Giving your cat melatonin in the evening can help it sleep longer through the night before waking you.Melatonin may be a good option if your cat wakes you multiple times in the night.

, If your cat wakes you up once in a while, you should check to ensure that it's feeling alright. You may need to take the cat to the vet if it seems in pain or has been sick, especially if your cat doesn't usually bother you in the middle of the night.If your cat is fine and repeatedly wakes you, you'll need to start ignoring its night wakings.

, Once you've ruled out any medical concerns or issues that could be keeping your cat up, figure out why the cat is waking you. Your cat may want your snuggles or attention. Or your cat may be hungry and expect you to feed it. Determining why your cat is waking you will help you prevent future night wakings.Don't forget to check your cat's sleep environment for anything that could bother your cat. Your cat may not like a bright light shining into the room or may be upset if another cat is outside meowing.

, If your cat doesn't have any medical conditions and you've ruled out something bothering your cat, you'll need to ignore the night waking behavior. Completely ignoring your cat's bids for attention will teach it to stop waking you. Remember that even negative attention is attention.For example, you shouldn't even be in the habit of getting up and moving your cat or closing your door. Your cat will see this as a response and it will continue to wake you at night.

, It may be difficult to hear your cat whine for your attention and to ignore it, but you must if you want the behavior to end. It's important to consistently ignore the cat so it doesn't expect any sort of response from you. Keep in mind that your cat's whining will probably get worse right before your cat stops waking you. Just continue to ignore the behavior.


It will take one or two weeks for your cat to learn that you won't give it food or attention when it wakes you at night.

Give your cat treats when it reacts appropriately.,
Pet your cat or show it attention when it ignores the dog or plays well.,
Don’t lavish attention on your cat when it behaves aggressively.",How to Stop Your Cat from Attacking Your Dog4," When your cat interacts well with your dog or does not aggressively hiss or swipe at it, give it a treat to reward it. The treats should teach your cat to behave well with your dog., Positively reinforce good behavior by giving your cat special attention, such as petting or extra play. This can work especially well for older cats that don’t like being bothered by a playful dog. When your cat doesn’t bat the dog to get it to go away, you can show it that you approve by speaking to the cat and petting it.

, When cats hiss or react fearfully to a dog, it’s normal to want to scoop them up and pet them so that they’ll calm down. While it may work to get your kitty calm, it also teaches your cat to attack the dog when it wants attention. While you want your cat to feel safe, make sure that you aren’t rewarding it for undesirable behavior.Be firm when you remove the cat from the situation, and then let the cat sit alone for a few minutes before showing it positive attention.
Never physically punish your cat.

Attract cats to a cat garden.,
Use plants to discourage cats from certain areas.,
Make a cat sandbox.",How to Stop Cats From Using Your Yard As a Litterbox2," If you want to keep cats out of certain areas of your yard, but don’t mind them being in other areas, then try making a cat-friendly area. Cats will be attracted to areas covered by certain plants, and hopefully leave the rest of your yard alone. Create a small plot and grow one or more of the following non-toxic plants in it:Catnip (Nepeta cataria)
Catmint (Nepeta mussinii)
Cat thyme (Teucrium marum)
Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)
Spider-plant (Chlorophytum comosum), Cats do not like certain plants, and will stay away from them. Try cultivating one or more of these plants in areas of your yard that you do not want cats using as a litter box:Lavender
Rue
Geranium
Absinthe
Lemon thyme
Thorny roses

, You can create an alternative outdoor litter box for cats by using a new or old sandbox that is at least as big as a large litter box.Fill it with soft, fine-grained sand (this can be bought by the bag at hardware and home supply stores), which cats find especially attractive. With luck, cats will be drawn to the sandbox and use it much as they would a litterbox.


Make sure to scoop the sandbox regularly; if it gets too full, cats may return to using your yard.
Keep children away from the cat sandbox, and make sure they understand not to play in it.

Create a barrier fence.Cats are persistent, and able to squeeze into many places.,
Use a motion-activated sprinkler.Motion-activated sprinklers are available from home supply stores.,
Use an ultrasonic device to deter cats.,
Use a low-voltage wire.An electric fence can effectively keep cats out of your yard, or specific areas.,
Spray cats with a hose.If you are watchful of your yard, you may be able to simply spray cats with a water hose whenever they are trying to use your soil as a litter box.,
Get a dog.",How to Stop Cats From Using Your Yard As a Litterbox3," However, a six-foot high chain-link fence, with two-by-two inch mesh can be effective at keeping cats out of your yard. A two-foot overhang can provide additional protection.

, When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your yard or areas of it that you do not want cats to use as a litter box.


These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs.

, These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear.These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your yard or sections of it that you do not want cats using as a litter box.

, As long as it is low-voltage, it will not harm the cats, only drive them away. The fence can be raised about 4 inches from the ground and still discourage them from using your yard as a litter box. .


Look for electric fencing at hardware or home supply stores. Carefully follow all installation and safety instructions.
Keep children away from electric fencing.

, Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently discourage them from using your yard.


Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enough—there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats.

, Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them from using your yard as a litter box."

Redirect their playfulness.,
Provide toys.,
Change up the toys.,
Spend twenty minutes a day playing with your cat.",How to Stop Your Cat from Pouncing on You2," Your cat might pounce on you because it’s not getting enough stimulation from other toys. If your cat does pounce, say “no,” and then throw a toy in another direction. This redirects your cat’s attention and energy toward positive play., Make sure your cat has a good variety of toys to play with. This includes stationary toys like stuffed mice, and interactive toys like chasing games. If your cat is getting enough interaction from its toys, it will be less likely to jump on you., Say your cat has a bunch of toys but still seems to pounce on you a lot. This might mean that your cat is bored with the toys it has. Try buying one or two new toys, and putting the rest in storage. From there, you can rotate the toys out every few weeks, which means your cat is always interested without your needing to replace their toys every few weeks., Your cat might pounce on you simply because it wants your attention. Try to play with your cat twice a day for about ten minutes. This will give your cat positive attention and might curb its pouncing tendencies."

Put a roof on the nest box.,
Do not feed birds at ground level.,
Protect the bird feeding area.,
Use a cat deterrent.",How to Stop Cats from Getting Birds2," Cats are nocturnal animals and realize that a nest box is an easy way to get food. They usually sit on the top of the box and put their paws in the entrance of the box to grab their prey. A roof that extends five inches beyond the front of the box will prevent the cat from reaching into the hole.You can also put a guard on the pole of the box that will prevent cats from climbing up the pole.

, Place your bird feeder high off the ground where the birds will be safer from cats. Place trays under the feeders to keep food from falling to the ground. If food falls on the ground, birds are more likely to go to the ground to eat and be vulnerable to cats. The food on the ground will also attract cats. Consider using no mess blends of bird feed as well.No mess blends of bird feeds contain seeds and nuts without shells. The birds can eat all of the food without dropping shells on the ground and attracting cats., Your bird feeding area should be in an open area and at least 10 feet away from any shrubs or hiding places. This extra space will allow birds to spot the cats and more time to get away. You can also place a fence around the feeding. Although the cats, will climb the fence, the fence will slow the cats down and give the birds time to get away.Place prickly plants around the base of the feeder to keep cats from sitting under the feeder., Using a cat deterrent is another option to keep birds safe. There are many different options. You may already have some of these. Coffee grounds, vinegar, fresh orange and lemon peels, citrus scented sprays, pipe tobacco, lavender oil, lemongrass, citronella, and eucalyptus deter cats. Apply these fragrances around the area the bird feeder is in, on the tops of fences, and around the edges of the yard."

Train your cat to be around your bird.,
Choose a safe bird cage.,
Separate them when you are not around.",How to Stop Cats from Getting Birds3," Your cat will naturally be curious about the bird. You want to get to the point where your cat does not really pay attention to your bird if they are in the same room.At the initial meeting, both your bird and cat should be in their separate cages. If your cat is not in a cage, you can just hold your catPay attention to how your bird and cat respond to each other. Does your bird appear stressed or scared? Does your cat reach for the bird?
Tell your cat ""NO!"" when it tries to reach for the bird. You must establish boundaries.
Give your cat toys, including play mice and feathers, to distract your cat when the bird is in the room.If you are comfortable having your bird out of your cage when the cat is around, do not let your cat lick your bird. This may lead to an infection.

, Your bird cage should be secure (e.g. with a lock) and high enough that your cat is unable to reach or jump on your bird.A locked cage will also keep your bird safe in the event the cage is knocked over. The cage should be large enough to allow your bird to move away if the cat's paws get through the bars.Stainless steel and powder coated, wrought iron cages are best.
Cage bars should be no more than 1/2 inch a part to prevent cat paws from being able to get through.
Using citrus oil, tin foil, or an overturned doormat with spiky traction around the bird cage will deter your cat from hanging out in that area.

, Don't leave your cat alone with bird when no one is around. If you leave them home alone, close the door to the room the bird is in.If you are not comfortable with training your cat, you can keep your pets apart all of the time. Just make sure that both of them spend enough time with people as they are social animals.

Squirt lemon juice or scent on your flower bed.,
Drizzle orange oil on your flower garden.,
Use eucalyptus as a deterrent in the flower garden bed.,
Squirt the cat.,
Leave prickly cuttings under the flowers.",How to Stop Cats from Digging in Flower Beds1," Lemon is a citrus fruit, and many cats hate the scent of citrus, and will be instantly repelled by the scent. Lemon zest is better if the flower plants are growing, but lemon juice is perfect if you have fully grown flower plants to dodge.;
, Again, many cats absolutely hate the scent (and taste!) of citrus fruits. Alternatively, you can split orange segments and place the buds around the flower beds.

, Though it may smell slightly clinical, it is a great way to repel cats. Its strong odor stops many a cat from entering the area sprayed with it.

, Use a spray bottle filled with just water. Leave it hanging or sitting very close to the affected flower bed. If you come across the cat in the flower bed, grab the bottle and spray the cat. A few short, sharp sprays will scare off puss. Repeat as needed. With luck, the cat may come to associate that flower bed with unpleasantness and will leave it alone.

, This isn't the most ideal solution, as you're likely to get pricked when clearing up the garden bed or picking flowers. However, it may work if the area is open enough and you can easily collect up the prickly matter at the season's end. Try blackberry stems, rose stems and other thorny stems.


Be aware that some cats are really not fussed at walking over the thorny branches. However, they may be far less inclined to start digging into them. At worse, they may urinate but not dig.

Know the difference between spraying and urinating.,
Understand why a cat sprays.,
Figure out why your cat is spraying.,
Keep things routine.,
Make sure your cats are getting enough space.,
Clean the urine thoroughly.,
Limit contact with the outdoors.,
Help cats adjust to any new family members.,
Have a veterinary check up.,
Neuter your cat.,
Seek medications.",How to Stop a Male Cat from Spraying," Spraying, or urine marking, is communicative behavior that can be caused by a variety of factors. Urinating, however, is usually due to need and can often be attributed to a litter box issue alone.


Spraying marks are found on vertical surfaces as a cat sprays by backing up into an object. They also have less volume than simple urinating.
The urine emitted during spraying will smell stronger as the cat releases certain chemicals to send messages to other cats.Spraying is more common in un-neutered males, multiple cat households, and in households where there have recently been changes.;
, To stop the behavior, you must understand the reasons cats spray. Spraying is a way to communicate with other cats, and knowing what your cat is trying to communicate is key to fixing the problem.


Cats are territorial and like to claim certain things and areas. Urine marking is your cat's way of letting other cats know of his presence and which portions of the house belong to him. If you live in a multiple cat household, your cat is likely claiming territory.Spraying is also a mating ritual for cats. Spraying is very common during mating season, and the pheromones in the cat's urine communicate their availability to breed. If your cat is not neutered, he may be spraying for this reason., Now that you know the causes for spraying, ask yourself a series of questions about your own house. This can illuminate the reasons your cat may be spraying.


Is there a new baby or pet? This might mean your cat feels threatened and wants to mark his territory.
Are there any neighborhood cats that could be coming into your yard, causing your cat stress?
Have there been any changes to your cats routine? Cats dislike change, and sometimes act out when their routine is disrupted.
Do you have multiple cats in your home? If so, do they all have enough space?
Have there been any changes to the little box lately?, Changes in a household can cause stress that triggers a cat's insecurity, leading him to spray to claim his space. If your cat has been spraying, establishing a routine can reduce his stress and eliminate spraying.


Feed your cat at the same time each day, and keep his litter box, bed, and toys in the same areas.If you have company, put your cat in a separate room. This is especially important if your visitors have cats of their own whose scents may be transmitted via their clothing. This can trigger stress, and in turn spraying.Certain pheromone sprays, available at most pet stores, are designed to calm cats. If you know a big change is coming, such as a new household member or pet, investing in one of these sprays can help cats transition., If you live in a multiple cat household, spraying is often a result of a cat's territorial nature. Making sure all your cats have adequate space can reduce spraying.


Provide multiple perches. Cats love to be up high to observe. You can either clear a window sill or space on a bookshelf or purchase cat condos/cat trees from local pet stores.Have multiple sources of food, water, scratching posts, and toys available.Provide more than one litter box. Although spraying is different from urinating, limited litter box space can trigger territorial responses like spraying. Invest in more than one litter box, and scoop both daily., Repeated spraying often comes in response to the scent of a cat's urine, especially in multiple cat households. Pet odors needs to be neutralized in order to stop recurrence.


Anything that can be washed in a washing machine should be, using standard detergent.A concoction made from 50% water and 50% white vinegar can be placed in a spray bottle and squirted onto surfaces where a cat has sprayed. This neutralizes the odor and discourages future spraying.Local pet stores, branches of Petco, and even some supermarkets and department stores sell cleaners laced with synthetic pheromones and certain enzymes that remove odors that encourage spraying., Oftentimes, conflict with a neighborhood cat results in spraying. Even if your cat is not allowed outdoors, if they see or smell a cat through the window they may resort to spraying.


Move furniture your cat likes to perch on away from the window. Consider investing in a cat tree to give them an alternative resting spot.Close windows, blinds, or doors.Consider attaching a motion detection devise to your lawn sprinkler, which will cause the sprinkler to squirt water towards your cat when he goes to the window., A new baby can cause spraying as your cat wants to make sure his territory is not being invaded. You need to ease your cat into this transition to make sure he doesn't start spraying.


Keep on a schedule, even if it's tough. When the new baby, your schedule will probably change dramatically. Try as best you can to keep consistent with your cats feeding, sleeping, litter box cleaning schedule.
Do not give your cat extra attention before the baby arrives, as he will become accustom to added affection. This will result in a bigger letdown when the baby comes, which might make your cat act out for attention.
Introduce new toys and baby supplies to your cat by letting him smell and examine them after unwrapping. Anything with a new or unfamiliar smell can cause spraying., While spraying is usually a behavioral problem, if making certain household adjustments does not resolve the issue a trip to the vet is needed. A basic exam can rule out or identify and treat any medical problems that may be causing the spraying. Bladder control issues, especially in older cats, can be a sign of serious problems like organ failure.

, If your cat is not fixed, this may be what's causing the spraying as the behavior is used to advertise to mates. Spraying is a sign of sexual maturity in cats, and having your cat fixed can stop the behavior.


If possible, have your cat neutered before he is 6 months old. More than 90% of cats will not start spraying if they're fixed in this time frame.In older cats, roughly 87% will stop spraying after being neutered. While the majority stop immediately, a little under 10% will take a few months to cease spraying., Spraying, even when caused by stress or anxiety, can be treated with certain medications prescribed by a veterinary professional.


Anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, given orally, can be obtained by consulting your vet. These can ease tensions caused by a multiple cat household or anxiety caused by an erratic schedule.Always consult with a veterinarian, and know your cats medical history. Certain medical issues can interact poorly with medications.All medication has potential side effects. Ask your vet what side effects to look for, and how severe such side affects are, before giving your cat any meds.

To put an end to this immediately, it is necessary to put something solid - like a door - between your cat and the couch (or any other item he is scratching inappropriately.,
If there is no way to isolate the cat, it would be best to put something heavy (heavier than the cat) up against the damaged furniture.,
An essential piece of cat gear is the scratching post.,
Clipping your cat's claws is something that takes some getting used to.,
After getting the Brazilian sisal rope scratching post (best to get 2 or 3) set up, it should be placed in a high traffic area.,
The best way to teach a cat to use a scratching post is to help him discover the post on his own, with the aid of a simple piece of string.,
Spraying a cat with water is not a desirable way to deter him from improper scratching.,
While catnip can be a nice addition to a cat's diet and can make him silly and wacky, this harmless herb alone will not show a cat how to use a proper scratching post.

,
Once the cat has established a habit of scratching on the sisal rope scratching post, he can be reintroduced into the entire house, and obstructions can most likely be removed.

,
It's always a good practice to make gentle, soothing, and encouraging sounds when your cat is scratching his post.",How to Stop a Cat from Scratching the Couch," This is a temporary measure. The cat can be reintroduced to his entire domain after these other steps have been accomplished.;
, Something like an end table, a chest, a wall, or even a cinder block or two. Again, this doesn't have to stay there in the long run. It is just to end the destruction immediately.

, Not just any scratching post. It needs to be as tall as what he is destroying now. So measure up to the highest point of the damage. This is probably going to be somewhere around 24"", and it wouldn't hurt to go up to 35"" or even 48"" when you get your cat's new post. The post also needs to be stable. This means that the base needs to be EITHER at least 60% of the height of the post (for a 24"" post, the base should be at least about 14 1/2"" square), or made from heavy material, like 5/8"" to 3/4"" panel. Finally, this scratching post should be wrapped with 3/8"" Brazilian sisal rope. It can be wrapped on the top half with this rope. Not recommended: hemp, jute, or manila. Totally carpeted scratching posts could be considered, but this 3/8"" Brazilian sisal rope is very long-lasting, and cats find that they can really sink their claws into it for a satisfying scratch that is likely to be repeated. Carpet, like corrugated cardboard (sometimes used for scratching pads), will leave a big mess on the floor, and will also need to be replaced frequently. Many sisal rope scratching posts can last upwards of 8 years. Many scratching posts are made with 1/4"" sisal rope. In addition to having a shorter life, they are typically prone to being too loosely wrapped to be of much use. There are cheap ""traffic cone"" scratching posts sold in all the major pet supply stores, and they are bound to be ignored by the cat.

, But after being shown by your vet the proper way to do this regular bit of cat maintenance, it can become routine. The best time to clip a cat's claws is when he is relaxed and sitting - maybe even sleeping - next to you. Many times, this task can be accomplished swiftly without disturbing the cat.

, If the cat generally sits with you while you watch TV, put it at the entrance to this room. Other high traffic areas are just inside the room where the cat is fed, at the entrance to the room where his litter box is, and near a window where he likes to sit & watch birds.

, An effective method is included as a source, here.

, Water is terrifying to a lot of cats, and it's just not necessary to intimidate your cat in any way for any reason. This also applies to striking, yelling at, or otherwise imposing your substantial size advantage on your critter.

Understand that kittens learn how to play gently from their littermates.,
Be aware that a kitten will chase and bite your feet because she is dealing with her natural hunting instincts.,
Tire your kitten out by playing games with a toy on a string to keep yourself safe from bites.,
Keep your kitten from getting bored as much as possible.,
Redirect or disengage if your kitten bites you.,
Break the biting habit with a bitter taste.",How to Stop a Kitten from Biting1," A vital part of a kitten’s early life is play with her littermates. It is through bites and scratches from her fellow kittens that she learns what hurts and how to be gentle when she is playing.If a kitten is deprived of this early experience, for example if she is hand-reared, or a lone kitten, then she is less likely to have a concept of what is painful and what isn’t.;
, It is a kitten’s natural instinct to chase anything that moves in training for hunting prey (even though she will most likely never have to hunt). As she reaches around twelve weeks of age instinct tells her to bite prey to kill it. Eventually, the scenario arises where she chases moving objects, such as human feet or hands, and then bites them.


Unfortunately, the kitten’s behavior can be reinforced by the reaction of her victim. You are bitten and react with fear, it reinforces your young cat’s instinct to chase and bite her quarry.

, Kittens are geared for bursts of wild energy and this is when they lose their inhibitions about biting. The trick is to channel this energy safely away from your hands and feet, by getting the kitten to play vigorous games of chase with a toy on a string. Tire her out with the toy while keeping your hands and feet at a safe distance.A kitten can normally play in bursts for 5 to 10 minutes and then she will have to stop and lie down. Only pet her once she is calm again, and then reward this calm behavior with small food treats.

, When kittens get bored, they build up excess energy that can lead to wild bursts of biting frenzy targeted at your feet. Provide her with plenty of toys and switch up which toys are available for her to play with so that the toys seem new and exciting each time you rotate them.There are lots of automated toys on the market that are battery operated and can be programmed to start moving at certain times, hence catching her attention and keeping her mentally stimulated even when you are out.

, Teach your kitten that you will not engage in aggressive play. If the kitten does bite you, say “no” in a firm voice, and pull your hand away. Give them a toy to play with instead. Don’t go back to petting them or letting them play with your hands until they have calmed down., If your kitten absolutely will not stop biting you, try putting a bad-tasting but non-toxic substance on your hands before playing with or petting the kitten. The kitten will quickly come to associate biting you with a nasty taste. You can get bitter apple or bitter cherry spray for this purpose at most pet stores, or at your vet’s office."

If you want to get your cat used to bathing, hold her and rub her down a little. Make sure she's comfortable with your touch before trying to bathe her. This process with vary in length depending on your cat. Very skittish cats may take longer to train.Touch your cat's ears, mouth, and nose. You should also touch her feet gently. Pet sensitive areas, like her belly and legs.
While you do this, whisper sweet, soothing words to your cat. If she resists, gently pull her back towards you and reassure her. When she behaves, give her treats and praise as a reward.;
, When your cat stops resisting your touch, introduce water. Get a wash cloth slightly damp and run it over your cat's body.Repeat the same process you used when touching your cat, but incorporate the washcloth. Rub the wash cloth over her ears, mouth, nose, and sensitive areas like her belly.
If your cat resists or tries to pull away, speak to her gently until she settles down. Praise her when she behaves.

, You should not just submerge your cat in a bath without getting her wet first. Water can be shocking to a cat, so get her used to water first by pouring water over her back. You should not bathe your cat until she cooperates with water being poured on her. Cats will take different amounts of time to adjust to bathing to water. A skittish cat may take a few weeks, while a calm cat may only take a few days.As with the other parts of the process, reassure your cat the entire time. Speak to her softly and gently pull her back towards you if she resists. Make sure to gently move your cat's head upward by pushing on her chin. You do not want water to get into her eyes.
Dry your cat afterwards by wrapping her in a warm towel. Cuddle and praise her during the drying process.

, You want your cat to think of water and touch as peaceful experiences. Therefore, be reassuring throughout the process. Talk to your cat the entire time in a soft voice to make her feel safe. When she behaves, give her treats as a reward.Cats generally do not take well to scolding, so do not scold your cat if she misbehaves. This is only likely to aggravate her, making the entire process of bathing more difficult. Even if you get frustrated, resist the urge to scold your cat.

, Cats are usually well-equipped to clean themselves. They spend a lot of time grooming, so there is usually not much of a need for regular bathing.In the event your cat does not adjust to your touch and water, you may want to refrain from bathing your cat. You can try brushing your cat instead, which can remove dirt, grease, and dead hair.

, Timing is key when it comes to bathing a cat. You do not want to put your cat in a bath when she is agitated. Wait for a moment when your cat seems to be in a good mood.Think of times when your cat seems calm. She may be docile and pleasant after her dinner, for example. She may generally settle down after a few minutes of play.
Choose a time when you know she will calm to bathe her. If she is relaxing on your lap purring, it may be a good time to give her a bath.
In some cases, you may not be able to wait for the ideal time. If your cat got into something toxic, or was sprayed by a skunk, call a vet. Your vet may advise you to wash your cat immediately or to bring your cat in for washing and grooming. If you attempt to bathe a cat that's distressed, he or she may bite or claw, which can cause injury. It's best to consult a vet for advice for you and your cat's safety.

, You should always brush your cat before bathing her. This will remove loose fur, dirt, and grease. You should also clip any mats out of her fur prior to the bathing process.Even when not preparing a cat for a bath, you should groom her regularly. Grooming your cat a couple of times a week promotes blood circulation and keeps her coat smooth and clean.
If your cat resists being brushed, talk to her softly and offer treats and praise throughout the process.

, You can bathe your cat in the sink, the bathtub, or a small container big enough for your cat. Ideally, you should have a spray nozzle to use for bathing.Only fill the sink, tub, or container with 3 to 5 inches of water.
Make sure it's lukewarm water. Water that's too hot or cold could make your cat uncomfortable. Test the water with your fingers before placing your cat in the tub.

, Your cat may be nervous, especially if this is her first bath, so go slowly. Talk to your cat the entire time in a gentle voice as you place her in the water.Use the spray nozzle, if you have one, to get your cat thoroughly wet. Do not spray directly into her face, and make sure not to get any water in her eyes, nose, or ears.
If you do not have a spray nozzle, you can use a pitcher or cup to get your cat wet.

, Once your cat is wet, you can add shampoo. Make sure to use a shampoo specifically made for cats. Dog shampoo or human shampoo is not appropriate for a cat's bath.Work from the head to the tail when as you lather your cat. Massage the shampoo into her coat. Be gentle and make sure to praise your cat for behaving.
Always avoid the face. The eyes, nose, and mouth should not come into contact with shampoo. You can rub your cat's face down with plain water after the bath.

, It's vital to get any shampoo residue out of your cat's fur. You do not want your cat to lick up leftover shampoo. It can also irritate your cat's skin.Use your spray nozzle or cup to pour clean lukewarm water over your cat. Again, make sure to avoid the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Keep rinsing your cat until you do not notice any suds or bubbles coming off your cat's fur. Make sure you rinse all areas, including areas like the stomach, legs, and paws.

, Wrap your cat in a warm towel to dry her. Make sure to dry your cat in a warm area that's away from any drafts.You can also use a blow dryer if your cat is not afraid of the noise. If you do so, make sure to use the lowest heat setting.
If your cat has longer fur, you may have to brush her again after her bath to remove any tangles.

, Your cat may scratch during the bathing process. Clipping her nails can protect you from harm. Clip your cat's nails in a quiet room, and wait for a time when she is calm.Take your cat's paw between your fingers. Massage it for about three seconds and gently squeeze the paw so her claws come out. If your cat pulls away, do not pull back. Simply follow the motion of her paw, while keeping your fingers around the paw.
Clip the tips of your cat's nails. Make sure you do not clip into an area known as the quick, as this will cause bleeding. The quick is marked by a reddish or pinkish portion of the nails. Only clip the clear part of your cat's nails.

, Water in your cat's ears could potentially cause an infection. Prior to bathing her, place two cotton balls in either ear. After her bath, remove the cotton balls and discard them.Cats may resist this, so go slowly and reassure your cat the whole time. You may want to practice putting cotton balls in your cat's ear prior to the bath.

, Your cat may have crust or debris around her eyes and nose. Do not wash this out with shampoo. Instead, get a cloth damp and gently rub away any dirt or debris from your cat's face.If your cat gets scared, talk to her gently throughout the process to keep her calm. Always praise your cat for behaving.

, It's possible your cat is very aggressive about bath time. While cats do not necessarily need regular baths, you may need to take your cat to a groomer under certain circumstances. If your cat has mats, fleas, or is covered in dirt and grime, take him or her to the groomers if you can't bathe your cat yourself."

Never cut off your kitten’s escape route.,
Try to build a relationship between your kitten and children.,
Ignore your kitten to build her confidence.,
Reward ‘brave’ behavior.",How to Stop a Kitten from Biting2," A trapped kitten will feel overwhelmed and bite as a means of defense. If she has gone to ground, leave her be. Pulling her out from under a bed will only intensify feelings of fear and reinforce that she is right to be frightened.If your kitten is hiding because she got scared, place some food or a treat within her reach and leave the room. When she perceives the threat has gone, she will then have a reason to come out that will also reward her ‘bravery’ for coming out of her hiding place.

, As odd as this may sound, kittens and children can have a hard time getting along. This is because children have a hard time understanding that kittens need to be handled gently, and don’t always like to be picked up. If your kitten is frightened of children, help her get over these feelings. You can do this by:


Teaching your kids to be gentle with the kitten. You can do this by modeling gentle and appropriate petting and playing behavior. Explain in simple terms how to touch the kitten, e.g., “Hand flat when you pet the cat!” or “Use nice, soft touches, like this.” Praise your kids when they pet and play with the kitten appropriately.
Having your children give treats to the kitten. This will help the kitten learn to associate your kids with good things.
Feeding the kitten in one half of the room, while the kids sit in the other half of the room and ignore her. Explain to your children that they should never disturb the kitten when she is eating because she might see them as a threat.By learning that the children are not a threat (to herself or to her food), she will gradually view them with less fear and begin to associate them with nice things (like eating food).
Always supervising your kids around the kitten, and intervening if necessary.

, Cats may feel threatened by direct eye contact. Thus, an anxious kitten may misinterpret you looking at her as a threat, rather than as affection or concern. To help build your kitten’s confidence:


Lie flat on the floor. A human standing up is an intimidating thing for a small animal.
Turn your head away from your kitten. If your kitten approaches, do not turn and look, but let her investigate in her own time. This will make her more comfortable with you.

, Positive enforcement of exploratory behavior will help teach the fearful kitten that new experiences can be good. To do this carry a bag of cat treats with you. If you notice the kitten venturing out from behind the sofa, casually drop a treat within her reach so that she associates the big, wide world with nice things like food.

Redirect your kitten’s agitation with a toy.,
Recognize signs that your kitten has become agitated in the future.",How to Stop a Kitten from Biting3," Redirected aggression is responsible for half the attacks by cats on people. It occurs in kittens when they get frustrated. When a kitten becomes aroused to the point of attack but cannot to do anything about it so she redirects her pent up emotion to the next closest thing. Often this is the person who disturbs her, and she lashes out and bites.


For example, if your cat sees a bird out the window but can’t attack because there is a window pane in the way, she may redirect her anger to the next thing that moves or disturbs her, like your foot.

, When you recognize signs of agitation, you should also try to redirect your kitten’s frustration towards a toy. Once that pent up frustration is channeled in a more appropriate direction, she will become her friendly kitten self once more.


Toss your kitten a catnip mouse or get her chasing a toy on a string.

, The key to remaining bite-free is to put some distance between yourself and your kitten when you notice her becoming agitated, frustrated, or scared. Signs that you cat is agitated and may bite include:


Flattening ears.
A flicking tail.
Skin twitches.
Wide, staring eyes.
Fluffed up coat.
Vocalizing low growls.

Afterwards, put your cat on a regular grooming schedule. Other reasons for shaving your cat include cat allergies, hairballs, dirty bottoms, and excessive shedding. In these cases, you can reduce the fur's thickness by thinning it.Generally, it is best to avoid unneeded shaving.


Your cat’s coat is designed to keep him cool in the summer and warm during the winter. If you shave too much of your cat’s hair, you will interfere with your cat’s temperature regulation.
If you have a long-haired cat, consider brushing her to keep her cool instead.
Not all cats should be shaved. Highly aggressive, elderly, or ill cats can become stressed or nicked during shaving.;
, Check local prices and locations. Pet groomers are trained to treat your pet’s hair. Although it is more expensive than shaving your cat at home, it might be worth it. Groomers are less likely to accidentally nick your cat. They also know how to keep pets calm during the grooming process.


Prices vary depending on what service you need. If you want basic grooming (rather than a full shave), the cost will be lower.

, To be safe, check with your vet before shaving your cat. If your cat’s fur has a tangle, your vet might prefer to remove it herself. Additionally, your vet might advise you not to shave your cat or to only do it during certain seasons. She also might have recommendations for groomers or tools.

, If you decide to shave your cat at home, being prepared will make the process easier. Collect rubber gloves (to prevent scratching), towels, a brush, treats, appropriate clippers, and a #10 blade.You can purchase a pet hair clipper from your local pet store or online. Be sure to purchase a tool designed for small animals rather than for humans.


Do not use a razor blade.

, Shaving your cat on your own would be very difficult. It is best to find someone who can hold the cat while you shave your pet. Try to find someone who already knows your cat, like your partner, child, or close neighbor. Your cat will trust these people more than a stranger.


Train your cat to associate grooming with positive things like petting and rewards. Show her the tools you will use and then give her a treat, praise or pet her.When starting a grooming session, have your helper pet the cat first on the grooming table so that your cat becomes calm. After your cat is purring, have your helper gently hold the cat in place with two hands. There might be moments, like when you are working in the tail area, when your helper will need to hold the cat in her arms., Decide where you want to shave your cat. There likely will be hair all over, so keep that in mind. Aim for a site with tile or wood flooring rather than carpet. A kitchen or bathroom would work well. Shaving your cat in a familiar environment can help keep your cat calm.


Find a table that you can use where you can place your cat. Pick a table that you don't mind accidentally being scratched or made dirty.

, It is a good idea to clean your cat’s hair before shaving her. Brushing your cat’s hair will remove dirt, spread natural oils throughout her coat, prevent tangles, and keep her skin clean and irritant-free. If your cat has short hair, you only need to brush her once a week. If she has long hair, you should brush her every week. To brush your cat, follow these steps:


Use a metal comb.
Comb her fur from head to tail. Start with her belly and legs. Be gentle near her chest and belly areas.
Untangle any knots.
Use a bristle or rubber brush to remove dead and loose hair.
Brush her in an upward motion.
Brush her tail by parting it down the middle and brushing the fur to either side., There are multiple ways to shave your cat. It is best to have a plan in mind before beginning to shave your cat. Consider the reasons (e.g. hygiene, age, hair length, etc.) for shaving your cat before choosing a style.


The sanitary or hygiene cut frees the anus area for easier cleaning.
The belly shave removes hair on the belly where matting often occurs.
The comb cut removes some but not all hair and essentially thins the hair. It is effective for reducing shedding.
A popular grooming style that reduces shedding is the lion cut. With the lion cut, your cat retains hair on her face but loses the rest of her hair.

, Make sure you do not shave your cat for too long with electric clippers. They will get hot. Take frequent breaks to let them cool. Your cat's skin is very sensitive, which is another reason to watch the heat of the clippers.


Consider using lubricant to aid shaving.

, When shaving your cat, be sure to stretch the skin enough so you do not nick your cat. Be sure you have calmed your cat sufficiently before trying this step. Having another person to help with this step is also a good idea.

, Have your clippers proceed in the direction of the lie of the fur. Aim to skim the clippers over the surface. Avoid applying downward pressure to the clippers as this is more likely to abrade the skin and cause clipper-rash --- a painful condition which causes the cat to lick to try and settle the inflammation and usually causes infection.


Shaving against the lie of the fur increases the risk that you will snag your cat's skin.

, To give your cat’s coat enough protection from the sun and cold nights, leave one inch (2.54 cm) of hair. Too close of shaves can result in guard hair being embedded under the skin. This can lead to irregular hair growth and skin problems., Do not shave further down the legs and paws where skin, ligaments, and tendons are sensitive to nicking. Do not shave any whiskers (including by the muzzle, above the eyes, and the backside of front paws).If your cat appears particularly agitated while you are shaving near a sensitive area, stop immediately.

, This cut is appropriate for long hair and overweight cats. The sanitary or hygiene cut is purely functional. It helps keep your cat's fur clear of waste that sticks to him after litter box use.Complete this cut every six weeks.Use a cat clipper with a #10 blade.
Hold your cat still.
Trim the hair around the anus. Be careful not to nick your cat.

, Appropriate for long haired cats, the belly shave removes most of the hair underneath your cat. This cut is an extension of the sanitary cut. It makes it easier for your cat to clean himself.A belly shave prevents matting and excessive shedding. You cannot see a belly shave when your cat is walking.Use an appropriate cat fur clipper.
Pull the skin taut.
Shave under the tail and around the rectum.
Shave between the rear legs.
Shave up the belly area to the armpits of the front legs., This trim leaves approximately 1/2″ to 1″ (approximately 1 to 2.5 cm) of hair on the cat’s body. You trim the hair short but do not shave it completely.Cats may not have matting for this cut.The comb cut reduces shedding and hairballs. It also makes it easier for you to inspect your cat's body for skin-related issues.Attach a snap-on comb to your clippers.
Start clipping behind the ears.
Clip your cat's back to the base of its tail.
Clip down the shoulders and the sides of your cat.
Turn the cat on its side.
Clip the cat's belly.
Clip the cat's legs.

, Start near the base of the tail on your cat’s back. Use a #10 blade clipper and shave against the growth of the hair. Shave up the back toward your cat’s head., Work down to your cat’s belly. First, shave with the hair growth so you can remove most of the hair and see better. Then, reverse the clipper’s direction and shave upward to get a smooth finish., For the lion cut, there are two primary tail cuts: the full tail or the pom-pom tail. The pom-pom tail looks like it has a fluffy ball on the end. The style you choose depends on your personal preferences. Here are steps on how to complete each cut:


For a full tail, move the clippers down to the tail’s base to create a line. Reverse the clippers to shave upward and provide a clean finish that will blend into your cat’s back. Shave to the underside of the tail. Keep the line even all the way around.
For a pom-pom tail, hold two to three inches (approximately 5 to 7.5 cm) of your cat’s tail in one hand. With the other hand, shave down the tail toward the pom. Use the clipper blade to create a pom line similar to the line created for a full tail. Then reverse the clippers. Shave upwards toward the body. Shave all sides of the tail until the finish is smooth and even., Fully extend the legs. Pull the loose skin of the armpit taut to prevent nicks or cuts. Shave up and over the elbow approximately one inch. Using the bare line underneath the arm, work toward the front and even up all sides. Again, use the clippers to shave with the growth to create a line. Reverse the clippers then and shave against the growth to smoothen the finish and define the line.

, First, extend the rear legs. Shave downward to remove the bulk of hair and gain visibility. Next, shave upwards against the growth. Shave until just above your cat’s ankle joint.

, Pull the ruff forward and start shaving at the back of the neck. Pull the skin taut and back. Work forward with the clippers against the growth. Imagine your cat is wearing a collar. Use the natural collar line as the guide. Once the lines become even at the back of the neck, move to the front of the cat's chin. Shave upward to her natural collar line. Then work around both sides of the neck to blend the front and back lines together, keeping with the natural collar line.

, After you finish these steps, give your cat a degreasing bath. Use a shampoo appropriate for cats. You can purchase these shampoos online or at your local pet store. If your cat has sensitive skin, your vet might have a shampoo recommendation. Follow these steps:


Place a rubber bath mat in a sink or tub to provide secure footing for your cat.
Fill the tub with three to four inches of lukewarm water.
Place your cat in the tub.
Use a spray hose to thoroughly wet your cat. Do not spray her directly in her ears, eyes, or nose. A large plastic pitcher or unbreakable cup will work in lieu of a spray hose.
Gently massage your cat with shampoo. Work from head to tail.
Thoroughly rinse your cat with the spray hose. Avoid the ears, eyes, and nose again.
Dry your cat with a large towel., After you have bathed your cat, blow dry her. Use the ""cool"" setting so that you do not harm her skin. Smooth any rough spots on her hair. Make sure the hair is well-blended and very smooth., Your cat’s fur helps prevent skin cancer by blocking harmful UV rays. When you shave your cat, he loses some of that protection. Be sure to apply pet-specific sunscreen to prevent sunburn and skin cancer. You can purchase sunscreen online at retailers like Amazon or in your local pet shops.

If you don't do this, the discharge can stain your cat's coat and also lead to infections if the cat's eye ducts get blocked up.While cleaning around your cat's eyes, it is a good time to inspect their eyeballs. Exotics can be prone to problems with their corneas, such as scratches or ulcers, so look at their eyes regularly to make sure that the surfaces of their eyes are smooth.;
, Even though an exotic shorthair has shorter fur than a Persian, they still need occasional combing to keep their coats in good shape. Combing your cat while it is in a shedding cycle will help to get rid of excess hair before it is all over your house and to keep the cat from ingesting too much, which can lead to hairballs.Use a metal long-toothed comb to comb your cat. These combs are sold at most pet supply stores.

Nails that are too long can be uncomfortable to walk on, can snag furniture, and the snagging can cause the nails to be ripped off.

, Just as with all cat breeds, giving your exotic shorthair quality cat food will make it healthier and will potentially help it to live a long life. A quality cat food consists of mostly animal tissue, as cats are strictly carnivores. Look at the ingredient list and make sure the food you choose has animal tissues, such as seafood or meat byproducts, as the first couple of ingredients. This will help assure that you are feeding your cat mostly animal tissue.In addition to the ingredients list, make sure that the food you choose is made for your cat's age. Food that is made for kittens, adults, and senior cats is formulated for the specific nutritional needs of those periods of life.
In addition to animal tissue, commercial foods may have added vitamins and minerals to give the cat proper nutrition.
Choosing between dry, semi-moist, and wet cat food is largely based on what your cat likes. However, wet cat food can be a great source of water for a cat that does not drink a lot of water.

, Cats should have constant access to cool, clean water. They may not drink it constantly but they should have access to it in case they need it.


Many cats are enticed to drink running water. Giving your cat a drinking fountain, which are specialty cat products that recycle a stream of water constantly, may help it to stay hydrated.
If your cat is dehydrated and does not want to drink water, consider feeding it wet food.

, There are a wide variety of dangers outside that can be hazardous to your cat's health. These include cars, diseases, parasites, toxins, and other animals. To avoid these hazards, it's best to just keep your cat inside.Not only does keeping the cat indoors increase its life expectancy, it is good to keep cats inside to protect wildlife, namely native birds.
Because exotics are not very active cats, most do not mind staying inside. However, you will need to provide enrichment for them, such as toys and viewing platforms that stimulate their minds.

, Keeping your cat happy and healthy will require that you give it a clean and tidy place to go to the bathroom. This means that you should clean the cat's litterbox daily and use a type of litterbox and litter that the cat likes.If you do not supply a clean and appealing litterbox, your cat may choose to go to the bathroom in other places in your home.

, In order to take proper care of your cat, you will need to give it love and attention. Spend time with it when it comes to you for affection or attention. With an exotic shorthair, you will likely know they want attention when they walk up to you and stare you down. The time you spend with them can be spent petting them or playing games with them.

Give your cat a variety of toys it can chase and play with. These could include bell balls, fabric mice, laser toys, or strings or puff balls.Additionally, make sure it has access to a window where it can look outside. This will allow the cat to get stimulation from looking at everything going on outside.

, Cats don’t like sticky or uncomfortable places to walk. To help deter your cats, make the surface undesirable. Place double-sided tape on the edge of counters, tables, or other high surfaces you don’t want your kitten jumping on. Cats don’t like sticky things on their paws, so they will not want to jump again.Try placing aluminum foil on surfaces you don’t want your cat to jump on. This will startle them and deter them from jumping again.
You can also place plastic carpet liners with the bumpy side up. The cat won’t like the way the small protruding bumps feel on their paws.

, Remote correction methods help reduce unwanted behavior when you are not around. They include motion-activated sprays or buzzers near areas where your cat jumps onto high surfaces.This helps the cat not associate the punishment with you while giving the behavior unwanted associations.

, Though you don’t want your cat to associate you with punishment, you can still deter them from jumping onto high places. When you see your cat jumping onto a high place or about to do it, you can hide out of sight and make an unpleasant noise that will scare your cat and let them associate the behavior with the unpleasant, stressful noise.


For example, you can use a whistle when they jump onto a surface. It will startle the cat and cause them stress.
You can make a shaker out of a can and rocks or coins. Whenever the cat jumps, shake the can to startle the cat.

, If you don’t want to buy commercial repellents or remote correction methods, you can make your own. These methods provide a startling experience for your cat so that they will be discouraged from jumping.For example, you can place cookie sheets on the edge of the counter. Your cat will jump on the counter, land on the cookie sheet, and be startled by the noise when the sheet falls to the floor. You may also place water on the cookie sheet, which will deter your cat.
Try a can trap. Fill a can with coins or rocks and connect it to a string. Place the can and string in an area where the cat will knock over the can when they jump onto the high surface.

, Cats don’t always respond well to punishment. Cats may become stressed instead of changing the behavior. If you have multiple cats, you may make a different cat think they are doing something wrong, like using the litter box or playing, if the noise trap goes off while they are doing the activity. Try other methods before using punishment.Be especially careful if you are using a shaker can or air horn yourself. You never want your cat to see you.

Know that aggression can be a cat’s way of showing you he is afraid.,
Try to understand why the cat is afraid.,
Look for warning signs of aggression.,
Do not make eye contact with the aggressive cat.,
Avoid cornering the cat.",How to Stop an Aggressive Cat1," A cat will do everything he can to avoid getting into a fight. However, if he is very afraid and sees no other way of defending himself, he will lash out at you., The key to stopping an aggressive cat who is afraid is understanding why he is afraid. Stopping his aggression may be as simple as stepping a foot or two back and giving him some space. Maybe you made a loud noise that startled him, or you moved quickly and it frightened him. Whatever the reason, it is generally best to give a cat some room when he is becoming aggressive.If possible, walk away, or give the cat a way to escape by taking a step back and letting him pass.

, When a cat is afraid and decides to become aggressive, he will arch him back and fluff up his tail. His tail will also form an inverted U-shape. He will give you other warning signs, like hissing, growling, and flattening his ears to his head. If you see these warning signs, walk away from the cat.

, As odd as this may sound, looking away from the cat may be your best bet when dealing with a cat who is on the offensive. A cat who is about to attack another cat will attempt to out-stare his opponent. If you make eye contact with the cat, he may think that you are planning on attacking him, therefore look away as soon as you notice any signs of aggression that the cat is displaying., One of the most common situations in which a cat becomes aggressive is when he finds himself cornered with no means of escape. If you are approaching a cat and he has nowhere to go (for instance, in a hallway or alleyway with no open doors), he may choose to become aggressive because he is afraid of you.


If you see the warning signs mentioned above, walk away or go around the cat so that he has a way to escape.

It will also help spread natural oils produced by your cat’s skin throughout its fur.This will increase the overall shininess and sleekness of your cat’s coat.


Brushing your cat frequently will also reduce the amount of fur that it swallows when grooming itself, thus reducing the number of hairballs it produces.
Begin grooming your cat at a young age so that it will get accustomed to it.Professional cat-grooming services may also be available in your area. Prices for these services can vary widely.;
, Long-haired varieties of cats will need more frequent brushing than short-haired varieties. Long-haired cats will need to be brushed once every few days, while short-haired cats may only need grooming once a week.Other experts suggest brushing long-haired cats for at least 15 minutes per day., To brush your cat well, you will need a quality general brush, a steel comb, and a rubber or bristle brush.All of these should be versions designed specifically for cats.


Optionally, a fine chamois or washcloth can be used to wipe your cat after brushing.This will remove any remaining hairs and improve the shine of your cat’s coat.

, Starting with the general brush, stroke your cat’s fur softly, working from head to tail.Next, use the steel comb the same way. This will help remove any dirt and debris. Finally, use a bristle or rubber brush, which will remove any loose hairs.


If your cat’s fur has any tangles, carefully work those out before brushing its whole coat.
If you wish, wipe your cat with a chamois or washcloth after brushing to maximize the shine of its coat.Make sure to be gentle on your cat’s sensitive areas, such as its belly.
To brush the tail of a long-haired cat, make a part down the middle and brush fur to either side.

, Cats are known to be self-grooming, and will only rarely need a bath.However, if your cat can’t or won’t groom itself well, you may need to bathe it more frequently.How often to bathe your cat will depend on its breed and activity level. Long-haired or especially active cats, for instance, might need to be bathed more frequently. A cat that is arthritic and has difficulty grooming itself, however, might also need to be bathed more frequently.

, You may want to place cotton balls in your cat’s ears to keep water out of them.


Choose a bath time when your cat is calm. Playing with your cat before giving it a bath might help to calm and tire it a bit so that the bath is less stressful.Try to soothe your cat before the bath, by giving it a small treat, talking softly to it, or petting it.
You may also want to clip your cat’s nails before bathing to protect yourself from scratches.

, Before bathing your cat, you should brush it thoroughly.Then, take a washcloth dipped in plain lukewarm water and use it to carefully wipe in and around your cat's ears. If your cat’s face needs washing, you can also use this cloth to gently wipe it., Fill a tub or sink with enough warm (not hot) water so that you will be able to wet your cat, but not so much that it could be submerged. If you are using a tub or basin to bathe your cat in, place a towel or non-slip rubber mat in the bottom.If your cat has something to hold onto during the bath, it might feel more secure and be calmer.


Make sure that the room you will bathe your cat in is warm (70 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer), as your cat may become cold when it is wet., You may need the help of another person to put your cat in its bath.Cats generally dislike water, and this step might be slightly stressful on yours.


You may also want to protect your hands in arms from cat scratches and bites by wearing gloves and long sleeves when bathing your cat.

, Cats have different skin characteristics than humans, and so you should not use human shampoo or soap to bathe your cat.Check your local pet supply store for shampoos and conditioners specially formulated for use on cats, or ask your veterinarian for advice.


If your cat has skin allergies or other issues, your veterinarian may prescribe special shampoos. Be sure to carefully follow all accompanying instructions.

, Using just a bit of shampoo and lukewarm water (one part shampoo to five parts water), massage your cat’s fur. Work quickly but calmly, and be careful to attend to any problem areas (dirt, matted hair, etc.). Work from head to tail, being careful to avoid your cat’s eyes and ears.


You can also use a gentle spray hose or bottle to wet your cat.Talking to your cat in a soothing voice may make the bath less stressful.

, Since cats are such persistent self-groomers, you can expect yours to start “cleaning” itself with its tongue and paws after you bathe it. Before you let your cat out of the bath, make sure to thoroughly rinse its fur free all traces of shampoo or conditioner, so that your cat does not accidentally swallow any.Otherwise, your kitty might wind up with an upset tummy or other problems.

, Once your cat is well-rinsed, remove it from the bath. Using a cloth or paper towel, blot its tail and legs to remove extra water.Wrap your cat in a towel to dry it. Keep it warm until its coat is dry.If your cat is short-haired and your home is warm, it may be able to dry on its own without a towel.
Hair dryers may not be a good choice for use on cats as they can dry out your cat's skin, or even cause them to have heat stroke; in addition, the noise may bother some cats. If you wish to use a hair dryer, make sure it is on the lowest (or “cool”) heat setting., A bath alone may be enough to make your cat’s fur sleek and shiny. However, if its hair is long, tangled, or matted, you may find that brushing afterwards will help., Bathing can be stressful for many cats, so reward yours with a treat afterwards.Petting or otherwise soothing it can also help to calm it down.

, To have a healthy coat, a cat must eat a healthy diet. Whether your cat eats canned food, dry food, raw food, or a combination of these, its diet should be high in proteins and fats.Your cat should also always have plenty of clean, fresh water to drink.Talk to your veterinarian for specific advice about selecting the right foods for your particular cat.

, Commercial cat foods can vary in quality. To ensure that your cat’s coat stays healthy-looking, check the food’s nutritional content (listed on the label) and make sure it matches your cat’s current needs.


To ensure quality, you can look for a cat food with a label showing that it has been certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).Raw meat diets are recommended by some experts as a way of making it easy for a cat to get the nutrients it needs.

, Your cat’s dietary needs will vary throughout its lifetime; foods that are designed for kittens are not suitable for older cats, and vice versa. The nutrition your cat needs also depends on its individual factors, like health and activity level.If your cat is not receiving the right kind of food for its age and activity level, its coat may look coarse and dull.

, If you are feeding and grooming your cat according to its needs, and its coat still seems dull, brittle, or coarse, talk to your veterinarian about the problem. Health problems, such as digestive issues, parasites, cancer, obesity, or stress can affect the appearance of your cat’s fur.Your veterinarian can determine if there is an underlying health problem causing the poor coat quality.

Know what a tarantula spider is.",How to Identify a Tarantula Spider1," Here are some key characteristics.



Physical features: Large and hairy

Venomous: Yes. But most are not medically significant, meaning at worst you can probably expect mild symptoms such as a bee sting. However in exceptional rare cases a stronger reaction may occur

Lives in: Habitats range from arid scrub to rain-forests and jungles: South America, Central America, Southern states of North America, but also much of Africa Southeast Asia, Australasia and also southern parts of Europe

Eats: A tarantula will pounce on any prey that it can subdue. It kills by injecting its venom through its fangs and into its prey. Examine the areas of invertebrates like grasshoppers and beetles, but also lizards and rodents. Tarantulas may find these all very tasty, but if you spot their likely prey, you are not likely to see a tarantula in pursuit.

Understand that a cat can become aggressive when she is in pain.,
Use a blanket or towel as a barrier between you and the cat.,
Talk soothingly to the cat.,
Secure the cat with the towel.,
Put the cat in a carrying box.,
Take the cat to the vet.",How to Stop an Aggressive Cat2," Sometimes, you may need to approach an aggressive cat in order to help her. In this instance, it is less about stopping the aggressive cat, and more about preventing her from injuring you or yourself while trying to help her., The best way to secure an aggressive cat that is in pain is to cover her with a blanket or towel. Its first important to keep the cat from attacking your legs and feet. To do this:


Shake out the towel and grip one of the long edges, placing your hands about a third of the way in from either end of the towel.
If the injured animal is on the ground, hold the towel at ninety degrees (or perpendicular) to the ground, with the long edge parallel to, and touching, the floor.
Hold the towel at arms’ length, acting as a vertical barrier between your legs and the aggressive cat.

, While holding the towel in between you and the cat, walk very slowly towards her and talk to the cat in the most soothing voice that you can muster. Talk quietly and in an even tone, making sure that you don’t make any loud sounds or sudden movement.


Don’t shout if the cat attacks the towel. If the cat is very scared, she may charge at the towel. Don’t yell, as this will only bring out more aggression.

, With a quick, confident movement, grip the cat’s chest firmly through the towel, one hand on either side of the rib cage, and lift her up off the ground. Hold the cat in a towel at arms’ length with her rear end dangling down, head up, and spine roughly vertical (the cat will attempt to curl up).


In this position, even if the cat turns to bite, your hands are protected by the towel. Likewise your hands and body are well away from her claws.

, Have someone open up a box or carrier cage for you to put the cat in. Move swiftly and calmly to the carrying box and, without removing the cat from the towel, place her and the towel inside the box. Make sure that the lid is secure.

, Rather than letting the cat deal with the issue on her own, you should immediately take the cat to a veterinarian so that the source of the pain (and the aggression) can be found.

Look for a very large, hairy body and hairy legs.,
Check for a red-brown to black color; most tarantulas don’t have obvious markings.,
Observe the form.,
Look for a single small group of typically eight eyes on the forehead, but all tightly clustered onto a single mound, not like shown here.,
Look at the features of the mouth area; there are two backward-pointing fangs just below the eyes and 2 pedipalps (leg-like appendages) near the mouth.,
Notice the fangs; tarantula’s fangs (and in other close families) move up and down (paraxial), whilst all other spider’s fangs move horizontally (axial) to pinch.

",How to Identify a Tarantula Spider2," However, some adult tarantulas can be less than 0.5 centimeter (0.2 in)!


The body length and height can be up to 3” (76 mm).
The leg span can be as much as 3 to 5” (76 to 127 mm).;
, However color is extremely variable, and many other distantly related spiders are the same colour as many tarantulas

, A tarantula like all spiders has a frontal segment (opisthosoma) connected through a narrow waist to the abdomen which is oval-shaped.

, This would be a huntsman. Another often confused are Wandering spiders, where two of the eight eights are lower down and closer to the mouth parts than the remaining eyes

, The direction the fangs bite can be very diagnostic - if biting 'backwards' (paraxial) then this reduces the possible identity to just several broad groups (spider families) which includes tarantulas.

Look for tarantulas in trees as well as under tree roots.

,
Examine rock cliffs for makeshift tarantula burrows.

,


An adult females is jet black with a variable red stripe on the back of its abdomen.
An immature female is usually brown and smaller with whitish markings.
A male Redback spider (rarely seen) is small and brown with red and white markings."

Be careful around building foundations, outside buildings--including outhouses, piles of outdoor storage materials and furniture.

,
Wear thick gloves if you are going to lift rocks or logs; they like to nest under those objects.

,
Always wear gloves and long sleeves when gardening.

,
Look before you reach into your mailbox.

,
Keep in mind that if you illuminate your porch, the light will attract insects that the Redback likes to eat, and will provide an ideal location for a web.

"
Apply ice to the bite.,
Take a non-prescription painkiller until you can get medical help.,
Prepare yourself for the primary symptoms; profuse sweating, vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle spasms and severe pain.

",How to Identify a Redback Spider4," If you don’t have ice, use the coldest water you can find, but do not bandage the area where you were bitten—the venom does not move fast and a tight bandage will only increase the pain you will feel.

, The pain for the first 5 to 10 minutes after a bite will be tolerable; after that, the pain is intensified.

,"
"
Move away from the cat.,
Watch for the cat’s flash point.,
Be mindful that some cats don’t have a flash point.",How to Stop an Aggressive Cat3," If you are petting a cat who is semi-wild (what veterinarians refer to as feral), or the cat was never really around people or other animals when she was young, she may suddenly turn aggressive without any warnings. This is because she never learned how to say “that’s enough” in a nice way--she will attack your hand rather than getting up and walking away.Because of this, you will need to be the one to walk away. If a poorly socialized cat becomes aggressive, simply stand up and move away.

, If you are petting a cat that you know might become aggressive at the drop of the hat, watch for her ‘flash point’. This is the telltale sign that she is about to turn aggressive, even if she was just affectionately rolling around on your lap. The flash point signs include:


A twitching tale. An agitated cat will subtly start to swish her tail back and forth.
Skin twitches. Similar to when a fly lands on a horse’s skin, and the horse moves the skin to get the fly off, your cat might twitch her skin when she doesn’t want to be petted anymore. A skin twitch will look like a slight muscle movement that will also move the fur in a specific spot on the cat’s body.

, Sadly, some cats won’t give you any warning sign that they are about to become aggressive. If you know that a certain cat has a habit of suddenly becoming aggressive without warning, proceed with caution when you choose to pet her.

"
"
Counter-condition your kitty.,
Avoid petting your cat’s belly.,
Expose your kitten to humans at an early age.,
Have your cat spayed or neutered.,
Take your cat to the vet on a regular basis.,
Give your kitten or cat toys.,
Make sure your cat has a good hiding place.,
Never use violence to punish your cat for being aggressive.",How to Stop an Aggressive Cat4," Sometimes, an aggressive cat will need to be trained out of his aggressiveness. To do this, keep some cat treats handy. When you pet your cat, hold a treat in one hand and pet the cat with the other. Watch his tail--he will start to swish his tail back and forth when he becomes aggressive. As soon as you see this movement, give the cat a treat. Doing this several times a day will help your cat to associate your petting with treats and gradually he will likely grow less aggressive., Some cats really don’t like to be rubbed on their bellies and will become aggressive if you pet them in that area. In the wild, a cat would never expose his belly to an attacker because it is the most sensitive part of his body. That natural instinct still lives on in many cats. To avoid bringing out your cat’s aggressive side, stick to petting him on the head and back.

, One of the reasons that a cat can be aggressive towards people is because he didn’t get used to humans at an early age. If you have a kitten, make sure that he gets to hang out around people starting around when he turns 12 weeks old. Let people hold him, pet him, and play with him., Aggression is linked to sexual urge, so when a cat is spayed or neutered, the sexual urge is--for the most part--removed, as is aggressive behavior. Of course, your cat might become aggressive for another reason, but getting your cat spayed or neutered can certainly lower his or her chances of developing serious aggression., As discussed in a previous section of this article, cats can become aggressive when they are in pain. Taking your cat to the vet on a regular basis will help to keep your cat healthy and pain-free.


Make sure your cat gets vaccinated for rabies during one of his trips to the vet. While there are many diseases that can cause aggression, rabies is definitely the worst and can actually be fatal for both the cat and yourself.

, Sometimes, kittens will mistake your toes or feet for toys. If you let this mistake continue, your kitten could grow into a cat that aggressively attacks your feet whenever you walk in the door. To avoid this, give your cat or kitten toys that he can play with. When your cat goes to attack your toes, throw a toy (like a ball of yarn or a squeaky toy) in the opposite direction to distract your cat.


Scratching posts are also good toys for cats. They help your cat to release pent up energy and helps them to learn not to scratch you or your furniture.

, Sometimes cats will want to be alone. Your cat needs a place to unwind and feel safe. A dark corner of a room, or an elevated spot where they can sit and watch you without being seen will do nicely.


A cardboard box that has been turned upside down is a perfect hiding spot. Cut a small hole in the box so that only your cat can fit into it.

, If your cat scratches you and you lash out by hitting your cat, you may break the bond formed with your cat. A cat that has been abused by a person will be very wary of getting close to another person so never use violence to show your cat that he was wrong to scratch you.

Know what a Portia spider is.",How to Identify a Portia Spider1," Here are some key characteristics.



Physical features: .24” to .39” (6 to 10 mm) long

Poisonous: No

Lives in: world-wide

Eats: The Portia Spider hunts and eats other spiders. They will eat any type of spider, including spiders that are 200 times their own size, but they prefer web spiders, probably because they have specialized techniques for stalking and capturing other spiders in their webs. The manner by which they stalk and capture their prey is fascinating because they use specialized tactics for each type of spider they are hunting. Some of their clever hunting schemes include: Imitating a fly caught in a web, pretending to be an inanimate object, conducting the mating ritual of a specific spider species, attaching their own web to the web of their prey, catching a fly and putting it in the spider’s web; while the spider is eating the fly, the Portia sneaks up and eats the spider.

Check that the spider has a brown body and yellow markings on its abdomen.,
Determine the size of the spider.,
Use a magnifying glass or a microscope to examine the spider’s palpi.,
Confirm the spider is not another type of spider.,
Confirm the web is at ground level.,
Check if the web is shaped like a funnel.,
Note if the web is not sticky to the touch.,
Look for any blistering or open wounds around the bite.,
Note if you develop a severe headache, nausea, or fatigue.,
Seek medical care if you have a hobo spider bite.",How to Identify a Hobo Spider," Hobo spiders have a brown front body, where its legs, also brown, are attached. There are usually darker brown markings on its front body that can be seen if you examine the spider up close. You should also see a pattern of yellow markings on its lower body or abdomen area, though you may need a microscope or a magnifying glass to spot the yellow markings., Hobo spiders are often smaller than other spiders. Male hobo spiders can be 7-13.55 mm (9/32 - 9/16 in) long and female hobo spiders can be 9.5-16.5 mm (⅜-⅝ in) long. It may be helpful to compare the spider to a brown recluse spider to see if it appears smaller.Hobo spiders also have shorter legs than other spiders, with a leg span of less than two to three inches., The more distinguishing features of a hobo spider can be seen better with a magnifying glass or a microscope. The smaller details on the spider’s body can help you determine if you are dealing with a hobo spider.Male hobo spiders will have two large palpi, one on each side of their head by their mouth, that may look like boxing gloves under a microscope. These palpi are the male genitalia and may appear swollen. Female hobo spiders also have palpi but they will not appear swollen.You should also look for fine, almost clear hairs called plumose setae on the spider’s body. You will need to use a strong hand lens on a microscope to see these hairs. They will lay flat on the spider’s body and be hard to see with the naked eye., Hobo spiders are often confused with brown recluse spiders and other spiders. However, you can identify several physical markers on the spider to confirm it is a hobo and not another type of spider.Check if the spider has spots on its sternum, which is the flat shield like section on the top of the spider, surrounded by its legs. If there are three or four light spots on the sternum, it is not a hobo spider.
You should also look for two long, distinct stripes on the front part of its body, where its front legs are attached. If there are two long, distinct stripes, the spider is likely not a hobo spider. Hobo spiders have indistinct or diffused patterns on the front section of their bodies.
Look for any legs that appear shiny, hairless, and dark-orange in color. These are all indications the spider is not a hobo spider.
Unlike brown recluse spiders, hobo spiders do not have dark bands on their legs or a violin shaped pattern on their heads. Brown recluse spiders also do not have any markings on their abdomen, while hobo spiders do.

, Hobo spiders are not vertical climbers, so they will usually build their webs at ground level or below ground level in basements. If the web is located in a ground level or below ground spot, you may be looking at a hobo spider web., The hobo spider is a member of the funnel-web spider family. They use their long legs and running abilities to create webs that are funnel or tube shaped.


These funnel shaped webs may be attached between two stationary objects at ground level, such as two planters or two tree branches. Sometimes, hobo spiders will also create webs under the siding of homes, in basements, and between plants or weeds.
Unlike hobo spiders, brown recluse spiders do not build webs. So if you notice a funnel shaped web in the spider’s environment, you can rule out classifying the spider as a brown recluse.

, Unlike other spiders, hobo spiders create non-sticky webs. The web will trip the prey and the hobo spider will attack the prey before it can escape.


Hobo spiders have poor eyesight so they tend to be more aggressive to humans than to other spiders. Partly, hobo spiders are aggressive because if they do not attack, they could die of starvation.

, Most hobo spider bites feel painless at first. You may notice a small bite that appears red, like a mosquito bite. But within 24 hours, the bite will start to develop into a blister. Within 24-36 hours, the blister will break open, leaving an open, oozing wound. At this point, your body is reacting to the spider’s venom.

, The most common symptoms of a hobo spider bite is a severe headache, nausea, and fatigue. You may also experience temporary memory loss and vision impairment due to the bite. These symptoms will likely occur within 24-36 hours of the bite.If the hobo spider bite is not treated, you may have reoccurring side effects due to the poisoning, such as severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, soreness in the bite area, and flu-like symptoms.

, If you have been bitten by a hobo spider, you should first clean the wound thoroughly with antiseptic. Show the bite to a doctor so you can get antibiotics and/or a tetanus shot to prevent an infection.Most hobo spider bites will scab over within three weeks of the initial bite and leave a permanent scar on your body. If the bite develops in fatty tissue on your body, such as on the inside of your arms or legs, the bite may be very deep and not heal for two to three years.

Look for short spinnerets.,
Look for a burrow.,

Watch for mouse spiders on the ground.,
Observe the spider running.,
Look for spiders on the move in the day time.",How to Identify a Mouse Spider," Since the mouse spider is a ground spider, they have very thick and stocky (almost muscular) legs. Female mouse spiders, too, have thicker legs than male spiders. In addition, the male mouse spider may have long palps that appear as an extra pair of legs.;
, Both male and female mouse spiders range between 20 to 35 mm in body length. The females, however, tend to be toward the longer part of this range., Male mouse spiders are dark blue or black in appearance. Female mouse spiders tend to be dark brown in color. However, there is some variation between the 8 different species of mouse spiders., Male mouse spiders can be either red or black on the front of their body. This bright red color is a tell-tale sign of certain mouse spider species and should not be dismissed as another sort of spider., Spinnerets are the part of the spider’s body that typically spins the web. They are found near the front/head of the spider. Although Mouse spiders don't spin webs, they do have very short spinnerets.The last section of mouse spider spinnerets appears button-like or dome-like.

, Mouse spiders dig their homes – burrows – into the ground. Burrows can be identified by the pyramid-shaped mounds of soil that are often found beside them.

Burrows are often characterized by a small hole in the ground with two right angle side-tunnels jutting off almost immediately. The side tunnels may then go straight down and may have a chamber that breaks off from the main tunnel., Mouse spiders live exclusively in Australia. They do not, however, live in Tasmania. While they have been exported and introduced elsewhere, there is no evidence that breeding populations exist outside of their native range., Mouse spiders live throughout Australia and are common in populated, suburban areas, outside of the cities. Their burrows can be found in suburban yards, in pastures, in parklands, and elsewhere., Mouse spiders live throughout Australia. They inhabit forest environments and dry arid environments. As a result, they can potentially live in just about every climate in Australia., Mouse spiders do not spin webs, and as a result, are often found on the ground. In their range, they can be observed on the floor in dark areas of the home. Thus, if the spider is spinning a web, it is probably not a mouse spider., Mouse spiders are active and vigorous hunters. You may see them wandering at night chasing their prey. In fact, mouse spiders can run quite fast., While many species of mouse spiders are night time hunters, they can also be very active in the daytime. This is especially true during the late summer, fall, and early winter. In addition, you may see mouse spiders moving around during the day after a heavy rain."

Look at the shape of the spider's body.",How to Identify a Nursery Web Spider1," The nursery web spider is one of the largest true spiders.They are so big that they are sometimes mistakenly thought to be close relatives of the tarantula.The nursery web spider's body is typically about a quarter of an inch to an inch in size, but it may spread its legs out to as far as three inches.;
, Although there are several different variations in coloring, nursery web spiders generally have a base color that is tan, gray, beige, or buff, with darker brown stripes or other markings.Close inspection of the legs of these spiders will reveal small black spines sticking out.

, Nursery web spiders have eight eyes. They appear in two horizontal rows. The bottom row is nearly straight, while the top row curves upward forming a ""u"" shape.The eyes of the upper row are somewhat larger than the lower one.
Examining the eyes, if you can get close enough to do so, is a good way to differentiate between the nursery web spider and the wolf spider, which have a different arrangement of eyes. Specifically, wolf spiders have three rows of eyes., The nursery web spider has a slender body.Its abdomen is widest in the middle and tapers toward the rear.Male nursery web spiders are typically very slender. An egg-bearing female, however, may have a very large abdomen.

Practice matted hair prevention from early in your cat's life.,
Make sure that your cat is grooming itself effectively.,
Keep a close eye on cats with long hair.",How to Prevent Matted Cat Hair1," Many people have problems because they didn't groom their cat's coat in earlier life, because it wasn't necessary to do so. However, as the cat gets older and needs a little help, they are unfamiliar with what you are trying to do and can resent the tugging and pulling on their skin. The cat then hisses or spits, and it can become dangerous to continue.In an ideal world you would plan ahead and get the cat used to being groomed and accept it as a pleasant experience from kittenhood. This involves short daily grooming sessions accompanied by lots of praise and a treat or two. Kittens under around 18 weeks of age are receptive to new experiences so the more she is brushed before she reaches this age the more she accepts it as normal.;
, Cats shed hair all the time. Mostly the cat grooms out the shed hair or else it is rubbed off on your sofa and clothes. However, older cats that are arthritic and stiff, can have difficulty turning around to get to all parts of their body. This means the shed hair doesn't get shifted and sits in place clogging up the rest of the coat.


You can usually tell if your cat has this problem because the coat has a ""felted"" appearance and is dull. If you grasp some of the hair tips in the felted area and pull gently the hairs come away painlessly., Long-haired cats usually have a soft coat that is subject to static and tangles easily. The first places to get knotted are those areas where fur rubs on fur, such as in the armpits, between the back legs, under the chin, and behind the ears. However, when the cat curls up to sleep the fur can also mat up.Certain breeds of cats, including Persians, Birmans and Himalayans, have silky, fine hair that is especially prone to matting. Pay extra close attention to brushing and grooming these breeds and other long-hair cats.

Watch for an egg sac.,
Look for a nursery web.,
Watch hunting behavior.,
Observe posture.",How to Identify a Nursery Web Spider2," Possibly the easiest way to identify a female nursery web spider is to watch for any spiders that are carrying an egg sac. A nursery web spider will carry her eggs in her fangs until they are nearly ready to hatch.The egg sac looks like a tiny white golf ball. It typically contains a few hundred eggs.The spider will carry the egg sac underneath her body., When it is almost time for the eggs to hatch, the female spider will spin a protective nursery web. This tangled web is usually spun in high weeds or low shrubs, with the egg sac itself suspended inside a leaf.After spinning the nursery web, the mother spider will stand guard over it until the eggs have hatched.The nursery web spider will shelter the young spiders until they are ready to fend for themselves.

, Nursery web spiders, unlike many other species, do not spin webs for hunting purposes. Instead, these spiders hide in wait for prey (typically insects) and then spring out quickly to catch it.Instead of entangling insects in a web, the nursery web spider simply overpowers and subdues its prey.These spiders hunt both by day and by night.

, A nursery web spider, while at rest, will often adopt an ""X"" shaped posture, holding its front and hind pairs of legs together."
"
Learn the nursery web spider's range.,
Look for them in their normal habitats.,
Watch for them in the right season.",How to Identify a Nursery Web Spider3," Nursery web spiders are quite common across much of North America. They are most commonly found in the eastern part of the US and southeastern Canada.People disagree about how far west these spiders can be found. Some say they have been found all the way out in the states of the West Coast.Others disagree. It is safe to say, however, that they are less common in western states and provinces.

, You can look for nursery web spiders in a variety of different types of habitats. They are often found near water.They are known to inhabit the following areas:


Woodlands
Farms and gardens
Grasslands and heaths
Old fields
Rocky areas along the edge of streams and other water

, Nursery web spiders mature in late spring and reproduce in the summer.They are most often seen between the beginning of May and the end of July.Juvenile spiders will hide under loose bark or rocks in the fall and will remain there for protection during the winter. They will emerge in the spring mature.
Like most spiders, the lifecycle of this spider is about year.

Use the correct tools to groom a short-haired cat.,
Use the correct tools to groom a long-haired cat.,
Groom your cat routinely.,
Be sure to comb the undercoat as well as the top coat.",How to Prevent Matted Cat Hair2," For short haired cats, invest in a Zoom Groom type tool or a rubber hand mitt. The Zoom Groom is designed to mimic the motion of a cat being licked by another and cats find this very pleasant and indulgent. The Zoom Groom is a rubber grooming tool that draws out shed hair from the coat by gentle friction, much as a tongue pulls out the dead hair.


Many cats will purr ecstatically while they have a Zoom Groom spa treatment and this is a great way to keep a short-haired cat's coat from becoming knotted.
It also has the advantage that the grooming tool is soft and so there are not hard metal teeth to catch against sore joints and hurt the older arthritic cat.
Start using one in kittenhood and not only will the cat look forward to his or her daily grooming sessions but it will have a luxuriously glossy coat to boot., Invest in a well-made cat rake and long-tooth comb to properly help prevent matting. Rakes have short, sturdy bristles that are usually made of metal and are good for brushing dense, long hair.


Long-tooth combs allow you to comb deep into your long-haired cat's fur and comb through small mats before they get too large. Both items can be found in pet and retail stores.
Use the comb first, gently combing through the coat much as you would comb through your hair to tease out any tangles. Grip the knot between finger and thumb and work above your fingers so that you are not tugging on the skin. Start at the top of the knot (the end furthest from the skin) and gently separate the knot until it begins to part. Then work down a little deeper. Sometimes it is helpful to use your fingertips rather than the comb, to open up the mat. Keep working gently until the tangle is removed and you can comb through.

, By grooming your cat every day you catch mats in the early stages, while they can still be untangled. Begin a regular brushing routine on your long-hair cat's coat before mats occur. Work with your long-hair or short-hair cat daily so he or she gets used to being brushed. If you get your cat as a kitten, start when he or she is young.

, Run the rake deeply but gently in the underlying fur, called the undercoat ,where mats begin as tangles. Rakes penetrate down to the under coat and reach deeper than a Zoom Groom or rubber mit. The rake helps to remove shed fur from the soft undercoat, which is often where tangles start to develop.

"
"
Acclimate your cat to touch.,
Brush slowly and gently.,
Scruff the cat if you cannot get it used to combing.",How to Prevent Matted Cat Hair3," Many cats are hesitant to be brushed because they never became accustomed to being handled by humans. Slowly get your cat used to your touch by petting it for brief sessions every day.


If your cat responds negatively to your touch, then you need to find another time in the day to pet it. Even a cat that doesn't like to be petted may have a time in the day when it is more open to it.

, Brushing is the best method to avoid mats, so if your cat doesn't like being brushed you should try to get the cat used to it. Pet the cat until it is relaxed and hopefully purring. Let the cat sniff the comb and then gently pass the smooth side of the comb over the cat's coat, without putting the tines through your cat's fur. Swiftly follow the comb with your hand so the comb is almost indistinguishable from a stroke.


Repeat this a few times, give the cat a treat and end the session on a high. Repeat this daily, twice daily if possibly, building up the cat's tolerance of contact with comb and having its body touched in general.
This approach works best if the coat isn't tangled, since tangles equals tugging and soreness. Thus if the coat is already knotted consider getting the worst areas clipped away and then start getting the cat used to being brushed.

, If a cat hisses and spits, and yet you want to get rid of a stubborn knot before it causes a problem, consider scruffing the cat. To do this use your non-dominant hand to grasp the cat's scruff so that you can use your dominant hand to comb the cat through. This has a naturally subduing effect on the cat, as it's where the mother grips her kittens when carrying them.


Never lift the cat off the ground completely, as this could injure an adult cat. Simply grip the scruff to stop the cat running away."

Identify cat-hair mats.,
Avoid cutting out mats if possible.,
Be very cautious if you decide you need to cut out a mat.,
Cut thick, large mats out using small scissors.,
Take the cat to its vet when matting gets too bad.,
Brush thoroughly over the areas where matted cat hair was removed.",How to Prevent Matted Cat Hair4," You can tell if your cat has matts because the clumped fur is not painful when you touch it. If you work down to the bottom of the lump you can often see the individual hair fibers bridging between the skin and the mat., When mats do occur, they can be difficult if not impossible to comb out, resulting in the need to cut chunks of hair from your cat's coat. The cat's coat will then grow back uneven, and can take months to return to normal. Therefore, it is important to learn how to prevent matted cat hair before it happens to keep your cat looking and feeling his or her best.

, If you are unable to untangle a knot, then you may need to cut it away. Proceed with extreme caution because it is all too easy to accidentally cut the skin instead of the knot. This happens because when you lift up the knot to get it clear of the skin, the skin often ""tents"" upward with it. Then when you snip across the base of the knot you may cut across an elevated piece of skin.

, Try and slide a comb between the knot and the skin, and cut above the comb so that it acts as a shield protecting the skin. Pay close attention not to cut your cat's skin, especially in areas where the hair mats are close and tight.

, If you are nervous to cut out mats yourself, or if your cat is covered with mats, take it to its veterinarian. Above all, if in doubt do not cut. Take your cat to a vet clinic or a groomers where they have professional clippers that can shear away the knot with a reduced risk of cutting the skin. Your vet is probably very practiced at removing mats.

, This will help to prevent the area from matting again. If an area has been matted before, your cat will probably continue to neglect it. Make sure that you get all the way down to the undercoat and that you brush it out regularly.

All Brazilian wandering spiders are hairy.Some spiders may be more yellowish than brown. Others may appear to have black legs, or black bands on brown legs., Brazilian wandering spiders get their name because they like to move along the floor of the rainforest. They catch prey by moving super quickly, so be wary of fast spiders you encounter in the Brazilian wandering spider’s habitat., If they feel threatened, these spiders rise up on their hind legs. This scary-looking posture will expose red hair around the fangs of some species of Brazilian wandering spiders. A spider in this defensive stance is not happy, and you should very carefully and slowly back away if you see this happen., If you live or are traveling in the parts of South and Central America where these spiders live, don’t take the time to guess if you’ve spotted one. If you have any doubt, move away slowly and avoid angering the spider.

, Brown widow spiders can look similar to certain species of black widow spiders, and their brown color can make them hard to distinguish from other spiders. Knowing what a brown widow's egg sac looks like can help you identify it with more certainty. Here are some things to look for:Size: ½ inch (centimeters)
Color: Ivory, tan, or yellow
Shape: Round and spiky
Location: On the web

, Brown widow spider webs look different from the traditional lace-like spider web. Instead, they are three-dimensional (instead of flat) and cobwebby."
"
Take note of their body size.,
Look for a light brown color.,
Notice distinguishing marks on the legs.,
Pay attention to the abdomen.,
Get a closer look.",How to Identify a Barn Spider1," Female barn spiders grow to ⅞ of an inch (2.22 centimeters), while males are slightly smaller at ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters). Measure from the back of the back legs to the front of the front legs. But just estimate lengths by sight, since touching the spider will most likely startle it and scare it away., Barn spiders are generally a light, creamy brown color, with little variation in tone compared to most other spiders.The brown color of the barn spider serves to camouflage it, so you may have to look closely to detect this spider’s presence.

, One key characteristic of barn spiders is the banded or dotted appearance of their legs. The color tone alternates from medium to light brown or white, giving the legs a striped aspect. Another key to identifying them are the small white hairs covering the legs., The egg-shaped, somewhat oblong abdomen of the barn spider is disproportionately large compared to the legs, more so than with most spiders. This can give it a swollen, almost misshapen appearance. There are also darker brown spots toward the back end of the abdomen, in a pattern somewhat resembling military camouflage., If you think you may have found a candidate, take a digital photograph of it that you can enlarge. This will allow you to get a better look at the details of its anatomy. You can also use a magnifying glass for the same purpose, along with a flashlight if the web is in a dark area.

Be aware that, although a very passive arachnid, it can pinch and does have specific needs.,
Know what kind of animal you've got:

Common Name: Vinegaroon
Scientific Name: Mastigoproctus giganteus (Lucas)
Order: Uropygi

,
Understand its anatomy.,
Be prepared for reproduction.,
Try to figure out the sex of your Vinegaroon.,
Watch out for its defense mechanisms.,
Be very gentle with it.",How to House and Care for a Vinegaroon1," If you are unable or unwilling to provide appropriate housing and husbandry, then perhaps this species is not for you.
,, Vinegaroons have heavy mouthparts (pedipalps) that are formed into pincers. The first pair of legs is long and thin and is used like antenna to feel their way around. Vinegaroons have poor eyesight. The next three pairs of legs are used for walking. The abdomen is attached widely to the head-thorax region (cephalothorax). The tail is long and thin suggesting a whip which is where the common name, ""whipscorpion,"" originates. Their chelicerae are too small to really get a hold of skin and bite with much vigor. But they will pinch pretty firmly, if they feel the need., Eggs are carried in a sac by the female. After hatching, they ride on the female’s back similar to scorpions., Sexing Vinegaroons is very difficult as it is done by a very close inspection of the cephalothorax (underbelly) and differentiating a slightly different shaped segment., Vinegaroons have no venom glands, but they have glands near the rear of their cephalothorax that can spray a combination of 85% acetic acid and octanoic acid when they are threatened. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving reasoning to the common name Vinegaroon. Unless you happen to be allergic to vinegar, then you have no reason to be alarmed, if you're ever sprayed., Typically, these critters are very tolerant of handling. Be very careful when doing so as they are not as strong as they look. A fall of even a meter can kill or severely injure them."

Know if brown widow spiders live in your state.,
Know if brown widow spiders live in your country.,
Brown widow spiders prefer secluded areas.,
Know when brown widow spiders come out.",How to Identify a Brown Widow Spider2," Brown widow spiders are typically found in the southern part of the United States. Here is a list of the states that they can be found in:Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas
California (particularly southern California), Colorado
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii
Louisiana (particularly New Orleans), Mississippi
Nevada, New Mexico
Oklahoma, South Carolina
Tennessee, Texas

, Brown widow spiders are not just found in the United State; they can also be found in other countries, including:Asia
Australia
Caribbean Islands
Cyprus
Japan
South Africa

, Like most spiders, brown widow spiders prefer dark, less-frequented places, such as woody areas. They can also be found in urban areas and around your home and backyard. Here are some places where you are likely to find brown widow spiders:Around garden, including under railings and inside empty flower pots
In closets, attics, and garages, including inside boxes and under handles
Around your house, particularly under eaves, and behind window shutters
Underneath furniture, both patio and indoor
Within folds of linen and clothing
Inside shoes

, Unfortunately, brown widow spiders are active during all four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter."

Be able to identify a brown widow bite.,
Know when to see a doctor.,
Take care of the bite by cleaning it and applying an ice pack.,
Take some over-the-counter medications.",How to Identify a Brown Widow Spider3," Fortunately, brown widow spiders are not able to inject as much venom as some other species, so their bites are rarely serious. Here is what you should expect from a brown widow bite:The bite hurts or stings a little
There is a small, red mark where you got bitten

, Sometimes, the body can have a far more severe reaction to a spider bite. If you experience any of the following symptoms, visit your doctor immediately:Trouble with breathing or keeping conscious
Muscle cramps or tremors
Muscle tremors
Sweating
Nausea and vomiting
Severe pain
Infections at the bite site, such as rashes, pus, or ulcers

, Clean the bite using soap and warm water; be sure to rinse it well. Elevate the bitten area, if possible, and place an ice pack over it; you can also use a cloth soaked in cold water. Washing the bite will help prevent infection while keeping it cool will keep the swelling down., Spider bites can be itchy and uncomfortable, and brown widow bites are no exception. If you get bitten, consider taking some medication for it:


Consider taking a pill, such as an acetaminophen, antihistamine, or ibuprofen.You can also use an anti-itch or anesthetic spray. Try to choose one that has benzocaine in it; this will help reduce the itching and pain.If the bite is red and won't stop itching, try an anti-itch cream, such as an hydrocortisone cream or a calamine cream."

Spot the orb-shaped web.,
Look for nighttime web rebuilding.,
Pay attention to daytime behavior.,
Recognize their prey.",How to Identify a Barn Spider2," Barn spiders are part of family of spiders known as orb-weavers.As the name suggests, all spiders in this family spin circular webs. The diameter of the orb part of a barn spider’s web is typically two to three feet (0.61 to 0.91 meters)., Orb weavers take great care in either repairing or rebuilding their webs daily.Barn spiders rebuild their webs each night.They begin by creating a sunburst-shaped framework for the web, then spinning the circular part in a spiral pattern, working from the outside inward., Being nocturnal, barn spiders may be easiest to locate at night when they’ll be busy spinning their web. But they can also be spotted during the middle of the day, when they can be found sitting head-down in the middle of the web.Sometimes they rest someplace secluded off the web during the day. If an insect becomes caught in the web, they will spring out to where it is entangled, and spin it in a sac of silk to eat later., The insects that will become entangled in a barn spider’s web are typically flying bugs such as mosquitoes, flies, and moths. This is especially the case if the web is built near a porch light, since these kinds of insects are known to be attracted to lights at night. But terrestrial insects such as ants and beetles can occasionally fall into the web as well.


Barn spiders eat two times their weight in insects each day."
"
Check that you’re within their range.,
Look for intersecting surfaces.,
Follow the insects.,
Search in the late afternoon and evenings.",How to Identify a Barn Spider3," Barn spiders can be found in the eastern United States, as far west as Texas, and in southeastern Canada., Barn spiders are most likely to build their webs where there are wide open perpendicular surfaces, such as in fences, trees, weeds,open doorways, window frames, bends in rock walls, where a supporting column meets the ceiling or floor, and between tree branches.And there should be plenty of open space between the surfaces, since the supporting strands of the web sometimes span more than 10 feet (3.05 meters)., A barn spider, like most spiders, will build its web near where insects are known to move about. Look for porch lights near doorways and awnings, and corners of window frames, where flying insects typically gather or pass through., Barn spiders are nocturnal, so they hide in dark corners during the middle of the day. But later in the afternoon and night, they can be found sitting in the center of their webs, waiting to catch prey. Later at night, you can find them rebuilding their webs, which they do once per day.Don’t disturb the web when you are trying to identify a barn spider. If the spider feels threatened, it will drop from its web and scurry away.

Create a dry home.,
Find an adequately-sized tank.,
Add a substrate to the enclosure.,
Provide the Vinegaroon with a hide.,
Consider a heat lamp.",How to House and Care for a Vinegaroon2," Vinegaroons are a desert dwelling species of arachnid and thus need a dry climate enclosure., Housing Vinegaroons in a 5-10 gallon (18L–37L) enclosure is a great idea. Glass or plastic is up to you. Either works fine.

Horizontal dimension is more important than vertical. In other words, make sure that you provide an enclosure that will allow for free travel throughout the substrate. Providing vertical climbing is not necessary.

, The substrate you choose should allow for safe and sturdy burrowing. This species will slightly dig and burrow during the day as they are strictly nocturnal.

Provide a substrate composed of riverbed sand mixed in equal parts with terrarium soil and forest moss or sphagnum moss. This mixture holds moisture and allows for a secure burrow to be constructed without fear of a cave in. A standard depth of about 3""–4"" (7.62cm–10.16cm) works fine.

, Anything will do, but if you are looking for a visual appeal then you can purchase a pre-manufactured hide from any pet store. This will also prevent them from having to dig as much and eliminate the risk of cave ins., If your home stays at about 78ºf–80fº (25.56ºc–26.67ºc) then you will not need a heat source to maintain a warmer environment. If you live in a cooler climate or have a colder ambient room temperature, then you'll want to utilize a low watt heat source, such as a small heat pad or blue or red spectrum heat lamp.

A 25 watt lamp works nicely. Be sure to check the temperature directly under the heat lamp or above the heat pad. The temperature should not exceed 78ºf–80fº (25.56ºc–26.67ºc).
Exposure to excessive heat will cause your Vinegaroon to become dehydrated and too much heat can kill your animal. Also, do not place the heat source any place where your Vinnie can come into direct contact with the heat. Unless you want a barbecued Vinegaroon.

"
"
Provide a shallow water dish with a wet folded up paper towel inside; this is sufficient as a water source.,
Feed your Vinegaroon appropriately.,
Give your Vinegaroon only one prey item each night.,
Never feed invertebrates from your garden or any other wild source if you even slightly suspect that there has been pesticide sprayed.,
Clean up after your Vinegaroon.,
Mist your enclosure at least once a week in cooler climates and every couple days in warmer climates.",How to House and Care for a Vinegaroon3," Be sure to switch out the wet towel every couple of days to prevent mold growth. Mold can kill your Vinegaroon., When feeding your Vinnie you can use a wide variety of invertebrates. Always make sure that the prey offered cannot overtake the Vinegaroon. They can take down good sized prey, but better be safe than sorry. Good invertebrates include:

Crickets
Cockroaches
Slugs
Snails
Waxworms
Superworms
and more.

, You can give one random night a week off where you don't feed. This helps to give your Vinegaroon a night off., Any bug spray can kill your pet., Be sure to keep the waste left behind by your Vinnie cleaned up each week. They don't defecate all that much., Keep a supply of water handy. Distilled or R.O. water is always best. And a time or two each week you should mist the enclosure to help add a little humidity and aid your pet with molting."

Avoid stimulating the cat’s skin.",How to Diagnose and Treat Hyperesthesia Syndrome in Cats," Symptoms of Feline Hyperesthesia occur in short episodes of abnormal behavior. The cat will be doing something normal, like sleeping, sitting, or walking, and then suddenly they will start moving in a repeated, twitching way. These episodes generally last from around 10 seconds to a few minutes. After the episode is over, the cat will go back to the normal behavior they were doing before.;
, During these episodes, the cat will engage in repetitive behavior that may result in self-harm. Their skin may start twitching, or the tail may swish back and forth in a violent, agitated manner. Because of this, they may start scratching or biting their skin, or they may start chasing their tail and trying to attack it.The cat make start scratching their skin in an obsessive, repetitive way, or they will suddenly start licking or biting at their back, tail, or side. Often, this is combined with removing their fur and can be considered self-mutilating behavior.
This often occurs after being touched by their owners.

, Your cat may exhibit other symptoms that make them seem frantic or agitated. They may suddenly open their eyes wide, and you may notice they have very dilated pupils. They may frantically run around the house after an episode.The skin may start rippling on the back due to twitching muscles beneath it.

, Some cats become extremely scared suddenly due to this condition. They may run away from something they think is a threat but that is not actually there. The cat may start salivating a lot or make agitated or frantic sounds.Some cats may have accidents where they suddenly urinate.

, This condition is diagnosed by ruling out other diseases. The vet also assesses the symptoms to help identify the condition. The vet will do a physical exam to check for symptoms of other diseases.Videos of your cat’s episodes may help the vet determine if the symptoms are FHS.

, There is no specific test for FHS. Instead, the vet needs to test for other conditions to rule those out before diagnosing hyperesthesia. The vet will perform blood work to check blood count, the thyroid, and the blood chemistry. They will also do skin tests to check for skin allergies or dermatitis.The vet may also do imaging tests to check for internal problems.

, In some cases, the vet will refer the cat to a specialist. These specialists will do more specific tests to rule out rare diseases and more definitively diagnose FHS. Neurologists and dermatologists are usually consulted in these cases since FHS deals with both the brain and the skin., The vet may prescribe medication to help manage your cat’s symptoms. The cat may be given antidepressants, anti-obsessional, or anti-convulsant medications. These drugs aim at calming the cat and reducing anxiety., The symptoms of this condition often occur when the cat is overly stressed. Reducing as much stress for your cat can help. Things that stress your cat may not make sense to you, like being fed at a different time.Try feeding your cat on a schedule. Routine can help ease stress for the cat.
Aggression between other pets and people in the house can cause stress to the cat. Address this aggression to help give all pets a calmer environment.

, Not getting enough time with you may cause stress. Play with them with toys, have them run around and chase small balls of paper or toys, and provide cat furniture. Cat furniture can also help them jump and run to expel energy.Exercise and spending time with you helps decrease the cat’s boredom, which can reduce their stress.

, Taking care to not bother the cat’s skin can help. Avoid scratching the cat, especially on their back. You should also be careful not to touch along their tail and the bottom half of their body. Those areas are extremely sensitive and may trigger an episode."

Schedule surgery.,
Administer an anti-inflammatory medication.,
Schedule other treatments.",How to Diagnose and Treat Horner's Syndrome in Cats," Most of the visible signs of Horner’s Syndrome will appear in your cat’s eyes. You might notice drooping eyelids, unequal pupils, and sunken eyes. There might also be redness around your cat's eyes, and the red area may be warm to the touch., If you notice your cat stumbling when they walk, they might have Horner's Syndrome. Your cat might also tilt its head to one side or the other., Because Horner's is sometimes caused by head trauma, consider if that's a possibility with your cat. Was your cat hit by a car? Was your cat in the car with you when you got into a car accident? Did it get hurt by another animal? These could indicate your cat has Horner's., To fully diagnose Horner's, your cat needs to have a complete physical examination. This might include blood work and the administration of epinephrine.The amount of time between administration of the epinephrine and dilation of the pupils can tell your vet where the injury or issue causing Horner’s is., Horner's can prevent your cat from blinking normally. The application of phenylephrine eyedrops can help dilate your cat's pupils and make it easier for your cat to blink. Your vet might also prescribe other eye medication depending on your cat's condition. You should give this medication to your cat as instructed by your vet., Your cat might require surgery, particularly if the Horner's Syndrome is caused by tumors. If this is the case, your vet will perform a physical examination on your cat to determine if surgery is an option. If it is, your vet will give your cat a general anesthetic to make it more comfortable during the surgery. Your vet will also provide you with a list of at-home care instructions for after the surgery. You should check the incision daily for bleeding or swelling, as this can be a sign of infection.Your vet may not perform surgery if he or she determines that the symptoms your cat is experiencing are less traumatic than surgery might be.

, Your cat might suffer from inflammation around the eye from Horner’s. If this is the case, your vet might recommend you give your cat an anti-inflammatory drug to reduce the swelling.Many anti-inflammatory drugs can be dangerous to cats if the dose is too large or cats take them for too long. Make sure you carefully follow your vet's instructions if they prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs., Because Horner's Syndrome can be both a condition by itself and a sign that something else is wrong, the treatment your vet prescribes will vary. Talk to your vet to get the best information possible regarding treatment options for your cat."

Monitor the kitten’s belly button after birth.,
Take your kitten to the vet.,
Get imaging tests.,
Wait until the kitten is desexed for uncomplicated hernias.,
Correct complicated hernias with surgery.",How to Diagnose and Treat Hernias in Cats1," Umbilical hernias are very easy to detect. After birth, check the abdominal area of the kittens. An umbilical hernia will be a bulging area of tissue around the belly button. This hernia will feel soft. If you push it in, it will pop back out immediately.Some umbilical hernias will gurgle when you press on it.
Some kittens may also vomit and refuse to eat.
They develop soon after the kitten is born if the opening in the abdomen that was connected to the umbilical cord does not close properly.;
, If you notice an abnormal bulge in the belly button area or hear a gurgling sound when you press on the kitten’s abdomen, take them to the vet. The vet will perform a physical exam, which is usually enough to identify the hernia.The vet may also ask you basic questions about the hernia, like when did it appear, has it gotten large, has the kitten been performing basic bodily functions, or has the kitten seemed like they were in pain.

, The vet may decide to do an x-ray or ultrasound on the abdomen. This can help determine the extent of the damage associated with the hernia. The vet will need to see if part of the intestine is inside the hernia.Determining if the intestine is involved helps the vet decide on treatment.

, Uncomplicated umbilical hernias often heal on their own by the time the kitten is six months old. The vet will check the kitten when it is taken to be desexed. If the hernia is still a problem, the vet will suggest surgery., Complicated hernias occur when abdominal organs shift through the hernia and past the muscle. This generally leads to death of some tissue and part of the intestine. This type of hernia will not fix itself, so the kitten must undergo surgery.The vet will remove dead and scar tissue and then close the hernia with sutures.
Most kittens have a complete recovery after this procedure.

They will be pale in color. You should be able to detect these lumps when running your hand across your cat’s skin, and when parting your cat’s fur to check its skin., In addition to, or instead of, small pale lumps, your cat might have a series of red, crusty bumps on its skin. These are most likely to be found near the base of the tail, the thighs, abdomen, head, neck, and on the lower back. If you notice your cat scratching or biting itself aggressively, part its fur to check for reddish, crusty bumps., When cats have flea allergies, they are very itchy. To relieve their itchiness and irritation, they will aggressively chew, bite, or scratch at areas that are especially irritated. If you see your cat engaging in this behavior, it could be experiencing a flea allergy., As a result of your cat’s constant scratching or biting due to irritated, itchy skin, large portions of its fur might begin to lose fur altogether. If your cat takes on a patchy appearance with whole sections of its fur missing, it could be a result of flea allergies., A flea comb is a fine-tooth comb specially designed to trap fleas and their feces. Have your cat stand on a piece of white paper or a white sheet when using the flea comb. Run the comb through your cat’s fur, looking for small brownish bugs (fleas) or their feces. When you comb a bug or bit of flea feces out, the white background onto which it falls will render it more visible.Flea feces looks like small, black, comma-shaped flecks of dirt.
If you’re unsure whether or not you’ve located a bit of flea feces, place it on a piece of white paper, then drop a single drop of water on it. If it runs red, it is flea feces.
The presence of fleas increases the likelihood that your cat’s symptoms are a product of flea allergies. If you don’t find fleas when combing your cat, it doesn’t mean your cat isn’t suffering from flea allergies. It could just mean that you were unable to find fleas.

, Only your vet can identify whether or not your cat has flea allergies. Your vet will draw on your cat’s medical history and the information you provide regarding your cat’s behavioral symptoms to make a diagnosis. They might also physically examine your cat for evidence of an allergic reaction, or test your cat’s skin for evidence of an allergy.In certain rare cases, if a diagnosis continues to be elusive, your vet might draw blood from your cat to test it for the presence of certain compounds that could prove the presence of flea allergies., Unless you remove the fleas themselves, your cat’s allergies will never really get better. There are a number of options for ridding your residence of fleas. You should start by thoroughly vacuuming your house and washing your blankets and bedding (and your cat’s blankets and bedding) where fleas might be hiding. After that, you’ll probably need to enlist the help of a professional flea exterminator, or place flea-specific insecticides around your home.Your vet will provide advice regarding what sort of flea treatment is best for you and your cat.

, While removing fleas from your home, you should concurrently remove fleas from your pet. There are many ways to do this. For instance, you might administer medicine (nitenpyram, afoxolaner, fluralaner, or spinosad, for instance) that causes fleas that might be hitching a ride to die. Alternately, you might spray your cat’s coat with an insecticide.Ask your vet what treatment method is best for your cat.

, Sometimes, despite your best efforts, some small population of fleas survives your home cleaning and/or the anti-flea treatment you administer to your cat. In this case, you might see another flea outbreak in the not-too-distant future. Keep an eye on your cat, checking its coat and behavior regularly for the next two months.Prevent future flea infestations by keeping your cat indoors.

, Antibiotics are useful for preventing or curing infection in your cat’s scabs and self-inflicted wounds. Common cat antibiotics include cephalexin, cefpodoxime, and cefovecin. These might be given intravenously (in the form of a shot) or administered as an oral pill.Your vet will determine if your cat requires an antibiotic, and will explain how to administer it if necessary.

, Corticosteroids are a common class of steroids that prevent the allergic reaction your cat experiences when bitten by fleas. Corticosteroids might be administered intravenously (as a shot) or as an oral medication. Your vet will decide which type is best for your cat, and will provide you with directions to administer the medicine.Common corticosteroids for your cat’s flea allergies include

, Antihistamines are a type of drug that blocks the body’s histamine receptors, the chemical agent that causes inflammation and itching.Common antihistamines administered to cats include fexofenadine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine maleate, clemastine fumarate, and cyproheptadine.Feline antihistamines are available over-the-counter, but seek your vet’s advice regarding which is best for your cat.
Some antihistamines are available as oral pills, while others are available as injections. Follow manufacturer directions for more information regarding how to give your cat antihistamines.

, To soothe itchy skin, your vet might recommend anti-inflammatory shampoos or conditioners. You can generally use these products just as you would use regular shampoos and conditioners.Fill your tub with water to a level that reaches your cat’s chest.
Place your cat in the tub, then lather the shampoo or conditioner into its fur.
Rinse your cat off using a detachable shower head or a small bowl filled with water.
Consult manufacturer directions before using anti-inflammatory shampoo or conditioner.

Try to keep the cat quiet and warm.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Calicivirus," Cats with this virus basically develop an upper respiratory infection. Part of that infection includes your cat having a runny nose.You may also notice congested breathing, which you can identify by a wheezy sound when your cat is breathing through the nose.Your cat may also sneeze, but that isn't quite as common as a runny nose with this particular virus.;
, Cats with this virus often develop conjunctivitis, which is an inflammation of the inner membrane of the eye. You may notice discharge, more blinking, squinting, or a red or swollen eyelid., While not every cat develops this issue, some cats will develop mouth ulcers. One sign that your cat has a mouth ulcer is it is drooling more than normal. Mouth ulcers can also cause severe gingivitis, inflaming the gums.Mouth ulcers usually look like small white or yellow patches. They will have red around the edges.You may notice your cat is less hungry because of this problem.

, This virus can produce muscle and joint pain in your cat, which you may notice if your cat is limping or reacts aggressively to being touched. However, not every cat will develop this symptom.Also, look for ulcers on the paw pads, which can be crusty or red.

, Some symptoms are not specific to this disease, but they show you your cat is sick. For instance, low energy, fever, and not eating can all be signs your cat is sick. You might also notice enlarged lymph nodes.With swollen lymph nodes, you may notice swelling under the chin, near the shoulder, or even in the leg., While at the vet, you'll need to tell them things like when the symptoms started and what symptoms in particular you've noticed. It would also be helpful to know if the cat came in contact with another cat who had the virus (such as the cat went outside).It's also important for the vet to know if the cat had the vaccination for this virus.

, Your vet will spend some time examining your cat's eyes, nose, and face. The vet will also likely explore the cat's body, looking for things like ulcers on the paws and pain in the cat's muscles., If your vet suspects FCV, they'll likely take samples from the cat's eyes, nose, and mouth. The vet may also take samples from the lungs. These samples will then be tested for certain diseases to narrow down what is wrong with the cat., If the problem isn't diagnosed the first time, your cat may need additional tests. Blood tests, x-rays, and diagnostic tests of discharge may all be appropriate., While antibiotics do not treat this disease, they can keep your cat from developing other infections related to the virus. Therefore, the vet may prescribe one for you to give your cat at home., The cat will often need ointments to help treat problems like conjunctivitis and mouth ulcers. You'll need to apply these medications to the areas according to your vet's instructions to help alleviate these symptoms., In some cases, you may receive eye drops from the vet for your cat. The eye drops help with the conjunctivitis and can help prevent secondary infections. Apply according to the vet's instructions for dosage.Come at the eye from the back of the head, as your cat will want to move if you come at it from the front. In fact, you can rest the bottle on the back of the head to drip it into the eye.
Wipe off any drops that go down the front of the cat's face.

, If your cat is having a great deal of muscle or joint pain, an anti-inflammatory may help them feel better. However, you need to ask your vet what is appropriate for your cat, as cats cannot take many of the medications that humans can., Other medications, such as ones to help with mucus or breathing, may also be appropriate for your cat. Talk with your vet about what's best for your cat, especially if symptoms worsen., You don't like snot or other fluids running down your face, and neither does your cat. Try to wipe away discharge from both the eyes and nose with a warm cloth to help keep your cat comfortable., A humidifier can help with your cat's congestion by keeping discharge more liquid. Run a humidifier in the room where your cat is mostly staying to keep it comfortable, as the humid air will help it breathe more easily., Many cats will be disinclined to eat because they can't smell well. Offer canned food if possible, as the increased smell may encourage your cat to eat.Sometimes, baby food (just chicken with nothing else in it) can also encourage your cat to eat. Try putting a bit on a spoon and holding it near your cat's nose.


If it becomes a problem, your cat may need a stimulant, or it may need to be hospitalized.

, Your cat will need to take in plenty of fluids, but you will need to encourage it to drink. If your cat is especially sick, for instance, you may need to bring the bowl of water to the cat to get it to drink., Keeping a cat quiet can be difficult, especially if it is starting to feel better. However, rest is best to help your cat get better, so try to encourage it by keeping noise and other distractions (such as other pets) away from the animal. Also, make sure to provide blankets and keep the area warm for the cat."

The cat also often experiences problems breathing, which may lead to resistance to exercise. The gums and lips may have a bluish tint.Cats may also not want to eat and lose weight. This may be related to problems swallowing.

, Hiatal and diaphragmatic hernias occur either due to birth defects or from trauma. Whenever your cat shows any symptoms, take them to the vet. The vet will perform a physical exam. If you have a kitten, the vet will look for other birth defects. If the cat has experienced trauma, the vet will find the injuries and treat those first., The vet will need to perform imaging tests to determine the extent of the damage. An x-ray may be used to look for herniated areas, such as gas-filled tissue or organs that have no border.Small cameras with lights may be inserted into your cat’s digestive tract to get clearer images of the hernia. This can also help the vet find complications, like foreign bodies or pneumonia.

, Hernias that occur due to trauma may need to be repaired surgically. The vet will fix the abdominal wall and restore all organs to their proper locations. Surgery will help to prevent any scarring between the chest cavity and the intestines. The cat will have to go under anesthetic.The vet may use sutures to help close the hernia. Some organs may have to be surgically attached to the abdominal wall to keep them in place.

, The vet may prescribe medication for your cat. Your cat may need medicine to help aid the digestive process. The vet may also give the cat medicine to help strengthen the sphincter, which will help with digestion.If the cat has pneumonia or a bacterial infection, they will be given antibiotics. Sometimes antibiotics are given after surgery to help prevent infection around the incision.

, The vet may suggest that you change the cat’s diet to help with their digestion. Generally, cats will need to eat smaller meals more often throughout the day. They also need foods that are lower in fat.Talk to your vet about a good low fat cat food for your cat’s condition.
The vet may also suggest probiotics or antacids to help the cat with their digestion.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Get surgery to fix the hernia.",How to Diagnose and Treat Hernias in Cats3," Perineal hernias usually occur on the side of the anus. Inguinal hernias occur in the groin area. These hernias can contain multiple organs, including the rectum, prostate, bladder, and small intestine.Because of this swelling, the way the cat carries their tail may change.

, Cats who have perineal or inguinal hernias may have difficulty with urinating and defecating. They may strain to do either process. They also may experience constipation or the be unable to urinate. Some cats may experience incontinence.Cats with a inguinal may also experience bloody urine. They also may try to urinate often., The vet will perform a physical exam to determine the type and state of the hernia. If they have a perineal hernia, the vet will perform a rectal exam. This may require a sedative.The vet may do a blood count, urinalysis, or biochemical profile.
The vet may also perform imaging tests to figure out what organs and tissues are inside the hernia, if there is cancer, and the size of the bladder and colon.

, Emergency surgery will be performed if the bladder is in the hernia since it causes the cat not to be able to urinate. In non-emergency cases, the vet does surgery to fix the pelvic diaphragm or abdominal wall. For some cats with perineal hernias, they tack the colon or bladder to the abdominal wall. With inguinal hernias, the vet may need to replace organs in the abdomen area.Male cats will be castrated during this procedure to help reduce risks of future problems.

Track symptoms.,
Be prepared to answer some questions.,
Run some tests.",How to Diagnose and Treat Megacolon in Cats1," By knowing the potential causes of megacolon, you can help to better diagnose your cat.Although megacolon sometimes occurs as a primary condition, it usually comes the result of one or more of the following:

Colon muscles that do not contract normally
 Prolonged constipation
Physical trauma
Ingesting non-digestible items
Neurological disorders;
, Pay attention to your cat's bathroom behavior. If they have stopped defecating, appear to be having trouble doing so, or seem to be in abdominal pain, there is a chance that they could be suffering from megacolon. If you notice such symptoms, you should seek veterinary care. Any time your cat stops eating or seems unusually lethargic, seek help right away.Symptoms of megacolon include:

Difficulty defecating
Pain while defecating, accompanied by wincing or meowing
Blood in fecal matter
Abdominal pain
Loss of appetite
Vomiting
Defecating outside the litter box

, When you visit your vet, plan to bring along some information. In order to properly diagnose your cat, your vet will ask a series of questions.Be prepared to describe:

The complete medical history of the cat (to the best of your knowledge)
What (if any) medications your cat is currently taking
What symptoms you have noticed
When these symptoms began
If your cat has experienced any physical trauma

, In order to determine what is going on with your pet, the vet will need to perform a series of tests.If your cat is showing symptoms of megacolon, your vet is likely to perform:

General physical examination
Rectal examination
X-rays
Additional diagnostic tests (such as blood work, urinalysis, and/or ultrasound)

Talk with your vet.",How to Diagnose and Treat Heatstroke in Cats," Shallow, rapid breathing is a common symptom of heatstroke. If this is accompanied with drooling, then your cat may be experiencing a heatstroke., Check your cat’s mouth for a bright red tongue. Additionally, check the consistency of your cat’s saliva. Thick, sticky saliva is another symptom of heatstroke. , Check your cat’s capillary refill time by lifting its upper lip. Place your finger on its gums and apply a small amount of pressure. Then remove your finger. If it takes more than two seconds for the spot to turn pink again, then your cat may be experiencing a heatstroke.Additionally, dark red gums are another sign of heatstroke.

, Difficulty moving or standing up, or refusing to move or stand are also symptoms of heatstroke. Additionally, if your cat appears very lethargic, i.e., lying down with heavy or irritated eyes, and apathetic, then your cat may be in the midst of a heatstroke.Dizziness is also a common symptom.

, Vomiting and diarrhea are common symptoms of heatstroke. Make sure to check its vomit and diarrhea for blood. If you see blood, then this is a sure sign that your cat is experiencing a heatstroke.Additionally, bleeding from the nose is also a symptom of heatstroke.

, To do this, you will need to place a conventional digital thermometer into your cat’s rectum. Oil the tip of the thermometer with a lubricant like Vaseline. Firmly hold your cat with its stomach pressed to the floor, bed or chair. Gently rotate the thermometer into your cat’s rectum. Insert the thermometer about one inch into its rectum. Remove the thermometer once you hear a beep.A cat’s normal body temperature is 100.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2 to 39.2 degrees Celsius). A body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) or higher indicates a moderate to severe heatstroke.
If you do not have a digital thermometer, then touch your cat’s nose and observe its behavior. If your cat’s nose is warm and dry, and if it seems very lethargic, then your cat may have a temperature.

, Wet a towel in lukewarm water. Then wrap the towel around your cat. Make sure the towel is touching your cat’s paws as well. This will help bring its temperature down.Alternatively, you can place your cat in lukewarm water in the tub or sink. However, make sure water does not get in its nose or mouth.
Do not use cold water. Using cold water may lower your cat’s temperature too quickly, which can cause other health problems.

, Place an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables) underneath your cat’s head. Also place the ice packs between its legs to cool your cat down., Place your cat in front of a fan, or at a comfortable distance in front of an air conditioning unit. The cool air provided by the fan or AC will help bring your cat’s temperature down.If you are on the way to the vet, aim your car’s air vents at your cat to cool it down.

, Make sure to provide your cat with cool, fresh water. If your cat is too weak to drink water, use a spoon or a syringe to place the water in the sides of its mouth. This will help rehydrate your cat.Try not to force the water down its throat.

, Take your cat’s temperature every five to ten minutes. Once your cat’s temperature reaches 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius), stop the cooling methods immediately. Remove the wet towel and ice packs, and remove your cat from the cool air.Your cat’s body will begin to cool itself once it reaches this temperature. By stopping the cooling methods, you can prevent hypothermia.

, Even if you are able to bring your cat's temperature down to a normal level, you still need to bring it to the vet to get it checked out. Your vet will check your cat to ensure that any damage to its internal organs has not occurred.They will also want to monitor your cat for a couple hours in order to treat any complications that arise.

, Your vet will give your cat intravenous fluids in order to treat dehydration. This is a routine and necessary procedure, especially if your cat refuses to drink water, or is too weak to drink water., Your cat’s airways can become restricted due to overheating. If your cat is having trouble breathing, then your vet will give it oxygen.Cortisone injections may also be given to reduce the swelling in your cat’s throat.

, Blood tests will help the vet monitor your cat’s blood platelet count. It will also help the vet monitor the clotting time of your cat’s blood., After your vet has treated your cat’s immediate symptoms, they will want to monitor it for the next couple of hours. This way, your vet will be able to treat any damage to its internal organs.Your vet will monitor your cat for heart abnormalities, brain malfunctions, kidney failure, respiratory distress, shock, and other common complications.

, Once your cat’s vitals have stabilized, talk with your vet about ways to prevent another incidence of heatstroke. This is important because cats that have had heatstroke once are at a higher risk of having another incident.Your vet will most likely advise you to keep your cat indoors on hot days, to provide cool water at all times, and to make sure your cat has access to cool areas in your house.

Check for overall poor health.,
Watch for problems with the eye.,
Monitor for neurological symptoms.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Infectious Peritonitis1," Cats may stop eating or decrease the amount of food they eat each day. Due to this, the cat may start to lose weight. In kittens, this may stunt their growth. These symptoms are characteristic of the wet/effusive type of FIP.Despite the lack of eating and weight loss, the abdomen may swell and the cat may look like they have a potbelly.
The cat may also have diarrhea.;
, Feline Infectious Peritonitis may affect a cat’s respiratory system. The cat may show difficulty breathing and wheeze. They also may sneeze often and have a runny nose. These symptoms are also characteristic of the wet/effusive type of FIP.These respiratory symptoms may be connected to fluid building in the chest cavity.

, The second type of FIP is the dry/non-effusive type. If a cat has this type, they will have poor health. Kittens may have stunted growth and not progress as they should. Cats may also show signs of jaundice through the yellowing of the inside of the eyelids and anemia. A dull coat is also common.The cat may have a fever.
Cats with FIP may show symptoms of depression or lethargy.

, The dry version of FIP may affect the eye. The eye may become inflamed and swollen. You may notice redness of the whites or the lining, and in some cases the eyes may even bleed. The cat’s eyes may change color, usually to a brown shade. The cat may lose the ability to see.
Problems with the eye may be the only symptom of this disease.

, FIP may also affect the brain. Your cat may display problems with coordination, so they may wobble, be off-balance, or have trouble walking. They may also have tremors or seizures."

Determine and address the cause.,
Administer an enema.,
Provide medication.,
Perform a colectomy.",How to Diagnose and Treat Megacolon in Cats2," If your vet is able to determine the underlying cause of megacolon in your cat, the best course of action is for your vet to address this root cause.Additional diagnostic tests may be performed to help determine this cause, and a treatment plan will be devised. These tests may include:

Abdominal ultrasound
Contrast studies
Additional blood work
Colonoscopy

, Whether or not a root cause is determined, perhaps the best way to relieve the distress on your cat's colon is for your vet to perform an enema.In order to do this:

Your cat will be placed under anesthesia
Fluid will be injected into your cat's colon
The blocked feces will be manually expressed

, Your vet will likely suggest the use of medication to help relieve your cat's condition and to prevent future constipation. Depending on the nature of your cat's megacolon, you may be asked to continue providing medication after your cat returns home.Such medications will likely include:

Cisapride, which initiates colon contraction
Lactulose, which acts as a stool softener

, If your cat's megacolon is especially severe, and/or if other medical treatments have not been successful, your vet may wish to perform a colectomy. This surgery involves removing a portion of your cat's large intestine.Should this be needed, be aware that this surgery involves:

General anesthesia
An overnight stay in the animal hospital
Recovery time where you cat will need accommodations
Significant medical fees

Alter your cat's diet.,
Ensure proper hydration.,
Let your cat rest.,
Attend any follow-up appointments.",How to Diagnose and Treat Megacolon in Cats3," In order to help heal megacolon, and to help prevent its return, you may be asked to place your cat on a high-fiber diet. Ask your vet for recommended brands and portion guidelines.Look for cat food labeled ""high fiber.""
You can find these at pet stores, grocery stores, through your vet, or online.

, Dehydration is a major factor in constipation. In order for your cat to recover from megacolon, it is important for you to monitor their hydration for at least a week after you see your vet.In order to do this, you can:

Provide fresh water
Make sure your cat is drinking every day
Make sure your cat is urinating every day
Include canned food in their diet
Add water to their dry food
Follow any additional instructions from your vet

, In order to recover, your cat will need to rest. Consider limiting your cat’s activity level and making any necessary accommodations.You may need to:

Relocate food and water bowls
Relocate litter boxes
Limit playtime
Limit your cat's contact with other pets

, Depending on the severity of your cat's condition, as well any underlying causes, your veterinarian may want to schedule one or more follow-up appointments with your cat. In order to ensure that your cat is healing properly, it is important for you to attend these appointments.The number of appointments (if any), as well as their frequency will vary based on a number of factors. These include:

Your cats age
Other health problems present
The underlying cause of megacolon in your cat (if any)

Determine if your cat has been at risk for infection.,
Take your cat to the vet.,
Have the cat’s blood tested.,
Have the chest and abdomen tested.,
Get a biopsy of organs.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Infectious Peritonitis2," Most cats develop this disease when they are under two years of age. It is more common if the cat lives around other cats, or if it was in a communal area with many cats. The most common way is by coming into oral contact with infected feces. Humans may transfer the virus on their clothes. If an infected cat comes into contact with an object, the virus may end up transferring to the object.The virus is often shed through feces. The virus will live for up the 36 hours, though it can last longer in colder climates.
In most cats, the virus will cause some diarrhea and then clear up on its own.
Feline coronavirus is only something that cats can get. People and dogs cannot become infected with feline coronavirus.

, FIP is difficult to diagnose, so taking your cat to the vet as soon as you suspect a problem can help them get a diagnosis. Make sure to give the vet as many of the symptoms as you can to help them have all of the facts.Sometimes, FIP can only be diagnosed through ruling out other diseases.

, The first thing the vet will probably do is test the cat’s blood. This checks to see if any coronavirus antibodies are presented. However, these antibodies just mean that the cat has been exposed to the virus, not that they have FIP. Other tests will be performed to give a definitive diagnosis.There are certain abnormalities on a blood panel that may cause your vet to suspect FIP. Your vet may also run a titer test for FIP.
The vet will also check blood counts, along with liver and kidney function.

, The vet may give your cat an x-ray to determine if they have fluid in their abdomen or chest. If the x-ray shows fluid, the vet will tap the cavity to draw fluid out for further testing.This often is enough to diagnose, but in some cases, a definitive diagnosis cannot be given.

, The dry form of FIP is challenging to diagnose since fluid won’t be present in the organs. If a differential diagnosis won’t lead to a diagnosis, the vet may do a biopsy of the affected organs."
"
Provide supportive care for cats with the dry form.,
Drain fluid for cats with the wet form.,
Give the cat medication.,
Decide if you want to euthanize your cat.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Infectious Peritonitis3," There is no cure for either type of FIP. However, cats with the dry form may live for a few months if they are still eating, haven’t developed neurological signs, and don’t have anemia. Providing a cat with the quality nutritious food can help for a few months.If the cat develops anemia, they may need blood transfusions.

, Cats with the wet form generally don’t live as long as those with the dry form. To help prolong your cat’s life for a little while, you can have the fluid drained from the chest and the abdomen.Draining the fluid may cause a significant loss in protein, which may make the condition worse.

, The vet may give the cat antibiotics if they develop infections. Immunosuppressants are sometimes given to help decrease the antibodies. Corticosteroids may be prescribed if the cat has problems with their eyes., Almost every case of FIP is fatal, and there is no treatment for the virus. Most treatments are supportive to help improve the cat’s quality of life for a few weeks or months. Many vets suggest that cats diagnosed with FIP be euthanized.If your cat is diagnosed, you and your family have to decide the most humane and appropriate course of treatment for your cat.

The main sign of giardia is unusual bowel movements. Cats will have foul-smelling, watery diarrhea that may contain trace amounts of blood.Some cats may also lose weight with giardia due to the diarrhea. Cats may also become less active in this weakened state.;
, If you notice any unusual symptoms, take your cat to the vet right away. The vet will work with your to diagnose and treat giardia. Tell the vet all the symptoms you observed and they will determine whether to test your cat for giardia.The symptoms of giardia do not necessarily indicate giardia. Unusual bowel movements can be caused by lifestyle changes, such as a change in diet. If your vet believes something else is causing your cat's symptoms, they may want to treat or test for that before testing for giardia.

, Giardia infections are usually detected via a stool sample. Collect a recent stool sample from your cat's litter box for testing. Place the stool sample in a plastic bag and bring it to your vet's office for testing., Your vet will send the sample to a lab or test it in the clinic. The test will determine if your cat has giardia.A stool sample is usually used to detect giardia. However, depending on your cat's symptoms and risk factors, vets may occasionally diagnose giardia without a stool sample.

, Usually, giardia can be treated at home. However, the condition can cause dehydration. If your cat is severely dehydrated, your vet may want to leave your cat at the hospital so it can receive fluids via an IV., Giardia is usually treated through prescription medications. Your vet may administer the medications at the office. They may also send you home with medications for your cats. Your vet will provide information about how often and for how long to give your cat medications to fight giardia.Metronidazole is the medication most often prescribed. Unless your cat is pregnant, your vet will likely give you a prescription for metronidazole.
Pregnant cats are usually treated with the alternative medication fenbendazole.

, Younger cats and kittens are especially prone to developing dehydration due to giardia. Dehydration can be life threatening when left untreated. If you notice signs of dehydration in your cat, take it to your vet as soon as possible.The following are symptoms of dehydration in cats:Sunken eyes
Lethargy
Stiff skin
Dry mouth
Lack of appetite

, Giardia-causing parasites may stay in a cat's fur. After the diagnosis, give your cat a bath. Ask your vet whether you need special shampoo and how often you should bathe your cat.Bathe your cat when it's mellow. Bathing can be stressful, so it's a bad idea to bathe a cat that is already aggravated.Place a rubber mat in a bathtub or sink and fill it with three to four inches of lukewarm water. Gently place your cat in the water.
Use a faucet or bucket to wet your cat's fur. Mix one part shampoo with five parts water and lather it into your cat's coat, working from head to tail. Then, rinse out the shampoo completely.
Wrap a towel around your cat, remove it from the bath, and dry it off in a warm place in your home.

, Make sure you keep your home clean. The cleaner your home, the less likely you are to attract parasites. Dust, mop, and vacuum regularly, especially near doors and openings to the outdoors., If your vet suggests it you can administer medication for giardia regularly to outdoor cats. The  medication is not harmful for cats who do not have giardia and it can help stop an infection right away. Ask your vet whether regularly giving yoru cat giardia-fighting medications is right for you., Giardia can be ingested through water from creeks, lakes, and ponds. Keep your cat inside for the most part, especially if you live near a body of water. Your cat should only drink clean tap water to prevent giardia."

Listen for wheezing or difficulty breathing.,
Check for fever and other symptoms of bronchitis.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Bronchitis1," At first, it might be difficult to distinguish a persistent cough from normal hairballs. Notice if your cat coughs repeatedly over the course of days or weeks. As you make your observations, look for potential environmental causes, such as:Pollen conditions
Whether anyone is smoking nearby
Any perfume, cologne, or air freshener you’ve used
Dusty cat litter
Dust inside and outside of the house
Contact with other cats with viruses;
, If you notice your cat has a persistent cough, look for signs of difficult breathing. Hold your ear near its chest and mouth and listen for wheezing or crackling sounds. Take note if its breathing seems visibly labored or if it consistently breathes through its mouth., If you have a pet thermometer, take your cat’s temperature. A temperature of 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit (39.7 degrees Celsius) or higher indicates a fever. Other symptoms of bronchitis include general stress and loss of appetite.You might also notice a bluish tint to the mucous membranes, like the nose, gums, and lips. This is due to a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream caused by respiratory difficulty.
If you notice these symptoms, take your cat to the vet immediately. If the symptoms worsen, your cat could experience respiratory failure.

"
"
Bring your cat to the vet and report its symptoms.,
Have your cat’s blood tested.,
Give the cat an x-ray or bronchoscopy.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Bronchitis2," Call the vet if you observe persistent coughing with or without other symptoms. The first step in making an accurate diagnosis is to report your cat’s symptoms to the vet.Tell the vet which symptoms you’ve observed and how long it’s been since you noticed them. Let the vet know if they came on suddenly or if they seem to be related to any potential allergens, like smoke, chemicals, or pollen.

, In addition to evaluating the cat’s symptoms and giving it an initial physical exam, the vet will need to screen your cat’s blood. They'll test for heartworm, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia, and other potential underlying conditions.Blood tests can also help evaluate the condition of the cat's organs.


These tests will help accurately diagnose acute or chronic bronchitis and help the vet better understand your cat’s overall health.

, The vet will most likely recommend some sort of imaging test, such as an x-ray or bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a technique that uses a small camera to examine lung tissue. The vet may also take a culture or biopsy of respiratory tissue to make an accurate diagnosis.There are a number of potential causes, like infection or parasite infestation, that your vet will need to eliminate. Imaging techniques, bacterial culture, and biopsy are the most effective ways of determining the best treatment plan.

However, if it grows bigger over time, that is cause for concern. Take your cat to the vet if you notice the lump is getting larger, especially if it continues to grow 1 month after the injection.The lump will likely be fairly hard and not move around that easily.Any lump over 2 centimeters in size needs to be seen by a veterinarian.;
, Any lumps from an injection site should go down after three weeks to a month. If you notice the lump on your cat is still there after about three weeks, it's important to talk to the vet about the lump., If your cat develops swelling at the vaccination area, that is normal. Similarly, some pain is also normal. You may also notice decreased energy, and your cat may not have much of an appetite.Serious symptoms that are unrelated to sarcoma include stomach problems such as vomiting and diarrhea, as well as allergic reactions such as bumpy, itchy skin and swelling around your cat's face. Your cat may also have difficulty breathing or even faint. These symptoms may not be related to sarcoma, but they can be very serious. Contact your vet if you notice these symptoms after a vaccination.

, A needle aspiration is likely the first diagnostic tool (aside from physical examination) that the vet will try. The vet will use a small needle to try to get a sample of the tumor cells so that they can be tested. However, sometimes the cells are difficult to pull out, so the vet will need to try another type of diagnostic tool., When the cells are too difficult to pull out with a needle, your vet may need to perform a surgical biopsy to test cells from the mass.In that case, the vet will need to cut out a piece of the actual tumor for testing., Most of the time, your vet will take an x-ray of your cat's chest. The purpose of this test is to determine if the tumor has spread to your cat's chest, which is more serious than if it hasn't spread that far yet.Your vet will also probably do things like take blood for tests.

, In many cases, the vet will run a CT scan once they have a positive diagnosis of sarcoma. The scan will help the vet determine how far the mass has spread, which is needed when the vet performs surgery., Surgery is usually the primary treatment of injection-site sarcoma. Because this type of tumor tends to spread outwards with small, root-like projections, the vet will likely need to take a wide area.""Clean margins"" are preferred, meaning the tumor doesn't reach all the way to the surgery's edge. However, this tumor can regrow even if the edges are clean.
If the site is on a cat's limb, it's likely that the vet will take the limb. While that seems extreme, it gives the cat a better chance of surviving. Most veterinarians now give vaccines in the limbs, further away from the body, for this reason.

, When you bring your cat home, try to keep it quiet by placing it in a quiet area. Monitor your cat to make sure it's using the bathroom, and only give food and water in small amounts until your cat is acting fairly normally again. Also, make sure you're giving any medications as prescribed by the vet.If your vet advises you keep your cat in a crate, make sure you follow that advice.

, Chemotherapy is generally used if the sarcoma is too large to remove easily. Chemotherapy may be used to try to decrease the size of the tumor before the vet performs surgery on the cat.Chemotherapy done after surgery can help keep the cancer from spreading.
Often, the vet will give you chemotherapy tablets to give at home. If they do, you need to take precautions. Handle the tablets with gloves and don't break them in half. Also, wear gloves when cleaning the litter box, and wash any bowls and bedding separately.
Like humans, chemotherapy can cause side effects in your cat. You may notice hair loss and stomach problems, for instance., In some cases, your cat may need radiation therapy. Often, radiation therapy is used if a follow-up scan shows that not all of the mass was removed and the vet cannot take more tissue due to where the injection site is located.However, some vets may recommend this treatment no matter what, as it is difficult to tell if the whole mass was removed., As the main way to treat this problem is surgery (followed by radiation and chemotherapy), treatment can be expensive. Also, this disease does have a high chance of returning. Talk to to your vet about the best way forward. As much as you love your animal, it may not be worth the pain of surgery to remove the tumor if it's in a place that has a high chance of regrowth., If the vet decides treatment won't help or you decide the risks outweigh the benefits, you'll need to offer palliative care for your cat. Pain medications, anti-nausea drugs, and antibiotics may all help your cat rest easier. Ask your vet what medications are best to give your cat."

This condition can affect from just one to all four of your cat's eyelids.;
, As the cat's eyelid turns in towards the eye, it begins to irritate the surface of the eye. This can cause an array of symptoms including:Redness
Light sensitivity
Tearing
Squinting
Discharge

, Persians or other brachycephalic breeds are more likely to have this genetic abnormality because of the different structure of their skulls.If you have one of these cats, you should be especially vigilant in looking for the signs of the condition.Cats without the stubby face of the brachycephalic breeds are more likely to have saggy or droopy eyelids instead of eyelids that are curled inward.

, Entropion often occurs in brachycephalic breed cats at birth. In these cases it has a strictly genetic cause and cannot be prevented, except through breeding programs the avoid using cats that have no family history of the problem.You should be on the lookout for entropion in kittens that are brachycephalic breeds. If newborn kittens do not open their eyes within four to five weeks after birth they should be assessed for this condition by a veterinarian., You should be on the lookout for entropion if your brachycephalic adult cat has had chronic infections of the eyes. Chronic infections, such as repeated bouts of conjunctivitis, can cause the condition to develop., As soon as you notice an abnormality with your cat's eyelids, you should make a veterinary appointment. Call your veterinary office, tell them about your cat's condition, and make an appointment for as soon as possible.

If your cat's eyelid is extremely infected and swollen and the cat seems very sick, you may want to bring your cat to see a veterinarian immediately. Call your veterinary office on the way there to warn them that you are coming in.

, When you bring your cat in for assessment, you should tell the veterinarian about the cat's symptoms. Discuss the cat's general health and answer all the questions the veterinarian asks you.

Feel free to ask the veterinarian questions about your cat's condition as they assess your cat.

, In order to figure out the right treatment for your cat, your veterinarian may need to complete a variety of tests. This could include a simple tear test to assess the cat's tear production and tests to identify any existing infections in the eye.

Tests will add to your veterinary bill but they are necessary in order to fight infections and to treat the abnormal eyelids. Without proper treatment of the condition and subsequent infections, your cat could lose its vision., There are several preliminary treatments that can be done on a cat with entropion before turning to surgery. To begin with, any underlying infections should be treated, usually with antibiotics. You can also apply artificial tears to the cat's eye to make movement of the lid easier.Discuss your treatment options with your veterinarian. The extent to which you can use non-surgical treatments on entropion depends on the severity of the condition.
Cats with severely turned eyelids may need surgical treatment right away.
In less severe cases of entropion, clearing up any infections in the eyes can cause the eyelids to go back to normal., The surgery used to treat entropion flips the eyelid right side out and removes skin so that it stays that way.If your cat has a severe case of entropion, it is likely that they will need this procedure.Even with surgical correction, your cat may still have spasms and infections of the eye. Thus, you will need to continue to assess the cat's eyes.

, After non-surgical treatments and surgical treatments your cat will need some care. Most importantly, make sure that the cat cannot touch its eyes by putting a cone onto it. Also make sure that the cat receives any medications that have been prescribed to it.Follow your veterinarian's suggestions about caring for your cat's sutures after surgery. Dressings should typically be changed regularly and the surgical wound should be kept clean and watched for signs of infection.
If your cat undergoes surgery, it may have some reactions when coming out of anesthesia. It may be extra sluggish for up to twenty-four hours after it wakes up."

Notice any ear sensitivity.,
Look for excessive scratching.,
Check for any discharge.,
Look for problems walking.,
Check for any redness and swelling.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ear Infections in Cats1," Ear infections can make your cat’s ears sensitive to touch. You may notice this when you pet your cat’s head. They may shy away from you or react negatively if you touch their ears.You may try to massage near the base of the cat’s ear. If they have an ear infection, they will feel discomfort.;
, Ear infections can cause a lot of itching and discomfort. Due to this, your cat may scratch at their ears or rub them against the floor or soft objects. Watch your cat for targeted scratching around their ears.Due to this scratching, the ears or head may end up with wounds or trauma.
Your cat may also shake their head a lot.

, Another common symptom that occurs with ear infections is discharge. This may be debris around the opening of the ear canal or inside of the ear, or it may be wet pus. This discharge may have a bad odor.The discharge may be yellow, dark brown, or black in color. It may be crusty on the ear or be thick and oozing.

Get your cat treated for acute bronchitis.,
Talk to the vet about corticosteroids and bronchodilators.,
Get an air purifier and treat against specific allergens.,
Reduce your cat’s exposure to triggers.,
Help your overweight cat lose weight.",How to Diagnose and Treat Feline Bronchitis3," Acute bronchitis can result from a bacterial or viral infection, or parasitic infestation. Your cat’s vet will suggest the appropriate medications, such as antibiotics, to treat the infection or infestation.The vet will likely prescribe an oral antibiotic or antifungal medication, depending on the results of the culture and imaging scans. Be sure to administer any medication as instructed., If your vet rules out parasites or infection, they will likely prescribe a corticosteroid, which acts as an anti-inflammatory. In addition, they might suggest a bronchodilator, which opens up the airways.Both of these medications come in oral, inhaled, or injectable forms. Talk to your vet about which option is best for your cat, and be sure to administer any medication as directed.
While often used in combination with corticosteroids, bronchodilators are rarely prescribed on their own.

, Corticosteroids and bronchodilators are the most common treatment methods, but your cat’s vet might also recommend other options. If they can identify a particular allergen, there are experimental desensitization therapies available. The vet might also suggest you invest in an air purifier to eliminate allergens from your home., If your cat is diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, you should take efforts to reduce its exposure to any allergens that might trigger its respiratory problems. Keep your cat indoors and stop smoking around it.You should also observe and eliminate any particular conditions that worsen symptoms. For example, if you observe your cat coughing or wheezing in a certain room of the house, restrict its access to that room. If you notice a perfume or air freshener triggers its bronchitis, stop using that product.Cat litter can be another trigger. If you think the cat's litter is causing the problem, try buying another brand.

, Obesity puts extra stress on a cat’s circulatory and respiratory systems, so you should help your overweight cat lose weight. If you free-feed your cat, switch to scheduled feedings. If you give your cat treats, make sure they account for no more than ten percent of its daily calories.Ask the vet if they have any further weight loss recommendations.
Since obesity can be a lifelong condition, the cat may need ongoing treatment of their bronchitis.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Check the ear.,
Undergo other tests.,
Examine a sample from the ear.,
Sedate the cat if necessary.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ear Infections in Cats2," When you suspect an ear infection, immediately seek medical treatment for your cat. The vet will need to do an examination of the ears to determine the type of infection and the cause of it.Make sure to give the vet a full medical history of the cat in case there are any underlying issues related to the infection.Trying to treat the infection at home may not work since you don’t know what kind of infection it is or what caused it.

, If the vet suspects an ear infection, they will use an otoscope to check the inside of the ear. The instrument helps magnify and provide light on the inside of the ear so they can get a good look at the middle and inner ear.They will also be able to tell if the eardrum is still intact.
During the examination of the ear, the vet will also be to see if there is something lodged in the ear. They will also check for tumors.

, Your cat may need to have other tests to determine the extent of the infection. Your vet may suggest an x-ray of the head.The vet may also draw fluid from the middle ear with a needle.Other tests may include blood tests, urine tests, CT scans, or MRIs.

, Your vet will probably swab the inside of the cat’s ear for a sample. This is especially important if the ear has discharge of any sort. The vet will them look at the sample under a microscope.This helps the vet figure out what type of infection your cat has. The type of infection determines the treatment. For example, there are bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.

, If your cat has an ear infection that is severe, the vet may have to sedate the cat or put them under anesthesia. This only occurs if the cat is in too much pain for the vet to touch the ears, or if discharge or swelling blocks the view inside the ear.The risks of sedating your cat include allergic reactions, swelling at the site of the injection, and in rare cases, death. However, most cats go under sedation without any problems. Talk to your vet about your cat's health and age to determine if sedation is right for them.If your cat has a severe infection or has something lodged in their ear, removing it or draining the infection without sedation can be too painful, so sedation helps reduce this pain risk for your cat.

Give your cat antibiotics.,
Remove any foreign bodies.,
Flush the ear.,
Undergo surgery.",How to Diagnose and Treat Ear Infections in Cats3," If your cat has a mild infection, the vet will prescribe oral antibiotics or antibiotics that need to be injected. This is usually given along with topical antibiotics, antifungals, or antiparasitics that you put directly on the ear.The vet may also prescribe ear drops, sprays, or creams to put on the ear., If something is lodged inside the ear, like a piece of grass, your vet will need to extract the foreign bodies. The cat will be sedated or put under anesthesia. The vet will remove the item from the ear.You will have to give your cat prescribed medication to heal the infection.

, In some cases, the cat’s ear may need to be flushed. The vet will clean out the ear canal of any debris and discharge. If the cat is in too much pain, they will be sedated.The vet may also cut or remove some of the hair around the ear to reduce the risk of reinfection and to help it air out as it heals.

, If your cat has a severe infection, or they have recurring infections, then the vet may have to do surgery. During surgery, they may drain fluid buildup or repair the eardrum. They may also remove tumors or polyps during surgery.In extreme cases, a veterinarian may remove and close the ear canal.

Notice breathing problems.,
Listen for a cough.,
Watch for decreased overall health.,
Check for discoloration.",How to Diagnose and Treat Chylothorax in Cats1," The first symptom of chylothorax is usually difficulty breathing. Often, it seems like the cat is holding their breath or has stopped breathing because it takes longer to inhale and exhale. This may also present as shortness of breath, panting and rapid breathing, or wheezing and other sounds while breathing.The cat may also be unable to exercise because of the breathing problems.
The breathing problems are due to fluid accumulating in the lungs.;
, Some cats will develop a cough before they develop any other symptoms, including breathing problems. A cough is one of the main indicators of the condition because cats rarely cough, and chylothorax is one of the few conditions that causes coughing in cats., This condition can affect your cat’s overall health. Your cat may become lethargic and resistant to exercise or any kind of physical activity. The cat may start acting depressed, and their general behavior and disposition may change.The cat may stop eating and start losing weight.
The cat may also run a fever.

, Chylothorax can cause parts of your cat’s body to change colors. The gums and other mucous membranes may become pale and lose their normal color. The skin may start to have a blue tint."

Stay away from your cats if you’re sick.",How to Diagnose and Treat Chlamydiosis in Cats," If you notice that your cat’s eyes look watery, it might have chlamydiosis. You might also see some discharge from your cat’s eyes – usually green or yellow – that’s thicker than normal cat eye discharge. If you notice this symptom, your cat might have chlamydiosis, but it might also have a condition that affects its eyes., If you notice that your cat is having difficulty breathing, it might have chlamydiosis. This can manifest as loud breathing, or you might notice your cat extending its neck to breathe. Your cat might also cough if it has chlamydiosis. This can also be the symptom of other serious conditions, so you should take your cat to the vet if you notice these issues., Healthy cats’ noses are sometimes a little cold and wet. If you notice that your cat has a runny nose, however, this might be a sign it has chlamydiosis. At the very least, it indicates that something is wrong and you should take your cat to the vet., One of the most common signs of an upper respiratory infection is sneezing. Cats sneeze from time to time, but if you notice your cat more often than normal, it might have chlamydiosis., If you notice that your cat is not eating as much as it usually does, it might have chlamydiosis. Lack of appetite is a serious symptom in cats, regardless of the cause, so if you notice this, you should take your cat to the vet immediately., If you notice any of the above symptoms in your cat, take it to the vet and explain all of its symptoms. If your vet suspects that your cat has chlamydiosis, they will take a swab of the discharge (from your cat’s eyes, usually) to determine the cause of its illness. Even if the underlying cause of your cat’s symptoms is not chlamydiosis, a swab will help your vet figure out the best course of treatment for your cat., Because an upper respiratory infection mimics the symptoms of pneumonia, your vet might order an x-ray to eliminate one or the other as a cause of your cat's symptoms. This will allow your vet to look for liquid in the lungs – the most obvious sign that your cat has pneumonia., The bacteria that causes chlamydiosis sometimes comes up during a blood screening. Your vet might order one for your cat to be sure about the diagnosis of chlamydiosis., If your vet determines your cat does have chlamydiosis, they might prescribe antibiotics. These can Include tetracycline or doxycycline. Make sure you follow the directions for administering the drugs to your cat and ask your vet any questions you might have about the medication., If your cat is experiencing quite a bit of eye discharge as a result of chlamydiosis, your vet might prescribe antibiotic eye drops. As with oral antibiotics, you should follow the directions your vet gives you very carefully., If your vet prescribes antibiotics, you will notice improvement in your cat’s health. However, you should continue to administer treatment for at least ten days after your cat’s symptoms clear up. The bacteria that causes chlamydiosis could still be in your cat's body, even if it isn't exhibiting symptoms., Although the medication your cat is taking might take a while to start working, you should pay attention to whether your cat is improving at all. If it's not, there might be another underlying issue, or your cat might need different medication. If you're not noticing any improvement, take your cat back to the vet., Chlamydiosis is incredibly contagious. Because of this, it’s best to keep an infected cat away from other animals. Move its litter box and food and water bowls into a separate room if possible, and keep it quarantined from other animals in your home., Cats can spread chlamydiosis to humans. People the most at risk from upper respiratory infections can become infected after interacting with cats that have chlamydiosis. You should keep children, the elderly, and pregnant women well away from cats with chlamydiosis., Chlamydiosis spreads easily from cat to cat. If you have more than one cat and one gets chlamydiosis, take preventative measures. Ask your vet for doses of preventative antibiotics to give to your other cats. This will prevent the spread of the disease to the other cats in your household., Just as cats can pass upper respiratory infections to humans if they have chlamydiosis, so too can humans give their cats chlamydiosis if they have upper respiratory infections. If you’re sick, try to stay away from your cat as much as possible until you’re feeling better. Have someone else feed your cat if possible, and try to avoid touching it."

Take the kitten’s temperature.,
See if the kitten can support itself and roll over.,
Look for inadequate weight gain.,
Check for physical abnormalities.",How to Diagnose and Treat Fading Kitten Syndrome1," Hypothermia is the most common symptom of fading kitten syndrome. You should take a newborn kitten’s temperature regularly. In the first week, a kitten’s rectal temperature should be between 95 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 37 degrees Celsius).The temperature should increase to between 96.8 and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (36 to 38 degrees Celsius) in the second and third weeks. By the fourth week it should reach standard adult levels of between 100.4 and 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (38 to 39 degrees Celsius).  ;
, By three days of age, a kitten should be able to roll over if it’s placed on its back. By two weeks of age, it should be able to support itself on all four limbs and begin to crawl. Failure to reach these milestones could indicate weakness associated with fading kitten syndrome., A healthy kitten’s weight should increase by seven to ten grams per day. You should weigh a newborn kitten twice per day using a precise gram scale. Failure to gain adequately gain weight can indicate malnutrition and possible underlying problems., Congenital defects are a common cause of fading kitten syndrome. Look for common abnormalities such as cleft palate, umbilical hernia, and skeletal defects.Unfortunately, severe defects are usually untreatable.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Get imaging tests.,
Have chest fluid tested.,
Have tests to determine an underlying cause.",How to Diagnose and Treat Chylothorax in Cats2," If your cat presents any of the symptoms, you should take them to the vet. The vet will perform a physical exam and listen to the chest to check for fluid. Any fluid in the chest cavity will muffle the sound of the heart and lungs. After listening to the chest, looking at the cat’s medical history, and hearing the symptoms, the vet will determine if additional tests are needed.You should also take the cat to the vet if they have a history of chest trauma or disease, which increases the cat’s risk for chylothorax.

, If the vet suspects the cat has chylothorax, they may decide to do an x-ray on the chest. An x-ray will show the vet that there is fluid in the chest cavity. However, this doesn’t tell the vet any specifics about the fluid., If the x-ray confirms fluid in the chest cavity, the vet will then draw fluid through a chest tap. The fluid will then be analyzed. The vet will look at the color, since chyle is white or light pink. The fluid will then be tested to check the fat content.The last test checks the fluid for large numbers of white blood cells.

, After the vet confirms chylothorax, they will try to figure out what caused it. They may perform blood tests to look for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and heartworm disease.They may also do more imaging tests to look for any infections.

Bring the kitten to the vet at the first sign of trouble.,
Test the kitten and mother’s blood types.,
Have the vet test for infections.",How to Diagnose and Treat Fading Kitten Syndrome2," For the best chance of saving the kitten, you should seek veterinary care sooner rather than later. If possible, you should bring the entire litter in for examination to rule out a litter-wide health issue. The queen, or litter mother, should also be examined by the vet., It’s possible that the mother and fading kitten have different blood types. If this is the case, nursing is impossible. Without the ability to nurse, the kitten is prone to malnutrition and infections.If the mother and kitten have different blood types, the kitten will need to be bottle or intravenously fed.

, The vet should administer a blood test and bacterial culture to identify an infection or infestation. Fading kitten syndrome can be due to a variety of viral or bacterial infections. Internal and external parasites can also compromise a newborn kitten’s health.Improper nursing or failure to nurse can increase the risk of infection and infestation. During the first few weeks after giving birth, the mother passes protective antibodies through colostrum, which is a fluid the kittens ingest when they nurse.

"
Keep the kitten separated and warm.,
Provide humid nursery conditions.,
Treat dehydration and malnutrition.,
Treat any infections or parasites.",How to Diagnose and Treat Fading Kitten Syndrome3," The kitten should be separated from the litter, especially if an infection is detected. Kittens rely on huddling with their mother and littermates to keep warm, so you should take efforts to keep a separated kitten warm.Keep the ambient temperature as warm as possible. Keep the kitten wrapped in a blanket or towel. You can use a heating pad to keep its box warm, but be sure to check the pad frequently to make sure it’s not too hot.

, In addition to maintaining a warm temperature, nursery conditions should also be humid. Using a humidifier if necessary, keep the ambient humidity between 55 and 65 percent.Humidity will help prevent fluid loss and dehydration.

, If the kitten cannot nurse, you should bottle feed it every two hours. If it cannot suckle, it’ll require a dextrose solution (a sugar solution), which the vet can administer intravenously.If the kitten is dehydrated, the vet will also have to administer an intravenous fluid line.

, If the vet identified an infection or parasitic infestation, they will likely prescribe an antibiotic or antifungal medication. If the kitten can suckle, a liquid medication can be added to milk. If not, medication will likely have to be injected."

Determine if the cat is a stray or not.,
Be cautious.,
Be aware of the rabies risk.,
Keep stray cats away from your cats.,
Gain the stray cat’s trust.",How to Help Stray Cats1," Before you decide to help, you need to determine if the cat is a stray or not. Try to find out if the cat belongs to one of your neighbors. Ask around the neighborhood to see if anyone is missing a cat. Cats escape from homes sometimes and may roam far from their yards.Call your local veterinarian and animal shelter to ask if someone has lost a cat similar to the one you think might be a stray.
Snap a photo with your phone camera and post on-line on missing pet forums on social media. You could even make up fliers with the photo and post in local stores.
Care for the stray while you wait for a response.;
, Stray cats can be wild and unpredictable in their behavior. Approach the stray cat keeping in mind that it may spread disease to both you and any cats you already own. Your first responsibility is to protect yourself.Cat bites often become infected and sometimes with serious consequences.
Wear long sleeves, gloves and pants when you are around an unfamiliar cat. In addition to infections, cat bites can spread rabies. Keep in mind that a cat’s sharp teeth can still penetrate gloves and clothing.

, It's uncommon for even stray cats to carry rabies, but it is a possibility. If you live in an area with wild animals that are known rabies carriers, such as raccoons, bats, skunks, and foxes, you should exercise extra caution.Look for aggression, restlessness, and lethargy. It could be difficult to tell the difference between the stray cat's ""normal"" behavior and unusual behavior.
Listen for increased vocalization. When cats are suffering from rabies, they may meow or howl more frequently.
Look for signs of disorientation, paralysis, or seizures.
You should not attempt to handle or capture a cat who is acting strangely. Instead, report the animal to local animal control officers as soon as you can.
There is no test to diagnose rabies in live cats. Thus, it is important to exercise caution when interacting with the cat.
If you are bitten, clean the wound well with soap and water and see your doctor immediately., To protect your own cats from any diseases or parasites the stray may be carrying, you should keep strays away from your cats until the strays have been examined by a veterinarian. Stray cats can transmit diseases such as feline leukemia, distemper, rabies, and parasites such as fleas.If the cat acts lethargic, has a runny nose and eyes, breathes heavily or acts strange don’t approach the cat. These are all signs of disease. If you encounter an unhealthy looking cat, call animal control to have the cat caught by professionals., Gaining a cat’s trust can sometimes be difficult. Setting food out for a stray cat is a good way to start gaining its trust. Try placing wet food and a bowl of fresh water in a protected spot that is not accessible to dogs or other animals like raccoons. Stand or crouch several feet away from the food to let the cat to get him used to your presence.If the cat is timid keep leaving the food out for three or more days until it becomes comfortable with you standing or crouching near the feeding spot.
During this time look for signs of disease and pay attention to the cat’s behavior. Does it growl or hiss at you? Does it watch you when you are around? Does it approach you?
If the cat seems comfortable in your presence, try offering it a little wet food on the tip of a spoon. If it eats off of it, then that means that the cat may be ready to make friends with you.
Offer it more food on the spoon and slowly reach your hand towards it. See if the cat will let you touch it under the chin. Once the cat allows you to stroke its chin, try stroking other parts of its head.
Do not attempt to pet or hold a cat that looks aggressive or sick.

Set a sleep schedule and stick to it.,
Create the same environment every night.,
Change how you feed your cat.",How to Help Cats to Sleep at Bedtime1," Cats are like kids - they respond to schedules. Maintaining a routine is the first step to sleep training your cat.


Establish a bedtime routine. Cats are social animals, and they crave attention and love from their owners. If possible, get up and go to bed at roughly the same time each night. This will help your cat adjust to your schedule, and they'll be more likely to rise and fall with you.
Turn the lights off at a specific time. Darkness is a cue to cats that it's time to relax and cuddle up for bed.However, keep in mind that cats also love to hunt at night, so darkness by itself doesn't make cats sleepy.;
, Cats thrive on schedule, and easily pick up on signs in regards to their owner's activities. If you sleep with the lights off, turn them off. If you turn the TV off at night, turn it off. If you turn on the fan, turn it on. If you listen to radio, listen to it. Create the same environment every time you go to bed. Your cat will recognize this environment, and understand that it's time to sleep.

, When a cat is fed affects their sleep schedule drastically. Oftentimes, if a cat is being particularly pesky at bedtime or early morning they're simply hungry. If you can change how and when you feed your cat, this can lead to more peaceful nights.


Try feeding your cat shortly before bed. We're all more likely to sleep after we've had a nice meal. Some people find that if you feed your cat a half cup of dry or wet food shortly before bedtime, they'll be more likely to sleep through the night full and satisfied.Invest in an automatic feeder for morning meals. Automatic cat feeders, which can be set to release a handful of dry food at specific times, are available for purchase online and at many department stores and specialty pet stores. If your cat wakes you in the early hours of the morning wanting breakfast, an automatic feeder can help. Not to mention, cats are known for their sense of anticipation. If he knows breakfast is coming, he'll likely hang around the feeder early in the morning rather than making noise near the bedroom.

Have the fluid drained.,
Give the cat rutin.,
Have surgery performed on the cat.,
Place your cat on a low fat diet.",How to Diagnose and Treat Chylothorax in Cats3," The first thing the vet will do is try to help the cat breathe normally. They do this by draining the fluid from the lungs. The vet will remove the fluid with a syringe needle first. Then, if the fluid continues to accumulate, a chest drain will be placed through surgery to help the fluid drain each day as it continues to accumulate. The cat will remain in the hospital while the drain is in place.The chest drain will be removed when the chyle stops forming in the chest.

, The vet may recommend that you give your cat a supplement of rutin. This supplement may help stimulate cells to remove fat from the chyle and prevent fluid from forming in the chest cavity. Rutin is given orally.You can get rutin at pharmacies and natural health stores.

, The vet may decide to perform surgery on the cat. During surgery, the vet may tear or burn the cisterna chyli that hold fluid in the abdomen. This surgery helps the cat’s body find other ways for the fluid to enter the bloodstream, in order to stop it from accumulating in the chest cavity., Since chyle contains high levels of triglycerides, the vet may tell you to feed your cat a diet lower in fat. The food should be meat based with a high level of protein, roughly 35 to 45%. Look for foods that are low in fat and carbohydrates. Ask the vet for suggestions for quality low fat cat foods."
"
Schedule a veterinary visit.,
Decide if you will take ownership of the stray or try to find him a home.,
Consider joining a trap-neuter-release organization.",How to Help Stray Cats2," After a cat starts to trust you, you will need to take the stray for a checkup with your veterinarian. Make an appointment with your veterinarian for as soon as possible.To take the cat to the veterinarian, place him in a cat carrier. This will help to keep the cat safe and secure.
Make sure that you inform the veterinarian that the cat is a stray. Also, tell the veterinarian if you’ve noticed any injuries, parasites, or any other health concerns.
The veterinarian will examine the cat and treat it for any internal or external parasites. The veterinarian will also perform a feline leukemia test by drawing a small amount of blood from the cat’s vein. If the test is negative, the veterinarian will administer some vaccines (rabies and distemper) and ask you to schedule the cat to be spayed and neutered.
If the cat has feline leukemia, you will be given some options. These may include surrendering the cat to a human society for care and adoption, keeping the cat yourself under feline leukemia precautions, or euthanasia. The veterinarian will help you decide which option is best for you.

, Helping stray cats is more than just providing them with some food.Stray cats need help finding homes so that they can lead the best life possible. Sometimes that home is with you; other times the best help you can give a stray cat is to find someone else who can provide for the cat.

, There are trap-neuter-release (TNR) organizations that will trap stray cats; take them to be neutered or spayed; and then release them back near where they were found. These programs help to keep the cat population under control and it is often a good option for cats that would not make good pets due to being too wild or feral.Your veterinarian, local humane society or animal control should be able to tell you if such organizations exist in your area and how to contact them.

Schedule playtime before bed.,
Provide entertainment options for your cat throughout the day.,
Install a bird feeder.",How to Help Cats to Sleep at Bedtime2," Interactive play sessions in the evening are a great way to get your cat tired before bedtime. Toys that mimic the movements of mice and birds, which cats hunt in the wild, are ideal options. Look for toys that bounce and wiggles, like ping-pong balls, string-based toys, and furry mouse toys. Play until your cat seems tired or uninterested. Cats hunt in short bursts, so they tire quickly (like sprinters, not marathon runners). They usually tire after 10 to 15 minutes max. However, make sure there's plenty of play spaced over the day., Our pets lives revolve our comings and goings. Oftentimes, cats get bored during the day when their owners are gone. This leads to an excess of neediness later in the day, when you're trying to wind down and get to sleep. Keep your cat entertained while you're at work or school and they'll be less likely to need attention at night.


Provide toys your cat can play with on his own. Small plush mice, especially those laced with catnip, are a great choice. They can be swatted around without a human's assistance. Make sure to rotate toys often as cats, like people, crave variety and will get bored with the same toy after awhile.DVD's are available for purchase online and at some department stores that are designed specifically for cats. Video CatNip from Pet-A-Vision Inc., for example, includes footage of birds and mice that cats will try to catch when you're not home. Just leave the TV on and make sure it's at the cat's eye level.Battery operated toys are available at most grocery stores, department stores, and supermarkets. These toys move on their own and can be left on for a few hours while you are at work. However, be sure to read any warning labels. Some battery operated toys recommend cats only use them with supervision.

, Cats love windows, and enjoy being able to see the outside world. Anything you can do to make your backyard more appealing is great. Installing a bird feeder is a low-cost way to give your cat something to watch while you're at home.


Set up your feeder in a quiet place where it's easy to stock and refill. Feeders should ideally be close to natural shelters, like trees and shrubs, where birds will feel safe.
Make sure your feeder is at least three feet away from your window. This reduces the likelihood of window collisions, which kill millions of birds each year."

Leave your cat in a separate room.,
Create a resting space for your cat.,
Keep deterrents by your bedroom door.",How to Help Cats to Sleep at Bedtime3," If possible, close your bedroom door at night. Cats are notoriously difficult to sleep with as they rarely sleep a full eight hours and can cause you physical harm via biting and scratching if they're startled by your movements during sleep. It's best to keep your cat out of the bedroom at night, and establish altogether that your sleeping space is not a cat-friendly area. Leave the door closed during the day as well. Cats are territorial. The more access they have with a particular space, the more they think of it as their own, and the harder it is to keep them out when you're trying to rest.

, If your cat feels they have their own place to sleep, they're less likely to invade yours. Cats take refuge in comfortable spaces, surrounded by their toys, litter box, food, and bedding. Setting up a comfortable sleeping space for your cat can give him a place to go at night that won't interfere with your sleep.


A high resting spot is ideal, as cats are natural observers and love to view a wide scope. A multi-level kitty condo, available for purchase online or at pet stores, can be a good option as it's comfortable for rest and also allows your cat to climb high.Cats need multiple places to sleep, so provide them with multiple options. While many pet stores sell expensive bedding, just a pillow or blanket is usually sufficient. Place cat-friendly bedding throughout the house, and places where you are okay with your cat taking a snooze. Place a small pillow on the arm of your sofa, or a warm blanket on the top of the stairs. This signals to your cat that these are places for him to sleep.Cats are most vulnerable when they are sleeping, so they prefer to rest in areas where they feel safe. Provide refuge in quiet spots of the house, especially places that are somewhat hidden like behind or under furniture.
As stated, cats feel like a space is their own if their things are nearby. Set up resting spots close to your cat's food, water, litter, and toys so the cat knows this is a space for them., If your cat keeps trying to get in at night, there are a variety of ways to deter this behavior. Set up some kind of inconvenience for your cat, or something that will startle him, and he'll be less likely to come to your door to cry and scratch.


Place something in front of the door, such as vinyl carpet runner placed upside down to expose the knobby bits, double sided sticky tape, or aluminum foil. The unpleasant texture will make your cat less likely to bother you at night.
Set up a booby trap to startle your cat. Hang your blowdryer from the doorknob or place your vacuum 5 or 6 feet away from the door. Plug the dryer or vacuum into a remote switch, which can be purchased online or at a Radio Shack, and when your cat starts meowing or scratching turn the appliance on. The noise will startle your cat, and he'll be less likely to come back after that."

Look for signs your cat is upset.,
Pet and soothe your cat.,
Block out the view.,
Distract your cat with puzzle toys.,
Block off that area of the house.",How to Help an Indoor Cat Being Tormented by an Outdoor Cat1," It should be fairly obvious if your cat is upset. It may hiss or yowl. It might also puff up its fur, a tactic designed to make it look bigger and more menacing to other animals. It may also become more aggressive, attacking you or other family members (human or animal) because it can't take out its aggression on the outdoor cat., One way to try to calm your cat is to spend some time petting it. Gently stroke the cat in its favorite places, talking soothingly to it as you do. Use long strokes, going from the head to rump. For some cats, that may be all you need to calm them down.


Obviously, if your cat tries to attack you, back away, and let it have some space.

, While your cat may enjoy watching the birds, you may need to block its view of the outside for a while. Though your cat will likely still be able to smell the other cat, not being able to see it may keep your cat from getting as crazy, calming it down.You may need to do more than close the blinds since cats are persistent creatures. For instance, purchase dark window clings to cover the window. Use them on the part of the window at your cat's level, and leave the top of the window open for a view.

, Cats need entertainment, just like you do. That's one reason your cat is looking outside: it wants to see what's going on. However, you can help keep your cat's focus indoors by providing more interesting toys. Often, simple toys will suffice, such as boxes and paper bags.However, sometimes upgrading toys can interest your cat. For instance, puzzle toys that release treats as your cat plays with them are a great way to keep your cat entertained.

, If the outdoor cat is mainly in one area (the front or the back of the house), considering keeping your cat out of that area for a while. Keep the door closed so your kitty can't venture in there and be annoyed by the outdoor cat."

Try a pheromone spray or diffuser.,
Ask about an anti-anxiety medication.,
Talk to a veterinary behaviorist.",How to Help an Indoor Cat Being Tormented by an Outdoor Cat2," You may notice that your cat rubs its face on items in your house, especially new items. The cat is leaving a scent behind when it does that. Basically, the cat is saying, ""I've looked at this item, and it seems safe."" When another cat approaches the item, that cat sees it as ""safe."" Pheromone sprays and diffusers play on this sense of safety by recreating that smell, giving your cat a sense of safety.Try using a diffuser in the room where your cat most often sees the outdoor cat. The scent should help keep your cat calm. You can find these diffusers at pet stores or online.

, In some cases, an anti-anxiety medication may be appropriate if your cat is getting very upset and aggressive. The best way to proceed is to talk to your vet and see if they think a medication is appropriate for your cat. Keep in mind that this type of medication is usually seen as a temporary solution., If your cat is still having problems, a behaviorist may be able to teach your cat coping techniques. For instance, the behaviorist may try to help your cat stay calm when it sees another cat. They may also try to calm down other aggressive behaviors, particularly those directed towards family members (both human and non-human).Ask your vet for a recommendation for a behaviorist.

Remove bird feeders and other attractions.,
Don't engage with the cat.,
Try physical deterrents.,
Use smelly deterrents.,
Discuss it with the owner.",How to Help an Indoor Cat Being Tormented by an Outdoor Cat3," Bird feeders obviously bring birds to your yard. In turn, neighborhood cats will show up for the free entertainment and food.If you want to discourage the neighborhood cats from coming around, it's a good idea to remove the feeders completely.

, While you might be tempted to feed or pet neighborhood cats, that's only going to keep them coming back for more. Try to ignore the cats as much as possible. It's a good idea to not pet neighborhood cats, anyway, as you can pass diseases to your own cat., You can take steps to deter cats from coming near your yard. For instance, some cats enjoy walking along the tops of fences, but they find it more difficult with a pointed fence. Another option is a motion detector that will spray water if an animal comes near. Since cats don't like water, it will often keep them away., One way to deter cats is to sprinkle lemon or orange peels around your garden, as they don't like the smell. Coffee grounds, pipe tobacco, vinegar, eucalyptus, lemongrass, and lavender will likely have a similar effect. Rue is also a deterrent, which you can add to your garden or just sprinkle around the yard.These deterrents will need to be renewed regularly, particularly after it rains. Also, renew them if you notice cats coming around. You may need to do it as often as twice a month. You just need enough to make a steady border around your yard.
You can also buy a cat repellent spray at places like feed stores.

, Often, outdoor cats are owned by someone in the neighborhood. The owners may not realize that their cat is causing problems elsewhere, as they aren't around to see it. Simply bringing it up with them may help them realize there's a problem. In turn, they may decide to keep the cat indoors more.You could say, ""I don't want to cause issues between us, but I was wondering if you knew that your cat enjoys taunting the indoor cats in the neighborhood. For instance, he loves spraying on our porch, which drives our indoor cat crazy.""

Check the inside of the cat’s ears by putting the cat in your lap and flipping over its ear flap. Look for any redness or irritation around the outer ear area. Notice if there is any fluid coming out of the ear or an obstruction of any kind visible on the outer ear.Ear mites are a common infestation in cats that will also show up as red, irritated ears with lots of dark debris. The mites make the cat’s ears very itchy and uncomfortable. See your veterinarian so they can treat the mites.
If you suspect your cat may have an ear infection that is causing it to shake or tilt its head, bring it to the vet right away for treatment. Ear infections in cats should be addressed so they do not get worse or become a more serious health issue.;
, Pay attention to how the cat is standing or walking. Notice if the cat is falling or rolling to one side as it tries to walk or stand. It may also stumble or walk in circles. This, combined with the shaking or tilting of its head, could be a symptom of vestibular disease, which is a serious condition that needs immediate treatment.Cats with vestibular disease often tilt their head and fall to one side because they are feeling imbalanced or lack coordination due to the disease.

, This is another known symptom of vestibular disease. If the cat is vomiting, in addition to the head tilting or shaking, you should bring it to the vet right away., Try offering the cat food to see if it has an appetite. You can also look at the cat’s food bowl to see if it is eating. If the cat is not eating and has not eaten in 24 hours, this, combined with the head tilting or shaking, could be a symptom of a serious medical issue.


The cat may not be eating due a general feeling of being unwell or due to a more specific medical issue. Your vet will be able to determine the exact cause.

, Sometimes head tilt can be caused by a reaction to a medication. Even if you did not give your cat any medications, double check that they did not get into any medications that you might have laying around in your home., The vet will do a complete physical exam as well as a blood test and a urinalysis. The vet will exam the cat’s ears to determine if it has an ear issue. They will also use the blood test and the urinalysis to help determine the cause of the cat’s symptoms.Depending on the cat’s other symptoms, the vet may also need to do x-rays, a computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

, If you know about the medical background of the cat, such as if it has had issues with head tilting or shaking before, you should tell the vet. The vet may also ask you about the cat’s normal diet, as well as any supplements, medications, or additional foods you may have fed the cat., Once the vet has completed all testing, they can give you a clear diagnosis. Possible diagnosis for a cat who has head tilting or shaking could be an ear problem, such as an ear infection or an ear wound. There are also more serious possibilities like vestibular disease., Depending on the diagnosis, your vet will outline several treatment options for the cat. If the cat has an ear problem, it may be prescribed antibiotics or topical ear medication. The vet may also prescribe antivertigo medication if the cat is struggling with its balance.If the cat has a severe disease like vestibular disease, it may need to be hospitalized and put on intravenous fluids. It may also need surgery to treat the disease.

Look for difficulty with movement.,
Spot signs of swelling or abnormal looking joints.,
Notice if your cat is in pain.,
Be on the lookout for problems with joints that have been dislocated previously.,
Take your cat to the vet.,
Help your veterinarian to assess your cat's condition.,
Allow veterinary testing.,
Have the joint put back into position.,
Consider replacement surgery for certain types of dislocations.,
Give post-procedure and post-operative care.,
Reduce the risk of osteoarthritis.",How to Diagnose and Treat Dislocated Joints in Cats," The tell-tale sign of a dislocation is the inability to move a joint. When a joint gets dislocated, the muscles, tendon, and ligaments that enable movement are dislodged and they will likely lose their function.


Dislocations do not always eliminate all movement. Your cat may just appear lame or avoid its usual weight bearing.
In some cases, the muscles surrounding a dislocated joint will cause a limb to curl up or move into an unnatural position. This is the case, for instance, with many dislocated hip joints.;
, Assess your cat's body regularly in order to spot signs of illness, including dislocated joints. When looking for swelling or abnormalities, it is a good idea to focus your attention on joints that are commonly dislocated in cats. These include:Knee joints
Hip joints
Shoulder joints
Elbow joints
Tail joints

, If your cat is having problems moving and one of its joints looks weird, assess the cat for signs of pain. This can be hard to spot in cats because they usually try and mask their pain. However, if your cat is lethargic, unusually vocal, or it reacts badly to touch, then it is likely in pain.A cat that is in pain is likely to hide as well. If you haven't seen your cat in awhile and that is unusual, you take the time to look for it to make sure it is okay.

, A joint that has been dislocated in the past is more likely to be dislocated again. This is due to damage that can be done to the muscles and ligaments during a dislocation. Once these parts are damaged, the long-term stability of the joint can be compromised.


However, if your cat has had surgical treatment for certain dislocations it may not have further dislocations. For example, if your cat has a ball replacement for a hip dislocation it is not likely to get an additional dislocation. However, it may have lingering stiffness or mobility issues., A dislocation can be a serious medical problem for a cat, so it is important that the cat be seen by a veterinarian quickly. Call your veterinary office while you are taking your cat in. Let them know that you are bringing your cat in for an emergency.


If you notice the symptoms of a dislocation while your regular veterinary clinic is closed, it's a good idea to take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital. You do not want your cat suffering with pain for hours before treatment.

, Your veterinarian will likely first ask you about your cat's condition, what symptoms you've seen and when they started. They they will likely try to manipulate the joint. This can cause the cat to give a pain response and the veterinarian may even be able to hear the sound of bones that are out of place rubbing against each other.You may be asked to help keep your cat calm while the veterinarian is assessing your cat's condition and manipulating its joints. However, if the injury is serious and includes other trauma, it may not be appropriate for you to be in the room and you will be asked to wait in a waiting area.

, If your veterinarian suspects a dislocation or break, they will likely do an x-ray on the cat's joint. This will allow them to see what is going on inside your cat's body.For most dislocations, an x-ray is all the veterinarian need to confirm their diagnosis.

, With many dislocations, the cat will just need to have the bones placed back into the joint. After this is done, the area will be made immobile with a wrap to keep the bones in place while the cat heals. This can be done externally, with what is called a ""closed reduction"" or surgically in what is called an ""open reduction.""Both of these procedures will require that your cat be put under anesthesia. With an open reduction this is because it is a surgery and with a closed reduction it is due to the pain involved in moving the joint back into position.

, There are certain types of dislocations that cannot just be put back into place. For example, cats with hip dislocations often need surgery to repair their joint. This surgery entails the replacement of the ball in the joint, and takes several weeks to recover from.Surgery is an especially good option for those cats with chronic cases of dislocation, such as those related to hip dysplasia., Whether your cat undergoes a procedure to put the bones back into place or a surgery to repair its joint, you will need to give it care for several weeks afterword. It is likely that your cat will be prescribed medications, usually pain killers and antibiotics, that need to be given to it on a regular basis. You will also need to restrict the cat's movements.


If your cat has its bones re-positioned into their proper place, you will need to keep the area bandage and immobile for several weeks while the muscles and ligaments repair themselves.
If your cat undergoes surgery, you will usually need to keep it in a cage for several weeks to keep the injured joint immobile.
Joint dislocations may require several operations to repair if they are especially bad. This means that you will need to nurse your cat several times in order to get it healthy., Cats that have had dislocations are at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in those joints in the future. To minimize this risk, give your cat dietary supplements that prevent osteoarthritis. These include omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine and chondroitin.As with all dietary supplements, discuss them with a veterinarian before giving them to your cat.

Pay attention to how much food your cat is eating, and take note if it leaves more in its bowl than it usually does., Some cats with cholangitis might try to eat even with inflammation, which might then cause them to vomit. All cats vomit from time to time, but if you notice your cat vomiting on a regular basis, or every time it eats, your cat might have developed cholangitis., Since cholangitis can cause disordered eating in cats, your cat might lose weight if it has cholangitis. Even if you don’t notice changes in food intake or vomiting, weight loss in your cat can be a sign of the disease., If you notice that your cat’s skin (especially on its ears or paws), eyes, or gums are yellow, your cat might have jaundice. Jaundice is a symptom of cholangitis, along with other serious health conditions. If you notice jaundice in your cat, you should take it to the vet immediately., Cats with cholangitis often have high temperatures. The most accurate way to take your cat's temperature is rectally. Cover the tip of a thermometer with some lubricant. Lift your cat's tail gently and then slowly and gently insert the tip of the thermometer into your cat's anus. Twist it gently from side to side and exert gentle pressure. Only insert it far enough that the silver end of the thermometer is covered.100.4 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38 to 39 degrees Celsius) is the normal temperature range for cats.Digital thermometers are generally the best because they beep when the reading is ready, and come in quick-read models that allow you to take your cat's temperature faster than a typical thermometer.

, If you notice that your cat is acting lethargic, it might have cholangitis. Lethargy is indicated by a decrease in energy levels. You’ll know your cat’s normal energy levels better than anyone else, so take note if your cat seems to be less energetic than usual, especially if they are exhibiting other symptoms as well., Cholangitis has symptoms in common with other diseases, so the only way to truly diagnose your cat is to take it to your vet. Your vet will likely give your cat a full physical. You should also share your cat’s full medical history with your vet to rule out any other issues., Your vet will probably order blood and urine tests to try to diagnose cholangitis. These can include a complete blood count and chemistry panel, or pancreatic tests, to rule out other causes of your cat’s symptoms., If your vet suspects cholangitis, they may order an ultrasound. During the ultrasound, they will look for changes in the appearance of the cat's liver and gall bladder. They may also aspirate the gall bladder to contents to check for infection., Because cholangitis often occurs along with cholangiohepatitis, which affects the liver, your vet might order a liver biopsy. This will likely occur if your cat is very ill or has been experiencing symptoms for quite some time., The most common treatment for cholangitis is the prescription of antibiotics. Your vet will prescribe the type best suited to how advanced the cholangitis is in your cat. Your vet will generally recommend that you hide the antibiotic pill in a treat or mash it up in your cat's food. Be sure to follow the directions your vet gives to you., If your vet feels confident that the disease is not caused by infection, they might prescribe corticosteroids instead of antibiotics. These help reduce the inflammation that is a signature sign of autoimmune cholangitis. As with other medications, your vet might recommend mashing up the pill and putting it in your cat's food or hiding it in a treat., If your cat’s illness has progressed quite a bit, it might require in-patient care. This could include the vet giving your cat fluids intravenously or feeding it through a feeding tube. This is especially likely if your cat hasn’t been eating., If it turns out that your cat’s bile duct is totally blocked, not just inflamed, your vet might schedule surgery for your cat. This is often a last resort and is usually necessary in only the most advanced and serious cases.The risks and success rate of this type of surgery varies greatly depending on your cat's age, overall health, and how far the cholangitis has progressed. Talking with your vet can give you a better idea of the risks and success rate, as well as how long it might take your cat to recover.

Keep deaf cats indoors.,
Tag your cat.,
Give the cat warning you're nearby.,
Put a bell on the cat.",How to Help a Deaf Cat1," Cats are safer indoors, anyway, but once a cat loses its hearing, being outdoors is particularly dangerous. They can't hear approaching dangers, so they're more likely to run into trouble, such as a car on the road., Your cat should be tagged anyway, in case it gets outside, but tagging is especially important for deaf cats. Buy a collar and tag. On the tag, include your contact information, as well as a note about the cat's deafness.


It's also a good idea to have your cat microchipped, as collars can come off. A microchip is a small chip inserted under your cat's skin that provides your contact information when scanned.

, If you have a deaf cat, it will likely startle more easily. Help keep it calmer by alerting it to your presence. One approach is to stomp the floor so the cat can feel your vibrations before you come closer.You can also flash the ceiling lights to let your cat know you're nearby.
You don't want to just swoop in and scoop up a cat who didn't know you were coming. It will scare the cat, who may lash out.
Clap your hands for partially deaf cats. If your cat is losing its hearing but isn't completely deaf, clapping your hands nearby may be enough to get its attention., If your cat is wandering around somewhere in your home, it's obviously not going to hear you calling if you need it. Place a bell on the cat's collar so it makes noise when it walks, helping you pinpoint where it is in your home."

One way to do that with a deaf cat is to raise your arms above your head (to make yourself taller) and wave them as you approach the cat., Although most cats won't come every time you call them, you still want to teach your cat a visual cue for ""come."" When your cat is looking at you, hunch down on the floor, and create a hand signal, such as tapping the floor. Use a treat to entice it over. Reinforce this behavior until it gets the idea., Most cats respond to a being sprayed with a water bottle, and a deaf cat is no different in this regard. If the cat is on top of something you'd rather it not be, a quick spray from the bottle will encourage it to get down. Spraying a cat as you come in the door can also discourage door-darters."

You may notice discharge and coffee-like bits. You'll also likely notice a smell., Another problem that can lead to hearing loss is an ear infection. Look for redness and inflammation inside the cat's ears, both the flaps and the canal. If you notice an issue, the cat could have an ear infection that needs to be treated by a vet., If your cat suddenly loses its hearing for any reason, it's a good idea to visit the vet. As noted, it could be ear mites or an infection, but it could also be something like a tumor that needs to be removed. Trauma and nerve damage can also cause hearing loss. Some hearing loss is treatable, though, so make sure you visit the vet."

Introduce your kitten to new things slowly.,
Let your kitten get used to a smaller space first.,
Give your kitten things to hide in.",How to Help a Fearful Kitten Feel More Confident1," In order to get your cat used to new things, you should introduce the kitten to things slowly. Let your kitten smell a new thing and approach it at their own pace.For example, if your kitten seems afraid of pots and pans clanging around in the kitchen, show the kitten a pan and let the cat smell the item. Then show the kitten the clanging sound that the pan makes so it will understand the sound and get used to it over time.
Kittens need to feel safe and secure in order to feel comfortable enough to explore freely in their environment. If your kitten doesn’t feel safe, it will hide and stay out of sight often. Introducing your kitten to new things slowly will help your kitten feel more comfortable at home.;
, If your kitten seems very afraid, you should help it feel more secure by confining it to a smaller space for a short period of time. This means that you should let the kitten live in a smaller room, like the bathroom, where it can explore the entire area easily and familiarize itself with the whole room.If you put your kitten in the bathroom for a few days, make sure it has all of the necessary supplies in the room as well. Leave the kitten’s food and water, its litterbox, a soft place to sleep, and a few toys in the room with it.

, Your kitten will feel much braver about exploring your home if there are plenty of things around for it to hide in or crouch behind. Give your kitten the option of hiding when it feels insecure by providing it with things to hide inside of.Put some baskets around different rooms or other boxes and items that your kitten can jump inside. This will help your cat feel less afraid.

Take a look at your cat's tongue.",How to Help a Cat That Swallowed String," Once you're at the vet's, you'll need to give them as much information as you can. Let the vet know when the cat swallowed the string, how long you think the string was, and what type of string it was. The vet will best be able to tell you how to move forward., The vet will perform a physical exam first. Often, string will wrap itself around a cat's tongue, while the rest of it is swallowed, so the vet will check inside the cat's mouth and under the tongue. Keep in mind that the vet will need to gently restrain your cat to examine it.Some cats may be frightened need to be sedated for a more thorough exam. Doing this will help your vet fully explore the extent of the problem.

, With this condition, your cat will usually need x-rays. An x-ray will tell the vet where the string is in the cat, allowing them to make a judgment about treatment. The vet may use barium to enhance the x-ray, as often strings may not show up clearly on a plain radiograph., If your cat has been vomiting a great deal or had diarrhea, the vet will likely need to give your cat fluids intravenously first thing. Also, if the cat is in a great deal of pain, the vet will attend to that need by giving the cat pain medications., One way objects like strings are removed is to make the cat vomit it up. Usually, this method is used if the object hasn't gotten too far in the cat's digestive tract.However, you should not try this method at home without explicit directions from your vet, as you can do more harm than good.

, This treatment is where a tube is inserted into your cat through its mouth. The vet will use the tube to pull the string out. However, this treatment might not always be appropriate, depending on where the object is.If your veterinarian is part of an emergency practice, they may be able to perform the endoscopy. Alternatively, they may refer you to a clinic that does perform this specialized procedure if they do not have the ability to do it.

, If the string has gotten into the cat's intestines, it may have bunched up the intestines or lacerated them. In many cases, the only treatment is surgery to remove the string and to fix any problems with the intestines. If the string has damaged your cat’s intestines, your cat may face a long and difficult hospitalization and recovery.Strings can be deadly to cats, and there is a possibility that the internal damage is so severe that the cat may need to be humanely euthanized.

, If you see a string protruding from the rear end of your cat, you may be tempted to pull it out to help the cat along. However, if the other end is stuck somewhere inside the cat, you could cause more damage.You can tug very, very gently on the string while another person holds the cat. If it comes out, that's good. However, if you feel any resistance, stop immediately.You can also cut the string so it's not too long, leaving an inch or two. Be careful not to catch any of the skin.

, Similarly, if you see a string under the cat's tongue or wrapped around the back of the cat's tongue, don't try to yank it out. You don't know how long the other end of the string is, and it could be entangled in the cat's intestines., If you do keep the cat at home, keep an eye on the cats bathroom breaks. If your cat seems upset while going to the bathroom (crying out, for instance), that's a good sign you need to take the cat in to the vet., Vomiting and loss of appetite are also good signs it's time to take the cat in to vet. Similarly, if your cat seems lethargic, particularly in connection to stomach problems, it is time to take your cat in., If your cat develops a purple tongue, that's another sign it's time to go to the vet. A purple tongue indicates the string has wrapped around the back of the tongue, cutting off the blood supply."

Talk to the kitten in a soothing voice.,
Stroke your kitten gently.,
Redirect the kitten’s attention.",How to Help a Fearful Kitten Feel More Confident2," Your kitten may be afraid of many things in your home – different sounds, smells, or even objects – but hearing your voice can be a great comfort to your kitten. If you notice your kitten acting afraid, you should try to calm it down by calling to it in a soft, soothing tone.Your cat will associate your voice with safety and comfort and will respond positively to the sound over time.

, When your kitten is afraid, you often need to physically comfort it to show the kitten you love it and will protect it. If you see your kitten behaving in a manner that exhibits fear, you should bring the kitten to you and stroke it gently. This will help calm your cat down and make it feel more secure.Be sure to avoid forcing the kitten to do anything it doesn’t want to do. If the cat is very afraid, you may need to let it run and hide, rather than forcing it into your arms.
Make yourself available for comfort, but don’t force the kitten to sit with you when it clearly doesn’t want to.

, If your kitten seems scared, try to take the cat’s mind off of the scary situation by attracting its attention to something else. Try distracting the kitten with a delicious treat or a fun toy to play with. This should help your scared kitty feel more confident and move past the feelings of fear.Distracting the kitten can help your cat become more socialized by making it forget the thing that made it feel afraid. This will help your cat become more well-adjusted overall, especially as the kitten encounters more things over time.

The best way for your kitten to get over this fear and to become a well-adjusted adult cat later in life is to make your kitten interact with many people, especially while it is quite young. Don’t force your kitten to do things it doesn’t like, but make sure your kitten is around a variety of people so that it grows accustomed to humans coming and going in your home.Remind any children that interact with your fearful kitten to treat the cat gently and avoid scaring it on purpose.
Ask people your kitten seems scared of to offer the kitten treats so that it becomes less afraid of new people over time.

, Kittens are often afraid of other animals they encounter in your home, so you’ll need to work on building up your kitten’s positive experiences with any other pets you may have. Try transferring some of your other pet’s scent onto the kitten by petting the other animal first and then holding your kitten without washing your hands.Introduce your kitten to new animals one at a time. This will help you avoid overwhelming the already frightened kitten.

, Try to help your scared kitten overcome its fear by desensitizing it with treats. This means that you should have another family member hold the kitten while the scary loud noise is happening. They should pet the kitten and give it treats to make it forget about the noise.Kittens are often afraid of loud noises in your home. This can include things like vacuum cleaners, hair dryers, power tools, or even storms outside.

Give treats often.,
Reward good behavior.,
Spend quality time with your kitten.",How to Help a Fearful Kitten Feel More Confident4," One great way to get your kitten to feel more confident is by providing treats on a regular basis, especially at first while you are trying to train the cat away from the fearful behavior. Kittens love treats, so the cat will associate the treats with a positive feeling. The kitten should get more confident as it explores and interacts in its new home while it searches for new treats.Make sure you give the kitten treats that are relatively healthy, so as not to negatively impact the growing kitty. Consider giving your kitten small bits of cooked (preferably boiled or baked) chicken, or other healthy snacks.

, If your kitten does something that is particularly brave or curious, reward the cat with something positive – this can be a treat, praise, playtime, or petting from you. All of these things are positive for the cat and will encourage this type of behavior.Showing the kitten repeatedly over time that you value this behavior should make the kitten feel encouraged to repeat the action again in the future. This should be a good way to help train your scared kitten to feel more confident.

, Kittens love interaction and physical touch. A great way to encourage your kitten to be less afraid is to spend a lot of time playing and interacting with the cat. As your bond grows, the kitten should feel emboldened to expand its search parameters or to explore more things on its own.Play with your kitten for at least an hour or two each day. Let the kitten take naps on your lap. The more time you spend together, the more confident your cat should become.

Give a medical history.,
Prepare for a physical exam.,
Expect diagnostic tests.,
Understand hospitalization may be necessary.",How to Help a Cat That Is Dragging Its Rear Legs1," When you bring your cat in, you'll need to give information about the cat's symptoms, particularly when the cat started exhibiting the problem. You also should note if you saw anything that could have caused the problem, such as an injury.

The vet may take blood and urine samples to be sent for testing. The vet may also take an x-ray to see if the problem is physical (in the spine).The vet may also take CT scans or MRIs or perform a biopsy.
If the cat has experienced trauma, then the vet will likely assume the condition is related, and diagnostic tests like x-rays will help the vet see the nature of the injury. Similarly, it could be a back problem, such as a slipped disc or a blood clot, which an x-ray will also help determine.
For other problems, such as diabetic problems and tick poisoning, blood and urine tests will help narrow down the issue. If your vet suspects a or finds a tumor, they'll likely use a biopsy to tell if it is benign.

, When a cat is first having problems in its back legs, a hospital visit is likely in order, especially if the cat is having trouble doing things like going to the bathroom. In the hospital, the vet can observe and diagnose the cat."

, Cat grass can give your cat a bit of nature indoors.This type of plant is safe for cats to eat, and is readily available from pet supply stores. Plant some in a pot (or a few!) and set it around your house for your cat to explore. You'll enjoy watching your cat try to eat it.

, Cats love to watch birds, squirrels, and other creatures, and to keep an eye on outside activity. A window can be a great source of entertainment, especially if you have a cat who stays indoors permanently.

, An enclosed outdoor space can be a fun way for your indoor cat to get a taste of the outdoors. For instance, if you have a screened-in area of a home, such as a porch or sunroom, you can let your cat have access to it., They have a small harness and lead for you to walk a cat much as you would a dog. Not every cat will cooperate with a leash, so it take some time to train your cat to walk on a leash. It is easiest to start while the cat is young so it can get used to it.

, Outdoor cats can have fun pouncing on things, hiding and sneaking, and hunting small creatures.If you want to start bringing an outdoor cat indoors, do so slowly. Gradually have it spend more time indoors. You will also have to have patience while getting it used to using a litterbox, scratching post, and other indoor things., Cats are active creatures, but typically will play in short bursts of 5-15 minutes.It's a great idea for cats to play frequently, so try having a few short play sessions at different times during the day.

, Many cats enjoy having their own toys. Choose toys that will allow your cat to mimic its natural hunting behavior--things it can chase, pounce, or catch, for instance. Cats have individual personalities, so you might have to try a few different toys to find what yours likes. You can also change toys occasionally (every day or few days) to keep your cat from getting bored.Good toys can include:


Wand toys with something at the end
Rubber balls, or any soft or bouncy toy. Cats like to bat things with their paws.Catnip toys
Crinkly stuff, like bubble wrap or paper bags

Bags and boxes are great for this.In fact, your cat might play with one all by itself if you leave it lying around.

, The catnip plant is a member of the mint family. For reasons not entirely understood, many cats react enthusiastically to catnip—it may make them roll and flip around, act highly stimulated, or appear especially content.. You can safely give your cat catnip in various ways. You can try:


Buying a catnip-filled toy.
Making your own catnip toy. Fill a plastic easter egg with some loose catnip (found at pet supply stores) and watch your cat have fun sniffing and pawing it.Sprinkling some loose catnip on one of your cat’s things, like a toy or scratching post.

, Take a paper towel roll and put some shredded paper in it along with some treats and maybe some catnip. Watch your cat enjoy trying to get at the treats inside., Each cat will want to play in particular ways and at particular times, so pay attention to your cat’s preferences. Following a few tips can help you keep your cat happy and interested:


Don’t let your cat win all the time, or lose all the time.Don’t force your cat to play with you. If it doesn’t seem interested in one thing, try another. If it’s still not interested, wait and try playing another time.Stop playing if your cat becomes unusually aggressive.It might need to “cool off” for a while, or it might prefer to play a different way.

, You may need to contact a veterinarian if you see signs that your cat is in pain, such as:


Hesitation before jumping
Walking slowly up stairs or over other obstacles
Not landing correctly when jumping

, If you have an indoor cat, or an outdoor cat that spends time indoors, then you want it to play freely while staying safe.For instance:


Store cleaning supplies and other chemicals in securely sealed containers out of your cat’s reach.
Certain common houseplants (like ivy and mistletoe) are toxic to cats, so keep them away.
Cats sometimes like to crawl into small or dark places like cabinets and closets. Make sure that your cat does not get trapped inside one, especially if it has a habit of crawling inside.

, If you have a cat that spends all or part of its time outdoors, you can have fun watching it pounce, stalk, and hide. You can give it toys or let it play with things it finds outside.

Place treats in your cat’s favorite toys.,
Show your cat the treats and let it smell them.,
Hide the treats in spots in your home.,
Let your cat find the treats.",How to Hide Treats for Your Cat2," To play hide and seek with your cat, start by putting treats in its favorite toys, such as a stuffed mouse toy. Use toys that have a slot in them to hide treats or cut a hole in your cat's stuffed toys to put the treats inside them.If you do not want to stuff the treats in your cat’s favorite toys, you can just use the treats themselves. However, using a stuffed toy can prevent small children and other animals from getting at the treats.

, Start by showing your cat the toy stuffed with treats or the bag of treats. Let it smell the treats so it is aware of the smell and can use it to hunt down the treats.You may also use verbal cues for your cat, such as, “Look at the treats” or “Smell the treats.”

, Make sure your cat can see where you are hiding the treats. Put them all over the house so your cat has to move around to get them. Once you have hidden the treats, wait for your cat to find them.For example, you may hide the treats in your cat's favorite hiding spots, such as under furniture or on high shelving in your home. Or you may hide the treats near your cat's bed or its scratching post.

, Once your cat finds the treat, reward it with verbal praise and heavy petting. Try playing the hide and seek game once a day, rotating out the hiding spots so your cat gets better at hunting down the treats.Over time, try not showing your cat where you are hiding the treats. This will help your cat learn to find the treats on its own. This can up the challenge of the game for your cat.

Avoid giving your cat human food as a treat.,
Make your own cat treats.,
Ask your vet for cat treat recommendations.",How to Hide Treats for Your Cat3," When you buy cat treats from your local pet store or online, make sure you read the list of ingredients. The ingredients should be items you recognize, such as protein like tuna, beef, or chicken. Avoid treats that contain additives, preservatives, or dyes. You should also look at the number of calories and the fat content to ensure the treats are not too high in calories or fat.The treats should also contain an Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) certification. This ensures the treats meet the industry guidelines and are considered safe for your cat to eat.

, Catnip, also known as catmint, catwort, or field balm, is a fragrant herb that is natural and low-calorie. It is very popular with cats and makes a great treat. You can find dried and fresh catnip at your local pet store or online.You can also buy catnip seeds and grow your own catnip at home by a sunny window.

, Cats can find it difficult to digest human food. Try to give your cat human food as an occasional treat, such as small pieces of cheese, cooked tuna, chicken, fish, or liver. Do not give them too much human food at once, only small bites or pieces at a time.Avoid giving your cat human foods that are toxic or harmful to cats, such as raisins, grapes, onions, alcohol, salt, tea, and whole milk.

, If you really want to ensure you know exactly what is in your cat’s treats, make your own at home. Prepare organic cat treats made with tuna, chicken, or cheese. Use basic ingredients and a few easy steps to make healthy cat treats that also taste good.

Ask if surgery is necessary.,
Expect medications for saddle thrombus.",How to Help a Cat That Is Dragging Its Rear Legs2," Some causes of paralysis, such as a slipped disc, may be partially treated by physical therapy. You'll likely need to take the cat to a physical therapist, which may just be someone at your vet's clinic. In addition, the specialist may give you exercises for the cat at home., Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to weakness in the back leg. Evening out your cat's disease can help the cat regain strength.The main ways to control your cat's diabetes are through insulin, medication, and a weight-loss diet.The type of diet your cat should be on depends on the cat. Some cats do best on a very high-protein diet, while other diabetic cats do best on a high-fiber, complex carbohydrate diet. Talk to your vet about the best one to start your cat on.
Ask your vet about supplements. Some pet owners have had success with potassium, L-carnitine, and/or methylcobalamin.

, In some cases, surgery may be the only solution. Surgery can help with problems such as spine issues or tumors. If the cat had a traumatic injury, amputation of one or both of the back legs may be necessary.After surgery, your cat may stay in the hospital a few days, or it may come home. You'll need to keep the cat calm by keeping it in a small, quiet area. Your vet may advise you keep the cat in a crate for a day or two.
Give it small amounts of water and food throughout the day. Also, administer any medications prescribed by the vet.
The cat may also need to wear a protective collar so it doesn't lick the stitches., Saddle thrombus is a condition where your cat has a blood clot that travels from the heart. The arteries in your cat's back narrow just before they get to the back legs, so clots often stop there. In turn, your cat's back legs don't get enough blood flow.The main treatment for this condition is medication to dissolve the blood clot and pain medication to help keep the cat comfortable. However, some vets may not want to take this course of action. The disease is very painful for the cat and often indicates heart disease, as well, so some vets may recommend putting the cat to sleep.Some cats don't recover the full use of their back legs. Also, the condition has a high chance of recurrence.

Make your home accessible.",How to Help a Cat That Is Dragging Its Rear Legs3," Cats with back leg paralysis will likely have trouble getting into a traditional litter box. You may need to add a ramp or get a very shallow litter box depending on your cat's needs., If a cat is paralyzed in the back half of its body, it may need bathroom care. You will need to help it go to the bathroom by using your hands to empty its bladder and bowels. A vet will need to show exactly how to do this step.You'll also need to have the cat wear diapers. Bedding will need to be easy to clean.

, Some cats get around just fine on their front legs, but a mobility assistance device can also do wonders. These devices provide a way to lift their back end and increase mobility through wheels, allowing the cat to be mobile., While many cats will take to assistance devices, some cats don't. In addition, your cat cannot stay in an assistance device all day. For these purposes, your cat should have a drag bag. Basically, it covers the back end of the cat, so the cat doesn't get sores on its legs. Plus, it makes it easier for the cat to drag its back end because the bag is made of slick material.You can find these bags online.

, When a cat becomes disabled, you need to make changes around your home so it can get around more easily. You may need to install ramps over stairs, for instance, or move the food and litter box to the main floor. Consider adding a ramp to your cat's favorite couch so the cat can still get up on it.Think about how your furniture is arranged, too. For instance, if your cat is in a wheelchair device, make sure the cat has enough room to get around.

Open your window coverings.,
Create a window perch for your cat.,
Move furniture into the sunlight.,
Ensure there is space on the floor near windows.",How to Give Your Cat Space to Sunbathe1," Make sure that you always open your window coverings during the day. This will help provide your cat with natural light for sunbathing. When you wake up each morning, open all of the blinds and curtains in your house.If you are worried that your cat may get a sunburn from bathing in direct light all day, you can install UV protective coating to your windows.

, Cats love to sunbathe and you can make this a lot easier by installing a window perch for your cat. These can be purchased from your local pet supply store and are installed directly onto the window. There are a variety of different perches available, some use suctions for suspension, others are attached to the wall below the window. When choosing a cat perch, take into consideration your cat's size and weight.Your cat may also sleep on the window sill if it is large enough.

, If your cat enjoys sunbathing, then it is important to make sure that there is a comfortable place for your cat to sit near a window. For example, you can situate your furniture, such as a chair or couch near the window. This will give your cat a spot to rest and access sunlight. Alternatively, you could situate cat furniture, such as a cat tree, or cat bed close to the window. Your cat will likely seek out these spots and you can make this easier by ensuring that comfortable furniture is positioned in well-lit places., Some cats like to stretch out in a ray of sunlight on the floor. You can help facilitate this by ensuring that there is empty floor space available near your cat's favourite window.

Take the kittens back to the shelter, when the time comes.",How to Foster Kittens," You will want to have a separate room for the kittens to live in. This should be a quiet and dark place where they feel secure. It should also be away from any other pets in your home.If you can't give the kittens their own space that can be blocked off, where they can be kept away from other pets, then you probably shouldn't be fostering kittens.;
, Kitten-proofing means getting all the things that could be dangerous to small kittens out of the room. If the room is cluttered, it may be a good idea to move out desks, chairs, shelves, or bookshelves. Move out anything that you care about or could be dangerous for the kittens. Also consider moving out beds or other furniture that makes hiding easy for kittens, as it is not fun to spend your time trying to get the kitten out from under furniture.Put away all things that are small, such as hair clips, ties, small toys, beads. Also move electrical wires or cables out of the kitten's reach. If you wouldn't leave something in a room with an unsupervised toddler, you shouldn't have it in the kitten room.

, You will want to have a bed for the kittens to sleep in, to go to relax, and where the mother can nurse them. It should have a top and feel enclosed. Layer it with towels, blankets, and other soft stuff layers.Make sure that everything you use can be laundered if it gets dirty. It is likely that the kittens will have accidents and you will need to wash their bedding often.

, Near the bed you should place food and water bowls, if the kittens are old enough to eat on their own. The best are trays, which are long and shallow containers that are good for a lot of kittens eating at once. Don't use bowls that are too deep, as the kittens will have a hard time accessing food and water.If the kittens are needing to be bottle fed, check in with the shelter to get bottles and milk formula, or order it at your local pet store or online.

, You may want to get a couple of soft toys and some feather chasers to entertain the kittens. If the kittens are older, you may also consider getting a cat tree, as these can provide hours of fun and a nice place for the kitties to relax.Giving the kittens toys will entertain them and minimize the trouble they can get into if they are bored.

, You will definitely want to get training pads if the kittens are not litter-trained. You can spread them out all over the floor and especially over the bed.You will also need a litter box. You may prefer to get an enclosed one, so that the litter is better contained in the box.

, Almost all shelters provide fostering opportunities for members of the community and would really appreciate your help. Before you can foster, however, you need to get approved by the shelter and fill out all the necessary paperwork.The best time to find a fostering opportunity is spring (otherwise known as kitten season). This is the time when most kittens are born and end up homeless at the animal shelter. During this time, the shelters are often overcrowded with newborn kittens, and could use your help.
Most shelters will want verification that you are at least 18 years old, have space for a kitten, that you are allowed to have a kitten (if you rent your home), and that you can pass a criminal background check.

, You may need to go to a training session where shelter staff will explain in depth how to take care of the kittens. This training is especially important if you are going to foster any kittens with special needs, such as a kitten that is ill or needs rehabilitation from an injury.

Once you have been approved to foster and you have done your training, it may take a while before you get your first kittens to foster. It all depends on what the needs of the shelter or rescue are at the time.

, Ask the shelter what kind of kittens they have available. There are two different kinds of foster kittens: kittens with a mother cat and orphaned kittens. Caring for young orphaned kittens less than three weeks of age can be very demanding, as you are providing for all of their needs. Kittens with a mother are much easier to care for.If you foster a kitten that has a mother you will also be taking in the mother cat. The mother cat will do almost all of the work, including nursing, cleaning, keeping the kitten warm, feeding, and stimulating the kittens' bowels.
If you are fostering for the first time, you will probably want to ask the shelter for kittens that have a mother. Without the mother, kittens face a far higher risk of becoming ill and dying.

, Make sure you bring a pet carrier or get one at the shelter, as you should never have kittens loose in your car. Roll up the car windows and try to drive relatively slow, so as to not scare the kittens. When you get home, take the kittens to a separate room and get them settled in. Give them a while to relax and get used to their environment.If you can, try to bring some of the kittens' bedding or toys with you when you take them home, as this will provide comfort.

, If the kittens are with a mom and still nursing, let her take care of them. She will feed them and clean them herself, so you don't need to do that. However, you will need to keep a close eye on them in order to make sure each kitten is getting plenty of milk and attention.If there is a runt in the litter, make sure you give that kitten a little extra time with the mother cat alone, without the other kittens to compete for food.
Make sure the mother cat is eating plenty of food. Either feed her dry kitten food or protein rich wet food, as she needs the protein to produce milk.

, If the kittens are still bottle feeding, make sure you feed them every two to three hours. Before feeding, warm the formula to 99–101 °F (37–38 °C). Wrap the kitten in a towel to keep it secure and then feed it until it is full. The employees at the shelter or rescue should give your clear instructions about this process and how long to continue it.Remember, very young kittens will even need feedings every 2 to 3 hours, even in the middle of the night.
You can pre-mix enough formula for the kitten for 24 hours but you need to keep it refrigerated. Only heat as much formula as you will use for one feeding.
When first bottle feeding a kitten, it may have a hard time latching on. Be patient, keep trying, and make sure that the nipple of the bottle has a big enough hole in it to release drops of milk. If all else fails, you can call the shelter or rescue for help.

, If the kittens you are fostering are very young, you may need to help their digestive system develop. After each feeding, wet a cotton ball with warm water and gently massage the kitten's rectum until it defecates. This is crucial for the kitten's developing digestive processes.This process replicates what the mother would usually do with her tongue.

, When the kittens are about 5 or 6 weeks old, they should be transitioned onto solid food. You may want to start by feeding them wet kitten food, and then begin supplementing that with dry food. This is done by slowly adding pebbles of dry food to the wet food and increasing it as they age.If the kittens are eating on their own already, that's good. Feed them three times a day and let them eat their fill. Kittens generally need as many calories as they can get.

, To do this, after every feeding (nursing, bottle feeding, eating solid food etc.), place the kitten in the litter box. It should then do its business. If a kitten has an accident, quickly pick it up as soon as possible and place the kitten in the litter box. With persistence, the kitten should learn how to use it.The litter box will need to be scooped at least three times a day, and the litter changed at least twice a week.

, Make sure you hold the kittens frequently, petting them and picking them up. Play with the kittens a lot. The more time you spend with them, the better socialized they will be to people throughout their lives.Spending time with the kittens is the best part of fostering, so enjoy it.
Touch their paws a lot, as they will need to be comfortable with it in the future to have their nails clipped.

, In order to protect the kittens, you, and any other pets you have from disease, you should wash your hands before and after handling the kittens. A kitten's immune system is still developing, so you need to protect it from everything you can.

You also want to keep any illnesses that the kittens might have brought with them away from your existing pets.

, Most kittens that are fostered will appear healthy when they are placed in your care but it is always possible for illnesses to develop. Look for lethargy, fur loss, breathing problems, diarrhea, scratching, vomiting, discharge, or lack of appetite in the kittens. If the symptoms persist, call the vet.If the kittens have goop coming from their eyes or nose, call the vet or go to the animal shelter to have the kitten looked at. In most cases, you will then be asked to give the kitten medication until the goop is gone.

, When you sign on to foster kittens, you will need to agree to take them in for a variety of veterinary appointments. This typically includes signing them up for spaying or neutering and taking them in to have it done.There may be other veterinary appointments for the kittens, depending on their health and what veterinary procedures have been done on them before you took them in. In many cases you will need to get them a variety of vaccinations and have their general health assessed by a veterinarian.

, If you want to, start to let the kittens leave the room for short periods of time once they are seven or eight weeks old and have been at your house for at least a few weeks. However, they should always be accompanied by you and never allowed to run around loose, especially if you have other animals.Don't force the kittens to interact with other cats or dogs as this can result in injury and fear.
Always supervise the kittens carefully, and keep all doors closed.

, Your shelter will appreciate cute photos and videos being supplied when the kittens are up for adoption. They can post them online, on their website or on a pet finding websites. Typically, you can email the foster coordinator the pictures.


If you can, also include a small bio of each kitten. Include a general summary of their personality, which will be helpful for adoptive families considering the kitten.

, This is the hardest part of fostering, as you have likely grown close to the kittens you are fostering. Remember that you have greatly helped this animal and it will have a great new home and wonderful life thanks to your efforts.If you want to, you can ask your shelter if they would let you know when the kittens are adopted and, if possible, the email of their adopters if you would like to keep in contact.

Give your cat vet-recommended amounts of food and water.,
Prevent your cat from licking or grooming the stitches.,
Give your cat a restful environment.",How to Help a Cat Recover from Hip Dislocation Surgery1," After the surgery, your cat will probably have very little appetite, and may not want any food for a day or two. Follow your veterinarian’s advice on how much to feed your cat following the surgery, and make sure your cat has access to clean water.

Providing your cat with too much food and water after surgery will make it nauseous, and it may vomit.;
, Your cat may try to claw or bite at the sutures following surgery. If the cat continually tries to scratch or groom the injured hip, ask your vet for a large plastic cone to place around your cat’s neck, so it cannot bite or lick at the sutured area., Your cat will be groggy and tired after the surgery, and may not return to a typical energy level for days. During the time they’re healing, your cat will need a solitary, quiet place to recover. Also give the cat soft, comfortable bedding to sleep and rest on. If your cat is on cage rest, you can place soft towels or bedding in the kennel.It’s very important to keep your cat from jumping after surgery, so ensure there isn’t furniture or other items your cat may be tempted to jump on in their environment.
If you have other animals or small children in the household, keep them away from the cat, as they will likely bother and stress the cat.

If you notice your cat struggling to breathe or their mobility suddenly becomes restricted, they may be suffering from heart disease. If these symptoms occur, you should visit your vet immediately., If you believe your cat may have heart disease or a related heart condition, you should take your cat to the vet immediately for a medical assessment. Your vet will likely perform x-rays, echocardiography, and an ultrasound of the heart in order to diagnose the problem. Once diagnosed, they may prescribe atenolol.Atenolol should only be given to your cat if it has been prescribed by a licensed veterinarian.

, If your cat has been prescribed atenolol to treat heart disease, there is a good chance it is already on other medications for related health issues. Atenolol can interact with other drugs that your cat may be taking. These interactions can either reduce or increase the effects of other drugs.For example, atenolol will increase the effects of many drugs that are used for anesthesia.
Alternatively, it will reduce the effects of drugs that are used to increase heart rate or blood pressure.

, If you do not understand the instructions provided by your vet, ask for clarification. It is very important that you follow these instructions carefully.

Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds and then rinse off the soap and dry your hands on a clean towel., Ask your vet about any possible side effects from the drug and monitor your cat to see if any develop. Some possible side effects to look for include:Slow heart rate
Low blood pressure
Loss of energy and appetite
Diarrhea

, Some common indicators that your cat may have overdosed on atenolol include: slow heartbeat, shortness of breath, fainting, dizziness, weakness, confusion, or nausea., If you suspect that your cat has overdosed on atenolol, you should contact your vet immediately. Perhaps you left the pills on the counter and your cat got into the container while you were out. If your vet is not available, you can also contact the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC).Always bring the prescription bottle with you to the vet or APCC.

Verify that you are using the recommended dosage.,
Hold the cat still.,
Open the tube.,
Apply the medication to the back of the cat's neck.,
Make sure all the medication is applied.,
Don't let the cat disturb the application area.,
Wash your hands.,
Apply monthly, or as directed.",How to Give Selamectin to Cats with Parasites1," The minimum recommended dosage for Selamectin is 2.7 mg per pound (or 1.22 mg per kilogram) of body weight. However, the medication comes in a variety of pre-filled application tubes. Make sure that you are using the correctly sized application for the size of your cat.In most cases, your veterinarian will prescribe a certain size of application for your cat, based on its size. When you get refills of the medication, make sure you are still getting the correct size.;
, In order to apply Selamectin, you will need to limit your cat's ability to move. If your cat is particularly docile, you may just be able to hold it still in your lap. However, if your cat is active, you may need to restrain it.


In order to restrain a cat without injuring it, you can swaddle it with a towel. Have someone else help you. Place a towel out on a table, have the helper place the cat in the middle of the towel, and then wrap the towel around the cat. If you can get it snug enough to keep your cat's paws inside the towel, but not so tight that it hurts the cat, then this restraint will work for applying Selamectin.

, Open the container of Selamectin by first holding the tube upright. Then press down on the top of the cap until you hear a clicking sound. This signals that the seal on the tube has been broken.Once the seal has been broken, you can remove the cap.

, Whether you are holding your cat lightly or you have it restrained, move the fur at the back of the neck apart, so that the cat's skin is exposed. Then place the tip of the tube on the skin and slowly squeeze the contents of the tube onto the cat's neck.In order to make sure that all the medication makes it to the skin, you may need to empty the application container slowly. Allowing a few drops at a time to make contact with the skin will ensure that all the medication makes it onto the skin and not just onto the cat's fur.
While you are at your veterinarian's office, consider having the veterinarian show you how to apply this medication.

, As you remove the tube, you should keep it squeezed until it is clear of the medication that has been deposited. This will ensure that none of the medication is sucked back up into the tube.If you accidentally do suck some of the medication back into the tube, take the time to reapply it to your cat's skin. It is important that your cat has the full dose in order to keep parasites off of your cat.

, Continue to hold the cat still for awhile after you have applied the medication. You want to let it absorb as much as possible into the skin before letting the cat go. Once you think the medication is mostly absorbed, you can let the cat go.


The location of the application is designed to make it very difficult for the cat to disturb it. However, if your cat is very persistent and rubs or claws at the area, then you may need to keep an eye on it to make sure that it leaves the area alone.

, Selamectin can be irritating to human skin. After you have finished applying the medication to your cat, you should thoroughly wash your hands and any other area that might have been splashed with the medication., Your veterinarian will likely recommend a monthly dose of Selamectin. If applied as directed, this should protect your cat from fleas, ticks, heartworms, and a variety of other parasites.


Be sure to only give this medication to your cat monthly. If you apply it too often you run the risk of poisoning your cat.Signs of poisoning include hair loss at application location, vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood), lethargy, excessive salivation, and fever."

Follow your surgeon’s guidance on the cat’s confinement.,
Do not allow the cat out of its cage.,
Feed your cat in the kennel.,
Give your cat access to a litter box.",How to Help a Cat Recover from Hip Dislocation Surgery2," Due to the sensitive nature of the operation, your vet will likely recommend that the cat be confined following the surgery. In mild cases, the vet may suggest confinement to a single room in your house. However, if the vet is concerned that the hip may dislocate again, they may request that you confine your cat to a single large cage or kennel.In most cases, your vet will request that you bring the cat in for a follow-up inspection a month or two after the surgery.

, It’s important that, while the cat recovers from its hip dislocation surgery, it be confined in a large cage or pet kennel. Although the cat will doubtlessly protest its restricted movement, it’s for the cat’s own good. If the cat is allowed into too large of an area, it may run or jump, and re-dislocate the hip that was just operated upon.In cases where the vet suggests milder confinement, keep the cat shut in a room, such as your bedroom, laundry room, or small basement.
If possible, remove from the room low pieces of furniture (desks, chairs, dressers, etc.) that the cat could jump up onto, so it doesn’t injure itself in the process.

, Since your cat will be confined for three to four weeks, you’ll need to work out a system for feeding it within its large cage. If you visit your local pet store, you’ll find various models of food and water bowls which attach directly to the wire mesh of the kennel door. Using a door-mounted type of bowl, provide your cat with frequent access to food and constant access to water.

Attaching food and water bowls to the door itself will keep the floor of the kennel cleaner, since your cat won’t be able to knock its food and water down onto the bottom of the kennel (and whatever blankets and pads it may have).

, Whether your cat is confined to a large kennel or to a single room, it will need to have frequent access to a litter box. If you cat is on cage rest, release the animal into a small room (such as a bathroom) which contains the litter box. Let the cat do its business, and then return it to the cage.

This will be easier to provide if your cat is confined to a single room. Simply lay down a sheet of plastic on the ground, and then place the litter box on top of that.

"
Give your cat any prescribed medications.,
Watch for signs of bleeding or lingering redness.,
Give your cat attention.,
Take the cat to the vet for a follow-up surgery.",How to Help a Cat Recover from Hip Dislocation Surgery3," Your veterinarian will doubtlessly send you home with various prescribed medications: likely one or two painkillers to keep your cat from suffering, and an antibiotic to prevent infection. Follow the vet’s directions and the directions written on the packaging concerning how many pills you should give your cat, and how often they should be administered.If you run out of a certain medication but feel that your cat would benefit from more (e.g. a painkiller), contact the vet’s office about a refill.

, It’s normal for your cat’s skin surrounding its sutures to be reddened (and even bleed lightly) for the first couple of days following the surgery. However, if the area stays red for longer than two or three days, or if you see a scab forming by the sutures, you should contact your veterinarian. Also contact your vet if you notice any other concerning symptoms in the area operated on, including:Swelling or bruising
Fluid discharge or an unpleasant odor

, Your cat may be anxious or upset following the surgery. Especially if your cat is sequestered, make sure to spend time with it. Pet or stroke your cat and speak to it in a soothing voice. Spend time in the room your cat is in, even if they are in a cage. This will help your cat feel less anxious and more comfortable., If your cat had any pins installed in its hip (in order to help the hip heal correctly) during the hip displacement surgery, you will need to schedule a follow-up appointment. During this appointment, the vet will surgically remove the pins. Plan to have the follow-up appointment and surgery three or four weeks after the initial surgery.If the cat’s hip did not have pins inserted, there may be no need for a follow-up appointment.
As always, check with your veterinarian to see if they recommend a follow-up.

Search in the right places for fireflies.,
Look for fireflies at the right time.,
Use your own light to attract fireflies.,
Turn off your outdoor lights.,
Remain quiet and calm.",How to Catch a Firefly1," Fireflies live in various habitats, including forests and rivers. They tend to be drawn to high grass and humid, damp areas. They are found all over the world, from the Americas to Europe and Asia. In the United States, fireflies are rarely found west of the Rocky Mountains. They are commonly found down south, in the Midwest, and on the East Coast., Warm summer evenings are often the best time to catch fireflies – typically between June and September. Fireflies tend to come out at dusk when it is still warm out. Most fireflies are typically found in the country or in the suburbs.


As the night gets later, the air tends to cool off and some fireflies will stop flashing., Since fireflies communicate using their light, you can sometimes attract them by using a flashlight of your own. Pay attention to the light patterns that the fireflies are emitting, and copy them by switching your flashlight on and off.


Consider placing a blue piece of paper over your flashlight to turn the light blue. Scientists have found that fireflies respond better to blue light than regular lights., Since they rely on their light patterns for mating, fireflies are more attracted to darkness. Turn off your outdoor lighting, such as porch lights and walkway lights, to draw in more fireflies., Like most animals and insects, fireflies are easily scared by loud noises and sudden movements. When catching fireflies, make sure to move slowly and quietly. The more relaxed you are, the more relaxed the fireflies will be around you."

Get a sealable tank.,
Smear a greasy substance near the top of the container.,
Cover the floor of the container with some bedding.,
Furnish the enclosure with hiding spaces.,
Keep the habitat humid.,
Purchase a male and a female specimen.,
Keep the room temperature under control.,
Check the growth of your colony.,
Feed them with pelleted food.,
Offer them fresh fruits and vegetables once a week.,
Provide water in a separate plate.",How to Breed Hissing Cockroaches," Pick a glass fish tank or a Rubbermaid plastic bin where you will house your colony. A colony grows very fast, so make sure it's large enough to hold a few hundred roaches if you want to start a breeding business.


Plan on about 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) per dozen adult roaches, though you can also keep many more younger roaches in the same container.Use a container that can be fully closed with a lid. There shouldn't be any holes or cracks in it because roaches can get through them very easily, especially when they're young.Make sure to drill holes in the top if you're using a storage container or bucket. The holes should be about a half an inch in diameter, and then you should seal the holes with microscreen. In a large storage container (20 gallons), you'll need at least 10 holes along the top.When choosing a container, remember that what matters the most is floor space for food, water and furnishing, not height.;
, Madagascar roaches are very skillful climbers: you should spread Vaseline, olive oil or bug stop on the upper 3 inches of the container that are closer to the lid to prevent hissers from reaching the top., This is also known as substrate: the aim is to recreate a forest-like environment that resembles their original habitat. You can use gravel, sand, oak leaves as long as you avoid dirt, which makes it very hard to keep the tank clean and prevent undesired pests, or material that could get moldy, such as food.A good material for bedding is orchid bark or coco soft, which you can purchase in larger pet stores, specializing in insects and reptiles.If you think the bedding would make it too hard to keep the habitat clean, you can do without it. Hissers will be just as okay on a flat floor., Since most insects, including roaches, live under leaf matter and fallen logs, it's a good idea to add a few hiding spots. The best things you can use are the bottom of an egg carton, small logs, pieces of bark or tubes (like the cardboard ones found inside paper rolls).


If you use egg cartons, make sure you place several in the enclosure so the roaches will have multiple layers to hide in.

, Madagascar roaches are used to the very humid climate of the Madagascar rainforest, so they'll breed and live better in a similar environment. You should mist the enclosure every other day, or even each day if you live in a dry climate.You can also place the container near a room humidifier, but make sure you still mist the enclosure on a regular basis.

, To start your colony, you obviously need your little Adam and Eve. If you want to purchase more than two and want the colony to grow at a faster rate, purchase one male and multiple females. Once you've done this, the roaches will take care of the rest.


You can easily tell the difference between sexes: males have large horns while females don't.
It's not a good idea to start with more than one male. Madagascar roaches are very territorial, and males fight with each other for dominance. Once you have a well-established colony, this will become less of a problem because of the number of roaches. They'll fight anyway, but you won't have to worry about the steady growth of the colony.

, In order to breed, Madagascar roaches need a temperature around 85 to 95 °F (29 to 35 °C). They are tropical insects and won't produce young if the temperature is too cold.


If you live in a cold climate or do not want your room temperature to be too high, you can use lamps or place the container near heaters.

, A female will usually mate with dominant males. The gestation period is around 60 days, after which the female lays the eggs in a long case, known as ootheca'.' Nymphs are born out of it.


Each female will produce 2 to 3 dozens nymphs per gestation, and 700 over her whole life.
Nymphs are around the size of a watermelon seed (1/4 inch) and white. It takes them from 3 months to 1 year and around 6 to 7 molts (shedding their skin) to grow into adults, depending on the climate and living conditions. Once they've grown up, they'll start mating and produce more offspring.
Nymphs usually eat their own skin once it's shed.
Adults and nymphs get along with each other in the same enclosure and won't harm each other if there's enough food around.The color of an adult will depend on the food supply and usually ranges from brown or golden brown to black., Any dry pelleted food for pets, such as dogs, cats or birds, is good. Place it in a paper plate in the enclosure, as long as it's not too high for nymphs to climb. Make sure it has a high protein content, because your roaches will need it to grow fast and healthily. Remove it after a few days if it gets moldy or wet. Not giving them enough protein might result in roaches eating each other to get more nutrients., The best treats for roaches are carrots (big favorites) , apples, bananas, strawberries, oranges, romaine lettuce or leafy greens (collard, turnip, mustard greens). Make sure they're fresh and peeled, because pesticides could kill the whole colony very fast.Remove any fruits or vegetables that haven't been eaten within one or two days to prevent mold: this can be a huge threat to the colony., This should include something you can soak it up with, like paper. Sponges tend to smell after a while so it's better to avoid them. Do not pour water in a bowl without something to soak it up, because roaches could drown in it.You can also use water gel, usually sold by florists.

Acquire a cage.,
Choose a substrate.,
Add a hiding spot.,
Add a food dish.,
Add décor.",How to Care for Blue Death Feigning Beetles1,"  It is important to choose the correct size cage for your beetles. A cage that is too large will mean that the beetles will not be close enough to their food to find it. A cage that is too small will mean that the beetles will have no room to walk around. As a general rule, for every gallon that a cage is in size, five beetles can live. A one gallon (3.78 liters) cage can hold 5 beetles. A five gallon (18.92 liters) cage can hold 25 beetles. A ten gallon (37.85 liters) cage can hold 50 beetles, and so on. A cage that is a little bit too big is ALWAYS better than a cage that is a little bit too small. You can buy a glass terrarium or plastic critter keeper from a pet store to use as a cage. A plastic storage bin also works. Remember that blue death feigning beetles cannot climb glass or plastic, so a lid is not required, but still recommended. If you do add a lid, make sure it is ventilated so that air can flow in and out of the cage.;
, The substrate is one of the most important components in an insect cage. Because blue death feigning beetles are desert beetles, they prefer a sand based substrate. Play sand alone works fine, but many people like to mix in coconut fiber, or dead leaves into the sand. The substrate should line the bottom of the cage to a depth of 1-2 inches (2.5-5.8 centimeters.)

, Blue death feigning beetles are diurnal, meaning that they are active during the day and sleep at night. At night they like to stay hidden. You can provide your beetles with a hiding spot by simply leaning a piece of bark against the side of the cage. You can also buy a nice looking wooden half log from a pet store to use as a hiding spot. A toilet paper roll that is half buried in the substrate works too. Remember that the more beetles you have, the more hiding spots you will have to provide.

, It is important to keep the food you feed your beetles off of the substrate to prevent mold growth. A small food dish should be able to hold enough food for many beetles. If you have a larger colony of beetles, you might want to consider adding multiple food dishes. DO NOT ADD A WATER DISH! Blue death feigning beetles get all the water they need from the food they eat. A water dish is unnecessary and can result in drowned bugs! You can buy a food dish from a pet store or use a small overturned lid as a food dish.

, This step is not required but can be done to make the cage look nice. Live plants can be planted in the cage, assuming they will grow in the substrate that you select. If you do choose to add live plants, make sure that they are not toxic to you, or the beetles. Fake plants and terrarium décor can be bought at pet stores. Make sure not to overcrowd the beetles with unnecessary decorative items!

Catch fireflies with your hands.,
Use a net to catch fireflies.,
Catch fireflies with a mason jar.",How to Catch a Firefly2," As long as you approach fireflies slowly, they should maintain a calm and graceful flying path – this will make them fairly easy to catch. Once you are close enough to a firefly, calmly reach out with both hands, and try to cup the firefly between your hands. The outsides of your hands should be tightly cupped together when you catch the firefly, but leave enough space between your palms so that you do not crush it.This may take a few tries. Don't get annoyed or overwhelmed, just keep trying. Stay calm and relaxed.

, You can purchase nets at most home supply stores, or make your own out of a small netting. To catch fireflies with a net, simply flow the net around a firefly inhabited area until you catch one. Keep your movements slow and gentle so that you do not scare or harm the fireflies., Most people end up putting their caught fireflies into mason jars, so skip a step by catching your fireflies in a mason jar. Move slowly and calmly as you move your mason jar through the air to catch fireflies. Once a firefly has flown into the opening of your jar, place the lid on top to keep the firefly inside.

"
"
Keep your fireflies in a glass jar.,
Create a habitat in your jar for the fireflies.,
Release the fireflies after a short period of time.",How to Catch a Firefly3," If you plan on keeping the fireflies that you have caught, put them in a glass jar so that you can see their light. Mason jars are popular jars to store fireflies is. Do not poke any holes in the jar, as this could dry out the air and possibly cause the firefly to get injured while trying to escape. Remember that fireflies like humid, damp spaces.Only keep a few fireflies in a jar at the same time. This will give the fireflies some room to fly around.

, Creating a habitat in the jar will help keep the fireflies alive and happy. Put a small piece of apple and a small handful of fresh grass in the jar. The apple will help keep the air in the jar moist, and the grass will give them something to climb on, eat, and hide in., Although it can be tempting to keep fireflies for a long time, it's best to let them grafter a short while. Ideally, you should let fireflies go before bed. If you keep them overnight, be sure to release them the following morning. They need to be in their natural habitat in order to survive, and keeping them in a jar for longer than a day can cause them to die.

Search online to buy beetles.,
Find blue death feigning beetles.,
Move the beetles into the cage.",How to Care for Blue Death Feigning Beetles2," Blue death feigning beetles can be bought off the internet from online insect suppliers. Before buying from a site, make sure that they are actually trying to sell you beetles and not trying to steal your credit card information. You should also make sure that the sight is providing you with healthy beetles and can ship them to you without risking the death of your new pet!

, If you live in the South-Western United States, then finding blue death feigning beetles could be an option for you. You can look for them in sandy desert areas. Try lifting up rocks and pieces of wood. They can also be found on sand dunes, or at the base of many desert plants.

, Blue death feigning beetles are easily moved because they play dead when disturbed. These beetles will not bite, and are perfectly safe to hold in your hands. If you would like, you can wear gloves or use tongs to move the beetles. Just make sure you are gentle!

Keep the correct temperature and humidity.,
Feed them a varied diet.",How to Care for Blue Death Feigning Beetles3," These are desert beetles, so the humidity should be kept low. In-fact, the color of the beetles is based on the relative humidity! Beetles living in a cage with higher humidity will turn a blackish color, while beetles that are kept in low humidity, are bright blue! A lower humidity means more colorful beetles. If the humidity is too high, the beetles will die. Blue death feigning beetles do alright at room temperature, but a higher temperature will encourage breeding. Overall, they should be kept between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, (21-30 degrees Celsius) and at a relative humidity of 0-20%.

, Blue death feigning beetles are omnivorous. They will eat just about anything. Lettuce, carrots, apples, celery, and watermelon are the most convenient foods to feed your beetles and provide the beetles with water. Dry dog and cat food, grains, and other dead insects will also be eaten by blue death feigning beetles.

Watch your giant leopard moth emerge.",How to Care for a Giant Leopard Moth Caterpillar," Nearly any container can be converted into a great caterpillar home as long as you are able to secure the caterpillar and provide it air holes. Since caterpillars can crawl up the sides, it’s important to have a cover for its home. Otherwise, it’ll crawl away.If you have an aquarium or terrarium that allows air to flow through a lid made of screen netting, then you can use it instead of a jar. Check to make sure that the entire aquarium or terrarium is secure so that your caterpillar won’t escape.;
, Your caterpillar needs to breathe, so use a porous material like cheesecloth as a lid. Make sure that your cheesecloth doesn’t have holes that are big enough for the caterpillar to crawl through. You can secure the cheesecloth to your jar or pot with a large rubberband.If you don’t have cheesecloth, you can try using plastic wrap with plenty of holes poked in it.
Don’t use a metal jar lid because it can harm the caterpillar.

, You can use dirt from your yard or generic potting soil. If you find the caterpillar in nature, collect dirt from the area the caterpillar is living.Don’t take dirt from protected land, such as natural parks.

, Make your caterpillar comfortable by incorporating bits of its natural habitat. Your caterpillar will appreciate having places to crawl and hide.Collect grass, twigs, and leaves from where you found the caterpillar.
Do NOT put water into your caterpillar’s home because it will drown.

, You need to change out your caterpillar’s leaves daily or at least every other day because the leaves will decay.


If your caterpillar is on the old leaves, put in the new leaves and wait for it to crawl onto the new leaves on its own. Once it’s crawled over to the new leaves, you can remove the old ones., Caterpillars produce a lot of waste called frass, so you need to clean its home at least once a day to prevent mold or harm to your caterpillar.Use a paper towel to wipe the frass from the cage.

, If you want to follow your caterpillar’s natural life cycle, the place it on a porch, balcony, or in a garden if you have one.Keep your caterpillar warm. The caterpillar will hibernate during the winter, so a cold caterpillar will not be as active.
If you’re keeping it inside your house, consider putting it on a windowsill.

, If you found your caterpillar outside, start looking there. Caterpillars have a preferred diet, and they won’t switch food sources just because that’s what you give them. If you want your caterpillar to thrive, then you need to find the right plants.Giant leopard moth caterpillars enjoy munching leafy plants like dandelions, violets, honeysuckle, citrus plants, magnolias, lilacs, and broadleaf plantains.If you don’t find the plants in nature, you can buy a small potted plant. Dandelions, violets, and lilacs should be available in pots from your local garden store.

, Spiders and other insects can prey upon your caterpillar, so make sure that you don’t accidentally put a predator into your new pet’s home. You may come back to find your caterpillar has been eaten., At first, monitor your caterpillar to make sure that you are feeding it enough leaves. Caterpillars spend most of their time eating, so make sure that you meet your pet’s needs.Feed your caterpillar daily.
If you accidentally pull off more leaves than you need, you can keep them fresh by putting them in water and placing the container in the fridge.
Remember not to put containers of water in your caterpillar’s home because it will drown.

, If you have enough room in your caterpillar’s home, you can add a live plant for the caterpillar to eat. This is only possible for smaller plants, so look for one that will grow in a small pot, like a dandelion., Caterpillars can pick up germs from your hands, so make sure that you are clean before you handle it., Giant leopard moth caterpillars are nocturnal, so your caterpillar will be most active at night. You can look for movement during the day, but don’t try to wake up the caterpillar if it’s sleeping., Caterpillars will hold onto what they’re crawling on, so don’t try to remove your crawling critter. It will hold onto the surface and may be hurt., In the wild, giant leopard moth caterpillars hibernate all winter as part of their life cycle. Caterpillars can hibernate outside in their containers all winter, or you can put it into the refrigerator. Don’t freeze your caterpillar.Your caterpillar will not eat while it’s hibernating, but it may be lightly active on warmer days. When it’s mildly active, it might eat available food.

, When your caterpillar wakes up in the spring, it’ll be ready to fatten up in preparation for its metamorphosis into a moth, which will take place later in the spring. Make sure that you provide your caterpillar enough food for it to get ready to turn into a pupa, which is its cocoon-phase., Your caterpillar’s fuzzy skin will slide off once it has fattened up, leaving a smooth black oval called a pupa. This is it’s cocoon phase. You can expect it to shed its exoskeleton during spring., Since you can’t pinpoint the actual date of your moth’s emergence, keep track of its progress each day. While your pupa does not need food, you may want to mist the caterpillar’s home daily to keep it humid. Simply spray a light spritz of water into the container.While their actual time in the pupa can vary, giant leopard moth caterpillars only take a few weeks to metamorphose into a moth.

, You can choose to keep your moth or set it free."

Look for yellow and black.,
Identify wasps with other coloration.,
Estimate the wasp’s size.,
Observe the body shape.",How to Identify Wasps1," Identify yellowjackets and European paper wasps by the yellow and black bands on the wasps’ abdomens. Cicada killers are a type of digger wasp that resembles a larger, wider yellowjacket. Identify the European hornet by its yellow and black striped tail and red-brown thorax. You’ll also see black and yellow mud daubers.


Note that mud daubers can also be black or metallic blue-black, as can spider wasps (including tarantula hawks).;
, Paper wasps native to North America are golden brown with patches of red and yellow. Distinguish these from the baldfaced hornet, which is white and black striped with a white face. Also look for digger wasps, which have orange-brown, yellow and black bodies and metallic blue wings.


Velvet ants, despite their name, are black, hairy, wingless wasps with bright red, yellow, orange, or white-colored areas.

, Look for 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) long yellowjackets. Contrast these with larger wasps, including the 0.75 to 1.2 inch (1.9 to 3 cm) long baldfaced hornets, 0.75 to 1.4 inch (1.9 to 3.5 cm) long European hornet, and the significantly larger 1 to 2.5 inch long (2.54 to 6.35 cm) tarantula hawks and 1.5 inch (3.81 cm) long cicada killer. Paper wasps and mud daubers tend to be 0.5 to 0.75 inches (1.27 to 1.9 cm) long., With some rare exceptions -- like the European hornet -- wasps can be identified by their smooth, hairless bodies and narrow waists. Learn to recognize the yellowjacket by its short, narrow waist and cone-like abdomen that tapers to a sharp point. Look for the characteristically long legs and spindle-shaped waist of the paper wasp. Also note the mud dauber has a very narrow waist and long, thin body."
"
Look for paper nests.,
Identify the mud daubers’ mud nests.,
Look for digger wasps burrows in the ground.",How to Identify Wasps2," Unlike bees, which build nests from wax, yellowjackets, hornets, and paper wasps build nests from paper and saliva. Search for yellowjacket nests in crawl spaces and wall void, and for hornets nests in trees, shrubs, and under the eaves of buildings. Also look for paper wasps nest under building overhangs. Note that paper wasps’ nests will be open on top., Check for the mud daubers’ long, cylindrical tube-like nests on the sides of buildings, in attics, porches, carports, lawn furniture, and the underside of unused equipment. You might also see more lumpy looking mud dauber nests. Look for mud daubers around drinking fountains, puddles, the edges of ponds, and well-watered lawns, where they collect the mud for their nests., Watch for burrows about the diameter of a pencil in well-drained, sandy soil. You’ll see that there is typically very little vegetation around digger wasp burrows. Note that burrows are usually dug in areas that receive direct sunlight."
"
Distinguish wasps’ and bees’ physical characteristics.,
Check the coloring.,
Look at what they eat.",How to Identify Wasps3," Look at the insect’s waist. Wasps have waists, while bees’ waists are as wide as their bodies. Next check for hair. As noted above, most wasps are hairless, while bees tend to be more hairy to help them carry pollen. Finally, look at the insect’s length -- wasps tend to be longer than most bees., Generally, you’ll see the same basic colors on wasps and bees. Note, however, that wasps have more distinct colors and patterns than bees. Look for especially vivid coloring on wasps, in contrast to the more muted colors on bees., Wasps tend to eat other insects. Yellowjackets are scavengers and you can observe them eating or hunting for human food and garbage. Bees, on the other hand, survive on pollen and nectar."

Do not “teach” her how to scratch.",How to Stop a Cat from Scratching a Leather Sofa," There are different types of materials that cats like to scratch on, including corrugated cardboard, carpeted surfaces, and sisal (a type of rug). Scratching posts can be oriented vertically or horizontally, but cats tend to prefer vertical posts.Scratching posts can also come in different shapes and sizes.Sisal is a very popular scratching material with cats.Sisal can be found at your local rug store; you could also contact your veterinarian or local pet store to see where it can be purchased.
Scratching posts are a good way for cats to stretch their muscles. Although cats tend to prefer vertical posts, horizontal posts will also allow your cat to get a good stretch when she’s scratching.;
, With the wide variety of available scratching posts, purchase several and let your cat choose which ones she prefers.Keep in mind that you and your cat may have very different ideas of the ideal scratching post. Give her the space to make her own decision on what she prefers.If you purchase a vertical scratching post, make sure that it is tall enough (about 2 feet) for your cat to stretch out her entire body when she scratches.Make sure that the scratching post is stable and sturdy. If the vertical post is unsteady and topples over when your cat scratches it, then she will not use that post. If your cat prefers a horizontal scratching post, try to secure it under another piece of furniture so that it stays in place when your cat uses it., Once your cat has been scratching on the post for a while, it will look tattered and extremely worn. Although you’ll want to throw it away at this point, your cat will think that it’s perfectly worn in and just the way she wants it., Cats scratch for a variety of reasons, including marking their territory, stretching their muscles, sharpening their claws, and simply having fun.Scratching is something that cats need to do, so do not try to stop your cat from scratching your leather sofa by stopping her scratching behavior completely.

, Given that you can’t stop your cat from scratching, you will need to teach her that she shouldn’t use your sofa as a scratching post. There are a number of techniques that can discourage her from scratching your sofa.


Place an orange peel near the sofa. Cats do not like the smell of citrus.Soak some cotton balls in smells that are unpleasant to cats (eg, cologne, perfume, or a menthol-scented muscle rub) and place them near the sofa.Attach materials to your sofa that make it difficult for your cat to scratch, such as aluminum foil, double-sided tape, and sandpaper.Spray her with water (just a few spritzes) when you see her scratching your sofa. This may temporarily discourage her from scratching your sofa, but it’s likely that your cat will just learn to scratch when you are not around. This technique will not be effective in the long term.Remove her scent from the sofa. Cats will scratch where they have left their scent, so removing her scent from the sofa will discourage her from scratching on it. Visit your local pet store to purchase an odor-removal spray., It could take anywhere from several weeks to several months for your cat to stop trying to scratch your sofa. As your cat begins to avoid your sofa more and more, remove one undesirable item at a time. By the time you finish removing them, your cat will have learned to stop scratching your sofa., Although you are probably very frustrated with your cat scratching your sofa, physically punishing her will not solve the problem. In fact, it could make things worse because she will probably begin to perceive you in a negative light. A spritz or two of water is the most that you should do to punish her, but remember that this is not a long-term solution.Consider using a motion-activated can of compressed air such as Ssscat. Set this up to go off when the cat approaches the sofa. Instead of associating the unpleasant punishment with you (in which case the cat will just wait until you are not around to start scratching), it will seem like an ""Act of God,"" which is a far more effective deterrent.

, It is important to put the scratching post where your cat will be most likely to use it. Preferably, place the post where she typically scratches; given that she’s scratching your leather sofa, try placing the post by the sofa.It is also helpful to place the post in places where she normally frequents, such as her sleeping area or a particular window. If you put the scratching post in a corner or a place where she doesn’t normally go, it’s unlikely that she’ll use it.Cats often like to scratch when they first wake up, so having the post near her sleeping area will encourage her to scratch on the post., This means that, when your cat is scratching your sofa, you will physically pick her up and move her to one of her scratching posts.It may take time for her to understand why you are moving her, and she may not necessarily start scratching on the post when you move her. However, if she does start scratching on her post, reward her with a treat.By using positive reinforcement, she will be encouraged to use the scratching post instead of the sofa.

, Sprinkling catnip leaves or powder onto the scratching post will encourage your cat to scratch on it. You can also try attaching one of her favorite toys to the post. When she plays with her toy, she will probably end up scratching the post, which will be a pleasurable experience for her., A good way to encourage your cat to use her scratching post is for you to spend time with her near the post. The more positive associations she has with the post, the more likely she will scratch on it., It may be tempting for you to physically move her paws to get her to scratch on the scratching post. Your cat will not appreciate you doing this, since she already knows how to scratch. Although you are trying to get her to stop scratching your sofa, you will still need to give her the space to scratch on her own.However, there is an argument for placing her front paws against the scratching post since this helps to transfer some of her scent, from scent glands on the back of the paws, onto the post, which makes it more appealing for her to return to.

Consider whether the behavior is normal.,
Assess stressful situations.,
Take your cat to the vet.,
Move away from your cat when it attempts to chew your hair.,
Provide distraction.,
Help your cat cope.,
Switch hair products.",How to Stop a Cat from Chewing on Your Hair," If your cat has routinely licked or chewed your hair a small or moderate amount, this may be “normal” behavior for your cat. It could be a sign of affection or how your cat marks you as its own. Although this behavior may be annoying, and you might want to take steps to stop it, it’s nothing to be alarmed about.


Grooming is an important part of a felines’ social and emotional life from the moment it is born. Just as cats will lick one another to show affection, your cat may give your hair a few licks here and there to show you that it loves you.Your cat may also be putting its scent on you, in effect marking you as part of its territory or part of its group.;
, Cats will often begin licking behavior during times of stress, in response to a move, for example, or when a new pet has been introduced into the household. Consider whether any big changes have recently occurred in your cat’s life that may have brought on (or intensified) its hair licking.It’s important not to raise your voice or use physical punishments in an attempt to stop the hair licking or chewing. These things will only increase the level of stress your cat feels.Remember that what a cat finds stressful may not be the same things you find stressful. Try to put yourself in your cat’s shoes to determine the cause of the stress. Common stressors for cats include having visitors over, hearing family members argue, having a loud dog nearby, or seeing other cats through a window but being unable to get to them., If the behavior is constant or you’re unable to distract your cat from its hair licking or chewing by engaging it in another activity, the behavior may be compulsive and require a trip to the veterinarian.In a few hardcore cases, mood altering drugs like Prozac or clomipramine can help break the compulsive behavior.


Additionally, if this behavior starts when a cat is older it could be a sign of hypothyroidism.This occurs in 30% of cats who are age 10 and older and needs to be diagnosed and treated by a vet.Treatment should lessen this behavior. If not, continue discouraging the behavior after your cat’s hyperthyroidism is treated.

, If you stay in the same place and, even worse, pet or talk to your cat while it licks or chews on your hair, you send the signal that its behavior is desirable. Instead, get up and leave the area.If you’re in bed, you can put your head under the sheets to get away from your cat.You can also try putting a pillow between yourself and your cat (though she may just climb on top of it).Be consistent when discouraging the behavior. In order for this strategy to work, you need to resist the chewing every time your cat begins going after your hair, and you must act quickly. Inconsistent responses (allowing your cat to lick your hair some times but not others) will only confuse your cat.It will takes weeks, or perhaps even months, for your cat to get the picture, but eventually it will come to understand that the licking or chewing is not acceptable and that when it chews or licks it is not being rewarded by your company., One of the best ways to get your cat to leave your hair alone is to give it something else to chew on: toys, treats, cat grass, or even a piece of rawhide. Physical exercise and mental stimulation, which it can get through more playtime with you, are also great distractions that don’t cost a dime.Five to ten minutes of exercise a day might be enough to eliminate unwanted behaviors in your cat by reducing anxiety. You might consider using a laser light or a feather wand to get your cat moving.While treats can be a good distraction, be careful that you don’t overfeed your cat. This could result in weight gain and health problems.
Always make sure that the toys you provide your cat are safe and won’t cause it to choke.

, If stress does seem to be the culprit, try to find ways to help kitty cope with the situations that are causing it anxiety.For example, providing a safe space complete with familiar items may ease the stress of being in a new home, while spending extra time together may help to relieve the anxiety related to the arrival of a new furry friend or a new baby.


It may be possible to eliminate certain stressors. For example, if your cat is licking or chewing your hair because it is stressed out by a cat it sees out the back window, pull the blind on that window so that your cat no longer sees the other animal.
You can also invest in feline pheromone products which come in wipes, sprays, collars and diffusers. These chemicals mimic the pheromones given off by contented cats helping your troubled kitty cope with things beyond hers or yours control.

, If the hair licking or chewing behavior always happens when you use a certain scented shampoo or apply a specific hairspray, stop using that product and try something new. Choose an unscented product if at all possible, or find one with a scent that’s not cat-friendly.


Cats tend not to like citrus-scented products, so you may want to try a citrus-smelling hair product to repel your cat."

Never physically punish your cat.",How to Stop a Cat from Licking Stuffed Animals and Blankets1," Positive reinforcement via encouragement and a healthy amount of treats can help teach your cat to do certain things. While this approach only indirectly addresses specific negative behaviors, positively reinforcing good behavior will encourage your cat to spend their time doing things it knows will lead to affection and rewards.Stated simply: when your cat is doing something you want it to repeat, reward them.

, It will working against your training regimen to give your cat treats haphazardly. Save treats only for when you want the cat to repeat the behavior it literally just performed.


For instance, you may like it when your cat meows and rubs up against you. However, you may not want to reward this behavior, as the cat will learn that the behavior leads to treats and before you know it, it’ll be rubbing up on you and meowing nonstop.

, You must provide a reward within seconds of the behavior you’re trying to reinforce in order for your cat to associate the behavior with your positive reinforcement. For instance, if she jumps onto the couch and sits on your lap without licking anything, give her a treat as soon as she sits down.Use verbal reinforcement while giving treats. Scratch your cats head and tell them they’re wonderful when you’re forking over the goods.

, Use the same kind of reward to reinforce a behavior you want repeated, and provide it the same way. Either placing a treat on the ground or letting your cat take it from your hand will work, just go the same route every time. If you live with others, make sure they’re on board with your training regimen and will either comply or refrain from giving treats at all., While using food treats, know that they will be especially effective when your cat is hungry. You can likely even teach your cat to do certain things – such as come to you – using treats right before meal time.Once it seems your cat associates a certain behavior with a treat, stop providing them as consistently.
Wean them off by reducing the frequency of food treats. For instance, simply skip a food treat, then go back to food treats the next few times you observe the positive behavior you’re hoping to reinforce.
After a while, only provide food treats on the rare occasion your cat is being especially well-behaved.

, Continue using positive reinforcement by saying things like “now that’s a good cat” and “you’re the finest feline in the whole entire world.” Aside from verbal praise, a good scratch on the chin or belly, or a loving cuddle sends the message you’re happy with your cat. Alternatively, throw their favorite toy across the room to excite your cat., Not only is it hurtful to your cat, being abusive is simply less effective than positive reinforcement. Especially if you respond negatively after the fact, yelling, hitting, or shaking won’t teach your cat anything. In fact, abusive treatment will likely lead to more bad behavior – including incessant licking – from your cat because they will be more fearful and insecure."

Play with your cat more often.,
Cuddle your cat more often too.,
Add some cat-friendly verticality to your home.,
Consider getting your cat veterinary help.",How to Stop a Cat from Licking Stuffed Animals and Blankets2," Compulsive behavior such as incessant licking may be the effect of boredom or stress. Fortunately, both of these can be diminished via the best possible form of treatment: play. Make sure to play with your cat at least 15 minutes a day.Keep your cat’s daytime environment stimulating by leaving toys – especially ball and string toys designed for cats – in the areas they like to spend time.
Consider getting a fish tank. Cats will happily sit in front of a fish tank and wash fish swim around – an activity that can be both soothing and entertaining.

, Lots of licking of blankets and stuffed animals may simply be an indication that your cat is not feeling entirely secure. Since blankets and stuffed animals are often security items for cats, and many cats enjoy cuddling with these sorts of items while relaxing, incessant licking may indicate an over-attachment to certain items that stems from a lack of attachment to you.Gently pick up your cat and set them on your lap when you’ll be stationary for a while.
They may not like this at first, but repeatedly do so – with gentleness in mind – and pet them softly, if only for a moment. They’ll come to recognize your affection and slowly become more comfortable cuddling with you.

, Cats especially like high places that they can post up in and feel safe. If your cat is dealing with stress, this may be just the trick to calm them down.When you build or install a new cat hang out, furnish it with bedding or toys you know they enjoy to indicate that the space is meant for them.

, If your cat is particularly stressed, and is beginning to lick more and more, a vet may be able to help diagnose the cause.It may even be a medical issue that you’ll need help treating.


Furthermore, your vet can talk to you about medication options, including temporary anti-anxiety drugs.

Spray the items with a deterring aroma.,
Use scents cat’s won’t like, but that aren’t harmful.,
Hide the items you don’t want your cat to lick.",How to Stop a Cat from Licking Stuffed Animals and Blankets3," Indirect deterrence includes types of punishment that don’t come directly from you, and work well in deterring compulsive behavior such as incessant licking. A great deterrent is smell. Fill a spray bottle with water and a bit of something your cat doesn’t enjoy to smell.There are lots of options to try. Dilute liquids or soak solids in water before lightly spraying anything you don’t want licked.

, Citrus scents may be particularly effective. Soak orange or lemon peels in water. Use peels instead of the fruit’s flesh so you’ll get the fruit’s oils without the sugar. Vinegar or the oil of lavender, lemongrass, citronella, or eucalyptus will also likely work especially well. You only need to add a small amount to a spray bottle of water for the mixture to be effective.Coffee grounds and pipe tobacco also deter cats. Soak a small amount right in the spray bottle overnight.
Make sure whatever you choose won’t discolor or otherwise damage the items you spray. Test an inconspicuous area by spraying it and checking it the next day before you spray an entire item.
Be sure to choose an aroma that won’t bother you!

, If indirect punishment isn’t working, keep in mind that there are likely better ways to address your cat’s behavior than direct punishment. Most cat’s behavior problems can be remedied by making your cat feel more safe and secure and providing them with more stimulation.While training your cat not to lick too much, simply place any blankets and stuffed animals in a drawer or closet to keep them from being licked.

Look for signs of compulsive chewing.,
See if the chewing is tied to playful behavior.,
Look for any associated medical conditions.,
See your veterinarian.",How to Stop a Cat from Chewing1," A compulsion is an irresistible need to perform a certain behavior. In cat’s, the most common compulsive behaviors are wool or fabric sucking/chewing or excessive hair licking/chewing—also called psychogenic alopecia. This most often occurs when a cat is stressed or frustrated by something out of its control.In kittens that are weaned too early, this can become a problem when they become adults. Generally a kitten should not be weaned from its mother before eight weeks of age.Oriental breeds of cats are more likely to develop a compulsive chewing problem. Cats that are experiencing stress—such as moving to a new home or a new baby in the house—are also more at risk to develop a compulsive chewing problem.;
, Not all chewing is the result of a compulsive behavior. Young kittens and some adult cats may just be curious and adventurous enough to start chewing on things they shouldn’t. While it may be cute at first, this can be extremely dangerous if a kitten bites into an electrical cord or pulls a heavy object down on itself.Boredom can also cause a cat to chew., Some chewing starts as the result of a medical condition, such as fleas, allergies, food intolerance, or an unhealed wound.Dental disease or mouth sores may also cause a cat to chew on objects.Even a behavior like chewing on a plant can have an associated medical explanation. Indoor cats especially with few grasses in their diet may simply chew on plants because they’re craving greens., Before any diagnosing the reason behind any chewing behavior, your veterinarian should perform a thorough medical examination, especially on an adult cat that has recently started this behavior. Once your veterinarian has a diagnosis for the chewing behavior, then he or she will help you form a proper treatment plan."

Choose a roach species.,
Purchase more female than male roaches.,
Purchase at least 100 roaches.,
Obtain two plastic bins with lids.,
Make a hole in the top of the bins and cover it with metal screen.,
Add harborage to the bins.,
Heat the bins.,
Introduce your roaches.,
Mist the bin with water.,
Place a water crystal dish in the bin.,
Add dry food.,
Add fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Transfer your roaches to the second bin.,
Wash the first bin with soap and water.,
Don’t clean the bin too often.,
Let your roaches breed.,
Feed your pets.,
Share or sell excess roaches.",How to Breed Feeder Roaches," Dubia roaches, also called Guyana Orange-Spotted Roaches, are the easiest roaches feeder roaches to breed. They are hearty, fast-growing, and unable to climb up smooth surfaces. They are medium sized, so they can be fed to most animals.Other roach species, such as Blatta lateralis and Blaberus, are also good breeder roaches, but dubia roaches are easier to breed.
Dubia roaches (and other kinds of roaches) can be purchased at most stores that sell reptiles. If you don’t have a local place to buy roaches, they can be purchased online and shipped to you. 100 roaches will run you ~$20-$30.;
, The female-to-male ratio should be between 3:1 and 7:1 for ideal breeding conditions. You can tell female from male dubia roaches by their wings. Females have short, stubby wings, while males have long wings that cover their entire bodies., 100 roaches will provide a good base to get started with a sustainable colony. Less than 100 roaches will take longer to start producing a colony of feeder roaches.If you’re planning to start a very large colony, you can start with more than 100 roaches.
How large you want your colony to be will depend on what kind and how many animals you plan to feed.

, Choose bins that are at least 18” x 18” x 18” in size. Large plastic storage tubs are ideal containers since they provide darkness for the roaches and have smooth sides that the roaches cannot climb.The second bin is for storing your roaches when you clean the first bin.
Avoid using aquariums since they are harder to heat and don’t provide a dark environment.

, You can cut one large hole or several smaller holes. This will provide ventilation for your roach colony. Cover the holes with metal screen. Attach the screen with hot glue or duct tape.


Dubia roaches can chew through fiberglass screen, so metal is imperative. The screens will prevent your roaches from escaping through the ventilation holes., Harborage is just places for your roaches to hide and breed. Egg crates make the ideal harborage as they contain many ridges and degrade very slowly. You can also use toilet paper rolls, newspaper, or other cardboard or paper products. Place the harborage into the plastic bins.Avoid using glossy magazine paper for harborage. This type of paper contains chemicals that can harm your roaches.

, Dubia roaches—and most other breeds of roach—require temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit for idea breeding conditions. There are several ways to heat the bins. The easiest is to purchase a reptile heating pad and place it underneath the bin. If there is a spot in your house that stays consistently around 90 degree Fahrenheit, you can leave the bins in this area.Space heaters can also be used to provide heat, but they are less precise than reptile heating pads and will require you to keep a thermostat in the bins to monitor the temperature.
Don’t place the heating element directly into the bin. Instead, keep it either underneath the bin or outside the bin on the side.

, Release your roaches into their new environment and seal the bin. They will quickly find spaces to hide and they will begin the breeding process immediately., Dubia roaches need humidity to survive. As long as the humidity stays above 40%, your roaches will do well. You can achieve this by misting the inside of the bin with water once a week.In very dry environments you may need to mist more often.
If the humidity in your climate routinely drops below 40%, place a hygrometer in the bin to monitor the humidity levels.Remove any food from the bin before misting. This will avoid getting the food wet and potentially leading to mold.

, Water crystal dishes use a synthetic material that absorbs water. They have the consistency of Jell-O and will allow your roaches to drink water without drowning.Water crystal dishes can be purchased at reptile stores or online.
Your roaches will be able to get most of their water from the water you use to humidify the bins, but a water crystal dish ensures they will not get dehydrated if you miss a misting.

, Roaches aren’t picky about what they’ll eat. Dry food is ideal for their main nutritional source since it will not rot or grow mold that can smell and harm your roaches. Dry cat food, cereal, and bird food pellets are good options for dry roach food. Place the dry food in a dish and put it in the bin.Add more dry food when you notice the supply getting low. A cup of dry food should last your roaches several weeks to several months.

, These will provide additional vital nutrition for your roaches. You can use lettuce, carrots, bananas, and apples. Place the fruits and vegetables on a small dish and place them in the bin. Leave the dish in the bin for two days and then remove it. This will prevent the food from rotting or developing mold.Never leave fresh food in the bin for too long as mold can develop and kill your colony.

, Using gloves, remove the lid from the first bin and lift the harborage. Tap the harborage into the second bin, removing any roaches. Remove the food and water dishes from the first bin and hold the first bin over the second bin to transfer the roaches.If roaches remain in the first bin, lift them by hand using your gloves.

, Remove any solid roach feces (“frass”) and clean out the bin. It doesn’t have to be spotless. The goal is to remove excess frass and any dead roaches that have fallen to the bottom of the bin.Dry the bin thoroughly when you’re done.

, Baby roaches feed off of frass, so it’s important to let small amounts of frass accumulate in the bin. Only clean the bin when dead roaches have begun to accumulate of if the bin if producing a bad smell.Roaches ordinarily don’t smell, so if you notice a smell from the bin it’s time for a cleaning.

, Healthy female roaches will produce between twenty-five and thirty nymphs (baby roaches) every six-to-eight weeks. Any new females that are born will mate and begin to bear their own nymphs within seventy days.After two reproductive cycles (six-to-eight weeks for the roaches you purchase and seventy more days for the first offspring to bear young), your colony will be well-established.

, After your colony is established, you can begin to use the roaches as food for your pets. As long as you don’t deplete the colony below 100 roaches, it should be able to replenish itself with every seventy-day breeding cycle.If you do reduce the colony below 100 individuals and you notice a drop-off in numbers, simply purchase more roaches to fill in the gaps. For example, if you delete the colony to 75 individuals, purchase 25 new roaches.

, If you colony begins to develop beyond your needs—or your space—give excess roaches to other pet-owners, or sell them. You can sell your roaches in online marketplaces like eBay if you are unable to find local buyers."

Walk away.,
Interrupt the observation.,
Make safety your top priority.",How to Respond to Redirected Aggression in Cats1," Redirected aggression is an involuntary reflex. Your cat doesn’t mean to make you the target of its aggressive outburst; the cat simply reacts to how its body feels. If your cat is showing signs of aggression toward you for seemingly no reason, consider just walking away and giving your cat a chance to calm down.Leaving your cat alone to get over the feelings of aggression is the best bet to ensure that there is no unintended altercation between you and your pet.
You should also try to segregate the cat from any other pets or humans in the house.;
, If your cat is staring out the window with incredible intensity, you may want to try to break the spell. Try clapping your hands loudly or making another loud sound to startle the cat.This should hopefully cause your cat to stop paying attention to whatever it is that is agitating it and give the cat an opportunity to calm down.

, Remember that when you’re dealing with an aggressive cat, it’s possible that you may get injured. The cat may bite you or claw you in its redirected aggressive outburst.If you have to engage with an aggressive cat, take the proper safety precautions. Wear thick gloves if possible or several layers of clothing.
Try to avoid separating your cat from another animal if it is behaving aggressively. But if you must interfere, be extremely careful and be cautious of bites and scratches. Try using a squirt bottle or pillow to break up a fight between cats.
Remember that it is possible for the cat to injure itself also. Try to control the cat’s behavior without provoking it to react in a way that is more harmful to itself.

Add another litter box.,
Create more perching space for your cats.,
Make additional feeding locations.,
Put a bell on the aggressor.",How to Prevent Litter Box Aggression1," The main cause for litter box aggression in cats is too few litter boxes in the home. Simply adding another litter box can often dispel much of the tension that is causing your cat to act aggressively.The general rule of thumb is that you should have one litter box per cat, plus one. For example, if you have two cats, you should try to have three litter boxes in your home.
You should also make sure that the litter boxes are cleaned regularly. Try cleaning the litter boxes more frequently than you normally do to see if this helps the behavior.;
, Cats need room to roam and be active in your home. Sometimes litter box aggression can be caused by cats not having enough space to move in your house. Adding some extra climbing or perching structures can give your cats more mobility and more space to be active and happy.Try adding perches to window sills so your cats can look out the window. Or you might put a kitty climbing tower in the corner.

, Even if your cats don’t show aggression during mealtimes, this can still be a source of anxiety. Try adding another food dish so your cat doesn’t feel as possessive of the existing food sources.Consider letting your cats self-feed out of a larger food dispenser to alleviate some of the tension. Only do this if your cats are not overweight.

, Try putting a bell on the aggressive cat’s collar so that the other cats can always tell where it is in the house. While this will not help address the aggressive cat’s behavior, it will help the other cats protect themselves while you are trying to address the behavior problem."
"
Keep items the cat wants to chew out of its reach.,
Use bad-tasting deterrents to stop the chewing.,
Use a spray bottle or small squirt gun with water in it to deter the cat.,
Booby trap the object.,
Replace plants in the area with cat-friendly options.,
Ask your veterinarian about medications.",How to Stop a Cat from Chewing2," This could mean putting clothing or fabrics into a closed closet, placing items on an unreachable shelf, or keeping the cat out of the room where you keep the chewed object. If the cat has a problem with chewing electrical cords, then try placing a cord protector a rug, or even tape over the cords., Some common solutions are bitter apple spray (a commercial preparation) or cayenne water (water with cayenne pepper in a spray bottle).Always spot test the object you want to spray to make certain the spray doesn’t damage it.

, If you catch your cat chewing an object, immediately spritz the cat. Your cat will only associate the act with the negative consequence if you spritz the cat as it chews the object. If you can’t reach the spray bottle before the cat stops chewing, keep it next to you and wait until the next time the cat exhibits the behavior.


A strong “no” at the same time will also help the cat learn that word.

, Since you can’t always be around with a spray bottle to deter the cat, you can set up a “trap” to deliver the negative consequence for you. For instance, you can place double-sided tape around the object. Cats detest the feel of sticky tape and will concentrate on that instead of the object.


You can also look into products that deliver a repellant spray via a motion sensor.
Another option is to place the object on a “scat mat,” which is a product that delivers an electrical tingle into the cat’s paws when it steps on it.

, If a cat is chewing on a houseplant, it may enjoy the texture of the plant and want greens to chew on and eat.Remove the chewed plant from the area and replace it with a more-appropriate option, such as oat grass, catnip, or catmint.Make sure you especially move plants that would be toxic for the cat to chew. Some common examples include caladium, dumb cane, English ivy, lilies, mistletoe, oleanders, and philodendrons., If none of the behavior-modification techniques help, then consult your veterinarian. Certain medical conditions, such as the cat chewing its own fur, may need to be treated with mood-altering drugs."
"
Play with your cat more.,
Give your cat appropriate objects to chew.,
Change your cat’s feeding schedule.,
Mount bird feeders outside the window.,
Consider taking your cat outside in a secure way.,
Divert your cat’s attention with other solo activities.",How to Stop a Cat from Chewing3," Since boredom can be one of the causes of chewing, try spending a little more time playing with your cat. With some additional stimulation, the cat might forget about the chewing altogether.Try distracting your cat with dangling toys, a laser pointer, or other favorite toys., Thin pieces of rawhide, toy mice, or food puzzle toys will help occupy your cat’s time. An old bath towel or large stuffed toy can be a fun chew toy for certain cats. An uncooked chicken wing tip (the rubbery portion) may be appropriate for some cats as well.If you give the cat a chicken wing, ensure that it’s uncooked since the cooked bones can splinter and cause complications if ingested.Always supervise your cat when allowing it to eat chicken wings or rawhide., Feed small, frequent meals in various places. Use food puzzles that provide enrichment and stimulation for a cat that chews out of boredom or stress.

, Most cat owners know that cats can spend hours staring outside the window if the surroundings are exciting enough. Place a bird feeder (or even a squirrel feeder) outside an available window. The cat will be too enthralled with what’s going on outside to chew.Providing perches, cat towers, or similar items in strategic places will help your cat get a better view out the windows, and the cat furniture itself is another form of enrichment, especially if you buy one with dangling catnip toys., Don’t simply open the door and let an indoor cat roam free, but supervised time on an enclosed patio or in a fenced backyard is also enriching for your cat. Even just a few minutes outside chewing on some regular grass can prevent your cat from chewing once back indoors.If you don’t have access to an enclosed outdoor space, you can also use a harness and a leash for your cat when playing outdoors., You can’t always be around to play with your cat or supervise it outdoors. The more solo activities you leave for the cat to occupy itself with, the more confident you can be that your cat isn’t chewing when you aren’t around. Consider providing:A scratching post or cardboard scratch pads. You can also sprinkle the post or pads with catnip to make them even more irresistible to your cat.
Dry treats hidden around your home. By hiding treats in a few different rooms that are accessible to the cat, you can ensure that your pet stalks around these rooms searching for the treats rather than spending time getting bored and chewing on something it shouldn’t.

"
"
Limit the cat’s view outdoors.,
Separate cats that fight often.,
Avoid bringing in scents of other animals.",How to Respond to Redirected Aggression in Cats2," If your cat is an indoor-only cat, consider limiting how much access your cat has to viewing the outside world. Your cat is responding with aggression to things that it sees outside, but taking it out on you. You can minimize this problem by removing the temptation of the things the cat feels aggressive toward outside.Try covering the windows with blinds or curtains, preferably ones your cat can’t simply push out of the way.
Remember to leave the door closed so that your cat can’t constantly look out of the screen. Additionally, you can try closing the doors to rooms that provide views of the outdoors.

, If you have more than one cat in your home and one (or more) of them seems to initiate fights and engage in aggressive behavior often, you may want to consider separating them.After the cats have been separated for a while (at least a few days), start introducing them to one another again slowly.
Start with a smell introduction, where you bring in something that smells like the other cat. Then move toward a short face-to-face encounter.
Keep lengthening the amount of time you keep the cats together until you think they’re ready to be around each other full time again.

, Sometimes cats redirect aggressive behavior towards their owners if they catch a whiff of an unfamiliar animal on their human. If your cat is acting aggressively, try to limit your contact with other animals outside the home.If you must engage with other animals, try to wash your hands or change clothing before you see your cat at home.

"
Know that it isn’t directed at you.,
Watch for signs of aggression.,
Monitor potential triggers.",How to Respond to Redirected Aggression in Cats3," Recognize the fact that the aggressive behavior isn’t really directed at you. This kind of outburst is an instinctual, involuntary reaction that your cat is having to other external factors. Sometimes, if the cat can’t get to the thing causing the aggressive feelings, it will lash out at the next thing it encounters.This doesn’t indicate that your cat is mean, doesn’t like you, or that you have a bad relationship with your cat.

, If you know what to look for, the signs of aggression can be pretty obvious in cats. They typically either make themselves larger in an overtly aggressive manner, or they try to make themselves appear smaller in a defensively aggressive situation. Some standard signs of aggressive behavior in cats include:Growling, howling, hissing, or spitting.
Stiff tail lowered to the ground.
Crouching.
Flattened ears.
Turning sideways instead of facing the opponent straight on.

, There are quite a few situations that commonly cause cats to redirect their anger. In these situations, the cat is unable to reach or interact with the object of its aggression, so it transfers these feelings and instincts to something in its environment. Some examples of situations that can cause redirected anger in cats include:Seeing another cat outside through the window.
Smelling a strange cat’s odor on a family member.
Watching birds or other prey animals.
Being in an animal shelter or veterinarian’s office.
Hearing high-pitched noises.

Look for behavioral patterns.,
Understand your cat's body language.,
Note when the aggressive behavior happens.,
Recognize maternal cat aggression.,
Talk to your veterinarian or animal behaviorist.",How to Properly Deal With an Aggressive Cat1," To us, cats can appear baffling or unpredictable, whereas in reality we are just poor are reading their body language and understanding what they are trying to tell us. But what we do know is that there are a number of distinct patterns involved with cat aggression. These can be broken into a series of situation-oriented categories that are not mutually exclusive.Play aggression happens when cats take play too far.
Fear/Defense aggression comes from the cat feeling endangered, vulnerable, or trapped.
Territorial aggression is usually just among cats, but can be expressed toward humans and other animals.
Petting aggression is not well understood, and may come from over-stimulation.
Inter-Male aggression relies on the natural competitive nature between toms.
Maternal aggression is the queen cat's instinctual protective response.
Redirected aggression can come from frustration the cat cannot vent, which gets redirected toward another target, such as a nearby cat or person.
Predatory aggression derives from cats whose predatory instincts are triggered.
Pain aggression results from old or current sensations of pain.
Idiopathic aggression is spontaneous, and may be a threat to the physical safety of those who come into contact with the cat.;
, Knowing when your cat is about to go on the offensive or defensive by watching its body language can be key in managing the problem. Watch out for signs of oncoming aggression, as in:


Defensive postures

Crouching
Head tucked in
Tail curved around the body and tucked in
Eyes wide open with pupils partially or fully dilated
Ears flattened sideways or backward on the head
Piloerection (hackles up/hair stands on end)
Turning sideways to the opponent, not straight on
Open-mouthed hissing or spitting
Quick strikes with front paws, claws out


Offensive postures

A stiff, straight-legged upright stance
Stiffened rear legs, with the rear end raised and the back sloped downward toward the head
Stiff tail, lowered or held straight down to the ground
Direct stare
Upright ears, with the backs rotated slightly forward
Piloerection (hackles up), including fur on the tail
Constricted pupils
Directly facing opponent, possibly moving toward him
Might be growling, howling or yowling


Overt aggression

Swatting, striking with paws
Biting
Fighting
Growling, shrieking
Scratching
Preparing for an all-out attack by rolling onto side or back and exposing teeth and claws., Does the cat become aggressive in the presence of a certain animal or person? In many cases, aggression happens due to a specific trigger. Pay attention to the cat's environment during instances of aggression, so that you can work out what might be causing it, and improve the cat's behavior.

, Your cat may become aggressive after giving birth. Mothers have instincts to protect their offspring from potential danger. Maternal aggression can occur when a mother cat (called a “queen”) with her kittens is approached by people or other animals whom she perceives as a threat. It’s more often directed at other cats, but it can be directed toward people, as well. Queens can be quite aggressive when defending their young, especially in the first few days after birth.Avoid handling kittens during the first few days of their lives. Introduce yourself slowly.


Provide a low stress environment, keep visitors to a minimum, and avoid approaching or handling either the mother or her kittens if you are met with maternal aggression.

, This is very important any time you're dealing with animal aggression, in order to evaluate your options. As there are many different kinds of aggression, some more or less acceptable than others, you will want to make sure your behavior does not worsen the problem.

"
"
Spend more time playing with the aggressive cat.,
Give the cat choices.,
Separate the cats.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Prevent Litter Box Aggression2," Sometimes cats who exhibit litter box aggression just need more outlets to expel their energy. Try spending a bit more focused play time with the aggressive cat each day and see if that helps the unwanted behavior.Try throwing a toy mouse around for your cat to chase. Or use a string toy to get your cat to run around following it. Use a feather toy to entice your cat to jump up and grab it. Any active game is good for expending excess energy.

, Your cat may be aggressive about the litter box because it prefers one location over another, or it likes a certain kind of litter better. In any case, it’s important to give your cats choices. Try using several different kinds of litter (one in each litter box) so that your cat may choose which one it likes best.Try using one fine grain litter, one clumping litter, one larger grain litter. See which one your cats prefer.

, If the aggressive behavior gets too extreme, try separating the cats for a few days. Make sure each cat has everything they need in their own space – food, fresh water, a clean litter box, and several toys.Make sure you still take some time each day to hang out and play with each cat. Don’t just isolate them.

, To help your cat overcome its aggressive behavior, use positive reinforcement. This means that you should provide your cat with treats and praise when you notice that it doesn’t bother the other cats while they are using the litter box.Don’t give your cat a treat every single time, as this could contribute to a weight problem.
Never use negative reinforcement. Don’t yell at or hit your cat when you see it acting aggressively. This will only perpetuate the problem.
Instead, try to distract the aggressive cat with something more interesting (attention from you, play time, etc.) and then reward the behavior with praise or (occasionally) a treat.

Ask a professional cat trainer.,
Consult your veterinarian.,
Consider psychoactive medication.",How to Prevent Litter Box Aggression3," It might be helpful to hire a professional cat trainer to come to your home and help you with the problematic behavior. A professional will be able to make sure that your home is set up in a way that is conducive to happiness and satisfaction for the cats.

A trained professional can also make observations about your cat’s specific behaviors and give you advice that is tailored specifically for your cat’s issues.

, If the behavior is getting out of hand, you may want to consider asking your veterinarian for their advice. A vet has trained experience working with problems like this and will be able to offer you additional recommendations.Your vet will also be able to check to see if there is any underlying medical condition causing the aggressive behavior.
Aggressive behavior can sometimes be linked to medical conditions that cause pain for your cat – like arthritis or dental diseases – or to central nervous system conditions such as hyperthyroidism., If you have tried adjusting your home and addressing the cat’s behavior, it might be time to consider some psychoactive medication like lorazepam. This kind of medication can help decrease the cat’s aggressive tendencies and alleviate a lot of the stress that your cats are feeling.This option should only be considered in extreme circumstances once you have attempted to alter the behavior in other ways.
These kinds of medication can have a sedating effect on the cat, which is normal. But you may need to change the dosage if your cat seems too sedated.

"
"
Give the cat some space.,
Pay close attention to your cat's body language.,
Provide a variety of toys for your cat.,
Spend at least twenty minutes with your cat, twice a day.,
Build an outdoor enclosure for your cat.,
Try pheromones that mimic a natural cat odor.",How to Properly Deal With an Aggressive Cat2," While it's important to make sure the cat is stimulated by its environment, an aggressive cat is unlikely to want to socialize with people. She needs space to learn trust. Rather than dangling a toy in the cat's face, don't try to enforce playtime unless the cat seems to enjoy it.


When entering the room with an aggressive cat, avoid eye contact and make sure the cat has have a clear escape route. Do not approach an aggressive cat unless necessary; it's better to let the cat come to you.
If you have to handle the cat, wear thick gloves and long sleeves to avoid getting a scratch injury. To pick the cat up, wrap it snugly in a towel to impede movement.

, Some cats are easily overstimulated, and their play can escalate into aggression. To a cat, play is connected to how it learns to hunt. Play aggression is the most common type of aggressive behavior owners see in their cats.It’s believed that through play with each other, young cats learn to inhibit their bites and sheathe their claws when swatting.
The degree to which individual cats learn to inhibit their rough play varies, and those who were orphaned or weaned early might never have learned to temper their play behavior.
Long hours spent alone, without opportunities to play, and owners that encourage their cats to chase and play-attack people’s hands and feet contribute to play aggression., Some cats prefer toys that they can throw around themselves. Other cats prefer toys that require owner participation, such as those you wiggle and dangle. Stimulating play for a cat involves opportunities to “hunt,” so move toys in such a way that they mimic the movements of a rodent or bird. Introduce new toys periodically to keep your cat from becoming bored with her toys., Forty minutes is not that long for a person. It means a lot for the relationship between you and your cat. This will enhance the bond between you and your pet, and help your cat work out some energy.


For a truly aggressive cat you just need to be in the room, lying on the floor, eyes closed, with treats around you. This gives your cat time to build the confidence to know you are not a threat.
Use a fishing pole toy to keep the cat away from your body when playing.
Don’t resume playing until your cat is calm if it bites or scratches you.
Do not encourage your cat to play with your hands, feet or any other body part. While it may be fun when you have a tiny kitten, it becomes painful and dangerous as your kitten grows up.
Do not use toys that teach your cat to play with your hands, such as gloves with balls hanging from the fingers. If you do, your cat will be encouraged to direct his play at your hands.
Do not physically punish your cat for rough play. If you hit your cat, she may perceive your actions as play or become fearful of your hands.
Don't run from your cat or try to block its movement with your feet. These actions can cause your cat to intensify its play or become aggressive.

, A more complex environment for your cat will keep her stimulated, and she will require less attention from you. An outdoor enclosure not only keeps your cat in, it keeps other animals away from your cat. Make sure to include platforms and places for her to explore and rest.Cats will spend hours watching leaves blow in the wind, birds flying and squirrels scampering around. If you can’t have an outdoor enclosure, try creating a window perch where your cat can easily sit and look out the window.

, These are similar to the pheromones cats release when they rub their head on an object. This may reduce tension. Use a diffuser while the aggression is being resolved.Talk to a pet professional about brand recommendations and proper application.

Protect cats during feeding times from anything that cause them to exhibit fearful aggression.,
Use food to reward your cat for non-aggressive behavior.,
Teach your cat to enjoy getting pet by using treats.,
Try to entice an aggressive mother away with some food.,
Put your cat on a new meal plan so that you can conduct tolerance sessions just before mealtime.,
Provide several small meals per day rather than one or two large meals to help manage predatory aggression.",How to Properly Deal With an Aggressive Cat3," Examples include loud noises, children, other cats bullying them, and dogs. If your cat fears one or more of these things, it may not eat, and may react aggressively. Keeping your cat's environment quiet and still during feeding times will help to calm it.

, Cats will normally associate feeding with positive feelings, and so food can be used as a reward to help condition their behavior.There are a number of techniques you can try:


To build your cat's trust, find the cat's go-to treat and scatter some around the room during a play session. Try holding treats in your hand and dropping them to get the cat to come closer.
Expose to aggression-causing stimuli at a safe distance, for short periods of time, then reward with food for non-aggressive behavior. For example, if your cat has an aggressive fear of a specific person, that person might stand at a distance that does not trigger aggressive behavior.
When working with other cats, they might be kept in large cages at opposite ends of the room, on leashes, or in harnesses, so they can see the source of aggression, but not escape. After several hours, they might be brought closer together. After many such sessions, it should be possible for them to be close to each other, without becoming defensive.

, Petting aggression isn't a well understood behavior, even among experienced animal behaviorists. It's thought that some cats just have sensitive spots or limited tolerance for touch. The next time you pet your cat, watch her closely for signs of irritation. As soon as you recognize 'tells' that the cat's tolerance level is about to be exceeded, stop petting, stand up and tip the cat off your lap., This can be an easy way to calmly distract the queen. While she is occupied eating, it will give you an opportunity to care for the kittens, while avoiding the aggressive behavior. This can be used in a process of gradual acclimation.

, Learn what specific types of behaviors it likes and use only those strokes when training. Also remember to slightly vary your behaviors, as activity that is too repetitive can bore and annoy your cat., Avoid “free feeding” (keeping your cat’s bowl full all the time). If your schedule doesn’t permit giving multiple meals, you can purchase a feeder with a built-in timer, designed to open according to a preset schedule. Predatory aggression is shown not to occur when cats eat from a food bowl, but only with objects perceived as prey."
"
Start with a slow introduction.,
Introduce cats to each other during feeding times.,
Restrain two combative cats on opposite ends of the same room, either in carriers or restrained with harnesses and leashes.",How to Properly Deal With an Aggressive Cat4," Most territorial aggression is directed toward other cats. Managing this aggression can progress in much the same way as the fear induced aggression acclimation, with gradual exposure.


Confine the cats in separate rooms with litter, food, and water. The two cats should be able to smell and hear each other through the closed door, but there should be no physical contact.
After a few days, switch the positions of the cats. Allow your cat to investigate the smells of the newcomer, while the new cat explores the house and the scent of his new playmate.
Switch them back after they have had some time to explore.

, Both cats should be fed at the same time so that they learn to associate the pleasure of eating with each other's presence.Position one cat on each side of a room, several times a day, and try to feed them small amounts of food. Hungry and occupied with eating, they will begin to associate the other cat with this non-threatening situation.


If the cats eat without becoming aggressive, you can then try to bring the food bowls a little closer together each day.
If the cats won't eat or become aggressive, they are probably too close together. Try again later, this time positioning them farther apart.

, This can be done in combination with other kinds of exposure.


This whole process can take weeks or even months. Signs of anxiety or aggression usually indicate that the introductions are proceeding too quickly. If the territorial aggression still cannot be controlled, your veterinarian may prescribe medication for both the aggressor and the victim. Keep in mind that medication is only part of the solution; it must be used in conjunction with slow introductions and consistent rewards for peaceful behavior.

"
"
Block your cat's exposure to the outside world.,
Muzzle or gently restrain an aggressive mother.,
Interrupt aggression with a loud clap of your hands, spray from a water gun, or a burst of compressed air.If you let the cats fight it out, one or both may become seriously injured, possibly creating more opportunities for aggression in the future.,
Don't physically punish your cat for lashing out.,
Be mindful that your cat is much smaller than you are.,
Give your cat a time-out.,
Do not console the cat.",How to Properly Deal With an Aggressive Cat5," You can install electronic mats that deliver a harmless, mild shock, or put sticky tape on your windowsills. Window blinds are also effective deterrents. You can discourage outdoor animals from coming near your house by installing motion-activated sprinklers, removing bird feeders, and using well-sealed garbage containers.

, This is for situations when the kittens must be handled, and the mother is not permitting it. More is less in this case. Take care not to overly stress any of the cats. A blanket can work in certain situations. Remember that her aggression comes from a deep, instinctual care for her offspring.

, If this kind of aggression is not dealt with, it can progress to fearful aggression., Even yelling at it can make the problem worse. Teach your cat to be calm by remaining calm yourself. Aggression on your part can result in additional aggression form your cat.

, And though she is capable of injuring you, you are also capable of injuring her. At times when your cat becomes aggressive, don't forcefully throw your cat off of you. She might become afraid of you, or get injured by the fall.

, When she plays too rough, end the game by leaving the room. Don’t attempt to pick up your cat and put him in another room for the time-out as this could provoke aggression. Take your time as you do this. You do not want to provoke a chase.

, This can communicate your approval of the aggressive behavior. Visitors should not run or show fear, as this teaches the cat that she can make unwanted visitors go away. Ignoring the cat in this case can prove to be a more effective strategy."

Try being firm with the cat first.,
Follow up a strong ""no"" with a spray from a water bottle.,
Feed your cat.,
Distract the cat from chewing.,
Play with the cat.,
Keep snacks or treats near where you sit.,
Bring a scratching post into the area where your cat likes to chew.,
Put your books away in a way that makes them hard to get at.,
Use vinegar or bitter apple spray.,
Cover chewed furniture.",How to Solve Cat Book and Furniture Chewing," Most cats respond to voice tone; if the tone is negative, deep and authoritative, the cat will know that you are displeased and be left in no doubt that you want the action to stop. Whenever the cat chews or scratches, say ""no"" in a firm, deep voice.;
, This is probably best used if the cat is chewing furniture; for books, there is a risk of the pages getting wet.

, Chewing can sometimes be a way of annoying you into feeding your cat, especially in the mornings before you've woken. The simple answer is to get up and feed your cat. This should alleviate the need to chew if your cat is doing it to get your attention.

,


Remove the book from the cat. Each time you catch your cat in the act of chewing, gently remove the book from the cat's mouth and replace with a favorite chew toy instead. Do this each time, and do it calmly but persistently.
Pick the cat up and move it away from the piece of furniture he is chewing. Give the cat a favorite chew toy and keep an eye on the cat.

, A good way to distract your cat is to play a game, dangle something for the cat to attack or use a laser pointer for chasing.

, If the cat chews the couch because it's where you're sitting, take note of when the cat looks like it wants to chew and quickly head it off with a treat. Do not give a treat if the cat has already chewed; that would seem like positive reinforcement. Instead, only use a treat as a form of distraction.

, This might encourage the cat to scratch the post instead of chew the books or furniture.

, In the case of chewing books, once the cat has the habit, it will be very hard to break. In this case, dealing with your book collection is the best line of defense:


Face all books spine outward in bookcases. Do not leave any sitting sideways with pages or edges showing, or the cat may be tempted to pull them out and chew (for most chewing cats, it is the paper that is most appealing, not the spine).
Pick up books left on the floor.
Don't leave books sticking up out of containers, etc. Anything sticking up provides temptation.
Put a book you're reading out of reach or behind a barrier, such as a bedside table drawer or underneath a laptop, to prevent the cat from accessing it.

, Cats don't like the odor or taste of vinegar or bitter apple spray and it may help to keep the cat away.


Spray vinegar or bitter apple spray on your couch or other furniture, focusing most on the chewing zones.
Wipe vinegar on a chewed book. Or leave a bowl of vinegar near a pile or stack of books.

, If you can cover favorite chewing spots with something that the cat isn't likely to chew on, this might save the furniture. For example, you could wrap very heavy fabric with a scratchy texture around a couch end, or cover an area with a tarpaulin.

Give a high strung cat places to hide and feel comfortable.,
Give the cat some physical space from you.,
Simulate your cat's mind and body.,
Understand that a skittish cat may never get totally comfortable in your presence.,
Make sure that the cat sees that you are feeding it.",How to Pet a High Strung Cat1," While it may be tempting to force a nervous cat to come out of hiding, this will not build a better relationship with the cat. Instead, if you can tempt the cat out of hiding, you are putting the ball in the cat's court so to speak, basically having it make the decision to interact. If the cat has places it feels safe, then perhaps it will feel less stressed and it will make the cat feel more secure when it does venture out.While you want to make sure the cat can hide itself a bit, you also need to make sure that there are no hazards around it.Be especially sure that the cat cannot escape!;
, Don't force your affection onto a high strung cat. It can be totally frustrating to care for a cat that doesn't trust you or care to hang out with you, but you need to keep focused on developing your long-term relationship with the cat. Forcing the cat to do something it doesn't want to do will only make it more distrustful of you.

, Provide the cat with toys and equipment, such as a cat tower, that will make it happier and more fulfilled.While a skittish cat may be a little afraid of you, it may overcome that fearfulness to play with you or to receive a treat. Contentment will only make it more likely that the cat will overcome its shyness and become comfortable with you.

, Some cats are naturally reserved or have experienced trauma that makes them fearful. While it's important to try to make your cat happy and content, it may not be able to overcome all neuroses. Make a concerted effort to socialize your cat but don't think of it as a personal failure if your cat doesn't want to snuggle with you all the time.

, Food is a powerful motivator for a cat, so if it knows that you are the source of its food it may be more inclined to show you affection. If the cat is severely high strung, feeding time may be the only time you can get near it. Hang out near the cat's food dish, making sure that you are far enough from the dish that the cat will actually eat but that your presence is acknowledged by the cat.

Schedule daily, interactive play sessions with your cat.,
Provide her with more environmental stimulation.,
Give your cat a time-out if she plays too roughly.,
Prevent her from attacking your ankle.,
Set up deterrent devices in her usual stalking spots.,
Do not punish your cat.,
Reward her for good behavior.",How to Make Your Cat Stop Attacking You1," The sessions should last about 10 minutes each and take place when your cat is in a playful mood. Try to schedule at least two of these sessions a day.Increasing the amount of time that you play with her will address one of the possible causes of her attacks, and can serve as an opportunity to teach her not to attack and/or bite you.


A pole-type toy or a toy that dangles, both of which can be homemade or purchased at your local pet store, will keep distance between your cat and your hands and feet. This type of toy also fosters her natural predator-prey instinct.Stuffed animal toys are helpful if your cat likes to wrestle; they are especially helpful for kittens. Select a stuffed animal toy that is about the size of your cat. If she’s getting too rough with you during playtime, rub the stuffed animal against her belly to redirect her play from you to the stuffed animal.You can also throw one of her favorite toys away from you during playtime. Throwing the toy will serve two purposes–you are keeping her away from your hands and feet, and you are fostering her natural instinct to chase and pounce.;
, If you can keep your cat busy in her environment, she will probably spend less time trying to attack you. One way to increase this stimulation is to have a variety of toys and rotate them out on a regular basis.It is not necessary to buy new toys on a consistent basis. You can just put out the ones you have in different combinations so that she is not always playing with the same set of toys.


Regularly give your cat new things to explore, such as an empty cardboard box.Provide your cat with puzzle feeders. Puzzle feeders are toys in which you can place food. Your cat will need to put in extra effort to get the food, which will keep her busy and mentally stimulated.Place an old toy in something new, such as an empty cardboard box or paper bag.This is helpful if you notice that your cat has gotten bored with some of her older toys.
Place climbing perches or scratching posts in your cat’s favorite spots to give her something to climb and play on.If your cat is comfortable with being outside, you could purchase or build an outdoor enclosure so that she can safely play outside.Visit your local pet store to learn about the different types of outdoor enclosures that are available.

, Get up and walk out of the room, without paying her any attention, if her playing becomes too rough.You can even go so far as walking to another room and closing the door, blocking her access to you.Because cats avoid doing things that have a negative result,taking the fun of out playtime will teach her not to play roughly with you.


It is important that you walk away from her, rather than pick her up and move her to a different room. Your cat could interpret your physical touch as a reward, and you do not want to reward her for rough play., When you least expect it, your cat may jump out and start biting your ankle. To your cat, your ankle is an easy moving target, especially if she does not have many other toys or objects in her environment to keep her busy. When she bites your ankle, do not try to run or pull away. Running or pulling away resembles prey behavior, and your cat’s predatory instincts will encourage her to just bite down harder.Instead of trying to get away, gently push toward her. Because prey tend not to move toward the predator, you will confuse your cat with this action. She will let go of your ankle when she realizes that you’re not acting like prey.
When she lets go, stay still for a moment and don’t pay her any attention.She will stop biting your ankle when you take away the thrill of the catch.

, If you have identified areas where your cat likes to hide and try to attack you, make those areas as undesirable to her as you can. There are commercially-available deterrent devices that you can use, such as upside-down mousetraps and motion-activated devices that spray compressed air.These devices will startle your cat without injuring her. Eventually, she will stop returning those areas because of the startling effect and noise of those devices.The upside-down mousetrap will flip into the air when your cat steps on it., It is very important to remember that cats do not learn by punishment (eg, yelling, hitting, tapping her on the nose). Rather, your cat will become fearful and wary of you if you punish her.She may even become confused. Because the punishment would likely come after whatever she did wrong, she would not really know what she’s being punished for.


Some cats may even see the punishment as a challenge, rather than as a deterrent., Cats will repeat behavior that has positive consequences.If you give her plenty of positive reinforcement when she does the right thing (eg, playing gently with you, snuggling with you instead of biting your hands), she will continue to do it. Keep in mind that you need to give her the positive reinforcement during her good behavior so that she will form an association between good behavior and reward.

Neuter the cats.,
Resolve or alleviate their pain.,
Have cats with aggression problems examined for underlying medical problems.,
Handle sick cats as gently as possible.,
Ask your veterinarian about medications that can help your cat cope with its pain.,
Consult your veterinarian or an animal behaviorist to evaluate your best options in the case of idiopathic aggression.,
Rule out other factors before considering euthanizing your cat.",How to Properly Deal With an Aggressive Cat6," Intact males are particularly prone to aggressive behavior among each other. Getting them fixed is the best way to solve this kind of aggression.Although these males may still spray and be prone to other kinds of aggression, this typically resolves inter-male aggression.

, This is the best way to manage aggression when it stems from illness or trauma. Pain-induced aggression is triggered by pain, frustration or deprivation, and can be directed toward people, animals and objects. Any animal—including humans—can aggress when in pain. So even a well-socialized, normally docile cat can lash out when it is hurt, when someone tries to touch an injured area, or when it is in pain and anticipates being handled., Painful diseases such as arthritis, dental pain and abscesses from fighting are common sources of pain-related aggression. By diagnosing the problem quickly, you can avoid the cat developing trauma-based aggression. Allowing an issue to remain undiagnosed can cause the problem to worsen.


Body postures will usually be defensive. A cat that dislikes being touched in a painful area may display pain-induced aggression in an attempt to stop you from handling it.
This behavior can also be associated with past trauma. For example, a cat whose tail was once caught in a door may be protective of its tail long after the pain is gone., Wear gloves if necessary, and give them food treats so that they associate your touch with a tasty reward. If they act aggressive while you are handling them, do not reward with kind words and petting; this demonstrates that aggressive behavior is acceptable. Remain calm, and this will help keep them calm.

, These can reduce pain-related aggression. There are a variety of medications that are effective at managing pain in cats. It is possible that with the right prescription, you will be able to reduce your cat's discomfort and aggression.

, Redirected aggression must be closely considered and ruled out as a possible cause before a diagnosis of idiopathic aggression is made. These cats are dangerous, and owners of such cats should carefully assess their quality of life, as well as the safety of those around them.Find ways to relieve the cat's stress.
Reevaluate the cat's presence in your home. However, you should be extremely cautious about placing her in a new home; you don't want to pass your problem on to someone else.

, In most cases it is not necessary to put an animal down due to aggression. Consider all other options before taking this route.


Aggression from an illness might be a sign of great pain. In cases where the problem cannot be adequately treated with medical care, euthanasia can be the kindest option. Talk with your veterinarian about whether or not this is the best choice, when treatment is too expensive or unlikely to provide relief.
Idiopathic aggression includes any type of aggression whose cause can’t be determined or explained through behavior history or medical exam. Cats with this type of aggression can attack their owners violently. They may bite repeatedly and remain in an aroused state for long periods of time. Talk to your vet about how to handle this type of aggression.

Look for signs of fear in the cat.,
Understand that a cat may decide it doesn't want to be petted at any point.,
Look for signs the cat enjoys being petted.,
Remember that just because a cat rubs up on you, doesn't mean it wants to be petted.",How to Pet a High Strung Cat2," You don't want to increase the anxiety in a cat that is already stressed out. If a cat has its hair raised or is hissing at you, it's a good sign that the cat doesn't want to interact with you. At that point you can do one of two things, either walk away and let the cat have its space or you can try to win it over by offering a treat to it at a distance. You should not, however, try to win it over by forcing physical affection. This will only discourage trust and may result in the cat scratching or biting you.


Remember that a cat will rely on the instinct of fight or flight when it feels at risk.Whether it runs from you or fights you, it is doing it out of fear.
You can also look at a cat's tail to judge its comfort level. A tail that is straight up may signal that the cat is fearful, while a relaxed and swishing tail is more likely to signal that the cat is comfortable with you.

, Stop petting the cat at any sign of displeasure. A cat will usually warn you that it is getting overstimulated by a soft bite or growl.If the cat you are petting does this, immediately quit petting it and give it some room.

, Purring is the clearest signal that your cat enjoys how you are petting it.The cats body should be relaxed and it may be pressing into your hand for more pressure if it really likes the petting.


Your cat may also direct your petting toward where it wants to be scratched. This is a good sign that it likes what's going on, the cat just wants it to happen in another location.

, A cat may even be purring and then decide that it is done with what you are doing. When petting a high strung cat, be prepared to stop petting him or her quickly, and be aware that you may get bitten or scratched. This may be the cost of trying to connect with a skittish cat.

Lure the cat toward you.,
Allow the cat to sniff and rub up against you without attempting to pet it.,
Make sure the cat sees you coming before you attempt to pet it.,
Pet the cat in specific areas of its body.,
Avoid petting sensitive areas.,
Be patient.,
Build up the length of time you pet the cat gradually.",How to Pet a High Strung Cat3," Once you've located the cat, sit down on a nearby piece of furniture or on the floor but not too close to the cat. Try to be at the cat's elevation so you're not looming over it. You can look in its direction but don't make eye contact. Call the cat's name. It will either respond by looking at you, turning an ear in your direction, pausing from current activity, or slowly getting up, stretching, and leaving the room, or it will not respond to you at all.


If the cat acknowledges you, begin to pat your knee and call it again in a pleasing, gentle voice. You could even entice it to come to you with a treat., A skittish cat needs to get used to your smell before it can become comfortable with you. If it comes up to you and rubs up against you, it's saying that you are its territory.While a rub against your legs doesn't exactly mean that the cat loves you, it's a good first step toward the cat becoming comfortable with you.


Once the cat has rubbed up against you a few times, put your hand out for it to smell. The cat may rub your hand with its cheek, at which time you can begin to gently find out where it likes to be petted.

, Don't surprise a high strung cat. While you might get closer to a skittish cat by sneaking up on it, you are not building trust with the cat. Instead, make sure that the cat sees you coming. If it agrees to let you pet it, you will know because it won't run away.

, Begin by petting it on the back or under its chin. Also try scratching your cat between the shoulder blades or under its collar. These are spots it can't reach easily, and so cats generally love it.


Gently stroke the cat in the direction of its fur growth, as many cats don't like their fur messed up by petting against the growth.

, For instance, avoid petting a high strung cat's belly.Although some cat's enjoy being petted on the belly, it's more likely that this will make a skittish cat go into defense mode. Some cats even take petting on the stomach as a clear invitation to playfully gnaw and scratch your hand.


Also, many cats don't like being touched on their paws.
Some cats can bite without warning if you pet them too much. It is often safer to only pet the head, neck and under the chin if you are unsure.

, Pet your new best friend gently and find out where and how the cat likes to be stroked or gently scratched. If your cat leaves, act like you are glad to be doing something very important.

, Don't expect a shy cat to put up with petting for a long period of time. Give him or her a few nice pets on the back and then willingly let the cat move away. This will begin the physical bonding process between both you and the cat, but it will also help to build the bond of trust as well.

Learn why your cat is attacking you.,
Observe your cat’s body language.,
Keep a record of her attacks.",How to Make Your Cat Stop Attacking You2," In the wild, cats are predators. When your cat is stalking you and attacking and/or biting you, she is seeing you as prey.You probably don’t see yourself as prey, since you, her owner, are bigger than she is. However, even if your cat attacks nothing more than your ankles, she is demonstrating her natural predator instincts.


Your cat may also be attacking you because she does not have enough toys or other environmental stimulation to keep her busy. She might be bored, and sees you as an easy target.An insufficient amount of interactive playtime can also cause her to attack.Kittens that are separated too early from their mother and littermates do not learn how to stop biting, so they are more prone to attacking and biting you as her owner.What you might see as cute behavior in a kitten can actually become a very problematic behavioral issue.
Medical issues, such as hyperthyroidism and central nervous system dysfunction, may also be causing the attacks. Your veterinarian can determine if medical issues are the root cause.Medical issues should be ruled out first before considering behavioral issues.

, When you are playing with your cat, it may not be easy to tell the difference between normal play behavior and attack behavior (playing too roughly).Your cat will give you subtle clues to let you know whether her intentions are playful or harmful. For example, if she is in a bright and playful mood, she will open her mouth halfway, pounce or hop sideways, and have an arched back; she likely won’t make much noise.When she is approaching attack mode, she will start hissing, growling, or spitting during playtime.She may also start trying to grab your hand to bite it.You may see her ears flatten, pupils dilate, and tail swish back and forth.If you are not playing with her, but notice that she is stalking you, you can be fairly confident that she’s about to try to attack you., Keeping a record of when your cat attacks you can help you get a better understanding of the situations and times when she is most likely to attack. For example, you may notice that she tends to bite your ankles in the morning to wake you up, or becomes aggressive each time that you play and interact with her. If you are able to anticipate when she is most likely to attack, you can do some pre-planning to try to redirect her attention from attacking you to maybe playing with a toy."

Create your own environmental punishers.,
Place light baking sheets at the counter's edge.,
Create a noise trap.,
Place double-stick tape on the surface where the cat is not allowed to go.,
Buy devices designed for startling cats and put them on the counter.These devices startle cats with loud noises, unexpected movement, or double-sided tape.,
Activate noisemakers yourself.",How to Prevent Cats from Jumping on Counters1," Environmental punishers—also called ""remote correction""—involve disciplining the cats without being present yourself, so the cats don't link the punishment to you. If you punish your cats for jumping on off-limits surfaces yourself, they will learn to keep off counters only when you're at home. You can create some devices for remote correction yourself, but never create a deterrent that might hurt your cat(s).;
, This simple means of discouraging your cats from jumping on the countertop works because the cats will land on the sheets when they jump onto the counter. The noise and unexpected movement will frighten them, but not physically hurt the cats. Over time, they will associate the countertops with this sound and the stress it creates and avoid jumping up there.


You can also fill baking the trays with water and set them on the counter. Cats will be startled not only by the noise, but by the water as well. The drawback here is that cats can slip in the water, so if your cat is old or not especially spry, it would probably be better to avoid this method, as they might slip and hurt themselves.

, String a line of twine across the access point where your cats usually jump onto the counter. Attach one end of the string to empty cans that can be easily knocked over. If you position it just right, a cat jumping onto the counter will move the string enough to knock over the cans, creating a startling noise that will deter him or her from jumping up there again.


For an even more startling noise, add coins or other small objects to the cans.

, The tape can be lightly applied in just a couple of spots to hold it on, then, when the cat jumps upon it, it will stick to his or her paws, deterring them from going there again. Cats are easily distracted and annoyed by objects that stick to them, so the double-stick tape should be effective.


You can also try putting aluminum foil on surfaces. The noise will deter cats should they land on it.

, There is quite a market for these types of deterrents, so do some research to see what works.


Motion-activated air blasters are one example of electronic devices meant to deter cats from countertops or other unwanted surfaces or areas. A motion sensor detects the cat in the off-limits area and immediately sprays the animal with a strong gust of air, startling them.
Motion-activated alarms are another device that can help deter cats from countertops. A motion sensor activates a loud alarm that startles the cat and alerts the owner. Some motion-activated alarms are pressure sensitive, so they are activated when the cat touches them or what they are positioned under. There are even mats that are pressure sensitive that you can roll out on the countertop so they will be triggered when the cat lands on them.
Silent motion-activated alarms provide a less bothersome alternative to other motion-activated alarms. These alarms emit a tone of such a high pitch that they are inaudible to humans and even dogs, but they will deter cats.
Textured mats are a harmless deterrent that require no electricity, batteries, or compressed air. These mats are simply-textured with a minimally-pointed nub that is uncomfortable for the cat to tread upon. Encountering them, the cats will generally jump off.

, Conceal yourself from the cat's view and use a noisemaker of some kind as soon as you see the cat jump on the counter. There are many noisemakers from which to choose, and there are even some that are manufactured for this specific purpose.


An air horn can be an effective way of startling the cat enough to get them off the surface from which they are banned if you can catch them in the act and remain concealed. Just be sure the air horn you choose is not so loud the you damage the cat's or you own hearing.
Some manufacturers have created air horns that are loud when activated, but that also spray a pheromone which further deters the cat from unwanted behavior."

Add the essential oil to a spray bottle.,
Fill the spray bottle with water and shake it well to mix.,
Spray the mixture on desired locations.",How to Make Homemade Cat Repellent1," For the repellent, you’ll need a 2-ounce (59 ml) glass spray bottle. Squeeze 2 drops of lemon essential oil, 2 drops of wild orange essential oil, and 2 drops of lavender essential oil to the bottle.Cats are more sensitive to scents than humans, so essential oils with strong odors, such as citrus and lavender, can help repel them. You can substitute lime, peppermint, and/or eucalyptus for the lemon, wild orange, and lavender if you prefer.
It’s important to use a glass bottle for the spray because essential oils degrade more easily in a plastic bottle.;
, After you’ve added the essential oils to the spray bottle, pour enough water in to fill it. Close the bottle securely, and shake it well to ensure that the oils are blended with the water.It isn’t necessary to use filtered or purified water for the spray. Regular tap water works fine.

, Once the water and oils are mixed, apply the cat repellent to areas that you want to discourage cats from visiting. In particular, it works well if you have house plants that you want to keep cats away from.Be careful spraying the repellent on carpeting, curtains, or other fabrics because the oils may stain the material. Test it on an inconspicuous spot on the fabric to ensure that the spray won’t damage it.

Treat cats as independent animals.,
Avoid resorting to punishment.,
Discover your cat’s favourite treats.,
Embrace your cat’s unique personality!,
Learn and respect your cat’s body language .,
Listen to your cat’s vocalizations.,
Avoid prolonged eye-contact with your cat.,
When picking up your cat, go down to its level first.,
Keep your cat out of danger.,
Feed your cat according to a schedule.,
Don't neglect your cat!,
Clean litter boxes regularly.,
Brush your cat often.,
Play with your cat.,
Invest in a scratching-post.,
Consider purchasing or building a “cat tree” or “kitty condo,” which doubles as a scratching-post and a play structure.,
Utilize your cat's 'cupboard love' tendencies.",How to Make Your Cat Love You," Even though cats really need your care, they have a strong need for independence and personal space. While cats enjoy being stroked, they are not always interested in interaction with people. If you strike a healthy balance between playing with your cat and giving it alone time, your cat will love you more.


One of the biggest mistakes pet owners make is to treat cats like dogs. Remember that they are very different animals!
Dogs are pack animals originally bred to work alongside people. In contrast, cats are relatively solitary animals that historically served humans by killing vermin on their own.Don’t smother cats or be offended if they hide from you sometimes. This is part of their nature.;
, When cats are punished by yelling or other aggressive actions, they simply tend run away. For the most part, cats do not learn through discipline. Your cat will not love you if you're a mean owner.


Never strike a cat as this will only make matters worse.
While spraying a cat with water to punish bad behaviours is a common tactic, water-spraying may make your cat fear and distrust of you , Like humans, there are some foods that cats prefer over all others. Find out what these foods are, and instead of discipline use treats to reinforce your cat’s positive behaviour. Tastes among cats vary, but small tuna flakes and cooked chicken pieces often prove irresistible. Ration these treats to make your cat love you.Avoid feeding cats milk; contrary to popular belief, dairy is unhealthy for them.
Also avoid feeding cats chocolate, candy, raw eggs, raw meat or fish. Remember that treats are not a substitute for full meals of cat food.

, Although there are certain behaviours common to all cats, considerable variation exists. Spend time getting to know what your cat likes and dislikes. Knowing and respecting your cat's unique personality is important to getting it to love you.

, Much like humans, cats use body language as a form of communication to express everything from trust to fear. Their postures convey important messages. For example:


an arched back, upright hair along the spine, and unsheathed claws means that your cat feels threatened. Leave it alone for time being!
If your cat nudges you, it may want to play.
If your cat curls its tail around you, it’s probably expressing contentment.
When a cat approaches you with it tail pointing up and then curling round slightly at the top it is wanting to see you and be petted and play with you, let a cat check you out first by putting your hand out and letting them sniff it before you stole them.
If its tail is tucked below or between its legs, your cat is likely feeling anxious or insecure, Purring is a sign of love and contentment. Growling and hissing means stay away. Meowing is an attention-getting vocalization that expresses everything from hunger to a desire for affection.


Cats do not meow at each other; they meow to communicate with people.
Constant meowing may indicate illness and require a trip to the veterinarian. , While polite in conversations between people, many cats find extended eye contact threatening. When cats blink in your presence it is a sign of trust.


The next time your cat starts blinking at you, try mimicking the behaviour.
By blinking slowly, you are communicating trust and openness, and fostering a loving relationship, Slowly bend down before lifting your cat into the air. If a cat can see you before you pick it up, it is less likely to be frightened.

, If your cat is safe and protected, it will love you more. Ensure your cat has a safe place to sleep, feels secure while toileting, has unobstructed access to food, and is not threatened by other human or animal members of the household.


Ensure that your cat cannot access poisonous substances.
Keep your pantry and cupboard doors closed, as cats are curious animals and they may get into trouble.
Outfit your cat with a collar with a quick release buckle (in case he gets stuck) that includes contact information in case it runs away.

, Cats are creatures of habit. Don't change their feeding times drastically or very often. When cats do something good try to reward them with a treat, but don't let this interfere with their main meal. To get your cat to love you more, avoid frequently changing the type or brand of food they eat.


Cats can be perfectly healthy eating dry food, canned food, or a combination of both. Most experts recommend feeding your cat no more than two meals a day. In industrialized countries, one in five cats is obese, which can cause serious health problems. , When leaving home, make sure your cat has enough food and access to fresh water. If you're away from home for an extended period, ensure that someone keeps an eye on your cat's well-being, cleans its litter, and provides some stimulation. A neglected cat will not love you.


While cats are fairly independent creatures, they also need human attention and regular grooming.
If going on vacation, consider a cattery or pet sitter.

, Cats love cleanliness; if their litter box is dirty they may find somewhere else to go. Add fresh litter daily. Wash out the box with soap and water routinely. Don't suddenly change a cat's type or brand of litter.
When switching to a new brand of litter, gradually introduce it by mixing the new and the old.

, They love it! Regular brushing will keep their coats and skin healthy, prevent matting, and reduce shedding and hairballs. Grooming is a great chance to discover lumps, fleas, or injuries. Also use brushing as an opportunity to bond with your cat. Avoid brushing your cat against the grain of its fur; this may cause discomfort and stress.
Remember to brush gently in long strokes rather than in short, rough strokes.

, It will love simple and inexpensive toys -- try using a toy attached to string to simulate prey animals. Make toys scurry like a rodent, or flutter like a bird. Your cat will playfully pounce on toys you move in front of them. Cats love owners that stimulate them through play.


Encourage your cat to pounce on toys, not your hand!

, Cats are naturally inclined to scratch surfaces in your home, such as furniture. But they can be trained to scratch specific objects, particularly posts fitted with rough surfaces such as dense carpet or sisal. Your cat will love you better if it has access to appropriate scratching areas in your home. , They will love climbing and playing on this kind of structure.

, Many cats prefer the person who feeds them to others in the home. If there is more than one person in your house, try to be the person who feeds the cat. The cat will get used to this and come to you straight away if hungry or it's time for dinner.


One of the best ways to get a cat to love you is through its stomach!

Keep wool away from your cat.,
Say ""no"" and be consistent.,
Break up your cat's meals throughout the day.",How to Manage Wool Sucking in Cats1," Remove any wool or cloth so your cat can't suck on it. You may need to stop wearing wool sweaters around your cat and store any projects that use wool (such as your knitting or crocheting). This is especially important if you have valuable wool items that you don't want your cat to destroy.Don't forget to keep cloth holiday or party decorations out of reach. For example, your cat may be interested by decorations that contain fringe so hang them high out of reach.;
, If your cat finds wool or another unapproved item to suck on, remove the item, firmly say ""no"", and tap your cat on the nose. Do this each time you see your cat sucking on something it shouldn't. Your cat will soon learn that this is undesirable behavior.Never yell or get angry at your cat. Keep in mind that your cat is probably sucking because it's trying to relieve anxiety.

, Cats that suck on wool are usually very hungry. Instead of giving your cat one or two main meals a day, set out several smaller meals. You can also support your cat's hunting instincts by hiding dry food or putting it into puzzle feeders or treat balls.Hunting for food may also distract your cat from the wool sucking behavior.

"
"
Monitor your cat’s sleeping habits.,
Identify restlessness in your cat.,
Observe your cat’s snoring.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Getting Enough Sleep1," Your typical adult cat will sleep around 13 to 16 hours out of a 24-hour day (about 50 to 70 percent of the day). While it is common for a cat to wake up during the night for a couple of hours to play or eat, staying up all night is not normal. If your cat is staying up for an extended amount of time during the night, then it may not be getting enough sleep.Since it is difficult to monitor your cat’s sleeping habits during the day, try to monitor its sleeping habits during the night instead.
Senior cats generally sleep more than your average adult cat, around 80 percent of the day.;
, Restlessness, irritability and confusion are common signs that your cat may not be getting enough sleep. Additionally, if you notice any mood changes in your cat, then this may be an indication that your cat is not getting enough sleep.For example, if your playful, energetic cat suddenly turns into a distant, lethargic cat, then it may be suffering from a lack of sleep.

, While some cats are known to snore while they sleep, excessive or loud snoring may disrupt your cat’s sleep and cause it to lose out on its sleep. Additionally, overweight cats and cats with shortened muzzles (Persian cats) are more susceptible to excessive or loud snoring than other types of cats.If this is your cat, make sure its snoring is not preventing it from getting its sleep.
Be aware that excessive or loud snoring is also a symptom of sleep apnea.

"
Give cats acceptable alternatives to satisfy their natural instincts to climb and jump.For instance, cats crave what veterinarians call ""vertical challenges""; they will find counters less appealing if they have other objects to jump onto or climb.

,
Place vertical cat furniture near windows.,
Install a cat shelf.,
Give cats an assortment of toys to play with on the floor.,
Provide a variety of cat beds in warm, sunny sites inside your home.,
Put your cats in another room while you're cooking.",How to Prevent Cats from Jumping on Counters2,", Cat trees, cat condos, or climbing posts give cats a place to climb, perch, and survey their surroundings. Being near the windows allows them to look at natural prey, which satisfies their curiosity and stimulates them to the point that they will be less likely to jump onto countertops and other surfaces.

, Cat shelves are padded surfaces attached to the insides of window sills. Like cat trees and other cat furniture, cat shelves satisfy curiosity while stimulating your pet at the same time. Choose windows with good sun exposure, as cats do like to lay in the sun, and the cat shelf is a great place to do so in a window that gets a lot of sunlight. The cat shelf gives your cat(s) an alternative place to sleep and/or watch what's happening outside, which can help keep them distracted from countertops.

, These toys may help use up their energyso they will be less inclined to jump on counters. If you can keep your cat interested enough in toys that stay on the floor in particular, you may also be able to keep them from becoming interested in jumping onto countertops. Change the available toys occasionally so they don't get bored and start jumping on counters for new stimulation.


Many cats like simple toys, like small, fake mice that you can throw across the room for them to chase—they may even bring them back to you!
Some cats will inevitably avoid expensive toys and play instead with empty plastic bags, boxes, laundry baskets, etc. Experiment with different types of toys to see what you cat likes before you buy an expensive toy.
Many cat toys are now electronic, with toy mice that run around a track or even ones with wheels so they can roll across carpeting or other floors on their own. Still other toys incorporate LED lights and other technology. These toys can be very stimulating for cats, thereby keeping them off off-limits surfaces like countertops.

, Cats particularly enjoy beds in which they can ""nest"" or burrow. Cats sleep 16-20 hours per day, which is a lot of time they won't be interested in jumping on countertops.If you give them especially inviting spaces in which to sleep, you'll be encouraging them to sleep in these spaces and not on countertops. You'll also be helping to ensure they are taking full advantage of sleeping time and not seeking out new stimulation around the house—such as on the countertops.

, This is so they don't become curious about what is on the counter from the smell of food coming from there. Cats' sense of smell is forty times stronger than that of humans.They will smell whatever you are cooking, and this can excite their sense of curiosity when you're not around, so they may jump onto the surface these smells emanate from.


Cats might even have trouble controlling their curiosity and jump on the counter even while you are actively cooking. Putting cats in another room while you cook can minimize their curiosity about countertops and help keep them from jumping there.
Be sure to provide a toy and comfortable place to sleep in whatever space you leave them while using the kitchen to cook or prepare meals so they are stimulated and comfortable.
Confining cats to another room while you're cooking doesn't work with all cats, so don't be surprised if your cat whines from inside the room. If this happens, try not to leave them in there too long or you may cause them stress.

"
"
Keep counters clear of human food which may tempt your cats.,
Wipe off counters frequently.,
Consider giving more food to your cats.,
Keep counters free of objects cats like to play with.,
Keep windows near countertops covered.,
Clean your counters with lemon pledge or lemon oil.",How to Prevent Cats from Jumping on Counters3," Again, cats have a very powerful sense of smell, so food particles left on countertops can lure them into trying to find and eat any scraps, crumbs, or spills you may have missed, in addition to clawing or biting their way into food you have stored on countertops. If you must store food on counters, place it in containers which cats can't tear or chew open.

, This eliminates the odor of food on the surfaces. It might be especially effective to wipe off counters with a disinfecting wipe, which will eliminate odors that may attract your cat while keeping your countertops clean and sanitary.


Choose cleaners or disinfectants that smell like citrus, aloe, eucalyptus, or wintergreen in particular. These scents will deter cats from unwanted surfaces. In fact, many perfumes will have the same effect., It is possible your cat is jumping on your countertops to scavenge for food because he or she is hungry. You might be able to determine if this is the case simply by offering your cat more food than usual. If the cat doesn't seem to jump on the counter after you start offering more food than before, then you might have solved the problem. However, some cats do overeat, and even if you do offer more food, they may still jump onto counters. Be prepared for this possibility as you try offering more food to combat countertop incursions.


If you aren't already, keep a bowl of dry cat food out for the cats to eat as they please. Many cats are ""grazers"" meaning they like to eat small amounts of food throughout the day instead of having specific mealtimes where they eat a lot of food at once. If your cats are grazers, be sure to keep a bowl of dry cat food always available, provided you do not exceed the daily serving amount on the package (unless your veterinarian instructs you to do otherwise). You can also offer them smaller portions throughout the day if that is convenient for you, but the point is to offer them enough food to try to keep them from scavenging for food on your countertops.
Watch your cat's eating habits and weight to prevent obesity if you alter their regular feeding routine.

, If you have cats toys or other objects cats like to play with on the countertop, then the cat will be tempted to jump up there and get them. Keep in mind that cats toys are not the only things cats like to play with. Your cat may be tempted to get on countertops to play with objects like keys, pens, lip balm tubes, and paper.


Keep in mind also that you should not store cat toys in a location near the countertop, such as a cabinet. If the cat sees you put a toy there, he or she may be more likely to get on countertops to try to get the toy., Be sure you close the curtains or shades on windows that your cat can access via the countertop. Cats like to look out windows to see birds, chipmunks, and other wildlife outside, so they may jump on countertops to get to those windows. This is why it is a good idea to have cat trees or cat shelves set up for cats to be able to look out windows (see Method 2).

, Cats don't like lemon, so this might work on your cat(s).

Add the vinegar and water to a spray bottle.,
Pour the soap into the bottle and shake the mixture well.,
Spray or wipe the mixture on targeted areas.",How to Make Homemade Cat Repellent2," For the cat repellent, you’ll need a spray bottle. Pour 1 part vinegar and 1 part water into the bottle, and swish them together quickly to blend them.Use white vinegar for the spray.
You can use tap, filtered, purified, or bottled water for the repellent.
You can use either a plastic or glass spray bottle for repellent.

, When the vinegar and water are mixed, squeeze 1 part liquid hand soap into the spray bottle. Shake the mixture vigorously to ensure that the soap is fully combined with the vinegar mixture.Any type of hand soap will work for the repellent, but it’s best to use a clear formula.

, Once the vinegar, water, and soap are fully mixed together, apply on the areas where you want to discourage cats from going. You can spray it directly from the bottle or apply it to a cloth and wipe it over the spots.You can use the repellent to keep cats away from both indoor and outdoor locations.

Boil the water.,
Mix in the citrus peels and simmer the mixture.,
Allow the mixture to cool and transfer the mixture to a spray bottle.,
Add the lemon juice and dish soap and shake well to mix.,
Apply the mixture to key areas in your home.",How to Make Homemade Cat Repellent3," Add 2 cups (473 ml) water to a medium pot. Heat the water over medium-high to high heat until it comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.Because you’re boiling it, tap water is fine for the repellent.

, Once the water comes to a boil, add 1 cup (96 g) of orange, lemon, lime, and/or tangerine peels to the pot. Lower the heat to medium, and allow the mixture to simmer for 20 minutes.Cat dislike citrus scents, so any combination of orange, lemon, lime, and/or tangerine peels that totals a cup (96 g) will work for the repellent.
If the mixture begins to boil again, lower the heat.

, After the mixture has simmered for 20 minutes, take the pot off the heat. Let the mixture cool completely, which should take approximately 30 minutes, before transferring it to a spray bottle.If the citrus peels are in large chunks, you can strain them out of the mixture so it’s easier to pour into the bottle.

, When the mixture is in the spray bottle, pour 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of lemon juice and a squirt or two of lemon-scented dish soap. Shake the bottle well to ensure that all of the ingredients are well combined.You can substitute lime or orange juice for the lemon, but be sure to use freshly squeezed juice.
You can use any type of clear dish soap, but a lemon-scented formula works best because cats don’t like the citrus scent.

, After you’ve thoroughly mixed the ingredients, spray the mixture in any area of your house that you want to keep cats out of. You can apply it to floors, walls, and even furniture.To be safe, it’s best to test the repellent on an inconspicuous spot on fabric-covered items to ensure that the ingredients won’t damage the material.

"
"
Fill a spray bottle with the water.,
Add the citronella oil to the bottle and shake it well.,
Spray the mixture in indoor and outdoor locations.",How to Make Homemade Cat Repellent4," For the cat repellent, you’ll need a glass spray bottle. Add enough water to the bottle to almost fill it all the way to the top.Tap, filtered, purified, and bottled water will all work for the repellent.
Using a glass spray bottle helps keep the repellent effect because the oil is more likely to break down in a plastic container.

, After you’ve nearly filled the bottle with water, squeeze 20 drops of citronella oil into it. Mix the oil into the water by shaking the bottle well.Like citrus and other essential oils, citronella oil has an extremely strong odor that repels cats. It is also effective in keeping insects away.

, Once you’ve mixed the citronella oil and water fully, apply the mixture to any locations that you wish to keep cats away from. You can use it in both indoor and outdoor locations, though it’s important to reapply regularly outdoors if it rains.If you are using the citronella repellent in an area where cats have gone to the bathroom, it’s important to clean the spot thoroughly before applying the repellent.

"
"
Combine the pepper, mustard, and cinnamon in a spray bottle.,
Add the essential oil and garlic.,
Fill the bottle with water and mix well.,
Apply the mixture to preferred outdoor areas.",How to Make Homemade Cat Repellent5," For the cat repellent, you’ll need a 2-ounce (59 ml) glass spray bottle. Add 1 teaspoon (2 g) of black pepper, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cinnamon to the bottle.You can substitute cayenne pepper for the black if you prefer.

, After you’ve added the spices to the spray bottle, toss in a crushed garlic clove. Next, squeeze in 3 to 4 drops of lemon essential oil, and swish the contents gently to combine them.You can substitute ⅛ teaspoon (½ g) of garlic powder for the clove.
Lime, wild orange, or grapefruit essential oil will work in place of the lemon.

, Once all of the spices and oil are in the bottle, add enough water to fill the container. Shake the bottle vigorously to completely blend all of the ingredients.Tap water will work well for the repellent.

, When the spray is fully mixed, spray it over any outdoor locations that you wish to keep cats away from. In particular, it works well for garden beds, bushes, and other plants.You can also use the repellent to keep cats away from indoor plants.

"
"
Offer chew toys to your cat.,
Spend time with your cat.,
Give your cat a soft comforting toy.",How to Manage Wool Sucking in Cats2," Just because you've removed the wool doesn't mean that your cat will instantly stop sucking or chewing on things. To manage the behavior, give your cat things that it can suck or chew on like:


Cat chews
Approved large bones to chew (not chicken or poultry bones that can split)
Treat biscuits
Cat toys, such as small mice with catnip stuffing

, If your cat is sucking wool because it's anxious or needs comforting, spend more quality time with your cat. Try to give it more attention and snuggles so it feels reassured. You can also play more games with your cat to keep it active and entertained.For example, try tossing small balls to your cat, playing with a laser light, or dangling ribbons for your cat.

, You might find your cat sucking on any type of cloth even though you've removed all of the wool. Redirect your cat's behavior to a safe, comforting soft toy. Give your cat a stuffed animal or soft cat toy and put it where your cat usually sucks wool. Your cat may eventually cuddle or suck on the stuffed animal or soft toy when it's feeling overwhelmed or needs the stimulation."
"
Rule out any health problems.,
Identify your cat's risk for wool sucking.,
Watch for signs of an eating disorder.,
Ask the veterinarian about medications.",How to Manage Wool Sucking in Cats3," When you notice your cat sucking wool, think about your cat's diet and energy levels. If your cat isn't eating a nutritious, high-quality diet, then a nutritional deficiency could be causing the sucking. But if your cat eats a good diet, has plenty of energy, and has a nice coat, the wool sucking probably isn't caused by a health issue.If you suspect an underlying health problem, the vet can do a complete physical and run blood work. This may find an untreated chronic health problem that's causing the wool sucking.

, Your cat's genes may play a role in causing the wool sucking. Oriental breeds are more likely to develop the behavior. Your cat may also be more likely to suck wool if it was weaned at an early age (around 6 or 7 weeks). Your cat may be sucking wool as a way of comforting itself.Most young cats that start wool sucking begin doing it around 2 to 4 months old or once it's weaned.

, Look to see if your cat begins to suck or eat other items that aren't food. This can mean that your cat has developed an eating disorder known as pica. Talk with the vet about treating it before it causes intestinal blockages in your cat. Talk with the vet if you notice your cat sucking or eating:Cloth and paper
Hair
Plastic (like electric cords) and acrylic cloths (like nylon)
Shoelaces
Wood

, If your cat isn't responding to redirection or you suspect the wool sucking is caused by another health issue, you may need to talk with the veterinarian about treating your cat with medication. The vet can give your cat medication for the wool sucking compulsion, but it may take weeks or months before you notice an improvement.The vet will need to monitor your cat for side effects and may need to adjust the dosages over time.

Notice excessive meowing during the night.,
Watch out for excessive lethargy during the day.,
Consult your vet.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Getting Enough Sleep2," Excessive meowing (or crying) coupled with restlessness during the night may be a sign of an underlying illness such as heart disease or hypertension. It may also be a sign that your cat is in pain due to an infection, arthritis, or another type of disease or illness., If you notice a significant decrease in your cat’s energy levels during the day, this could be a sign that your cat is suffering from sleep apnea or another type of sleep disorder. Additionally, if your cat suddenly collapses into a deep sleep and then arouses as if nothing happened, your cat may have narcolepsy.Narcoleptic episodes can range from a couple seconds to 30 minutes.

, If you notice your cat sleeping much less than before, then you should take it to the vet. Your vet will run blood tests to rule out any underlying problems such as a disease or illness.Your vet can also advise you on ways to help your cat sleep better.

"
"
Play with your cat in the evening.,
Feed your cat a big meal before bedtime.,
Enrich your cat’s environment.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Getting Enough Sleep3," Make sure to play and interact with your cat for at least 30 minutes a day. This can be done in two or three, short 10 to 15-minute play sessions throughout the day. Playing with your cat will exhaust it and help it sleep better at night.Use interactive toys such as toys that imitate the movements of birds and mice.
Ping-pong balls, cardboard boxes, and crumpled pieces of paper are also great ways to keep your cat entertained during the day.

, A big meal before bedtime will cause your cat to become drowsy and want to sleep. If you decide to do this, just make sure to adjust the size of its other meals so it does not gain weight.For example, feed your cat a smaller amount of food before you leave for work. Once you are ready to go to bed, feed your cat the rest of its food.

, Keep your cat busy during the day when you are at work with cat perches and food puzzles. You can even install bird feeders outside to attract birds and other animals to your backyard. This way, your cat can watch the excitement outside while you are away.Make sure to provide your cat with a variety of toys, and switch them out often as well.
Cat videos are a new form of entertainment for cats today. Set up a timer on your TV to play these videos throughout the day to keep your cat busy.

Brush your cat on a regular basis.,
Help accustom your cat to regular brushing.,
Bathe your cat.,
Use cat-cleaning products.,
Visit a professional groomer.",How to Keep Cats from Shedding1," Brush your cat for five to ten minutes at least once a week to manage shedding. If your cat has long hair or sheds heavily, you may need to brush it once every two to three days or more.A soft-bristle brush will work for short- or medium-haired cats. A wire-bristle (“slicker brush”) or specialized cat comb will work best for long-haired breeds. The brush shouldn’t get snarled or require tugging.
Using a comb to get down to the skin will help get the loosened undercoat to the surface.
Finish with a quick rubdown using a chamois or cloth.
Avoid the face and ears while brushing, and be careful near the sensitive stomach area.If the cat does not tolerate grooming with a brush or comb, try using grooming gloves, which feel more like stroking.Mini cat-grooming vacuums are another option. The noise they produce may frighten your cat, though. You may have to start with the vacuum in another room, and gradually bring it closer over the course of a few days or weeks before the cat accepts the device being used on them. Using treats can be a good idea to create a positive association.;
, You may need to train your cat to tolerate grooming. Be attentive to your cat’s response and body language. Some cats are hypersensitive to touch. Watch the cat’s body language to avoid overwhelming or overstimulating it.


Watch for tail or ear twitching. If you see either, stop brushing, praise the cat and/or offer it a treat, then let it go. If you continue brushing, your cat may bite or scratch you.

, To actively reduce shedding, bathe your cat every one to four weeks. Because most cats don’t like water, your cat may not be enthusiastic about a bath. You may need to gradually work your cat up to a full bath.


To help your cat become accustomed to a bath, start by filling a bathtub with three to four inches of warm (not hot) water.For the first few times, just put the cat in the water so that just its feet get wet and let the feet soak for a short period. Gradually build up to getting more of the cat’s body wet each time. Always build up slowly to avoid frightening your cat and understand that some cats may never tolerate a bath.
When you’re ready to bathe your cat, begin by wetting its fur.
Use a soap-free, oatmeal based pet shampoo to lather the fur everywhere but the cat’s face.
Rinse the fur thoroughly, again, avoiding the eyes, nose, and ears.Dry the cat with a large towel.

, Visit a pet store and look for wipes or sprays that clean a cat's fur without water.


These can replace baths entirely for uncooperative cats. Or, you can use them between baths if the cat gets dirty or starts shedding.Alternatively, to quickly remove loose fur from the top coat, use a paper towel or cloth dampened in warm water.

, Make an appointment with a professional groomer if you’re unable to manage the shedding yourself.


A visit to a professional groomer may be necessary for cats with long, thick fur or for cats that react aggressively to grooming.
Consider having a long-haired cat shaved down once or twice a year to decrease shedding.

Crowd out the soil.,
Use a plastic scat mat.,
Make the surface around the plant sticky.",How to Prevent Cats from Digging Up Houseplants1," If you place big rocks on top of the soil all around the plant, then the cat can't get to the soil. You can still water around the rocks. Plus, you can just pick up rocks from outside if you have some in your backyard., An easy way to keep a cat away from plants is to build a tower of plastic cups in front of it. When your cat tries to reach the plant, the tower will topple, giving the cat a fright. Once the cat's been startled a couple of times, it will likely leave the plants alone., Hanging plants are much more difficult for your cat to get to, particularly if they're not near a tall structure (such as a bookcase). If your cat can't get to the plant, it can't dig in it., If you don't leave a space on the flat surface for the cat to jump on to, it may not climb into the plants. Try crowding several plants together on a windowsill, for instance., Start by making sure the plant is in a pot that's not too big for it, as that leaves space for a cat to dig. If the pot is too big, you can use the rock trick or you can even place other plants with their small pots on the soil of the big plant, leaving little room for your cat to get in., A plastic scat mat is a mat with spikes that stick up. You place it on the soil to keep the cats out. However, don't worry; the spikes are flexible, and they won't actually hurt your cat. They're just annoying enough to keep your cat out of the soil.You may need to cut mats to fit your plants.

, This trick only works if you have open space around the base of the pot. You add fly paper or two-sided tape to the surface, and the cat won't want to walk on the area (since cats don't like the feeling of it on their paws)."

Speak calmly and quietly.Talk to the cat in a low, soft, soothing voice.,
Attempt to touch the cat.If the cat appears to have calmed down, you can try to touch it.,

Take the cat to a safe location.,
Contact professional help if needed.If you cannot handle an aggressive cat without risking serious injury, contact an animal shelter, humane society, or animal behaviorist for tips and advice.",How to Pick Up an Aggressive Cat," Say its name, if you know it. Pay attention to the cat’s body language while talking to it. If the cat looks and acts normal, it may have calmed down. Be careful, however, if you see continued signs of aggression, such as:A stiffened tail
Ears flattened backwards
Raised fur
A direct stare
Hissing, spitting, mewling, or growling
Swatting, batting, scratching, or bitting;
, Gently stroke the back of its head and down its back. Stop immediately, however, if the cat begins to show signs of aggression again.

, If you fear injury from an aggressive cat, and do not have to immediately pick it up, wait for it to calm down. Watch it from a safe distance until it stops all aggressive body language, and only attempt to pick it up then.

, Using your fingers, lightly grasp its front legs. Raise the cat slowly upwards, and press it gently against your body. Gently hold its chin with your other hand.


Stop immediately and let the cat go if it begins to act aggressively again.

, Carefully put your right arm over its back and under its chest. Hold its front legs with your fingers. Use the rest of your arm to gently press the cat against your body. Hold the cat’s head with your left hand.


Do not attempt this method if the cat is violent. If the cat becomes aggressive in the midst of attempting it, stop and try another technique.

, This may calm the cat and allow you to control it.


You should not use this technique on an adult cat (over 6 months).In many cases, picking a cat up by the scruff of the neck will restrict its ability to breathe and only make it more aggressive.Some experts recommend never picking a cat up by the scruff of the neck., Before picking up the cat, put on long sleeves, pants, gloves, and shoes. Keep your face out of the cat’s reach.

, Approach the cat slowly, from above it, while holding a thick blanket or large towel. Place the blanket over the entirety of the cat.


Do not throw the blanket. The cat will probably react faster than you can act, and escape.

, Attempt to wrap it up like a bundle. Once it is covered (especially its mouth and claws), pick the cat up within the blanket. Clutch it firmly, but do not squeeze it.

, Once you have picked up the cat, you can put it and the blanket in a crate or carrier that is large enough for the cat to move around in and get out from under the blanket. Otherwise, carefully let the cat out of the blanket into the crate or carrier. Close the door immediately, and take it to a vet or animal shelter if necessary.


Alternatively, you can place the blanket-wrapped cat in another room where it will not be disturbed by other people or animals..Wait for it to calm down before handling it further. Tossing a treat inside the room may help.

, These experts are trained in the use of special techniques and equipment (such as muzzles and leashes) that may need to be used in certain cases. "

Feed your cat high-quality food and offer plenty of fresh water.,
Help an overweight cat lose weight.,
Increase your cat’s intake of omega fatty acids.,
Make sure your cat doesn’t have fleas or other parasites.",How to Keep Cats from Shedding2," A nutritious diet will help keep your cat healthy, which may lead to less shedding.


Look for wet cat food that lists specific meats (like chicken, beef, or fish) as the first two or three ingredients. Because cats need animal-based protein, these are vital to a healthy cat’s diet.Dry cat foods and low-quality wet foods contain a lot of grains or other carbohydrates like wheat, corn, and soy. These ingredients are not as nutritious for cats as meat-based proteins. They may even cause allergic or digestive issues that lead to dry skin and shedding.

, Overweight cats have more difficulty grooming themselves and are prone to having more loose fur.


You can tell if you cat is overweight if you can’t feel its ribs without pressing. If you don’t see a narrowing waist in front of the hips when looking at the cat from above, this is another warning sign.A veterinarian can give your cat a specific diet plan if needed.
You can also try reducing your cat’s intake to the recommended amounts and refraining from giving treats.
Play with your cat regularly so it gets enough exercise.

, Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are particularly important to keeping a cat’s skin and fur healthy. This can help reduce shedding.You can find omega fatty acids in wet cat foods that contain salmon oil or flax oil.
You can also buy omega fatty acid supplements that you can feed your cat separately or mix into its food.
Your vet is best able to judge appropriate diet modifications. But, adding omega fatty acids should be safe if you choose a supplement made for cats and don’t go beyond the recommended amount.

, If your cat is scratching vigorously (and thus perhaps shedding more), it could be the result of fleas or parasites.


Look for dark flea feces near the base of the tail. If you discover fleas or flea feces, treat your cat for fleas. Then, keep your cat on a monthly flea-control regimen. Ask your veterinarian to help you choose a flea-control product.
If you’re unable to trace the source of the itching, take your cat to the vet. In addition to ectoparasites, your cat could have hypersensitivity to pollens, molds, or grasses. It could also have food allergies. All of these can contribute to itching and shedding."

Get a cat bed.,
Cover your furniture.,
Clean up shed fur with a lint roller or vacuum.Use lint rollers or a vacuum (some of which have anti-fur attachments) to clean up fur on clothes, furniture, and floors.",How to Keep Cats from Shedding3," Look in pet stores for a cat repellent spray that's safe for use on furniture.


You can use both natural and commercial sprays to deter a cat from going (and then shedding) on surfaces you don’t want it to., Place a comfortable cat bed where your cat enjoys sleeping. This will help keep the shedding contained to a small area and off of your furniture and floors.


Cats generally prefer sleeping in places that are safe, partially hidden, and warm. Try to find a location with those features and set up the cat bed there.Store-bought cat beds may smell of unfamiliar places and materials, which cats find deterring. If your cat seems hesitant to lie in the bed, try covering it with a cloth or shirt that smells like you or your cat., Though perhaps not an ideal solution, you can cover your furniture with a sheet, blanket, or slipcover. You can then wash it to remove accumulated cat fur.


If there’s a particular spot on the furniture your cat frequents, toss a throw, mat, or pillowcase over that spot.

,


Keep a lint roller in your purse or car so you can de-fur your clothes after leaving the house.
A circle of duct tape with the sticky side out can also work as a makeshift lint roller.

Place mothballs in the soil.,
Break up old scented candles.,
Try citrus or lavender.",How to Prevent Cats from Digging Up Houseplants2," Cats don't appreciate the smell of mothballs, so placing them in your houseplant's soil may keep your cat out of it. It won't harm the plant, either. Just press them into the soil in several places., Now you have a great use for the ends of old scented candles. Just break them into pieces, and push them into the soil. The smell will keep the cats away, but it won't harm the plant., You can also spray the area with a lavender or citrus smell, which your cat won't like. Citronella may also work. You will have to respray from time to time. You can also add citrus peels or lavender flowers to the soil, which may also keep your at bay."

Make sure the cat is entertained.,
Spray the cat with water.,
Give your cat supervised outdoor time.",How to Prevent Cats from Digging Up Houseplants3," Some cats dig because they are bored and they have nothing else to play with. Others may feel lonely. Find toys your cat enjoys, so it won't mess with your houseplants. Also, play with your cat for about 30 minutes a day, broken up in two or three sessions.Your cat might like jingle ball toys or scrunchy toys. However, your cat may be equally happy with a cardboard box. When playing with your cat, lure toys are usually a good bet. Make sure you supervise your cat if you let them play with a string toys. Strings can be very dangerous if your cat swallows one.

, Most cats detest being sprayed with a water bottle, so it's an effective deterrent. Of course, you have to catch the cat in the act for this deterrent to be of any use. Simply spray the cat using only water, and the cat will jump down. Do it enough times, and the cat will likely avoid the plant., Some cats who dig in houseplants benefit from spending some time outside. However, you don't want to just suddenly let an indoor cat outside, particularly if the cat is declawed. You should supervise the cat on a harness and leash.To get your cat used to a harness and leash, start by placing the harness on the cat around the house. Begin with short periods, and work up to longer periods. When the cat is used to the harness, you can try taking it outside on a leash.

Create a self-brushing station for your cat.,
Make a catnip toy to attach.,
Use different textures.,
Buy a cat spa and activity center.",How to Make a Homemade Cat Spa1," You could make it out of cardboard, fabric, or rope. It can be as simple as wrapping a piece of wood with some rope and gluing the ends. Scratching posts can help keep your cat’s nails under control, so you won't have to cut her nails as frequently. You can attach the scratching post to a piece of plywood, creating a play area for your cat that you can then add to — many cats would also enjoy a carpet square glued to the plywood to scratch at.Some cats like to scratch vertical surface, others horizontally. Watch you cat and offer her the orientation she prefers.;
, Buy cat toys for enrichment for your pet. Find time after your cat has eaten to play with him. Think about attaching the toys to the scratching post so that the fun area is all in one place (and you don’t have to go chasing after the cat toys)., Taking a cat brush or two, pull the handle and back off the brush. Using glue, attach the section with the tines to a piece of wood or heavy cardboard. This way your cat can rub against the brush whenever she desires. This can really help keep hair under control, particularly if you have a cat that sheds a lot. If you don’t want to make your own, there are commercial products you can buy that do the same thing., Cats often go crazy for catnip and it can really enhance their experience in the cat spa. If your cat seems to be having a bad day, catnip can cheer him up and bring up his energy levels., Cats like to run their bodies along different textures to massage themselves. Think about using pieces of different fabrics or carpets that you can glue or staple to heavy cardboard or wood pieces.

Shampoo your kitten.",How to Help Your Cat Enjoy Having a Bath1," The earlier in her life that she gets use to having a bath, the better. If you give your cat a bath when she’s just a kitten, she’s more likely to tolerate it when she’s grown up. It can be useful to give your kitten a bath so she gets use to it, even if she doesn’t need one.If training your cat as a kitten isn’t possible, you can try training her as an adult cat. If you do this when she’s an adult, be patient. Each training step may take longer for her to successfully complete.;
, If your cat or kitten hates getting her nails clipped, you might want to do this a day or two in advance, instead of the same day as the bath. Clipping your cat’s nails beforehand will help limit the number of fabric items (e.g. towels, shower curtains, bath mats, etc.) her nails can get caught on if she struggles. Clipping her nails will also help reduce the number of scratches you end up with., Your cat or kitten will most likely want to stand up while she’s in the bath and you don’t want her to slip. Put some sort of non-slip bath mat on the bottom of the tub or sink where you’re giving her a bath.You could also put a towel in the tub or sink. The towel will obviously be soaked, but it will provide a soft place for your cat to stand.

, Start by gathering all the necessary bath supplies and taking your kitten into the bathroom with everything. Run the water and let her explore the sounds and the tub. Talk to her softly and gently throughout this whole process, and give her treats as a reward for good behaviour. For this step, she doesn’t need to get wet.Allow your kitten (or cat) to play in the bathroom (or wherever you might bathe her) whenever she wants. Ideally she should not have any fear of the room so she won’t associate it with something scary.

, This time take your kitten into the bathroom with all her bath supplies and run the water. Allow the tub to fill up an inch or two and then stop the water. Gently place your kitten into the water so her feet get wet. While she’s in the water, praise her and pet her gently. If she’s able to stand in the water without struggling, give her some treats.If she struggles, don’t give her treats, instead try this step again the next day.
When you take her out of the water, regardless of whether she struggles, wrap her in a towel and cuddle her.
Repeat this step until your kitten doesn’t struggle while in the water.

, Teach her how wonderful it is to get washed with a washcloth. Bring her into the bathroom with all her bath supplies. Fill the tub 1-3 inches and place your kitten in the water. Wet a washcloth and gently wipe your kitten all over her body. Keep eye contact with her while you’re washing her, and praise her in a calm and gentle voice. If she doesn’t struggle, give her treats.If your kitten struggles during this step, don’t give her any treats, just talk to her and praise her.
Repeat this step until your kitten is able to receive a full wash without any struggling. When she doesn’t struggle, give her treats as a reward.
When you’re done washing your kitten, take her out of the water, wrap her in a towel, and cuddle with her.

, Take your kitten into the bathroom with all her bath supplies. Fill the tub and place your kitten in the water.

If your cat dislikes claw trimming, do so a few days ahead of the bathing process. This dissociates the two events for the cat.;
, Get your towel(s), pet shampoo, a container of treats, petroleum jelly or cotton balls for its ears, a comb and brush, and anything else required for the bathing. Put items in a convenient location so that you can handle the cat in the tub or sink and still reach them.If you are bathing for fleas, a comb can help remove the stunned fleas from the cat’s coat without intensive searching. Be sure to use a shampoo specifically for flea treatment.
Having a small cup on hand can be helpful for initially wetting the cat’s coat and rinsing, especially with long-haired cats.
Many pet stores carry products that are formulated to relax cats via pleasant scents. Consider scenting the bathing room with this type of product to create added calm.

, Fill the tub or sink with warm (not hot) water. Be sure that it will come up no higher than the cat’s belly.


Remember that your cat is an animal with strong instincts. You want enough water to wash but not so much that the cat might fear drowning and panic.

, It may be easier to lure the cat with a toy or treat, as this will seem less suspicious. You can also simply pick up the cat and bring it to the room where it will be bathed. Close the door behind you if that is an option.


Bathrooms with a tub are ideal for adult cat bathing because they are small, with few places to hide, and usually have a door that can be closed, keeping the cat from running away if it becomes distressed.
If you have back problems that prevent you from leaning into a bathtub, consider bathing your cat in the kitchen sink. It may also be helpful to have another person on hand to help keep the cat still during bathing.

, Your cat may be stressed and paranoid because of the water, being closed in a room, or other unfamiliar sensations. Reassure the cat by petting and talking to the cat in soothing tones. Calm the cat as much as possible. Sit in the room with the water, letting the cat sniff the water and/or become adjusted to its location.


This is also a good time to insert cotton balls or, if your cat is resistant, put a layer of petroleum jelly on the area surrounding the opening of the cat’s ears. Just a little will do, on the area where the fur in thin, just outside the ear opening. Either the cotton balls or the petroleum jelly will ensure no water gets in the ear.If experience or suspicion indicates that your cat is a struggler, consider putting it in a cat harness for bathing. While this can add to discomfort and stress, it is better to have the harness to grab onto than letting a panicked cat break free and create a predator-prey association when you go to return it to the bath., Grasp the cat by the nape of its neck, using the loose skin between its head and shoulders. Pick it up gently, scooping the hind legs with your other hand, reminding the cat that it is secure and stable. Slowly lower the cat into the sink or tub, removing your hand from its lower half but keeping your hand on its nape.


Grasping the cat’s nape (called “scruffing”) is useful is a form of restraint if the cat is struggling. This is the way their mother used to grasp them when she wanted to restrain or carry them and cats of any age respond instinctually by curling up and/or going limp. Scruff only when needed, using other mild forms of restraint if the cat is not fighting you. For some cats, they are calmer and more secure if the owner sits in the tub with them during the bath. This should only be done if you know the cat will not use force to get away from you.

, Keeping one hand free to restrain the cat, use a small cup to scoop water onto the cat’s coat wetting the entire body except the head.


If you have a tub with a removable showerhead or a sink with a sprayer tool, you can use this to wet the cat’s coat.
It is important not to get water in the cat’s ears as this can cause ear infections.
To wet the cat’s head, tilt the head up. Placing the cup, showerhead, or sprayer between the cat’s ears, pour or spray water so that the run off only falls behind the cat’s head.
You should not have to wet the whole head, just the top and the back of the neck. If you want to clean the face around the mouth and eye areas, use a wet wash cloth.

, Use the hand not restraining the cat to drizzle a small amount of shampoo onto the cat’s coat. Set the shampoo bottle in an easy to reach location, and proceed to work the shampoo into the cat’s coat. Add more shampoo if needed.If you must clean the cat’s face, add a few drops of shampoo to a wet washcloth and gently wash the face, using a stroking motion that goes along with the grain of the hair.
If you are bathing the cat for fleas, you’ll want to work the shampoo into the body fur first, making sure to include the tummy, then shampoo the cat’s tail, legs and head. When they sense a threat like water, fleas instinctually migrate to the cat’s extremities. When you shampoo the body first, you ensure that, if the fleas attempt to return to the cat’s body fur, they are exposed to the shampoo and are stunned

, Drain the tub with the cat still inside. Using the showerhead, sprayer, or cup, rinse the coat using the same technique described for wetting the coat. Make sure that there is no residue of soap in the cat’s coat, as this can actually attract dirt once the cat is dry.


If rising with a cup, turn the faucet on lightly so that it produces a very small stream (this is to avoid panicking the cat with a full-blast gush of water). Leave the water running. Now fill the cup with water and pour it over the cat, repeating until the coat is free of soapy residue.

, If flea removal is the goal of the bath, after rinsing the fur, begin by running the comb from neck to the base of the tail, then combing the sides from the shoulder to the back leg. This creates grooves in the cat’s coat and make it easier to spot fleas. If using a flea comb, it will also help remove fleas and eggs.The comb may remove some fleas, but you can use your fingers to remove any other fleas you notice.
If your cat is lightly colored, you can easily see fleas stuck in the wet fur. You can also feel for fleas in the coat, as larger fleas present small, seed-like lumps.
Work over the cat’s coat methodically, attempting to remove as many fleas as possible. Also, don’t forget to check the cat’s tummy, as this is a favorite hiding spot.

, Once you’ve completed bathing and rinsing, you’ll begin the drying process by gently squeezing as much water as you can from the cat’s coat, focusing on the tail, legs, and feet.With the hand not restraining the cat, form a “U” shape. Settle the u-shape over the cat’s shoulders.
Apply gentle pressure while pulling it from the cat’s shoulders to hips. You’ll notice this pushing water down and away from the top of the back.
Gently grasp the tail and, with gentle pressure, pull your hand from base to tip. You should see water running off the cat into the tub. Do this to the legs and feet as well, squeezing the paw lightly to free water from the thicker fur around the toes.
Repeat this process a few times, being sure to also gently squeeze the fur around the tummy.

, Once you’ve removed as much water as possible from the cat, use the hand not restraining the cat to spread a towel out on the floor. Pick the cat up, remembering to support the back legs with the hand not scruffing it, lifting it from the tub or sink, and gently lowering it onto the towel.
Use the hand not restraining the cat to gently fold the towel over and around the cat until it is partially covered. Use the same hand to gently rub the towel over the cat’s body in a back and forth motion. You’ll want to rub as much of the body as possible. If the cat doesn’t seem inclined to run, you can use both hands.
Use a second towel if needed, continuing to rub the coat until it is semi-dry and fuzzy. Afterwards, use a comb to flatten the fur, being sure to comb in the direction that the fur typically lays. At this point, the cat can be given treats, reassured with pets and verbal soothing, calmed, then released and left to groom itself.

, It is recommended that you do a brief, preliminary dry with a towel before using the hairdryer. Additionally, you should only use the hairdryer if you believe the cat will not panic because of the noise it produces.Unwrap the cat from the towel, but leave it sitting on it. Be sure to restrain it if it seems likely to run.
With the hand not restraining the cat, grasp the handle of the hair dryer and put it on its lowest heat setting and speed. Turn it on, being sure to let the cat get used to the noise before using it. If the cat panics and cannot be calmed, turn off the dryer and continue to dry with the towel.
If the cat accepts the hairdryer noise, turn the dryer so that the cat can feel the air coming from it. If the cat continues to remain calm, bring the hair dryer closer and begin drying, using a back and forth shaking motion with the dryer to make sure that the heat and air is dispersed and not too focused.
If the cat seems calm, you can increase the drying speed and also re-situate it so that the cat is held between your upper legs, facing your feet, using one hand to dry the cat with the dryer and the other hand to fluff the fur while drying. If the cat will tolerate it without struggling, this expedites the drying process significantly.Dry the cat until the coat is mostly dry and fluffy. The legs and tail may still be slightly wet, but these will dry quickly once the cat is allowed to begin grooming.

, Your cat has just been through a completely unnatural experience and is probably exhausted, a little skittish, and may even believe the bath was a punishment. Remind the cat that you are its friend and that it is not in trouble by offering it some of its favorite treat.


Post-bath grooming for your cat means that it may ingest a good deal of hair. Consider treating your cat with specially formulated “hairball treats.” These contain a greater amount of fat or fish oil, which will stick to the fur in the cat’s stomach, helping the fur pass through the digestive system and preventing hairballs.

, While treating it, pat and stroke the cat gently, talking and telling it what a good kitty it is, reassuring it that everything is back to normal and that it doesn’t need to be afraid.


If your cat is a fan of being brushed, begin the grooming process by using its favorite brush to start removing hair that has been released due to stress and bathing.

, Don’t release the cat until its body language tells you it has relaxed and is not afraid. Look for signs like tail lifting, purring, closing or partially closing the eyes, bunting (nuzzling its head against your hands or body), or any other signs you recognize as indicating your cat is happy.


When the cat body emotes calm energy, release it. It will likely find a comfy, out of the way spot to begin its own grooming process. Give it a few hours to groom, nap, and feel normal again. Let it come find you when it’s ready for interaction.

, If you own the cat as a kitten, start bathing it as soon as possible. It is much easier to restrain a tiny kitten as opposed to a mature cat. Also, kittens are very responsive to being scruffed, and doing so reinforces the activity for future interactions.


Wait until it is at least 6 weeks old before bathing, as any earlier could lead to illness or other health complications.
For small kittens, begin bathing in the bathroom sink. This is shallow and a better fit, size-wise. It also enables you to rinse easily using the faucet, normalizing the sound and sensation of running water.
Consider bathing and drying the kitten once every 2 weeks for 3 months. This avoids complication of over-bathing (like dry skin) while also normalizing the bath process as a part of grooming.

, Never use bathing or hair dryers as a punishment for cats and avoid any event or form of interaction that might give the cat a negative experience with your bathroom or sink, depending on where bathing will occur.


This includes not using the bathroom for cat time-out when negative behavior occurs.

, Part of demystifying the bathing process for a cat and making it less stressful is letting your cat become accustomed to the noises, smells, and sensations of the process.When you are showering or drying your hair, give your cat access to the space(s) where these activities take place. Cats are very curious of novel experiences and will probably invite themselves into these rooms to investigate what is going on.
Ignore the cat as you go about your routine. Cats are independent by nature and it can be helpful to let the cat elect into these experiences of their own free will and normalize these sounds and sensations, independent of human influence.

, Before showering or drying your hair, consider leaving treats or a favorite toy in the room within sight of bathing or hair drying. This can entice the cat to come into the room and create positive feelings around doing so.


Avoid offering the cat toys or treats directly as, when combined with the sounds and smells of running water and hair drying, this can be overwhelming and might inadvertently be interpreted as threatening to a stressed cat. Remember, you want to ignore the cat while it’s learning to process these new experiences.
Reassure the cat. When the cat is comfortable with the noises, it may signify it is approachable by relaxing its body language, resting in or near the room where the noises are happening, or spending time in the bathroom with you while you are bathing or drying your hair. Some cats become comfortable enough to actually get in the shower with their owner. When the cat demonstrates it has normalized bathing and hair drying, praise it.Preempt the drying process by rubbing your cat with a towel as part of play. Some cats enjoy being covered or creating fabric “caves” as a part of play, and will take to the towel readily. Others may need a bit of coaxing, but try to familiarize the drying process by putting toys under the towel or putting you hand under the towel and moving it, simulating a small animal the cat might like to hunt. Encourage the cat to get under the towel while playing, normalizing the smell, feel and experience of interacting with the towel.

, Get family members involved in the effort to familiarize bathing and drying with the cat. If you are bathing a cat for the first time, consider having a family member or friend the cat knows on hand to help with the process and ensure it goes smoothly.

Get your cat accustomed to brushing.,
Talk and cuddle your cat as you brush.,
Choose the right tools.,
Deal with matted patches.",How to Make a Homemade Cat Spa2," Start when she is happy — perhaps after eating. Even though cats do a lot of washing themselves, brushing often takes some time to get used to. Start by letting her inspect the grooming brush and try to brush her for about five minutes.

, Keep your cat happy and entertained as you brush him. Start a regular brushing routine so that your cat knows what is coming and begins to look forward to it. At the beginning you might even want to give your cat a treat for doing a good job while you were brushing.

, Short-haired cats and long-haired cats have different needs when it comes to their care. Always brush in the direction the hair is growing. Be sure to clean out the brush after each use — and especially if you have multiple cats that use the same brush.Short-haired cats need a fine-toothed metal comb for the initial brushing, followed by a soft rubber brush to get out the loose hair.
Long-haired cats initially need a wide-toothed comb to get out the tangles and any dirt that might have gotten stuck in their hair. Work very carefully to get the knots out. Then use a wire brush to get out the loose hair. Some people suggest using a toothbrush around the face as the final step.

, Long-haired cats can easily get tangles in their hair which are often difficult to remove. Make sure your cat is in a very good mood before beginning to work on the knots. Using a wide-toothed comb, work at the edge of the tangle, closest to the end of the hair. Keep picking gently at the tangle with the comb — do not tear at it. It will eventually come out, even if it might take a few sessions to get it out entirely.

Focus on your cat’s eyes.,
Trim hair.,
Clean your cat’s ears.",How to Make a Homemade Cat Spa3," Check that they look healthy — they should be clear, with the area around the iris a bright white. Using a damp cotton ball, wipe away any of the dirt that collects at the edges of your cat’s eyes.Use a separate piece of cotton wool for each eye.

, Some cats get hairs on their faces that are so long that they can poke your cat in the eye or get in the way of his vision. This can especially be a problem for long-haired cats. Brush any hair on the facial area with a toothbrush, not a wire comb or brush.

, Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation of a good ear cleaner you can buy at the pet store. Be aware that some of the ear cleaners sold in pet stores are not suitable for use in cats, so make sure you talk to the vet first. Put a drop of the cleaner onto a cotton ball or piece of gauze.Fold your cat’s ear back and gently rub away the dirt and earwax that has gathered there.
Do not rub at the ear — just dab and lift with the cotton ball or gauze.
Be sure to stay away from the ear canal — it is sensitive and trying to clean it can easily cause infection.

Avoid restraining your cat if possible.,
Keep calm and talk softly.,
Distract your cat with treats.,
Pick times for a bath when your cat is sleepy.,
Brush your cat before her bath.,
Be prepared for the song of her people.,
Dry your cat off and keep her in a warm place.",How to Help Your Cat Enjoy Having a Bath2," Cats hate being restrained. If your cat feels restrained in the bath, she'll probably try to resist and struggle. Avoid any type of restraint in the bath. Allow her to feel like she’s in control of her movements.One way to restrain your cat without actually restraining her is to use your hand to block her movement in certain directions. You can do this without actually touching your cat.

, Your cat can feed off your emotions — if you’re panicking, she'll probably start to panic. If you’re calm, there’s a better chance she’ll be calm too. No matter what your cat is doing in the bath, or how scared she gets, stay calm. Don’t yell or raise your voice. Don’t freak out or panic. Talk to your cat the whole time in a soft and gentle voice, like you were talking to a baby., Throughout the whole process of giving your cat a bath, give her treats. For example, once you’ve closed the door and you’re filling the tub, reward her for being a good kitty. When you place her in the water, reward her for being a good kitty. If your cat loves treats, they might distract her enough to reduce her stress in the bath., Since she’s a cat and sleeps 18 hours a day, finding a time when she’s sleepy shouldn’t be too hard. If her sleepy time doesn’t correspond to a good time to give her a bath, have a high energy play session so she gets tired. Having an intense play session before the bath may be necessary for a kitten, as they’re almost always frisky., Before you put your cat in the tub, give her a good brushing. You want to get as much of the loose and shedding fur off of her before she’s in the water. Besides making the water dirty, it can also clog your drains. If your cat loves to be brushed, as many cats do, this brushing will help to calm her down and prepare her for the bath., Once it’s bath time, be prepared for your cat to meow, howl, and yowl. She might even hiss and growl at you as well. Do not panic! Cats like to vocalize their distaste and just because she sounds like she’s being tortured doesn’t mean she’s actually in any pain. Talk to your cat in a calm and gentle voice while she’s in the bath. Don’t make any sudden movements that may startle her., When the bath is done, you still need to work to keep your cat calm. While your cat is still in the tub or sink, use your hand(s) to wipe off as much excess water as you can from her fur. This is especially important for her legs and tail. Once that’s done, take her out of the tub or sink and wrap her in a warm towel. Use your hands and the towel to dry your cat as much as you can. If your cat is brave, you can even use a blow dryer — on the lowest setting of course.Even if you wipe off excess water before taking your cat out of the tub or sink, she’ll still be quite wet. You’ll probably need to use a second towel right away as the first one will be soaked quickly.
Until your cat’s fur is completely dry, keep her someplace warm (and clean).
If you have a long-haired cat, you’ll also want to brush her fur with a comb to remove any tangles.
Your cat will start to lick herself the minute she’s able to reach her fur. And she’ll continue to lick herself until she’s almost dry. This is completely normal.

Brush your cat’s coat using a firm-bristled brush.,
Understand that failure to groom your cat’s coat will result in knots and tangles.,
Undo knots and tangles in short-haired cats.,
Deal with knots and tangles in long-haired cats.,
Be very wary about cutting out knots.,
Take long-haired cats to a professional groomer if their coats are completely matted.,
Pay special attention to older cats.",How to Keep Your Cat Clean1," Long haired cats need daily grooming, while short-haired cats need to be combed and brushed roughly three to four times a week. Grooming helps to remove loose hair so that this ‘shed hair’ does not begin to form knots.


Grooming your cat regularly can also help you to find knots early so that they can be brushed out more easily.;
, To groom a cat, start by combing the cat’s fur. Use the same technique you would use to comb your own hair; make sure that the comb reaches down to the skin and is dragged along the length of your cat’s hair. Work methodically; perhaps start at the head and work your way to the tail, combing sections at a time. Make sure that you comb your cat’s hair in the direction that is grows naturally.


To determine what way your cat’s hair lies, run your hand along your cat’s back from her head to her tail. You should see that her hair smoothes down under your hand, which means that this is the way her hair grows. Now run your hand from her tail to her head; you should see that her hair sticks up, which means this is not the way the hair grows.
If you are gentle and do not tug on the hair, most cats tolerate or even enjoy being combed.

, Use a brush with firm bristles or short metal prongs to brush your cat’s hair. Again, work from the head down towards the tail, brushing the surface of the coat and gathering shed hair on the brush.


Don’t forget to brush your cat’s tummy as well.

, If your cat’s coat in not regularly groomed, both short and long haired cats can gets knots. Of these, short haired cats get knots that are easier to deal with.


The tangles are caused when dead hairs are not shed but retained in the coat. This chokes up the fur, which then felts together and form lumps. These lumps can be felt as knobbles, and may appear as dull, almost dusty looking patches.
Knots and tangles are completely avoidable with regular grooming.

, If your short-haired cat has clumps in her coat, these knots can usually be loosened, teased apart and then combed out.


To brush away the lump, start near the hair tips and pluck at the lump as if trying to divide it in two. Keep working away at the lump in this manner until the knot is no longer dense but has started to be teased open.
At this stage you may be able to pluck out clumps of dead hair. If not, use the comb to further separate the clumps and comb out the retained hair causing the knot.

, Long-haired cats generally develop more serious knots. Long-haired cats have fur that is soft, which causes the mats and knots that form to become more dense.


Small knots can sometimes be groomed out by inserting the comb between the skin and knot and pulling gently until the knot gives way and comes away from the skin on the comb.

, It is very easy to accidentally cut your cat’s skin when trying to cut out a knot because the skin often gets puckered up inside the knot. Never cut a knot unless you can slide the teeth of a comb between your cat’s skin and the knot, and then cut above the comb.


If you have access to clippers, use them rather than scissors. Run the clipper blade parallel to your cat’s skin, and make sure to never dig the clipper into the skin. If you are not sure what you are about to cut, stop.

, Some long-haired cats become so matted that their coat forms a cocoon like shell over their bodies. These cats need to be professionally clipped out by a groomer.


If your cat is aggressive or feisty, you may need to bring her to a vet to be sedated while the vet clips away all of her mats.

, Some older cats forget to groom themselves and their coats become starry and unkempt. It is essential that you comb and brush your old kitty every day to make sure that no knots develop.


If your old cat is not washing herself, get some cotton balls wet and wipe these water-logged cotton balls along your cat’s coat. Pay special attention to her face. This will keep your cat’s coat clean and fresh, and will help your old cat to feel better about herself.

This will help your cat get used to the spot and get more comfortable with grooming over time.;
, If your senior cat tends to fidget or move around when being groomed, use a towel to keep it calm. Wrap your cat in a towel by placing it in the center of the towel and wrapping each side around the cat like a cat burrito. This will keep your cat still and calm during grooming.You can then move the towel around as you groom your cat.

Say calming words to your cat as you pet it, such as “Good kitty” or “That’s a good kitty.”, If you have a long-haired cat, use a pin brush. If you have a short-haired cat, use a rubber curry brush. Do not use a brush that has sharp edges or sharp bristles. You do not want to scratch or irritate the delicate skin of your senior cat.You should also get a metal comb made for cats.

Do not pull or yank on the mats, as this can injure your cat.For mats that are hard to get out, try applying a small amount of cornstarch to the mat.

If mats and tangles on your cat’s coat are too hard for you to get out on your own, consider bringing your cat to a professional groomer. The groomer will need to use cat-safe hair clippers to remove the mats.

, Once you have brushed your cat fully, give your cat a treat to end the brushing session. End every brushing session with a treat so your cat feels positive about getting brushed.

, Most cats do not like getting wet and you will need to work fast when bathing your cat. Start by filling your bathtub, or a large plastic bin, with warm water. Only fill the tub or bin with enough water to cover your cat to its belly. Have the water ready before you bring your cat in for the bath.Always brush your cat before you bathe it. Get out any knots or mats before the bath, as it will be much harder to get them out while the cat is wet.

, Use reassuring, calming words as you do this. Some cats may not like getting wet and will howl or hiss when you put them in the water. This is normal. Pet your cat and say things like “Good kitty” or “Let’s be calm now” as you lower it into the water.If you are worried about water getting into your cat’s ears, you can put cotton balls in their ears.
If you are bathing your cat in a bathroom or a room with a door, close the door before you put them in the water. That way, it cannot run out of the room while you are trying to bath it.

, Dip a clean cloth in the water and gently wet your cat’s fur on her body and chest. Do not pour water on your cat’s head or wet her head right away. You can also use a cup to gently pour water onto your cat’s body and chest. Work slowly and carefully, wetting your cat’s fur., Once your cat is wet, use shampoo made for cats on its coat. Gently rub the shampoo into your cat’s fur. Be careful when lathering around your cat’s ears, eyes, and mouth. Work quickly to lather your cat, as it will likely not be a fan of this part of the bathing session., You can use a detachable showerhead to do this or a cup.

Buy them in any pet supply store. Because Persians are large cats, you might have to buy slightly larger clippers. Ask a staff member for assistance.


Never use scissors or anything with a straight blade. This can be extremely uncomfortable, if not painful.;
, Opt for a time when your cat is calm and relaxed. Right after a meal or before a nap is usually a good choice. Make sure the room is quiet without any distractions, such as a view of the bird feeder. If you share your home with other animals, close the door so that they can't enter., Hold your cat's paw in your hand. Do this slowly and gently. Start massaging it for one to three seconds. If your cat pulls away, don't fight them. Keep a gentle hold of the paw while allowing your cat to guide the motion. After they calm down, massage toe and give it a gentle squeeze. You will see a claw emerge. Give your cat a treat for their cooperation. Practice this on a different toe every other day until your cat gets used to it.


Get your cat used to the sound of clippers by practicing on an uncooked piece of pasta. Sit near your cat, put the noodle in the clippers, and trim it. Let your cat sniff the clippers if they want.
Get to the point where you can massage and gently squeeze the toe while you clip the pasta. Always reward your cat with a treat after each practice session., Only clip the white part of the nail. The pink area is the quick, which contains blood vessels and nerves. Always stay away from this part of the claw. If you clip it, you can cause your cat a great deal of pain and put them at risk for an infection.


Keep styptic powder within reach in case you do cut the quick. It will stop the bleeding and dull the pain.Apply it to a moistened cotton ball and hold it against the wound for 5 to 10 seconds. Buy it in any pet supply store.

, Massage each toe until the claw emerges. Clip only the white part of the claw. If your cat seems unfazed, proceed to the next claw. Don't forget the treat after each clipping session!, This is especially helpful if your cat isn't used to having their nails clipped. Schedule clippings based on your cat's preferences. You could clip the front paws one day and the back paws the next. Alternatively, you could focus on a different paw each day., Use a wide-toothed metal comb. Start at the back of your cat's head and work your way to the tail. Pay attention to the armpits and the belly, where hair gets tangled easily. Move the comb with the grain of the hair. Use quick, yet gentle, strokes. This will remove excess fur and help you to detect matting.Use caution if you decide to comb against the grain. It might help to remove the undercoat more efficiently, but it can also cause your cat great discomfort. Do this only if they don't seem to mind it. Otherwise, comb only with the grain.

, Use a fine-toothed metal comb. Comb with the grain of the hair. Be careful to avoid your cat's eyes, nose, and ears. Avoid nylon combs, which can generate static electricity and literally shock your cat., Avoid pulling on tangled hair. If you find a mat, start combing in downward strokes at the bottom. Gradually work your way up as you detangle the area beneath it. If the metal comb doesn't work, try using a mat splitter, which you can buy in any pet supply store., Use a brush with steel bristles to thin out the undercoat, which leaves the topcoat healthy. Start at the head and gradually move toward the tail. Move with the grain of the fur. Keep brushing your cat until the undercoat is gone. Usually you can figure this out by how much fur is on brush.Check the brush after a few strokes. Remove the hair from the bristles and continue brushing. Keep doing this until you pick up little to no hair. When there is hardly any fur on the brush, the undercoat is removed. Remove the undercoat every three weeks.

, You'll need this for brushing around your cat's eyes. Sometimes Persians get a buildup of eye secretions that can affect their field of vision. A toothbrush with soft bristles will allow you to sweep away the buildup without harming your cat's eyelids. Use quick, gentle strokes. Brush away from the eyes., Persians often get feces stuck in their fur. This makes them prone to infections. Cut the fur around the back area of the legs near the anus. Repeat this process every 3 weeks.


Avoid using scissors, which can pose a stabbing hazard., Persian cats' fur tends to get greasy, but frequent baths can remedy that. If your cat is young, start with two baths a month to get them used to the process. Afterward, depending on how oily their coat gets, you could cut back to once a month., If you buy a clear shampoo for a dark-haired cat, you'll end up lightening their fur. Dark shampoos will darken the fur of a light-haired cat. When the shampoo and fur colors match, it will enrich the color of your cat's coat. Stick to shampoos specially formulated for cats, which you can buy in your local pet supply store.


If you have a multi-colored cat, buy a shampoo that matches the dominant color in their coat. For example, you should buy a brown shampoo for a calico whose fur is mostly brown with smaller black and white patches.Make sure the shampoo is a tearless formula so that it won't irritate your cat's eyes when you wash their face., Run warm water so that you don't burn or shock your cat. Turn off the tap when the water level reaches about 4 inches (10 cm). Just use water at this point. Don't worry about shampoo, conditioner, or degreaser just yet., This is especially important if you don't know how your cat will react to getting wet. As you wet your cat's tail, watch their reaction. If they don't seem to mind, continue to wet more of their fur.If they put up a fuss, remain calm and talk to them in a soothing voice. Pet them as you wet their fur. Hold them firmly, but be careful not to hurt them.Don't panic or get angry if your cat bites you, scratches you, or runs off. Let them stew in their anger. You can always try again tomorrow.
It might take a while to get your cat completely wet. This is perfectly normal with thick and/or coarse hair.

, Don't spray water directly into your cat's mouth, nose, or eyes. Place large cotton balls at the opening of your cat's ears. This will prevent water from getting into the ear canal., Use an organic degreaser to remove excess oils from your cat's fur. Follow the instructions on the label to prevent any irritation to your cat's skin. Dilute the substance, if necessary. Then, apply it to your cat's fur. Add water, bring it to a lather, and rinse thoroughly. You can buy degreaser in pet supply stores., This involves letting the water float the coat hair up. When this happens, it penetrates the undercoat to ensure all the shampoo is rinsed out. Gently urge your cat to place their body (except their head) under the water. Hold them in place for a minute or two. Repeat this step after shampooing and conditioning, as well., Work the shampoo into your cat's fur. Keep it away from your cat's face to prevent irritation. Lather up the shampoo and rinse completely., Use an ear cleaner made for pets. Do NOT use shampoo. Apply the ear rinse to the ear. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes. If you cat shakes it out, that's okay. Take a cotton ball and gently wipe the inside of the ears to remove wax and debris. Clean only the area that you can see.


Never stick a cotton swab deep into the ear. If you need to have your cats ears cleaned more deeply, contact your vet., This will give the fur a healthy soft texture and make de-matting easier. Use a product specially formulated for Persian cats. Work the conditioner into the fur. Keep the conditioner away from the face. Rinse until the conditioner is completely washed out of the fur., Use a thick, absorbing towel to soak up as much water as possible. Make sure the towel is large enough for the cat's entire body. Wrap the towel completely around their body, as if you were swaddling them. Run your hands up and down your swaddled cat to quicken the absorption process., Most cats are sensitive to loud noises. If your cats hides when you vacuum, they might not like this step. Start at the tail if you've never used a hair dryer on them before. This way, they can run away without scratching you. If they don't seem to mind, gradually move the blow dryer up their body. Dry the fur as you would your own hair until it's completely dry.Always use a warm or medium setting. Hot or high can frighten your cat or burn their skin.If you can get someone to help you, have them hold the blow dryer while you comb your cat's hair. This will speed the drying process and prevent new mats from forming."

Use your fingers to loosen the mat.,
Hold the base of your cat’s hair with your fingers.",How to Handle Matting in Your Cat's Coat1," Work the talcum powder into the mat with your fingers. The talcum powder will help loosen the mat. You can purchase talcum powder from your local pharmacy or grocery store.Alternatively, you can spray a detangler or an anti-static spray onto the mat to loosen it. You can find these at your local pet store or online.;
, Gently pull any loose hair away from the mat with your fingers. Break the mat apart as much as you can without using a comb. Do this until only the core of the mat remains., Starting at the end of the mat, i.e., the tip of your cat’s hair, begin to gently comb the mat. Use a wide-toothed metal comb or a specially-made mat comb (also called a razor comb or mat rake) to work through it. As it breaks apart, slowly work your way deeper into your cat’s fur until the whole mat is removed.Use short, fast strokes to remove the mat. Do not yank or pull too hard.
If you are using a wide-toothed comb, use the tip of the comb as a pick to work your way through the mat.

Begin cutting.,
Reward your cat.",How to Make a Homemade Cat Spa4," If you’ve never done it before, it’s a good idea to observe someone else do it first. Ask at the veterinarian's office if you can watch someone. For some cats, a scratching post will be enough work for their nails that you don’t need to clip them. For most cats, however, nail clipping is an essential part of their grooming and care. Make sure your cat is in a happy and even sleepy mood before beginning. Cuddle and scratch your cat to get her ready. Some cats dislike getting their nails cut and might need to be wrapped in a towel so that you can complete the task., Cats need clippers specific to felines, available at pet stores. You might want to put a drop of baby oil on the nail so that you can see its length better. You don’t want to cut it too close to the quick, which will bleed if cut., Holding onto one paw, place your index finger on the pad on the bottom of the paw connected to the nail you want to clip. Put your thumb on top of the same area. By gently pushing with your index finger and thumb, the nail will come out (they typically retract in, so you need to get it out enough for you to cut it). Cut the nail just above the pink area (called the dermis or quick).

, For a job well done, give your cat a treat or toy. Play with your cat to reinforce good behavior. Try to start clipping his nails when he is young so that he gets used to it early and it becomes normal.

Dry your cat.",How to Make a Homemade Cat Spa5," Some cats love water, but many are actively resistant to baths. Luckily, most cats can keep themselves generally clean with their tongue, but sometimes it does become necessary to give a bath — particularly if she has gotten into something smelly or sticky. Bathing your cat should be the last step at your cat spa. Brush and trim nails before putting your cat in the bath. If your cat enjoys the water, a bath can be a real treat. Fill your tub with 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) of warm water. Put in a rubber bath mat so your cat doesn't slip., Always use shampoo specifically for cats, because other shampoos can have toxic oils.

Make sure you never spray or dump the water directly in your cat’s face. It shouldn’t get in the eyes, ears, or nose, so be careful., Make sure the door to the room where you will be washing the cat is closed. You don’t want to have to chase a wet cat around the house. You also might want to put down a few big towels in the room in case the cat escapes or is particularly agitated in the tub. Have your supplies at hand — shampoo, pitcher, washcloth, or towel — whatever you have decided to use. Carefully pick up your cat and put him in the tub., Soak your cat from the neck down in water using your sprayer, pitcher, or washcloth. Keep at least one hand on your cat at all times to prevent escape. Put a little shampoo on your hand or the washcloth and rub it through your cat's fur, starting at the neck and massaging through to the tail.

, Using your sprayer, pitcher, or washcloth, make sure to get all of the shampoo out. With clean water on a clean washcloth, gently wash your cat’s face, making sure not to get near the eyes, ears, or mouth., Get your cat out of the bath with a large towel wrapped around her. Pat your cat dry. Give your cat a treat for behaving so well.

, Make sure that the brush is a thin and strong brush. The bristles should be flexible but strong, and they should be fine in width.

, If the brush has your scent on it, your cat will calm down. An added benefit of doing this is that you can check that it is not too hard for use.

, If the cat does not try to bite the comb, proceed to the next step, if it does attack the comb, leave it be and try again the next day. Repeat until your kitten or cat accepts the brush.

, Do not brush hard, it could hurt your kitten or cat. Run the brush down its back, and try to brush down its legs. It is easier to do this when your cat is laying down. Brush its legs, but not its paws.

Understand the importance of oral hygiene for your cat.,
Brush your cat’s teeth, optimally twice per day.,
Use a feline-friendly oral rinse.,
Feed your cat a tooth-healthy diet.",How to Keep Your Cat Clean2," Part of keeping a cat clean is paying attention to her dental hygiene. A cat with dirty teeth and a smelly breath spreads foul-smelling saliva over her coat as she grooms, which makes her coat smell bad.


Food debris, the minerals in food, and the pH of your cat's saliva all play a part in the formation of hard mineral deposits called tartar on the surface of your cat’s teeth. Tartar harbors bacteria and can cause gum inflammation. The latter can lead to gum recession and teeth loosening, which leads to dental pain that may keep your cat from grooming herself properly.

, Just as we brush our teeth twice a day, cat’s should also have their teeth brushed twice a day. Special cat-sized toothbrushes are available, but you can also use a soft child-sized toothbrush. To brush your cat’s teeth:


Moisten the bristles of the toothbrush with water and, with the cat sitting on a table or a surface that is a comfortable height to work at, lift her lip with your left hand (if you are right handed).
Hold the toothbrush in your right hand and gently rub the toothbrush bristles over the outside surface of your cat’s teeth, and repeat on the other side.

, After brushing your cat’s teeth, use a special cat oral-cleansing rinse such as Hexarinse. This is a liquid that contains chlorhexidine, which kills bacteria for 12 hours. Use a cotton bud to apply this oral rinse. To use the rinse:


Soak a clean cotton bud in the oral rinse and then rub it over your cat’s teeth and gums. Try to do this after every time you brush your cat’s teeth.

, Feed your cat dry food rather than wet food if possible. Wet food contains humectants, which stop food from drying out but can also make it sticky. Wet food tends to bind to cat teeth and form deposits that can lead to food decay. On the other hand, dry kibble rubs against your cat’s teeth as she chews, helping to scrape tartar off of your cat’s teeth.


You could also buy your cat food that is specifically designed to promote dental health. One example of this sort of food is Hills T/D. T/D is made so that the fibers in the kibble are aligned in a grid. When your cat bites down on each biscuit, the tooth crown forces through the fiber grid and moves out again, in an action that mimics tooth brushing.

Wipe away any discharge from the corner of your cat’s eyes.,
Check your cat's ears regularly.,
Keep an eye out for any signs of infection.,
Wipe away any brown, waxy discharge with a cotton ball dipped in olive oil.",How to Keep Your Cat Clean3," You might have noticed cats with white faces that have rust-colored streaks running from the inside corner of their eyes, down over their cheeks. This is rusty streak is caused by tear overflow, which is a common problem for cats with watery eyes or narrow tear ducts. The tear fluid contains pigments called porphyrins and when exposed to the air, these pigments oxidize and turn rusty brown (it is the same process by which an apple when cut in half turns brown).


To keep your cat's face clean and streak free, wipe any gloop that forms in the corner of her eyes as soon as you see it. If you wipe the gloop away before it oxidizes, there will be no problems with brown stains.

, The skin of the ear flap should not be sore and the entrance to the ear canal should be clean. Avoid putting fluid or drops into your cat’s ear canal itself unless instructed to do so by your vet. You should try to avoid this because some cats are sensitive to the effect of fluid on the eardrum.


Check to see that there is no dirt build up in your cat’s ears, or that the ears are discolored in anyway. Signs of ear infections are covered in the next step.

, If there is discharge at the entrance to the ear canal, give it a sniff. If the discharge smells offensive, especially if it is cream colored or green looking, your cat may have an ear infection.


If you see these signs, have your cat’s ears looked at by a veterinarian.

, If the discharge is brown and waxy, try wiping it away with a ball of cotton wool moistened with a few drops of olive oil. Work the cotton wool into the nooks and crannies of your cat’s ears to clean away as much of the muck as possible.


When you notice this waxy discharge, look to see if she shows any sign of irritation, like shaking her head or scratching at her ears. If you don’t see these signs, you cat may just produce a lot of earwax. However, if you do see these signs, bring your cat to the vet for a check-up.

You may need to brush the cat in short bursts throughout the day, picking times when the cat seems content, to get the cat all the way brushed.You may get away with brushing every few days if your cat isn't prone to mats.;
, Your cat should be somewhere solid. A table or the floor is fine, but an elevated surface works better.You can also use a couch or the bed. Also, be sure your cat is calm. You can help the process along by petting the cat and speaking calmly to it. Scratch the cat in the good places it likes to make sure it's content before you begin., For a long-haired cat, the best tools are a wire brush, undercoat combs, and a flea comb.You can also use wide-tooth combs, if that's all you have, which can help especially when your cat is losing hair due to seasonal shedding.Undercoat combs have both long and short teeth. They are best for loosening hair in the undercoat. You'll need to start with a less fine undercoat comb and move to a finer one before using a flea comb.

, If the cat's fur is particularly bad, you'll need to start with the brush or wide-tooth comb first to get the major tangles out of the way first. Once you've worked through that, you can move down to an undercoat comb. Next, you can move to a finer undercoat comb, and then to the flea comb.You want to start with wider-toothed combs and brushes first because you won't be able to get a fine flea comb through the coat the first time.
If your cat's fur isn't too tangled, you may be able to start with a less fine undercoat comb.
Use the finer combs on the cat's head and legs.

, You probably won't have to hold the cat down in this position. Groom the back of the cat thoroughly, starting at the head and working down to the tail.

, After you've groomed the cat's back, turn it over so that it is laying on its back with its belly exposed. Lay it slightly on one side, with one front leg closer to the table and one more in the air.


Make a ""V"" with your thumb and other fingers. Press down on the underside of the cat with the ""V"" somewhat towards the shoulder and head, pinning the cat's top half down. This helps keep the cat in place, as well as keeping it from biting you.
As you move to the underside back end, use your arm and elbow to hold the cat down, while you lift one leg with that same hand and brush between the legs., Brushing in varying directions, make sure you're getting down to the skin. If you're getting to the skin, you'll see the fur creating a ""line"" of skin where you're brushing the fur. You don't want to dig into the skin, but make sure you are getting the undercoat.With this type of brushing, start with the cat's back, then move on to the sides, and finally do the undersides. You'll start at the neck and work your way down to the tail.
Brush in even strokes, concentrating on areas with tangles. Try to work out any loose fur you see.

, Another option is brushing against the grain. You'll be brushing towards the cat's head. When you reach the head, gently comb it out. Make sure to get the chest and stomach, too. Also, separate the fur out on the tail by moving it to either side. That makes it easier to brush it out.Make sure to hit problem areas. For instance, long-hair cats may get mats under their arms or across their bellies.Also, be sure your getting down to the skin and focusing on tangled areas.

, A little bit of talcum powder can help you comb out knots. Sprinkle a tiny bit on top of the knot. After that, use your fingers first to pull the knot apart. Make sure you don't yank on it, as that hurts the cat. Once you've teased it apart, use a comb on it., Another way to get rid of mats is to hold the mat near the root. That prevents it from pulling on the cat's skin. Then use your comb or brush to tease it out a little a time. You should be able to comb through some mats this way., Another option is a mat splitter. You can find these at pet stores. Basically, the mat splitter cuts the mat up. When the mat is in pieces, it's easier to comb the mat out and pull out the tangles without hurting the cat.You can substitute a plastic letter opener in some cases, that kind that has an opening the letter goes into. A seam ripper may also work.

, If a tangle is particularly bad, you may need to cut it out. However, you need to be very, very careful with this method, as it is easy to nick the skin. Pull the tangle gently away from the skin. Make sure you can see where the skin is before you cut, and then gently cut as far away from the skin as you can get.You can also use a mat comb/razor comb for this process. It's a comb designed to cut mats as you brush the fur.If mats are truly bad, you'll need professional help. The cat may need to be shaved.

, Long-haired cats will get tangles and mats without regular bathing. Grease and loose hair both contribute. Plus, bathing and blow drying the cat helps prevent the hair from tangling. Therefore, bathing your long-haired cat regularly is a good idea.If you don't feel like you can bathe your cat yourself, take it to a groomer's that accepts cats.
Also, always brush your cat before you bathe it to make sure you remove any loose fur ahead of time., When you bathe a cat, you can be severely scratched. Many cats will fight back when being bathed. Therefore, it's best to trim the cat's nails before bath time, saving you from pain and blood. Plus, when your cat scratches you, its likely to get away, and you'll need to wrangle it in again.To trim claws, you can use a human nail clipper, but clippers made for cats may work a little better.
Try to hold the cat under your arm while lifting up each paw one at a time. You can also ask someone to hold the cat down for you. You may be able to work on the claws while a cat is standing on a table.
Hold the paw in your hand. Gently press on the back and front of the paw at each pad, causing the claw to extend. Clip off the end of the nail, making sure you don't get the quick, which is the pink vein running down the nail.
Trim as much as you can, starting with the front claws. You may need to go back for the rest later., Playing with your cat can wear it down, which can make bathing easier. Pick the cat's favorite toy, and keep it playing for a while until it looks tired. Once you've worn it out a bit, you can move on to bathing. That way, it will be more relaxed during the bath., The tub needs to have a rubber mat in it, to keep your cat from sliding around. You can use a sink instead, but you still need a rubber mat. It also needs 4 inches (10.2 cm) or so of warm water. In addition, place cotton balls (gently) in your cat's ears, which will keep them from getting wet., Using lukewarm water, pour water over your cat with a pitcher or cup. You can also use a spray nozzle. Make sure you aren't pouring it directly on your cat's head, as you don't want to go in the cat's eyes, nose, or ears. That will only upset the cat., Make sure to use a cat shampoo, as your shampoo may be drying to the cat's skin. Mix about 5 parts of water with 1 part shampoo, and rub it into your cat's fur. It's best to start at the top and move toward the tail. Once again, try not to get the soap in the cat's face., Once you've massaged the soap in, it's time to rinse it out. Use a cup or a spray hose to pour water over the cat. You need to make sure you get all the soap out because it will be itchy for the cat if you don't. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.For the cat's face, simply get a washcloth wet, and gently wipe it clean., If you leave the fur damp without combing it, the fur can develop very tangled mats that may need to be shaved out, much like wool does. Make sure to comb out the cat's fur while it's still damp, and then again once the fur has completely dried. That way, you prevent mats from forming after the bath., Start with a big towel, rubbing as much of the moisture off as possible. Try to work somewhere where there's not a draft, so your cat doesn't get cold. You can also use a blow dryer on the warm setting (the lowest setting before cool). The blow dryer can help prevent tangles, as it blows out the hair in every direction. However, your cat may not like the sound. If it doesn't, just get it as dry as possible with the towel., After such a terrible ordeal (for you and the cat!), your cat needs to be rewarded (and you may need to be, too). Give your cat lots of attention. A nice treat can help, too. Use anything the cat likes to tell it what a good job it did."

Lift the hair from the skin.,
Cut the edges of the mat.,
Use your fingers to detangle the rest of the mat.,
Take your cat to a professional groomer.",How to Handle Matting in Your Cat's Coat2," Use a comb to do this. By lifting the hair away from the skin, it will be easier to see where the fur stops and the skin begins. This way, you may reduce the risk of accidentally cutting or nipping your cat’s skin., While the hair is lifted with the comb, take a pair of scissors and cut the edges of the mat. To be safe, only cut the edges of the mat on the outside of the comb, i.e., the part of the mat that is farthest from your cat’s skin. Cutting the edges of the mat will loosen the mat, making it easier to detangle with your fingers or a comb.Never lie the scissors flat onto your cat’s fur and skin. By doing this, you may risk cutting your cat’s skin. Always use a comb to lift the mat away from your cat’s skin before cutting the edges of the mat.

, You can also use a wide-toothed comb or a mat comb to untangle the rest of the mat. If the mat will not come loose, then use the comb and scissors again to cut the edges of the mat. Resume untangling the mat with your fingers or a comb., In general, mats that are smaller than the tip of your thumb can be easily removed at home without professional help. However, if the mat is very large, tight, or close to your cat’s skin, then you may want to take your cat to a professional groomer to have it removed.Additionally, if your cat’s coat is covered in mats, then you should take it to a professional groomer or your veterinarian to have them removed. In severe cases, the professional may need to shave your cat.

Brush shorthaired cats once a week.,
Brush longhaired cats every two days.,
Check for mats in common areas.",How to Handle Matting in Your Cat's Coat3," Use a metal or rubber fine-toothed comb to remove dead hair, dirt, and oil from a shorthaired cat's coat. When brushing your cat, remember to brush in the direction of its hair growth. Also make sure to brush your cat’s whole body, from head to tail, including its abdomen and chest., Use long-toothed slicker brushes and combs to brush longhaired cats. Starting with your cat’s abdomen and legs, gently comb its fur upward toward its head. Also comb your cat’s neck fur upward toward its chin. However, comb the hair on the top side of the coat in the direction of the hair growth.In order to brush the tail, part the hair down the middle and carefully brush out the fur on both sides.

, When combing your cat, make sure to check areas where mats commonly occur. These areas are around the groin and abdomen, behind the ears, between the back legs, behind the front legs (its armpits), around the collar area, and along the back of the haunches."

You will need two different types of cat brushes, both of which can be purchased online or at a local pet supply store. You'll need a metallic comb for the first round of brushing. For the second round, you'll need a soft bristle or rubber brush.As Maine Coons are prone to matting, you'll need a sharp pair of scissors to cut out any unwanted mats that you can't brush out. You'll also need a fine-toothed comb to remove mats. You can use a regular comb for this process.
You may want to get a rubber mat or rug of some kind. Maine Coons have a lot of hair. It's a good idea to brush them on a washable surface to help remove any loose hairs after grooming.;
, If your cat is new, he may not be used to being groomed. Start slow if you've never brushed your Maine Coon before.


Grooming sessions should be fun. Wait for a moment when your cat seems relaxed and happy to start. Pet him for a little bit before you begin grooming in order to assure that he's calm going into the process.At first, keep your grooming sessions short. You may not be able to do a full grooming routine the first few times you brush your cat. Aim for 5 to 10 minutes of gentle brushing. If your cat seems distressed or upset, pause and pet him. Provide treats and other forms of positive reinforcement to keep the grooming routine fun., The Maine Coon's coat has two layers: an undercoat and an overcoat.Two rounds of brushing are best for the Maine Coon's appearance. Start with the metal comb.


Work from the head to tail. Go slowly, especially if your cat is distressed during the process. Move the comb gently as you do not want to puncture your cat's skin.Make sure to get the cat's belly and legs. Longhaired cats, like the Maine Coon, tend to get a long of tangles in these areas. Go slowly and be extra gentle when working knots out of these areas. Cats tend to dislike having their bellies and legs handled. If your cat is new to grooming, it may take a few practice grooming sessions before he'll be ready to let you groom these areas.Get your Maine Coon's tail as well. Make a part down the middle of the tail and then brush the fur on either side., Once you're done brushing with the metal brush, use the bristle or rubber brush to remove dead fur. Brush the fur in an upward motion, as this will help you address both layers of the Maine Coon's coat. Once again, be gentle as you go and go slowly over sensitive areas like the legs and stomach., Due to their long hair, Maine Coons are prone to matting. While the best course of action is to try to work out tangles when brushing, some mats will not come out this way. You'll need to cut them out. If your cat is skittish, consider enlisting a friend for help during this process. You should clip out mats whenever you encounter them. If you brush your Maine Coon weekly, you're less likely to encounter mats.


If you're working with a helper, have your helper pet and stroke the cat to keep him calm.Use your fine-toothed comb to create a barrier between the cat's skin and the mat. Be careful not the pull the cat's skin. A cat may become aggressive and squirm when hurt, making the process of clipping the mats more difficult.Clip out the mat quickly. Your cat will probably dislike having a comb stuck in him and may try to run away. Therefore, try to trim the mat swiftly. However, move slow enough that you maintain control of your scissors. You do not want to accidentally cut your cat's skin.If your cat starts to become aggressive, engaging in behavior like hissing and growing, take a break. You can clip out the rest of the mats later., While most cats do not need regular bathing, longhaired cats like the Maine Coon may benefit from baths every few months. Their longer fur is more susceptible to holding onto dirt and debris, especially if you allow your cat to go outside. Before you begin bathing your Maine Coon, get all your supplies laid out. Once you being the bathing process, you may not have time to pause and grab supplies.


Find someone to help you. Most cats, even well-trained cats, dislike bathing so you'll need a friend or family member to assist during this process.Find a high-quality cat shampoo. You can purchase cat shampoo online, at a local pet supplies shop, or at your veterinarian's office. If your cat has any specific health conditions that affect his skin or fur, ask your vet for a recommendation.
You will need towels to dry your cat, a cup or bucket for pouring water over him, and a rubber mat to place on the bottom of the bath tub. This prevents the cat from slipping., Fill the tub or sink about 3 to 4 inches full of water. Use a lukewarm temperature, neither too hot or too cold for your cat's comfort., Most cats will not climb willingly into water. You will likely have to pick him up and place him in the tub. Pet him and talk to him in a soft, gentle voice as you pick him up. If he squirms, have your helper assist you in holding him. Pet him as you ease him into the water. Try using treats for positive reinforcement.

, Once your cat is in the tub, you'll get his fur wet and then apply shampoo. Take your time during this process to make sure your cat is washed completely.


A Maine Coon's fur does not get get wet easily. Use your cups or buckets to pour water over your cat's body until he's damp. It may take awhile due to the thick nature of the fur.Once your cat is wet, apply shampoo. Add a small amount to your hands and gently massage the shampoo in until it lathers. Move from head to tail and do not neglect places like the stomach and legs. Go slowly around the face to avoid getting shampoo into your cat's eyes.Add more water as needed when you shampoo. You may find, during the process, you need a bit more water to get the shampoo to lather., Once your cat is shampooed, rinse him off. Use fresh, lukewarm water from the faucet. Your cat will likely be licking at his fur after the bath, so make sure all the shampoo is out. Keep rinsing until you no longer see suds or residue coming from your cat's fur. Make sure you remember to splash water on the stomach and legs as well. If you're unsure if a cat is fully rinsed, you can squeeze a small bit of fur and watch for suds., Once the rinsing process is done, allow your cat to climb out of the tub. Use a towel to dry him thoroughly. Wrap your cat up in a towel and rub his fur as dry as possible. Using a hairdryer is likely to startle your cat, so avoid this option. Once your cat is relatively dry, give him some space. Do not let him go outside until his fur has air dried completely., You can use regular nail clippers, a type of clipper modified to hold your cat's paw in place, or guillotine style clippers. Guillotine clippers work by inserting the claw into a small hold and then pushing the blade downward to make the cut. Your style of nail clipper depends on your personal preference. Choose a type of clipper you feel comfortable maneuvering. If you have a more skittish cat, you may want to get the modified clippers that will help hold his paw in place., Your cat may dislike having his claws clipped. Therefore, it's best to have a friend assist you. Ask a friend told hold your cat in place, pet him, and soothe him as you begin the process of trimming his claws.In the event you can't find someone to help you, you can try resting your cat in the crook of your arm while using your other hand to clip his claws. If your cat is more docile, you may be able to clip his claws on your own., Trim one paw at a time. Trim only a small amount of your cat's claws, taking off only the top tip.


Do one paw at a time. Gently squeeze your cat's paw between your thumb and index finger so his claws extend. Then, begin trimming.There is a small pink portion on your cat's nail. This is called the quick. You should not trim into the quick as it's very sensitive and will bleed if cut. As you trim your cat's nails, stay well above the quick.In the event you accidentally trim the quick, dip the cat's claw in a bit of cornstarch or styptic powder. Then, rub the claw against a dry bar of soap., If you've never trimmed your Maine Coon's nails before, you might have to do more than one trimming session. If your cat gets aggravated and begins squirming, growling, or hissing, it's best to let him take a break. You can try to finish later when your cat is calmer., Grooming can be a stressful experience, especially if your cat is new to the process. It might be a good idea to leave your cat alone for a few hours after grooming. He may need some time alone to calm down after being brushed, bathed, or having his nails trimmed. Praise your cat directly after grooming, providing positive reinforcement in the form of treats and praise, and then allow him to have some time to himself.

, When you get done bathing or brushing your cat, clean up any loose furs or hairs. Your cat might lick or swallow stray furs he finds on the floor, which can lead to hairballs. Sweep the grooming area thoroughly after grooming your Maine Coon to prevent this problem., Maine Coons are prone to hairballs due to their long fur. Regular grooming can prevent hairballs. However, if your cat continues to have issues with hairballs despite frequent brushing and bathing, consider adjusting his diet.


Look into cat foods specifically designed to reduce hairball production. You can buy many hairball control cat foods at your local supermarket. Ask your vet for a recommendation if you're unsure what brand to try.Ingredients like avocado oil and other vegetable and fruit oils may help reduce hairballs in cats. Look for these ingredients when purchasing a new brand of cat food."

If you do need to groom the kitten prior to eight weeks, use a soft, damp cloth to spot clean soiled areas of the kitten’s fur instead of giving the kitten a bath.Even if the kitten doesn’t need a bath at eight weeks, this is the ideal time to start acclimating a kitten to baths if you want to be able to bathe the cat into adulthood for purposes of showing the cat or to cut back on your personal allergies to the cat’s fur. By starting as a kitten, your adult cat will be more receptive to baths in general.;
, If you know you want to be able to bathe your kitten, then start acclimating the kitten to handling by you as early as possible. In addition to learning not to fear the water, the kitten will also need some time to learn that the amount of handling required for a bath is okay.Handle the kitten’s paws and splayed toes, tummy, back, and inside the ears., Your first instinct may be to use a sink to bathe your kitten However, it’s not safe because the kitten could potentially jump out of the sink and sustain an injury. A bathtub is a much better option since the kitten can’t jump out of the tub basin. Place the kitten into the dry tub and let it explore and sniff around for several minutes while you offer praise.


You can also start using this step prior to eight weeks of age so that the kitten is already comfortable with the tub by the time you ever add water.

, After the kitten is comfortable with the dry tub, try wetting the kitten’s paws without giving a full bath. Run one or two inches of warm (not hot) water (just enough to cover the paws) with the kitten in the bathroom, so the kitten adjusts to the sound of running water as well. You may need to close the door to stop any escape attempts. Keep a hand under the kitten’s belly for support and lower the kitten’s paws down into the water.Offer petting and praise to calm the kitten down, and offer the kitten treats after standing for several minutes without fighting the water or trying to escape the tub.If the kitten won’t calm down in the water, then don’t offer the praise and treats since you’ll reinforce the wrong behavior. Instead, remove the kitten and try again the following day. You may have to repeat the process for several days before the kitten stands in the water without a struggle.If at any stage your kitten panics, gently grasp her by the scruff and lift her up out of the water. Holding the kitten by the scruff has a naturally calming effect and will help her to relax.
You may want to place a grippy mat at the bottom of the tub since the kitten is more likely to panic if slipping around on the wet tub floor.

, A small kitten can very easily become too cold with wet fur. As you acclimate your kitten to receiving baths, always make sure you gently rub the fur dry anytime you remove the kitten from the water regardless of whether it’s just the paws or whether the entire kitten is dripping water.

, The process of acclimating your kitten to your handling and any amount of water can take time and patience. No matter what, never get angry with the kitten or raise your voice as it will only scare the kitten and set the process back. Instead, offer a calm soothing tone, and offer plenty of positive reinforcement with petting, treats, and praise as the kitten makes progress.

, You can scruff a kitten to help calm her down at any point in the process, but this isn’t always possible while you’re scrubbing or lathering shampoo. If your kitten has shown difficulty adjusting to the water alone, then enlist help from a second person before taking the next step. Have the person on hand and ready to scruff her if she panics or tries to claw her way out while you already have your hands full.

, After the kitten has adjusted to standing in water without struggling, you can start wetting more of the cat’s fur in the bath. Initially, trying using a wet washcloth to rub down the kitten instead of pouring water.This will combine the wetting-down process with some nice petting and scratches along your kitten’s back, which the kitten will enjoy more than simply getting drenched with water.


Don’t use any type of shampoo yet at this point. Just give the kitten a couple of washcloth-scrub baths first to help the cat adjust. If you try using shampoo before the kitten has fully acclimated to receiving baths, then you could get stuck with a panicking, soapy kitten. As with other steps, offer plenty of praise and treats to reinforce when your kitten reacts appropriately to the bath.A full bath with shampoo should only take around five minutes, so aim to acclimate the kitten to this length of time in the tub.

, After the kitten has adjusted to receiving a bath with a wet washcloth, then you can move on to using a small cup or bowl to pour some of the water over the kitten’s back. As always, offer praise and treats if the kitten is receptive to the new step in the process., Getting water in the kitten’s eyes, ears, or nose can be very dangerous for the kitten. As you get closer to the kitten’s head while pouring the water, ensure that you lift the kitten’s chin and also use your hand to prevent water from running down over the kitten’s face.To wash the kitten’s face, use a clean, damp washcloth without any shampoo to wipe around the eyes, ears, and mouth. Use short strokes following the lie of the fur to mimic a mother licking the kitten.

, Use about a dime-size portion of a kitten-formulated pet shampoo. Spread the shampoo around on the kitten’s wet coat and lather up the fur.Scrub around the flanks and tummy and don’t forget to scrub between the paw pads to loosen any trapped dirt. Lift the kitten’s tail and gently use a soft washcloth if you need to clean around the kitten’s anus.


Ensure that you use a shampoo for kittens and not human shampoo. The pH balance is very different, and human shampoo will overly dry your kitten’s skin.
Even after you kitten has adjusted to the shampooing, you should still only use it every other time you bathe your cat to keep from over drying the kitten’s skin., Since the kitten should already be accustomed to you pouring the water, you should easily be able to rinse the shampoo off the kitten now. For any soap around the top of the kitten’s head, use a clean, wrung-out washcloth to wipe out the shampoo instead of pouring water on your kitten’s head., Don’t rush, but don’t leave the kitten to soak in the water either. The entire process for wetting, scrubbing, and rinsing the kitten should only take about five minutes. You don’t want to test the kitten’s patience for the whole process as this can make it harder for the cat to acclimate to baths in the long run.


As with all steps in the process, stay calm and use a soothing, reassuring voice to offer consistent praise to the kitten during the bath. This should help keep the kitten calmer for longer.

, As with any of the other steps that required the kitten getting wet, you should gently towel dry the kitten as soon as you remove it from the water to avoid the kitten getting too cold.


Though a towel is preferable, if you want to use a blowdryer to dry the kitten, ensure that you use the coolest temperature on the lowest speed setting and keep the blowdryer at least twelve inches away from the animal.

, Most cat’s will never need their fur clipped or trimmed. However, your kitty may need clipping or trimming in some cases, such as she has long fur that is matting, which can cause health problems.Trim or clip your kitty’s fur only if it is absolutely necessary or consider allowing a professional groomer to clip her fur.


Use only clippers for animals and take frequent breaks so you don’t burn your kitty’s skin.Use gentle pressure when clipping your cat. Lightly guide the clippers along your cat’s body.

Consider visiting groomers’ businesses before you send your cat. This will let you get a sense of the facility and see if the groomer is kind to your cat.

, Whenever you brush, clip, or bathe your cat, check her skin for bumps, bald spots, or cuts. This can indicate health problems such as allergies or stress.See your vet if you find any strange or unexplained anomalies on your cat’s skin or fur. Some skin problems your cat may have are:


Parasitic infections from fleas, ear mites, or harvest mites
Fungal infections such as ringworm or yeast infections
Infections from excess bacteria on the skin
Viral infections such as feline cowpox
Feline acne or seborrhea
Immune disorders such as allergies and feline eosinophilic granuloma complex
Sun damage like skin cancer
Contact dermatitis
Drug reactions
Fur loss due to stress
Trauma from accidents or collars., If you find fleas on your kitty during grooming or the course of caring for her daily, you’ll need to get rid of them as soon as possible. Fleas can make your kitty itch, lead to skin problems, or even other health issues such as having tapeworms.


Recognize that fleas are the most common external parasite in pets.They feed on the blood of your cat and are visible through droppings of “flea dirt” or white flea eggs on your cat, persistent itching or scratching, or hair loss.Get a diagnosis from your vet of fleas and ask for the best treatment of them.Your vet may suggest topical or oral treatments, shampoos, sprays, or powders.Follow the packaging instructions and make sure to not use medication on your cat or any other pets unless it is designated for that specific animal. Be aware that you’ll need to treat other animals in your home and thoroughly clean your house to help get rid of fleas and their eggs.Consider treating your lawn if your cat goes outside., Another common parasite that cats who go outside can get are ticks. These arachnids can spread serious diseases to your cat, so check her whenever your groom her or she comes indoors. Remove the tick and take your cat to the vet to ensure that she doesn’t have any further ticks or tick-related conditions.Be aware that most ticks are visible to the naked eye. They are about the size of a pinhead but swell as they feed on your cat’s blood.Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves and grasp the tick with a pair of tweezers. Pull straight upwards in a steady motion and place the tick in a jar of rubbing alcohol for veterinary testing.Disinfect the area of your cat’s fur with soap and water, wash your hands and tweezers, too., Tiny parasites called ear mites are also common in cats, though mostly in kittens and younger cats.They are highly contagious and can lead to skin and hearing problems.Recognize ear mites by a black, coffee ground-like discharge in your cats ears.Take your cat to the vet to confirm a diagnosis of ear mites. The vet will give you treatment to get rid of the mites and soothe your cat’s itchy ears. She may also suggest ways to clean your cat’s ears if you suspect mites in the future.Follow any instructions the vet gives you for medication.
Be aware that ear mites are highly contagious and other animals in your home will also require treatment.Clean mites from your kitty’s ears by wrapping her in a towel when she is calm and holding her earflap out with one hand. Use your other hand to squeeze out a cotton ball drenched in ear cleaner at the opening of her ear canal.Use ear cleaner specially-formulated for cats that you can buy either at a pet store or get from your vet.
Release your cat, which may result in some shaking and dislodging of debris. After a few minutes reassure your cat and wipe any debris from her ears with a dry cotton ball. Repeat the process in the other ear., Sometimes your cat might get herself into something, such as paint or a skunk, that leaves her especially dirty or in need of a bath. Taking care of these problems as soon as possible can help maintain your cat’s health and hygiene.


Flush the eyes and mouth of a cat sprayed by a skunk with water and give her a bath if necessary. If the spray was heavy, take her to her vet for blood work to ensure she doesn’t develop anemia.Bathe your cat as soon as possible if she gets oil or paint on herself. Cats are naturally inclined to lick themselves clean and you want to avoid this if you can.If your cat has a lot of oil on her fur, you may want to have your vet sedate and clean her., Your kitty should get routine checkups at a vet, which includes checking on the health of her ears. But in between vet visits, it’s important to check your kitty’s ears once a week for wax, debris, or infection.Check her outer ear flap, or pinna, to make sure it has no bald spots and that its inner surface is clean and light pink.Examine her inner ear by folding back each ear and looking down into the canal.Make sure there is no debris, odor, and minimal ear wax. The color should be light pink.Use a cotton ball dampened in liquid cat ear cleansing solution.Fold back your cat’s ear and gently wipe away any debris.Avoid probing or poking anything into the ear canal, which can cause trauma or infection.Take your cat to the vet if you notice any discharge, caked wax, redness, swelling, bleeding, or unpleasant odor., Every few weeks, your cat may need her nails trimmed.This helps prevent breaking, infection, and an irregular gait because her nails are too long.Use only a nail clipper designed for cats. Purchase this item a pet store or your vet’s office.Wrap your kitty in a towel to prevent her from scratching and/ or ask a friend to hold your cat while you clip her nails.Trim your cat’s nails slowly and methodically so you minimize the risk of hurting her.Avoid clipping too close to the quick, which is the blood vessel inside of the nail.Clip above this area and hold your cat’s paw firmly and cut the nail in a single stroke.
Use a clotting agent if you accidentally cut the quick.Give kitty a treat for a successful nail clipping session.Avoid forcing your cat to endure trimming. Ask a vet or groomer to clip the nails to prevent injury to your cat—or you.Remember that your cat needs to scratch to maintain the health of her paws. Offer her a scratching post and check her paws for wounds., Every cat needs clean, sharp teeth and healthy gums. Dental disease is a common problem seen by veterinarians.Checking your kitty’s mouth and keeping it clean with brushing and regular vet visits can help keep disease at bay and your cat’s breath fresh.Push back your kitty’s gums gently when she is facing you during daily oral care. Make sure her gums are firm and pink and not swollen. Her teeth should be clean and free of brownish tartar and show no signs of being loose or broken.Brush your kitty’s teeth daily with a cotton swab or kitty toothbrush and a feline toothpaste. You can also use salt and water. Ask your vet for product recommendations.Start by gently massaging your cat’s gums with your fingers or touching a cotton swab to them and then proceed to the cleaning.Take your cat to a vet if you notice abnormally strong odor, which can indicate digestive problems or gingivitis.You should also look out for dark red lines along the gums, red and swollen gums, mouth ulcers, loose teeth, difficulty chewing food, excessive drooling, or pawing at her mouth.Remember to praise and soothe your kitty for good behavior while brushing.

Jumping spiders live in many climates, from tropical jungles to temperate forests.It is important to know that jumping spiders do not build webs like many other species of spiders.
The jumping spider tracks its prey on foot. Look for them jumping or walking in the grass, or hopping from plant to plant.

, You may get lucky and simply spy a jumping spider as it crosses your path. However, in most cases you will need to make a concerted effort to track one down. A beating stick can help you urge a jumping spider out into the open.Use a medium length stick as your beater. Carry it with you as you hunt for spiders.

If the cat is allergic to fleas, treat them.,
Change your cat's diet if it is allergic to its food.,
Keep your cat out of hot, dry weather.,
Avoid bathing your cat too often.,
Take your cat to a vet for a medical diagnosis.",How to Get Rid of Dry Skin on Cats1," For most cats, one or two fleas aren't a serious problem. However, in the rare case that your cat has a flea allergy, even a few small bites can lead to dry, irritated, and flaky skin.A vet can help you determine whether or not your cat has an allergy. If your cat has an allergy, the vet can also recommend treatment options.


Common remedies for fleas include pesticide shampoos and ointments. If your cat is at risk for an infection, the vet may also recommend antibiotics. Luckily, most cats recover quickly with flea control treatments.;
, Just like people, cats sometimes have allergies to the things that they eat. If you can't find an obvious cause for your cat's dandruff, this may be the explanation. Your vet can help confirm your suspicions.


If your cat does have an allergy, you may need to switch to a different food at your vet's recommendation. If this keeps the cat from getting nutrients it needs, dietary supplements may be necessary.
In some cases, switching dry food for wet food and adding a little fish oil to each meal can help keep a cat's skin moisturized., It may not seem like a risk that's worth worrying about, but cats can have their skin damaged by the weather. This is especially true for cats with thin coats (or none at all). Hot, dry conditions can lead to dried-out skin and even sunburn, so let your cat stay indoors when it's scorching out.


Drier winter months can also be a source of flaky skin, even if there's less of a risk of sunburn.

, Cats aren't like people in terms of bathing needs. They're quite good at keeping themselves clean, so they only need to be bathed very infrequently. Unless your cat's coat is visibly dirty, oily, or matted, you won't usually need to bathe it more than a few times per year.Bathing the cat more often can strip the essential oils from its skin, leaving it dried-out and flaky.

Identify dandruff.,
Take your cat to its vet.,
Rule out infections that may present as regular dandruff.",How to Get Rid of Cat Dandruff1," Dandruff is actually clumps of skin cells that have sloughed off your cat's body. These clumps can look like scales or flakes. However, not all scale is due to dandruff and it is a good idea to get your dandruff-covered cat checked by a vet.;
, A vet check up is recommended to make sure your cat is not suffering from an illness that is impacting its general health and body condition. These could include diabetes, overactive thyroid glands, arthritis, or seborrhea. If your cat has one of these conditions your vet will make suggestions for treatment.

, One particular cause of confusion is the skin mite, Cheyletiella yasguri. This mite feeds on sloughed skin cells, which causes more scale to develop, and the mite itself mimics the appearance of scale. Indeed, it has the nickname ""Walking dandruff"".


Your vet can quickly tell if Cheyletiella is a problem by knocking samples of dander onto a microscope slide for examination under high magnification.
If the mite is identified then your cat needs treatment with a product containing fipronil. This treatment is generally given every other night, with 3 treatments minimum, in order to kill the mite and resolve the apparent dandruff."

Their legs are often striped, have feathery tufts, and the tips of their legs point inward., The body of a female golden orb-weaver can be between one-and-a-half and three inches, while males are typically smaller than one inch. Their bodies are longer than they are wide, and they can have a leg span of up to six inches.

, Golden orb-weavers usually have irregular spots on their abdomens.

, The webs of these spiders can be easily identified because of the yellow or golden color of the silk, which is why they are called golden orb-weavers.The webs can be larger than a yard across, and are generally found at eye level or above, and usually in forested areas or mangroves., Spiders of the Nephila genus are commonly called golden orb-weavers, giant wood spiders, and banana spiders. While these spiders are mildly venomous, they aren’t a big threat to humans, as their venom isn’t overly potent. The species that make up this genus can be found in most places throughout the world, including:


Australia
Asia
Africa and Madagascar
South America
North America (in the southern United States), Cupiennius spiders are called banana spiders because they are sometimes found in banana shipments in North America and Europe. However, they are only native to Mexico, the northwestern parts of South America, and a few Caribbean islands.


While these spiders are not dangerous to humans, they are often mistaken for the venomous Phoneutria, or Brazilian wandering, spiders.

, The smallest spider species in this genus are about a quarter-inch, while females of the larger species can be as large and one-and-a-half inches. While often mistaken for Brazilian wandering spiders, Cupiennius spiders are generally smaller.

, Cupiennius spiders may have bright red hairs on their legs or mouths, and may have black spots on a white background on the underside of their legs near the body., Spiders of the Phoneutria genus are commonly known as Brazilian wandering spiders, armed spiders, or banana spiders. They are native to tropical areas in South America, but there has also been one species found living in Central America.Like Cupiennius spiders, Brazilian wandering spiders are often referred to as banana spiders because they sometimes travel the globe in banana shipments.


Brazilian wandering spiders are a danger to humans, and are known as one of the most venomous spiders on Earth. However, there is anti-venom to treat their bites., Spiders in the Phoneutria genus can have bodies as large as two inches, and leg spans of up to five inches., These spiders tend to be brown and hairy. They are often confused with Cupiennius spiders because they too can have red hairs on their mouths, but they also might have a black spot on their bellies., Brazilian wandering spiders will often sit with their two front legs lifted in the air and sway from side to side., Argiope appensa are commonly known as Hawaiian garden spiders. They are native to Taiwan and Guam, and are now found regularly in Hawaii and New Guinea.They are not venomous, and don’t pose any real threat to humans.

, Hawaiian garden spiders have distinctive webs, thanks to the unique zigzag pattern they incorporate into their webs with thick bands of silk., These spiders can be quite large, with body lengths reaching over two inches.

, Hawaiian garden spiders are often called banana spiders because of their yellow color. They can also be identified by their unique star-shaped abdomens."

Create a safe environment.,
Feed your spider.,
Interact with your spider.,
Record your observations.",How to Catch and Care for a Jumping Spider2," Jumping spiders can thrive in a variety of environments. In order to make sure they have room to jump, try to choose a container that is at least a cubic foot in size. Glass or plastic terrariums work well.Make sure the lid is ventilated with small holes so that your spider gets adequate air flow.
Jumping spiders don't spin webs, but they do enjoy resting in little nests. Provide your spider with material to make a bed. Choose a small piece of cloth, or even a paper napkin.
Keep the cage out of direct sunlight. You don't want your spider to overheat.

, Your jumping spider will eat a variety of insects. Try feeding it flies and small crickets. If you don't want to collect the food yourself, you can purchase it at most pet stores.Your spider does not need to eat every day. It will be fine if you give it an insect every 2-3 days.
Spiders don't need much water. Just mist the sides of the cage with a spray bottle of water every few days.
Simply drop the insect into the cage. Your spider will pounce on it and eat.

, Like most spiders, jumping spiders really don't like to be touched or handled. For the most part, you should avoid trying to handle your spider. If you do need to move him, try to nudge him into a cup using a piece of plastic or other material.


You can still enjoy your pet. You can watch him jump around his cage. Some will also follow your finger if you gently trace it along the walls of the container. It seems like he may be playing, but it will help you keep him active, and know that he can still see and hunt.
Occasionally, you can take your spider out of captivity. Set him on your desk and watch him jump. Just be careful not to lose him!

, Your spider can be a very interesting pet. Try keeping track of things like how much it eats and when, and if it changes colors or size. You could discover some interesting patterns. You can also track when it likes to sleep.


Try keeping a small notebook near your jumping spider's cage. That way you'll have it handy when you see it do something interesting.

Give the cat a hot towel wrap.,
Slightly increase the fat in the cat's diet.,
Ensure the cat is getting plenty of water.,
Give the cat a gentle brushing.,
Use a gentle ointment.",How to Get Rid of Dry Skin on Cats2," The gentle, warm moisture from a hot towel can help soothe dried-out skin and leave the cat feeling refreshed. Follow the steps below:


When your cat is in a calm, approachable mood, find a clean towel or rag and soak it in hot water. The water shouldn't be too hot for you to hold your hand in.
Once it's soaked, take the towel out and wring it until it is not dripping wet anymore.
Drape the towel over the cat where the dandruff spots are. Gently keep the towel in place while you hold the cat. Let it sit this way for five minutes while you offer it petting and affection to keep it calm.

, Sometimes, a cat simply isn't getting enough of the right nutrients to keep its skin healthy. In this case, its diet may call for a little more fat. Try switching to a slightly fattier cat food or adding more fat to its meals yourself.


One healthy way to do this is to offer the cat fish, which contains healthy Omega 3 fatty acids. You can also try adding healthy oil supplements to

, Dehydration can also cause dry, flaky skin. Most cats don't need a lot of water, but since it's important for the cat's health and it doesn't contain any calories, there's no reason not to provide your cat with plenty of clean water every day.


Change its bowl frequently to ensure it always has good water to drink. It's also a good idea to wash the water bowl from time to time to kill any bacteria in it., An occasional brushing can remove dead skin flakes, reducing dandruff. Use a gentle cat brush and stroke in the direction of the hair. Don't use too much pressure — you want to stroke, not scrub.


Always brush gently and stop right away if you notice irritated skin or signs of pain.

, Believe it or not, there are moisturizing lotions and topical ointments designed for cats with dry skin. Your best chance for finding these will be your local pet store, but if you can't find any there, your vet may be able to recommend some. You can also easily find these products available online.


Only buy well-regarded, quality products for use on your cat. The best products will have lots of positive reviews from happy cat owners.

Address physical conditions that are making the dandruff worse.,
Keep your cat out of hot, dry weather.,
Give the cat a gentle brushing.,
Avoid bathing your cat too often.,
Use a gentle ointment.",How to Get Rid of Cat Dandruff2," Be aware that obesity, arthritis, and sore teeth can cause dandruff. Keeping the skin and fur conditioned requires the cat to groom regularly and spread the conditioning oils over the coat. If the cat is overweight or has mobility issues, such as those associated with arthritis, it physically won't be able to reach all parts of its body, which means those places are liable to have flaky skin.


If this is the case then you should groom the cat daily until the cat is able to do it itself.
If your cat is not grooming itself because it can't reach areas due to its weight, consider putting it on a diet. A leaner cat should be able to more effectively clean itself.
A sore mouth can also stop the cat from grooming, and can also impact on its ability to eat. In these circumstances veterinary attention is essential, to extract loose teeth, clean away tartar, and give antibiotics against gum infection.

, It may not seem like a risk that's worth worrying about, but cats can have their skin damaged by the weather. This is especially true for cats with thin coats or no coats at all. Hot, dry conditions can lead to dried-out skin and even sunburn, so let your cat stay indoors when it's scorching out.


Drier winter months can also be a source of flaky skin, even if there's less of a risk of sunburn.

, An occasional brushing can remove dead skin flakes, reducing dandruff. Use a gentle cat brush and stroke in the direction of the hair. Don't use too much pressure. You want to stroke and not scrub. Regular brushing is a great way to reduce dandruff. It improves the blood circulation to the skin, which carries oxygen and nutrients to the skin and helps condition it.


However, expect the dandruff to initially get worse in the first 3 - 4 weeks. You will loosen up sloughed skin cells that are then shed into the coat.
Always brush gently and stop right away if you notice irritated skin or signs of pain.

, Cats aren't like people in terms of bathing needs. They're quite good at keeping themselves clean, so they only need to be bathed very infrequently. Unless your cat's coat is visibly dirty, oily, or matted, you won't usually need to bathe it more than a few times per year.


Bathing the cat more often can strip the essential oils from its skin, leaving it dried-out and flaky. Bathing the cat is mainly of benefit to you (rather than the cat) if you are allergic to cat dander, as it will temporarily wash it away.
If you decide to bathe the cat then use a moisturizing shampoo, such as one containing oatmeal, and avoid human shampoos, which are too harsh and will strip out natural oils.

, Believe it or not, there are moisturizing lotions and topical ointments designed for cats with dry skin. Your best chance for finding these will be your local pet store, but if you can't find any there, your vet may be able to recommend some. You can also easily find these products available online.

Change your cat's food.,
Supplement your cat's diet with omega fatty acids.,
Ensure the cat is getting plenty of water.",How to Get Rid of Cat Dandruff3," Some cats have dry or scaling skin because of a dietary deficiency of vital nutrients that keep the skin in good condition. Typically a diet that is low in essential fatty acids has a detrimental effect on skin condition, leading to excessive scale and skin flakes. Cats have a high requirement for linoleic acid and arachidonic acid to be supplied in their food, because they are unable to make them in the body. Good quality diets are usually well supplemented with these fatty acids, but a cheap diet or a food that has been incorrectly stored and exposed to high temperatures may contain reduced levels.To prevent this make sure to feed a good quality food that lists a named meat as the main ingredient. Also make sure it is stored appropriately and away from extremes of temperature, which could degrade the vital fatty acids.

, To provide additional conditioning for the skin consider giving a supplement of omega fatty acids, also known as PUFA or polyunsaturated fatty acids. These should be given with food to improve absorption into the bloodstream. Fish and marine oils that are a balanced source of Omega 3 and 6 are ideal for your cat.


Around 75 mg / kg a day is the advised dose, which means giving an average 4 - 5 kg cat around 300- 450 mg a day., Dehydration can also cause dry, flaky skin. Most cats don't need a lot of water but it's important for the cat's health that it has access to water at all times. Provide your cat with plenty of clean water every day, whether you think it is drinking it or not.


Change its bowl frequently to ensure it always has good water to drink.
It's also a good idea to wash the water bowl from time to time to kill any bacteria in it.

Locate the spider's web.,
Once you have found a web, make sure you have your gloves on and your collection containers ready.

,
Catch the spider in its own web.",How to Catch a Spider2," Webs are usually inhabited, but if the web looks dull or wispy, then the spider probably doesn't live there anymore. Most web building spiders are active at night.

,, Place the biggest part of the container behind the web and the lid in front. Quickly bring the two together without injuring the spider. Clear the web around the rim of the container and shake the container up so that the spider can't climb back out of it's own web.


Most spiders will drop out of their webs, holding a container under the spider usually works well.

Shoo the ground-dwelling spider gently into the canister with your lid.

,
Bring the jar up so it can't escape.",How to Catch a Spider3,", You may also plop the jar or cup over the spider and slide a card under the cup.

"
"
Get a partner to help.,
Use your stick to make it jump into your canister in front of it.

,
Clamp the lid down and you got the jumping spider.

",How to Catch a Spider4," Jumping spiders are tricky to catch so you may want to have a partner there to help you.

,,"
"
Catch a tarantula, if there are any around.,
Place a large jar in front of them and they will walk into the jar.",How to Catch a Spider5,"


Note that these creatures dwell in holes in the ground in many areas. They are venomous (mildly) as most spiders, but beware that their fangs can be quite large and a bite can be quite painful.
Note that they are nocturnal (they hunt at night), so if you want to find them out of their lairs, look for them in the early morning when they are heading back toward their hole. You may find them out and about during the daytime and at certain times.

, Sometimes a gentle touch on the rear of their large abdomen will cause them to move quickly forward into the jar.


Do not touch them toward their front, where their eyes and fangs are. Read up on them beforehand.

Catch a trapdoor spider.,
Open their trap door by taking a knife to slowly open the door.

,
Leave the door attached to the web tunnel.

,
Fill the the tunnel with water.

,
Wait a couple of minutes and start twisting the web by turning the door again and again.,
Pull very gently on the web during the twisting set.,
Put the web in a container and gently cut the bulb open and enjoy your new catch.

",How to Catch a Spider6," Take your stick (it should be a long one) and prod (not too hard!) them from behind the spider you are trying to capture. It should move into the canister and you've got yourself a trapdoor spider. Trapdoor spiders will usually hold their doors closed with their fangs. If you can't gently pry the door open, the spider is just behind the door. A quick stab with a small trowel will usually result in a spider still holding its door (or half a spider).

,,,, This will cause the web to pull away from the dirt sides.

, The web will eventually pull all of the way out with the spider contained in the small bulb formed at the end of its web.

Provide a secure enclosure.,
Use the appropriate kind of material for housing.,
Decorate the enclosure.,
Keep the aquarium at the right temperature.,
Maintain the right humidity level.,
Feed your scorpion regularly.,
Provide fresh water.,
Offer the scorpion larger prey.,
Feed your scorpion at night.,
Remove uneaten prey.,
Observe your scorpion’s feeding habits.,
Don’t pick up your scorpion if you can help it.,
Use forceps and be gentle if you must handle your scorpion.,
Avoid handling molting or newly molted scorpions.",How to Care for a Scorpion," A 5–10 gallon (18.9–37.9 L) glass aquarium is a good size for most scorpions that are kept as pets. It is very important that the enclosure has a locking lid, so that the scorpion cannot accidentally escape. However, the lid must also have small holes so that air can circulate throughout the aquarium., Scorpions come from either jungle environments or deserts. The type of material you should choose to fill your scorpion’s aquarium depends on your pet's species. If you aren’t sure what kind of scorpion you have, check with a pet store, entomologist, or vet that specializes in exotic pets.Jungle species from Asia and Africa will like a thick layer of peat moss (about 2.5 inches or 6-7 cm) in the bottom of the aquarium. You can also add bark chips on top.
Desert species will like sand (about 4 inches or 10 cm thick).
Don’t use dirt from your yard, as it may have pesticides or microbes that could harm your pet., You can make your scorpion’s aquarium more like a home by giving it some things to play on and burrow under. Good choices include:Wood
Ceramic pots
Bark

, Scorpions need a warm environment in order to stay healthy. They will also need to have some temperature variation so that they can regulate their body temperature.Keep your scorpion’s aquarium at about 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). You can use a heat mat to help keep the aquarium at the right temperature. Look for one at a pet supply store.
The heat mat should be placed under the bottom of the aquarium, but should only cover about one-third of it. This provides a way for the scorpion to move around from warmer to cooler areas and regulate its body temperature.
If you live in an area that becomes very warm, you may not need to use the heat mat all the time, or at all.
You can attach a thermometer to the aquarium to keep an eye on its temperature. Look for one at a pet supply store. One used for reptile housings will be fine.

, Jungle species of scorpions will prefer a humid environment. Spray the aquarium of a jungle scorpion with water every day or two, but don’t soak it. It should not become moldy.You should only need to spray a desert scorpion’s aquarium with water once in a while.

, Pet scorpions can eat a variety of small prey, including insects, spiders, and mealworms. Crickets are recommended as regular food, since they are readily available from pet supply stores and/or bait stores.A large scorpion might eat a few (3-5) adult crickets once or twice a week.If you keep a supply of live food for your scorpion, be sure to care for it, too.

, Scorpions will need access to water, so you should keep a shallow bowlful in your pet’s aquarium at all times. Make sure that the water is clean, fresh, and chlorine-free., Scorpions are capable of eating prey that is quite sizeable. About once a month, you should give your pet larger offerings. Good choices include mice and small lizards or snakes., Ordinarily, scorpions are nocturnal. To mimic natural feeding habits, you should feed your pet at night., If your scorpion does not eat all of its prey at first, you should take the uneaten food out of its aquarium. Live prey that is left in the aquarium, including crickets, can attack and harm a resting or molting scorpion., If your scorpion seems to be eating less than usual, you may want to contact a vet that has experience treating exotic pets. Not finishing its food can indicate that something is wrong with the scorpion., Generally speaking, scorpions should not be handled. While the venom of most scorpions is not lethal, a sting can be painful. Individuals with allergies may suffer more severe reactions. In addition, scorpions may become stressed and ill if handled., If you must pick up your scorpion (in order to clean or change its aquarium, for instance), use a pair of foam-tipped tweezers or tongs. Be very gentle and do not squeeze your pet., The exoskeleton of scorpions provides good protection for them in their natural environments. However, scorpions can be crushed. When they are molting or have recently molted, their exoskeletons can be especially soft. Give your pet’s exoskeleton a chance to harden before handling it."

Get a small or medium enclosure.,
Place substrate at the bottom of the habitat.,
Place flat rocks in the aquarium.,
Decorate the enclosure.,
Install a heat mat.,
Keep a thermometer inside the habitat.,
Keep a wet sponge in the terrarium.,
Feed your scorpion a couple times a week.,
Schedule feedings at night time.,
Provide a shallow dish of water.,
Mist the habitat.,
Do not handle your scorpion.,
Trap or confine your scorpion before cleaning their habitat.,
Secure the top of the aquarium.,
Avoid using chemicals to clean the habitat.",How to Care for Scorpions," Purchase a hard plastic or glass enclosure at a local pet store. At a minimum, use an enclosure that is two cubic feet in size (.06 cubic meters). You should be able to house two to three scorpions in an enclosure this size.Make sure your enclosure has a top that snaps on securely.;
, Substrate is a layer of organic and/or inorganic material that covers the bottom of your enclosure. You need to provide 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of appropriate substrate for most scorpions. Substrate is important, as it will give your scorpion something to burrow into.


For desert scorpions, use sand. For species that live in temperate or tropical environments, use soil or pieces of bark or mulch.
If you have a burrowing species of scorpion (like desert hairy scorpions), you might want to and 6 inches (15 centimeters) of substrate.
You can gather substrate on your property (if it is appropriate for the species of scorpion you have), or you can purchase it at a pet store., Find 2 to 3 large rocks and place them in the aquarium. You can spread them out or put them together. These are important as they will provide the scorpion a place to hide., One of the most enjoyable parts of having a scorpion is decorating its enclosure. In addition to rocks, you can provide your scorpion with a variety of features to make the habitat interesting and diverse. Some features include:


Pieces of wood
Small plants
Pieces of ceramic pots, Purchase a heat mat from a local pet store or online. Then, tape the mat to the back side of the enclosure. The heat mat will provide the scorpion with enough heat to thrive. In addition, by securing it to the enclosure, you’ll allow your scorpion to move toward or away from it depending on the heat in the habitat.Make sure the heat mat only covers half to two thirds of the side of the enclosure.

, While your heat mat will do a lot to heat the terrarium, you’ll still have to monitor the temperature inside. To do this, keep a thermometer inside the habitat. Make sure the temperature is always around 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). This, though, could vary depending on the time of day and the type of scorpion you have.


Desert species prefer a range of 72 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 29 degrees Celsius).
Tropical species prefer a range of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26 degrees Celsius).
Temperatures should never go above 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).
Temperatures should be kept constant., A wet sponge will help keep the habitat humid. Dampen the sponge every couple of days. Humidity is important, as your scorpions could dry out without it.Try to keep the humidity of the habitat above 30% to 40%

, Depending on the size and type of scorpion, you’ll have to feed it once or twice a week. Feedings should consist of small crickets or pinheads.


Large scorpions may eat between 3 and 5 crickets a week.
Take uneaten crickets or pieces of dead crickets out of the enclosure if they haven’t been eaten in 3 to 4 hours.
You can also feed your scorpion a variety of insects, spiders, and lizards., Since scorpions are active at night, you should feed them at night. Not only will your scorpion likely eat what you feed it, but you’ll be super entertained watching it eat.If you find your scorpion doesn’t eat when you feed it, change your feeding time by a couple of hours.
Feed your scorpion regularly once you’ve identified a time that your scorpion likes to eat.

, While scorpions don’t drink much water, they still need to have it around. As a result, you should keep a very shallow dish (1 inch/2.5 centimeters or less) full of clean water in the enclosure.Make sure the water does not flood the substrate.

, In addition to keeping a shallow dish full of water, you might also consider misting the enclosure every so often. By spraying a mist, you’ll give your scorpion another way to get water, and you’ll provide water to any plants you may have placed in the enclosure.Don’t mist the scorpion directly.

, The majority of scorpions sting. While the severity of their stings varies depending on the species, most of them can inflect extreme pain on people. Some scorpion stings could result in death. Instead of handling them, have fun watching them from outside the enclosure.


Use tongs to feed your scorpion instead of dropping crickets by your hand, Before you do any work on the terrarium, you should trap or confine your scorpion. You can do this by taking a transparent cup and placing it over the scorpion. Then, slide a piece of cardboard underneath the bottom of the cup.After trapping the scorpion, you can choose to move it to another container to clean around it.
If you have two or more scorpions, you may need help trapping both simultaneously – ask a friend.
You may be able to purchase a ready-made non-lethal scorpion trap online or at a pet store near you.

, If you have a terrarium or aquarium with a snap on top, make sure the it snaps shut when you close it. If you have another sort of habitat, make sure it is appropriately sealed. This is important, as your scorpion could escape and wind up hurting you, a family member, or a pet.Consider placing rocks or something heavy on top of the closure for added protection.
Instruct small children and visitors not to take off the top of the enclosure when you are not around.

, Scorpions are very clean. As a result, you don’t need to use chemicals to clean their habitat. In addition, chemicals (like detergents or household sprays) could poison your scorpion.If you do need to clean any surface in the habitat, wipe it down with a clean cloth and warm water.

Provide obstacles in the terrarium.,
Do not place bright or warm lights around the cage.,
Clean your scorpion’s enclosure regularly.,
Prepare an insect-based diet for your scorpion.,

Feed your scorpion two to three insects per feeding.,
Provide your scorpion with water.,
Avoid handling your scorpion.,
Move your scorpion by coaxing it into a plastic container.,
Keep multiple Emperor scorpions in separate tanks.,
Allow your scorpion to move freely around its enclosure.,
Take your scorpion to the vet for any health concerns.",How to Care for Emperor Scorpions," The tank can be made of either glass or plastic, but needs to be sturdy and well-ventilated, and should have a secure lid that latches shut. Emperor scorpions are strong and can lift a lid if it’s not secured. The tank should not be smaller than 10 gallons. If you plan to ever have two or three Emperor scorpions in the same tank, opt for a tank that’s 15 or 20 gallons.You should be able to purchase a tank at any local pet store. You can also order glass or plastic terrariums online at pet-specific retail sites, or large retailers such as Amazon.;
, Scorpions do not generate their own heat, and so need to be kept warm by their environment. You can provide heat for your scorpion by installing a heat mat under the tank.This mat will regulate the enclosure’s temperature and keep the scorpion from becoming too cold.

Emperor scorpions need a day time temperature of around 29ºC/85ºF and a night time low of 23ºC/75ºF. If you live in a cold environment, you may choose to hang a thermometer in the tank to measure the temperature.

, Substrate gives the scorpion a loose ground layer to burrow in, and preserves relatively high humidity in the tank. Cover the floor with a thick layer of substrate, common materials for which include sterilized potting soil, cocoa fiber, peat, peat/vermiculite, or cork bark.The substrate should be kept moist by daily spraying with a water bottle. Spray the substrate until it is slightly damp, not wet or saturated.
Moss can also be added to the substrate, as it will retain moisture and humidity. Don’t cover all of the substrate with moss, however, as it will impede the scorpion from digging down into the substrate.

, Scorpions like to engage and interact with their environment, so provide objects like bark and rocks for your scorpion to climb, burrow, and hide beneath. Suitable shelters include cork bark, a partial log, driftwood, or a flower pot. Having these objects in the cage will also make the scorpion a more enjoyable pet for you, as you can watch it interact with its environment.Emperor scorpions love to climb, so you can place some short branches in the terrarium to stimulate interest.

, Since scorpions are nocturnal animals, they don’t like bright lights. Keep the tank out of direct sunlight and away from radiators and other sources of heat. This species is especially vulnerable to UV light, and too much exposure will stress the scorpion, which in severe cases will lead to its death.If you’d like the cage to be well lit so that you can see your pet scorpion, place the enclosure near a window or near a fluorescent light.

, Scorpions don’t make much mess, but any food remains should be removed daily. Change the substrate and clean and disinfect the tank every 3 or 4 months using an arachnid-friendly disinfectant.


Once your scorpion molts, you’ll also need to remove the shed skin.

, Just as they would in the wild, captive Emperor scorpions need to eat live insects. Feed your scorpion live crickets, locusts, and mealworms. The insects themselves should be fed beforehand with a nutrient rich mixture available from pet shops (this is known as “gut-loading”).You can purchase gut-loaded crickets and mealworms at any local pet shop that sells arachnids and reptiles. Gut-loaded insects are also available online at any major pet retail site.
If you’re caring for a baby or juvenile Emperor scorpion, feed it small insects, including pinhead crickets., Scorpions do not need to eat every day, but should be fed somewhat frequently. If you scorpion is very hungry during its weekly feeding, you can start feeding it every few days. On the other hand, if you’re feeding it every three days and it often eats only a single cricket, you can feed it less frequentlyAdult scorpions molt once or twice a year and don’t eat before and after molting. Don’t be alarmed if you notice this behavior.

, Don’t overwhelm your scorpion by throwing a handful of live crickets or mealworms into its enclosure. Instead, place 2 or 3 insects on the substrate near the scorpion, and let it eat them at its leisure. Scorpions can be temperamental eaters, and sometimes may refuse food altogether.It’s okay if you leave uneaten crickets in the cage with the scorpion. Keeping live crickets in the tank will never hurt your scorpions.

, Scorpions drink a lot of water, so make sure it is available every day. It’s best to provide water in a shallow, sturdy dish that the scorpion can’t knock over. The Emperor scorpion may want to crawl in the water dish to help it cool down. Give your scorpion fresh water daily, and wash the water dish every week or two.Do not soak cotton wool in bottled water and place it in a small dish for your scorpion to drink from. This can be very harmful for your scorpion, and may even result in its death.

, Although Emperor scorpions are generally docile, they can still sting or pinch. The pinch will hurt, since Emperor scorpions have large and powerful claws. Emperor scorpion’s stings can feel similar to a bee’s or a hornet’s sting: its poison is mild, but the sting will hurt.

It’s very unlikely that you’ll be allergic to the scorpion’s venom, although venom allergies do exist. If you notice swelling or experience substantial pain after a sting, consult your doctor.

, If you need to move the scorpion for any reason, avoid using your hands to pick up and move the pet. Instead, coax it into a ventilated box—such as a clean plastic margarine container—that can be closed easily once the scorpion enters it. Ensure that the container has holes poked in the lid and sides for air ventilation.Alternately, you can pick the scorpion up using a pair of tongs or forceps. Do this gently, so that you don’t accidentally crush its shell., Emperor scorpions are not social animals; they prefer to live alone rather than living in groups.Scorpions may eat one another if housed together. It’s also not uncommon for multiple scorpions to fight over the same piece of food or insect if they’re housed in the same enclosure.(However, keeping an adequate amount of food in their tank should prevent that from happening.)


Emperor scorpions can be housed together, but they enjoy their personal space and merely tolerate each other. If you feel that you need multiple scorpions, make sure there are plenty of hiding places, as the animals may become territorial.

, Scorpions will get any exercise they need from within their enclosure. If your scorpion appears to not be exercising, or is moving around too much, contact your local vet or the animal store from where you obtained your scorpion.


Don’t be alarmed if your scorpion hides or remains motionless for most of the day. Emperor scorpions are nocturnal and will emerge and move around at night., Emperor scorpions are generally healthy pets, and should have few health concerns if kept in the right conditions. The most common health problems relate to the terrarium’s and scorpion’s temperature. If the scorpion is overheated, it will become very active, may appear to sting itself, and finally roll over on its back. If the animal is too cold, it will burrow into the substrate lining the bottom of the enclosure. The animal also may not eat.

Its legs are a lighter brown and completely uniform in color, with no additional markings.If the spider has stripes or other pigments on its legs, it's not a brown recluse.
If the spider has more than two pigments on its body other than the violin (and maybe a slightly darker abdomen), it's not a brown recluse.
If the spider has legs that are significantly darker than its body, it's not a brown recluse. Keep in mind slight variation can exist in shade and tone.;
, It's a slightly darker brown color than the rest of the body, or cephalothorax. The violin shape isn't clearly defined, so it may not look to you exactly like the musical instrument.

Many spiders have similar shapes on their bodies, so this alone is not significant enough to identify the spider as a brown recluse.
Again, look at the color of the violin shape closely. If it has spots of different pigments, then you are not looking at a recluse. However, injury or sun damage may also cause what would appear as different coloring or texture.

, The brown recluse, unlike other spiders, has only six eyes. They are arranged in pairs: one pair is in the center, and there's a pair on either side. Because the eyes are so small, it can be difficult to see them without a magnifying glass. If you count eight eyes, you're not looking at a recluse. (Please be safe when counting -, The brown recluse has many fine, short hairs on its body. Unlike some other spiders, it does not have spines on its body or legs. If you see a spider with spines, it's definitely not a recluse.

, The brown recluse's body doesn't grow to be larger than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). If you're looking at a spider that's larger than this, it's a different type of spider., The recluse's range is in the midwestern, southeastern, and southwestern regions of the United States.If you don't live in one of these regions, then it is highly unlikely that you will encounter a brown recluse, although it is possible., True to their name, brown recluse spiders build their webs in out-of-the way places that aren't usually in plain sight. Brown recluses usually build webs in places that are dry and haven't been recently disturbed. Here are a few places you may spot them:


Rotting bark
Attics
Basements
Closets
Sheds
Barns
Woodpiles
Shoes
Dressers
Toilets
Cardboard boxes
Behind pictures
In unused beds

, Brown recluse webs are loose, sticky, and off-white or grayish.You won't see a brown recluse web strung between trees or walls - that type of web is built by an orb weaver.

, The initial bite of the brown recluse usually doesn’t cause pain. This means that you may not be aware of the bite for as long as 8 hours, at which time the bite area will become red, tender and swollen.

, In some cases the bite alone is the worst symptom, but sensitive people and children may develop other symptoms. Monitor your body for these symptoms that may occur:Chills
General feeling of illness
Fever
Nausea
Sweating

, The danger with a bite from this spider is severe tissue damage, and in rare cases it can cause someone to fall into a coma.Seek medical treatment as soon as you realize you were bit by a brown recluse. Seek immediate medical attention if a child or an elderly person has been bitten; the bite of the brown recluse spider is most dangerous to such persons and can produce very severe symptoms. While waiting to get medical treatment, you can take these immediate first-aid steps:


Wash the bite area with soap and water
Apply an ice pack directly to the bite area for ten minutes, then remove it for ten minutes.
Repeat until you reach medical facilities.

Look closely at your cat’s eye.,
Determine if the cat suffered an injury.,
Look for a foreign body.,
Check for discharges, plaque, or lesions.,
Bring the cat to the vet as soon as possible.,
Have the vet take a blood test and culture.,
Consider giving the cat an MRI.",How to Diagnose and Treat Bulging Eye in Cats1," Take a moment to inspect your cat’s eye closely and then get your cat to the veterinarian right away. As you do this, compare one eye with the other to see if one or both eyes are bulging. Be sure to tell your cat’s veterinarian anything you noticed about the bulging, but don’t worry if you cannot identify what exactly is bulging. Your veterinarian will examine your cat closely and use tests to help them determine the cause of the problem. Some of the potential causes of bulging may include:


Something pushing on the back of the eyeball causing it to bulge out, such as an abscess or a tumor.
Swelling in the eyeball itself, such as with glaucoma.
Swelling in the tissues surrounding the eyeball, such as in the eyelid.;
, Being hit by a car, getting into a fight with another animal, and other traumatic injuries are common causes of a bulging eye in cats. Traumatic injury is the most likely cause if the bulging eye developed suddenly with no prior symptoms of infection, like squinting, discharges, or gradual swelling.Bring a cat with a traumatic injury to the vet as soon as possible to reduce the risk of vision loss and other complications.
If the cat’s eyeball is out of the socket and hanging, then this is also an emergency requiring immediate veterinary treatment. You can soak a gauze swab in some saline solution and place it over the eye to help prevent it from desiccating. Take the cat to the vet immediately after that.

, Examine the eye and socket for an obvious penetrating injury or for small pieces of glass, metal fragments, sand, or other small objects. Call the vet and ask if you should attempt to flush small objects with saline solution before bringing the cat to the office or en route.Do not attempt to remove larger objects that penetrate the eye or socket.

, Examine the eye and surrounding skin for signs of infection. Look for clear or pus-filled discharges, cloudiness, and white or pink plaque or lesions on the surface. If the cat showed any gradually worsening symptoms before the bulging eye became obvious, a bacterial or viral infection is a likely cause., As you make your first observations of the injury or infection, call a vet and advise them that you’ll be bringing a cat with a bulging eye to their office. Be prepared to report as many details as possible, including:The cat’s medical history, if known.
Whether the cat suffered a traumatic injury and if any foreign bodies are present.
Foods it’s recently eaten.
Whether the bulging eye developed suddenly or if you observed prior signs of infection.
Its vaccinations, including whether it was vaccinated against feline herpesvirus (FHV).

, The vet will give the cat a physical examination and, if injury isn’t the obvious cause, take samples of blood and corneal (surface of the eye) tissue. They’ll take a complete blood count and test the samples for viral and bacterial infections. They might also test for allergies, especially if cultures showed no signs of infection.You can also request dental x-rays. Your vet may x-ray the cat's teeth roots to see if a tooth root abscess may be pushing the eye forward from behind.

, If the vet rules out causes such as injury, infection, or allergies, they might suggest administering an MRI. The bulging eye could be caused by an cancerous or benign tumor. If a scan reveals a tumor, or if the vet suspects a tumor is present, they’ll take a sample for biopsy to determine if it’s malignant."

Keep an eye on the condition.",How to Diagnose and Treat Blepharitis in Cats," When a cat has blepharitis its eyelids will likely swell due to the infection. Look for red and puffy eyelids in one or both of your cat's eyelids.Because this infection is bacterial, it can move from one eye to both eyes. However, it may just stay in one.;
, If your cat has blepharitis, it is likely that it is in some discomfort. The cat may scratch or rub its eyes repeatedly. It may also keep the affected eye or eyes closed for long periods of time.If your cat rubs its eyes too much, this can cause additional trauma to the eye area. This can make identifying the source of the infection difficult and increase the seriousness of the infection.

, If your cat's eyelids are infected, there may be clear or yellow discharge around them. In addition, the eyes may be covered in crust or flakes may develop.Discharge and crusty eyes can be associated with a variety of eye conditions. If your cat has these symptoms, it needs to be looked at by a veterinarian to identify the specific cause.

, There are some things that can predispose a cat to getting blepharitis. The most common congenital cause of the infection is entropion, which is a condition that causes the edges of the eyelids to rub on the cornea. Additionally, cats with feline herpes virus-1 and cats with food or environmental allergies are more likely to get this infection.Cats that have flat faces, deep facial folds, or bulging eyes are most likely to have entropion.
If your cat has any conditions that could predispose it to blepharitis then you should be vigilant in looking for the symptoms on a regular basis.

, If your cat is having problems with its eyes, it's important to have them looked at by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office and make an appointment for your cat to be seen. Tell the receptionist what is going on with your cat and ask for an appointment that will get your cat seen sooner rather than later.

Eye infections should not be ignored, as severe infections can lead to reduced vision or permanent blindness.

, When taking your cat in to get assessed, you should be ready to tell the veterinarian all about your cat's condition. Tell them when the symptoms started and if they have changed over time, in addition to answering any additional questions the veterinarian may have., Your veterinarian may want to run some tests on your cat to assess the underlying cause of the condition. Some of the tests can be completed in the veterinary office and some may need to be sent to a laboratory for analysis, such as the tests for feline herpes virus. These tests can be particularly important to figure out whether the infection requires an antibiotic for treatment.Your vet may perform a biopsy or take skin scrapings to help diagnose the cause of the blepharitis. These will be sent to a lab for evaluation., If your veterinarian does not know how to treat your cat's condition satisfactorily, they may suggest having the cat seen by a veterinary ophthalmologist. This is an eye doctor for animals. They should be able to work in collaboration with your usual veterinarian to figure out the best course of treatment.It may be necessary to seek out a veterinary ophthalmologist yourself for a second opinion. If your cat's condition has not improved with initial treatment, you should ask your veterinarian for a referral or find an accredited specialist on your own.
The American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists has a directory where you can locate local board-certified veterinary ophthalmologists.

, Give your cat the medication that your veterinarian prescribed. In most cases, this will be a topical antibiotic that will be applied to the eyelid. This will eliminate bacteria on the surface of the eyelid and it will keep the healing area moisturized.In some cases, your veterinarian will prescribe an oral antibiotic that is taken in pill form.

, Your veterinarian may also suggest that you apply warm compresses to the area to minimize swelling and discomfort. Simply wet a clean cloth with warm water, wring it out, and then hold it on your cat's eye for several minutes, or as long as it will let you.Warm compresses that are done regularly with clean cloths can help to clear out any clogged glands. They will also help to keep the infected area clean.
Not all cats will cooperate enough to have this done.

, It is important to make sure that your cat's condition is getting better during treatment. If it is not getting better, and in fact getting worse, you should call your veterinarian and have your cat seen again.

An eye infection that is not treated effectively can become very serious and threaten your cat's sight.
Treating blepharitis can take awhile. As long as the condition is not getting worse, keep doing the treatments as prescribed until your cat gets better."

Have traumatic injuries surgically repaired.,
Administer antibiotics, corticosteroids, and other medications.",How to Diagnose and Treat Bulging Eye in Cats2," If the eye is dislodged and eye socket damaged, the vet will need to perform surgery to put the eye back into place. Alternatively, if the eye is not salvageable, they will remove it.The vet will also place stitches and stents at the surgical site. These will be removed in one to three weeks, depending on the scope of the injury.
The vet may advise dental extractions to release an infection and let it drain out into your cat’s mouth, rather than pushing the eye forward.

, Treating a bulging eye due to a bacterial infection involves a regimen of antibiotic or corticosteroid eye drops, or a combination of the two. Be sure to apply eye drops and any other medications according to the vet’s instructions.In cases of injury, the vet will also prescribe anti-inflammatories and antibiotics, either in the form of eye drops or pills. Be sure to administer these as directed.

Consult with the vet to manage glaucoma.,
Work with the vet to manage feline herpesvirus.,
Discuss cancer therapies with the vet.",How to Diagnose and Treat Bulging Eye in Cats3," Glaucoma is a less common cause of swollen or bulging eyes. However, an injury or infection that resulted in the bulging eye can also cause glaucoma in the future. Glaucoma is incurable, but medications that reduce pressure within the eye and treat inflammation can help manage it.Glaucoma occurs when pressure builds up within the eye due to drainage issues. Injury and infection can cause these drainage issues, so you should take your cat for regular vet exams at least once a year after treating the bulging eye.

, Feline herpesvirus (FHV) causes eye infections like keratitis and conjunctivitis that result in swollen or bulging eyes. This often occurs as a result of the eyelids gumming shut and pus collecting behind them. Carefully bathe the eyelids with water to get them to open and release the trapped infection. FHV-related eye infections can be treated with antivirals, but if your cat tests positive for FHV, it will be a carrier for the rest of its life. However, the virus will go into a dormancy period, and there are steps you can take to manage it.Do your best to reduce your cat’s stress level by giving it loving attention, letting it have its space, limiting encounters with other animals or small children, and keeping it indoors. Stress will lead to more frequent recurrences, or flare-ups, of the virus.

, If a malignant tumor has pushed the cat’s eye out of place, immediate surgery will be required to remove the eye and gain access to the tumor, provided the tumor is surgically accessible. Your vet will likely suggest a chemotherapy regimen in addition to surgical removal.With its high cost and risks, the vet might unfortunately recommend euthanasia over cancer treatment. However, cancer treatment in small animals is a rapidly evolving field, so there might be a therapy or combination of therapies available to manage the tumor."

Find a web spinning spider.,
Create a habitat.,
When the spider completes a web, begin the feeding process.,
Obtain small insects.,
Feed your spider every three to six days.,
Release your spider in autumn.",How to Care for a Garden Spider," Look on trees in gaps in between branches, or in the corners of a shed for a web. If there isn't a spider on the web, try poking the web with a stick to imitate a trapped fly. This will lure out the creature from its hiding place.


When you can see the spider, place a plastic tub (lid off) in front of it on its web and the lid behind. Then, close the tub sealing the spider in.;
, Find a net enclosure for insects like butterflies. If one isn't available you may use a large transparent plastic storage box. Make sure you make breathing holes.


This can be achieved by poking a hot metal skewer through the plastic. Fill the container with bits of branch. Strip off most of the leaves, but leave some for hiding places. Release the spider into the container and put on the lid.

, This may take a day or two.

, Flies work well.


Catch flies in several ways. Try using a small dish of fruit syrup or honey, fly tape, or butterfly nets. Be aware that kitchen garbage is a prime attractant, so you may wish to set up your traps near a garbage receptacle.

, (Longer than this may result in your spider dying of starvation).

, Spiders do not hibernate in warm temperatures, and the supply of flies diminishes dramatically in cooler weather, which makes spider-keeping problematic in winter.

Examine your cat once or twice a month.,
Notice soft masses.,
Look for growths in the ears.,
Pay attention to digestive issues.,
Check for signs of muscle swelling or difficulty walking.",How to Diagnose and Treat Benign Tumors in Cats1," Take the time to examine your cat at home once or twice a month to look for any visible changes or growths. Calm your cat down by petting it or rubbing its belly. When it is calm, continue petting it and pay attention to any new lumps you may feel. Make an appointment with your veterinarian if you notice anything abnormal or new.If you do find a lump, measure it and take a photo. Take a new measurement and photo weekly to monitor it for growth. You can share your measurements and photos with your vet.;
, Lipomas are benign tumors that are made up of fatty tissues. Although they are not cancerous, these tumors are still invasive and can infiltrate the muscles, lymph nodes, joints, and tendons. If you notice a large, soft mass on your cat, make an appointment with your veterinarian so they can properly diagnose and treat the benign growth.Check for swelling in your cat’s lymph nodes.

, Benign growths in the ears, also called otic tumors, grow in the ear canal. Middle-aged cats are more likely to have benign ear canal tumors than senior cats. Examine your cat’s ears, and make an appointment with your veterinarian if you notice any growths in their ear canal.Watch for drainage, discharge, or signs of an ear infection because they can also result from a growth in your cat's ear.

, Vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, or a distended stomach can all be signs of tumor growth in cats. If you notice any of these symptoms, talk to your veterinarian right away.Notice if your cat also has difficulties or changes while urinating., If your cat is experiencing muscle swelling, is limping, or has difficulty moving their joints, that could indicate tumor growth. Pay attention to your cat’s movements, and schedule to visit your veterinary clinic if you notice any difficulties or changes."
"
Take a blood test.,
Ask about fine-needle aspiration cytology.,
Opt for a histopathology.,
Schedule a biopsy.",How to Diagnose and Treat Benign Tumors in Cats2," If your veterinarian finds or suspects tumor growth, they will run a few tests. These tests may require the use of a diagnostic laboratory to study the cells and determine if the growth is malignant or benign. Your veterinarian may recommend that a blood test be performed to determine if a tumor is present. A thyroid tumor, for example, can be diagnosed upon examination and by reviewing your cat’s thyroid stimulating hormone levels in its blood., A fine-needle aspiration cytology describes the method in which a tumor’s cells are extracted. A needle is inserted into the tissue and a syringe uses suction to extract a tissue sample. The tissue cells are studied in a laboratory to determine if it is cancerous or not. This procedure is minimally invasive and does not require general anesthesia., When a histopathology is performed, a slice or sample of the tumor is taken, stained with dyes, and examined under a microscope. A histopathology is usually very accurate in determining if a tumor is benign. This test can usually tell a veterinarian if the tumor could grow into something malignant over time. This can help the veterinarian determine if the tumor should be removed., Biopsies are usually performed when malignancy is expected, but they can help determine whether a tumor is benign. There are multiple ways to perform a biopsy—some only need to remove a small sample of the tumor’s tissue, while others are more invasive surgical procedures where the entire tumor is removed. Afterward, the tissue will be studied in a laboratory and results will be provided in about one week."

Have your cat undergo a lumpectomy.,
Consider cryosurgery.,
Remove tumors by surgery.,
Provide prescribed pain medication.,
Watch for growth.,
Look for signs of pain.,
Eliminate stress at home.",How to Diagnose and Treat Benign Tumors in Cats3," If your cat has a benign tumor on its skin or just below its skin, a lumpectomy may be performed. Your veterinarian will do a complete physical examination on your pet to locate and understand the size of the tumor. Your cat will need to go under general anesthesia, as the veterinarian will need to surgically remove the mass and its underlying tissues.

, Cryosurgery is effective for removing benign, superficial lesions on the surface of the skin.During cryosurgery, the benign tumor is frozen and removed by liquid nitrogen or nitrous oxide. There is little pain for the animal, and the tumor usually falls off or dissolves within four weeks.Most cryosurgeries do not require that the cat be anesthetized, which makes it a great removal option for senior cats., Most benign tumors can be completely removed by surgery. Depending on the tumor location, size, and potential future harm, your veterinarian may recommend leaving the tumor alone since benign tumors are slow-growing.Talk to your veterinarian about your options.


Mammary tumors and the surrounding tissue may be removed surgically. Since tumors in this area can be aggressive, your veterinarian may recommend removing the entire mammary chain as tumors here can metastasize.Non-cancerous bone tumors and cysts are rare in cats, but they can be removed by surgery if they are affecting the cat’s movement. Usually these tumors do not spread, and many will stop growing after the cat has matured., If the benign tumor is causing your cat discomfort, your veterinarian may prescribe pain medication like a NSAID, an opioid, or a corticosteroid. Be sure to give your cat the suggested amount, and talk to your veterinarian about the side effects of the medication., A benign tumor may not need to be removed if it is not causing your cat discomfort, impeding on its ability to move, or disrupting other bodily functions.If the tumor is not removed, it is important to check it regularly for signs of growth or change. If you notice any changes, make an appointment with your veterinarian., If the tumor is not removed surgically, it is important to watch your cat’s behavior and notice any signs that it is in pain. Talk to your veterinarian if your cat’s personality or behavior changes, if it is withdrawn, or if it has trouble moving around. Also watch for loss of appetite and restlessness., Try to create a stress-free environment for your cat to keep its immune system healthy and to help reduce anxiety.Plan to play with your cat every day to stimulate their mind, stick to a schedule, and provide them with safe hiding places where they can retreat.


Leave the carrier in the corner of a room, or leave a closet door cracked so your cat can safely hide. You can even drape a towel over the back of a chair or provide it with a cardboard box to jump in.Reduce the intensity of your usual playtime to make sure that the tumor does not cause your cat pain.
Cats love routine, so try to stick to a consistent feeding, sleeping, and playing routine as much as possible.If you feed your cat every morning at 8 AM, plan to do that every day. Set an alarm on your phone each day so you can remember to play with your cat when you arrive home from work.

Look at your kitten’s eyes.,
Observe your kitten’s behavior.,
Take your cat’s temperature.,
Take your kitten to your veterinarian.,
Administer medications.,
Provide supportive care.,
Schedule a follow-up appointment.",How to Detect Kitten URI or Pneumonia," A URI affects your kitten’s nose, throat, and sinuses,and pneumonia affects her lungs and airways.For both URI and pneumonia, you will probably hear your kitten coughing.The cough with pneumonia is typically deep.Kittens with pneumonia can have difficulty breathing. You may hear your kitten struggling to breathe if she has pneumonia.Sneezing and gagging are associated with URIs.;
, Nasal discharge is seen with both URIs and pneumonia. The discharge is typically green or yellow with pneumonia,indicating some type of infection. With a URI, the discharge may be colored or clear.Check for nasal ulcers as well. Nasal ulcers and oral ulcers are sometimes seen with URIs., With a URI caused by a bacteria (Chlamydia),the membrane that lines your kitten’s eyelids—the conjunctiva—becomes inflamed. This is called conjunctivitis, and would cause your kitten’s eyes to look a little red. Your kitten will likely squint or rub her eyes to try to relieve the discomfort around her eyes.Discharge from the eyes can be seen with URIs.Changes to the eyes are not seen with pneumonia.

, Not surprisingly, your kitten’s behavior will change when she becomes sick. For both URI and pneumonia, your kitten will probably start to become lethargic.In addition, she will eat less because the illness is dampening her appetite.She may also become depressed.These changes in behavior are not specific to either URIs or pneumonia, but generally occur during the course of an illness.

, Since URIs and pneumonia are most commonly caused by some type of infectious agent (e.g., virus, bacteria), either illness will cause your kitten to develop a fever. Take her temperature by inserting a thermometer (preferably digital) into her ear or rectum.


Ear thermometers specifically made for cats and dogs are available at your local pet store, but are generally not as effective as rectal thermometers.To take her temperature rectally, first apply a lubricant (such as KY jelly) to the thermometer’s tip. Then, stick the thermometer into her rectum and wait for about two minutes, or until it beeps.Remember that your kitten is small—you will not need to insert the thermometer in very far to get a reading.
A fever is a temperature over 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius).Your kitten may not stay still long enough for you to take her temperature. In that case, you can rely on her clinical signs to detect when she is sick and needs treatment.

, When you start coughing or developing a case of the sniffles, you can go to your local pharmacy and pick up an over-the-counter medicine that will help you feel better. However, if your kitten is showing signs of a respiratory illness, take her to your veterinarian—do not try to self-diagnose her.The infectious agents that can use URIs can be quite contagious, which is a problem if you have other cats. Self-diagnosing and treating her at home could end up making your other cats sick.
Depending on the severity of your kitten’s illness, she may require intensive treatment by your veterinarian to get better.Diagnosis of a URI is usually based only on clinical signs.If the URI or pneumonia is chronic, or if the initial treatment does not work well, your veterinarian may also perform other diagnostic tests (e.g., chest x-rays, blood tests, analysis of discharge)., After your veterinarian has diagnosed your kitten with a URI or pneumonia, you will need to follow the treatment recommendations to get your kitten back to good health. URIs are usually treated according to the symptoms.Your veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic, such as tetracycline or doxycycline, if the URI has caused a secondary bacterial infection.Although pneumonia is most frequently caused by a virus,it is treated with antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections. Antibiotics are usually given while other test results are pending.Pneumonia can sometimes by caused by fungi or parasites. Test results will determine if other medications will need to be prescribed.Your veterinarian will prescribe a topical medication if your kitten has discharge coming from her eyes,or has conjunctivitis., In addition to the medications, your kitten will need different types of supportive care to help her recover. For example, steam inhalation is recommended for URIs and pneumonia to keep the airways moist. Run the shower in your bathroom to create a steamy, enclosed environment. Place your cat in the steamy bathroom for about 10 to 15 minutes.Wipe the discharge from her eyes and nose with a moist tissue.To increase your kitten’s appetite, feed her a highly palatable canned cat food. Baby food might also work. If your kitten still refuses to eat, your veterinarian can prescribe an appetite stimulant.Make sure your kitten rests during her treatment.Since she will already be feeling tired, it probably won’t be hard to restrict her physical activity.
If your kitten has pneumonia, try to prevent her from lying in one position for too long.If your kitten has severe pneumonia, she will need to receive supportive care at the veterinary hospital to stabilize her before you bring her home. This may include intravenous fluids and oxygen supplementation., This is applicable if your kitten has pneumonia. Your veterinarian will want to see your kitten after a few weeks of treatment. During the follow up appointment, your veterinarian will take more chest x-rays.You may need to bring your kitten in for several follow-up appointments until the x-rays are normal. When they are normal, you can stop giving your kitten the antibiotics."

Look for problems on your cat's coat.,
Feel the cat's body for lumps or abnormalities.,
Inspect the cat's teeth.,
Listen to your cat's breathing.",How to Detect Common Signs of Illness in Cats1," There are a variety of health problems that can show up on your cat's coat. Make sure the cat's coat is shiny and thick, that there are no patches of missing fur, and that your cat is keeping it nice and clean.


Areas of missing fur could signal injuries, like those created during cat fights, that need veterinary treatment. They could also signal allergies or some other auto-immune or skin problem that also needs veterinary treatment.If your cat is not keeping its whole coat clean, this could signal loss of mobility or a different illness that is decreasing your cat's energy.
When looking at your cat's coat you can also spot any fleas or ticks that might be present. Look for ""flea dust,"" which is the excrement of the flea, or flea eggs when brushing your cat.;
, Along with looking at the cat's coat, you should feel the cat's body for injuries or abnormal growths at least once a month. This is one way you can detect internal growths, such as cancers, or painful injuries for the cat.You can do this while you are spending quality time with the cat, for instance when you are petting it on your lap.
If the cat responds in pain when you are feeling its body, then you know that it has an injury that needs further investigation.

, Looking in your cat's mouth will allow you to spot any problems with their teeth, gums, or tongue before they get very serious. Look for discoloration or injuries that could signal a problem, such as pale gums.


If can be difficult to look in your cat's mouth. You may need have someone help you restrain the cat still while you open the cat's mouth and look inside.
While looking in your cat's mouth, make sure that its breath is normal as well. Smelly breath can signal dental problems, such as periodontal disease, or a systemic illness, such as diabetes or kidney disease., If you listen to your cat's breathing on a regular basis you will be able to tell when it changes. For instance, when the cat has a respiratory infection, its breathing will likely sound moist and wheezy. If it has asthma, it will have difficulty breathing, have wheezy breaths, or coughing.If a cat is on your lap and the room is quiet, you should be able to hear its breathing even when it is healthy. Listening to this calm, healthy breathing on a regular basis will help you to spot when the cat's breathing changes.

Look for vomiting and stomach upset.,
Pay attention to changes in appetite.,
Make sure the cat is going to the bathroom normally.,
Notice changes in attitude.",How to Detect Common Signs of Illness in Cats2," One of the most common signs of illness in cats is vomiting. This could signal some sort of short-lived gastrointestinal distress or a much more serious illness, such as cancer.If your cat is repeatedly vomiting, you should have it checked out by a veterinarian.

, A cat that is sick may eat less food and drink less water. This could be due to nausea or simply lack of energy. For instance, one of the first signs of cancer can be lack of appetite. Changes in appetite or water consumption signal that something is wrong with a cat's health and you should take the cat to be seen by a veterinarian.


There are also some illnesses, such as kidney disease, that cause a cat to drink more water than normal.Pay attention to this as well.

, Whether your cat has diarrhea, is urinating profusely, or is not relieving itself at all, problems going to the bathroom can signal that something is wrong with the health of the cat.The best way to keep track of this is by looking in the cat's litter box.


When you are cleaning out your cat's litter box, you should assess whether your cat is relieving itself normally.

, Changes in behavior and attitude can signal a health problem with your cat. Whether the cat is more shy than usual, irritable, jumpy, or aggressive, all of these behaviors can signal that something is wrong with the cat. For example, painful conditions, such as arthritis or dental problems, can change your cat's personality completely.Changes in attitude and behavior can also be caused by stress or changes in the cats life. If you have recently moved or brought another pet into the house recently, for instance, then that may be causing the changes in behavior.

They may lick it or bite at it. They may also scoot their behind across the floor.Your cat does this to try and alleviate the pain and itchiness.;
, The anal sacs are two sacs located on the bottom sides of the anus. The ducts or the sacs can become swollen if there is something wrong. The tissues may become red around the anal area., If the anal sacs or ducts become too impacted, you may notice a red or bloody discharge coming from their anus. You may also notice the discharge of a pus that is thick and a dark color.This discharge may be accompanied by a foul odor.

, Some cats may experience digestive problems. They may have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea. This typically occurs before there are outward signs of problems with the anal sacs or ducts.The cat may also experience constipation or problems defecating., Cats who have an anal sac disorder may start acting differently than usual. They may chase their tails more or excessively lick their posterior area. The cat may also be grumpier than usual and may not respond to their owner’s petting or affection.Your cat may also be more reluctant to sit than usual., Any problems with the anal sacs or ducts needs to be examined by a veterinarian. At the vet, your cat will have a complete physical exam. The vet will also you for a medical history of your cat.You will need to tell your vet about any symptoms or odd behaviors of your cat. This can help your vet more accurately diagnose your cat’s condition. For example, your vet may ask you questions about your cat’s defecating habits, including the size, shape, and frequency.

, If the vet suspects anal gland disease, then they will perform a rectal exam. During the rectal exam, your vet may try to empty out the anal sacs. They will examine the secretions that come out to look for any abnormalities.Generally, this requires your cat to be sedated because it can be uncomfortable.

, If the vet believes your cat has an infection or the anal sacs are abscessed, they may check the white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood. This will help tell them if there is an infection.If a tumor is suspected, the vet may do a serum panel. This will test the cat’s organ function, along with the body’s electrolytes.

, If the vet thinks the cat has a tumor of the anal sacs, they will start with an x-ray of the chest or abdomen. This looks for any tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes or lungs. X-rays show obvious signs of cancer.The vet may also look for tumors via an abdominal ultrasound.

, For many cases, your vet will try to get rid of the fluid impacted in the anal ducts or sacs. Your vet does this with their finger. They will apply pressure to the ducts to push out the fluid. Your cat may need anesthetic during this procedure.This is only done if the sacs are impacted.

, If the sacs are impacted and cannot be manually expressed, the vet may flush and irrigate the anal sacs and ducts. The cat must be put under anesthesia for this procedure. The vet flushes the area with a saline solution.This procedure may also be used if the sacs have ruptured.
The saline solution will help to break down the impacted and firm buildup so it can be removed from the sacs.

, If the anal sac has abscessed, the vet will need to lance it so it can be drained. After lancing the abscess, the abscess is flushed with saline solution to help clear up any backed up or thickened secretions.The cat will need to be under anesthesia for this.

, If there is an infection, the vet will prescribe antibiotics to treat it. The vet may also prescribe antibiotic ointment to rub on the infected area. Topical steroids are sometimes prescribed if the area is inflamed., If the anal sac gets infected or impacted frequently, then the vet may suggest removing the anal sacs. Removal of the sacs is also the treatment for anal sac tumors. This is usually the last treatment considered.Surgery may lead to fecal incontinence and straining when defecating. This may clear up within a few weeks.

To make the solution, mix together ¼ cup of baking soda, 2 teaspoons of dish soap, 1 quart of 3% hydrogen peroxide, and 1 cup of warm water.If you have a large cat, you may need to increase the amount you mix, or just mix two batches.;
, When you put together this mixture, make sure to use a plastic container, like a bucket. Do not place a lid on the container because the gases could build up and explode. Never store leftover solution in a sealed container.Always use caution with this solution and never cover it. This solution can be very dangerous if you cover it.

, Make sure to use the mixture within an hour of mixing. The mixture will lose its potency if left for long periods of time. Ideally, you should put it on your cat immediately after mixing, while it is still foaming.Make just enough to use on your cat. Mix another solution if your cat needs an additional dose.
Toss out any leftover solution once you are finished using it on your cat.

, As soon as you find out your cat has been sprayed by a skunk, wash them. Skunk spray becomes increasingly difficult to remove if it stays on the cat. The odor can permeate the hair and skin if it sits.The spray is oily and seeps into fur and any material it touches. Keep your cat isolated until you clean them.

, Before you bathe your cat, try to clean up some of the spray on your cat’s coat. Use paper towels on the sprayed areas to try to soak up as much as possible. Blot and don’t wipe with the paper towel. Wiping may spread the oil around to unaffected areas., Do not bring your cat into your home if they have been sprayed by a skunk. This could lead to the smell spreading to your furniture or carpet. Instead, set up an area to bathe your cat outdoors.If the cat is inside already, try to contain them in the bathroom and keep them off furniture, rugs, and other materials.

, Dampen your cat's fur with warm water. Then pour the solution onto the cat’s fur. While wearing gloves, spread the solution over your cat’s coat and skin with your fingers. You can also use a sponge to scrub the fur. Leave it on your cat for five to 10 minutes.Don’t get the mixture in your cat’s eyes. Use a cloth dampened with the solution to put the solution on the head.

, After you have let the solution sit as long as needed, rinse all of the solution off with warm water. Make sure to get all of the solution off of the coat. If the smell has not dissipated, apply additional doses of the solution.

, Once it is completely removed from the coat, wash your cat with cat shampoo. Make sure to bathe the cat thoroughly.Rinse the shampoo from the cat’s fur with warm water.

, If your cat’s eyes got sprayed by the skunk, you cannot use the solution for that. Instead, use water to flush the skunk spray out of the eyes. You can also apply mineral oil to the eyes to help with stinging or redness. Then, rinse the mineral oil from the eyes with water.You can also soak cotton balls in water to rinse off the cat’s nostrils and mouth.

, Before you wash the cat, or as you are washing them, you should check for any injuries. In rare cases, skunks can bite or scratch the cat. This may lead to infection or other problems.Skunks can carry rabies. If your cat was scratched or bitten by a skunk, make sure to get them checked out by a vet. If they show signs of rabies, like foaming or drooling at the mouth, get them medical attention immediately.

, Getting sprayed by a skunk shouldn't cause any problems other than a foul odor. However, if your cat got sprayed heavily, you can take them to the vet. The vet will assess their blood work for any problems.The vet will check the blood work again after 72 hours to look for anemia.

, If your cat is a long-haired cat, you may want to cut their hair. This can help remove any remaining odor left on the long hair. You may want to take your cat to the groomers to get them professionally trimmed instead of trying to do it yourself."

Leave your cat in a quiet and undisturbed area to rest.,
Make sure the room is not too hot or overheated.,
Keep your coughing cat indoors.",How to Diagnose a Cat Cough," Coughing cats are relatively rare, so if your cat starts coughing have a look around for any obvious sources of irritation.


Airborne aerosols (deodorants, air fresheners, hair spray, and perfume) are all very irritating to your cat's delicate airways and can may make her cough. Cats are also sensitive to tobacco smoke.
If you suspect an obvious airborne irritant is causing the cough, take your cat outside for some fresh air, or open all the windows to ventilate the room.;
, One common trigger for feline asthma is house dust mites. If possible, keep your pet off soft furnishing, which harbor dust mites, including beds and sofas. Of course, it is pretty difficult to keep cats off of soft furnishings, so if your cat is going to be lounging on your bed or sofa, make sure you vacuum these surfaces every day.


Carpets also harbor dust and dust mites. Vacuum any carpet in your home at least once a week. If the carpets become too difficult to up keep on a daily basis, consider removing them and having laminate or hardwood flooring installed in your home.

, These are all symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infections, which can sometimes cause a cough.


Bathe her eyes and nose to free them from discharges. This will help her to feel better and breath more easily.

, Cats can suffer from colds or flu, just like we can, though it is caused by different bugs so you don't worry too much about cross infection. Your vet can confirm if your cat has an illness.


Your vet may require more rigorous testing, such as an x-ray, to determine how severe your cat's cough is.

, Conditions like a foreign body in the airway (such as a grass awn lodged in a bronchi), bronchitis, asthma, and infection (bacterial, viral, and parasitic) can all cause your cat to cough.


However, it is an interesting fact of nature that cats, unlike dogs, rarely cough as a result of heart disease. This may have to do with the distribution of cough receptors in your cat’s lungs.Due to this wide range of possible conditions, it is important to reach the right diagnosis. Treating a heart worm infection, for example, with an asthma inhaler is unlikely to be helpful. Neither would dosing a cat with anti-parasite products help a cat with a grass awn lodged in their lung.

, A radiography, or x-ray, is the most commonly used test. It produces an image of the cat's chest and lungs.X-rays produce an image by showing the different density of tissue in the body. A dense tissue like bone blocks x-rays (producing white on the image), while air does not block x-rays at all, so the plate will be black. Soft tissue such as the heart, lungs, fat, blood, and muscle have subtly different densities and produce different shades of shadow on the plate.

, These are the left lateral (the cat lying with her left side in contact with the table), the right lateral (right side down) and the dorsoventral (the cat resting on her tummy with the x-ray beam passing first through her spine then her breastbone).


Three views are taken to reduce the risk of missing any pathology in the chest. This can happen if too few views are taken because of your cat’s anatomical quirks.
When the cat rests on her side, the lower lung is compressed by the weight of the heart above it, and the lung above that. This makes the lower lung more dense, which can hide objects such as tumors.
To be certain there is nothing of interest in the left or right lungs, your cat needs to have images taken with her lying on both sides.

, Masses within the lung tissue such as tumors or abscesses tend to be denser than the lung and show up on the x-ray as brighter than the surrounding lung.Unfortunately, due to the laws of physics, it is only possible to see lumps that are greater than 5 mm in diameter. It is not possible to distinguish any smaller lumps from normal lung tissue.
Keep in mind that lung tumors are more likely to cause rapid breathing than coughing in the cat.

, This is fluid contained in your cat’s chest cavity that bathes the outside of the lungs.If sufficient fluid builds up, the pressure causes the lungs to collapse.
This does not usually cause coughing, but if present it will be visible on the x-rays.

, Air travels into the lungs down the windpipe, which then splits up into smaller airways called bronchi, which split into smaller airways called bronchioles. Think of the windpipe as a tree trunk and the bronchi and bronchioles as branches and twigs. If the pipe of the airway becomes inflamed or thickened, which happens with bronchitis and asthma, then the walls show up as a brighter white than the surrounding tissue.Both bronchitis and asthma are a common cause of coughing, so x-rays are useful to visualize the airways and check for this issue.

, Fluid can build up within the lung tissue as a result of heart disease, such as a pulmonary edema, or an infection like pneumonia.While it is not possible to say for sure what the fluid is on an x-ray, there will be clues as to the cause based on your cat's medical history. For example, a cat that does not have a heart murmur but is running a fever and coughing is likely to have pneumonia.
To be sure, it may be necessary to run additional tests. A bronchial wash is the most useful test for fluid build up because it harvests a sample of fluid.

, An inhaled grass awn stuck in your cat’s airway may appear as soft tissue density on the x-ray image, due to the build up of secretions in the lung downstream of the blockage. But the x-ray image cannot distinguish the grass awn from a tumor or a localized infection.


You will need to run additional tests on your cat to get a clearer diagnosis.

, An endoscopy is done with an endoscope, or tiny camera mounted on a fiber optic cable, that is passed down your cat's windpipe to examine your cat’s airways. Your cat will be under general anesthesia during this procedure.An endoscopy is used to look for foreign bodies in your cat's airways such as grass awn and lungworm larvae. Via endoscopy it is possible to see if fluid is present in the airway lumen, and if so, whether it is pus, mucus, or blood.

, Felines tend to have smaller sized airways. This smaller airway diameter means that even a small endoscope will completely fill their windpipe and the cat cannot breathe while the endoscopy is being performed.


To allow your cat to breath, an endoscopy has to be done in short bursts of 30 seconds at a time, with the endoscope removed in between to allow the anesthetist to fully re-oxygenate your cat.

, This procedure is done with your cat under general anesthetic. A fine tube is passed into your cat's windpipe and down into the lungs to where the windpipe divides to the right and left lungs. Around 10 mls of sterile saline is injected down the tube and immediately sucked back up again. The tube is removed and the saline wash is transferred into a sterile container.Like endoscopy, this procedure has to be done quickly, because for the period of time the tube is in their windpipe, the cat cannot breath.

, The samples obtained by a bronchial wash are used in a cytology and in a bacterial culture test.


Cytology is done by using a small sample from your cat’s lungs and looking at it under a microscope to see what cell types are present, from cancer cells to parasite eggs or larvae, to inflammatory cells. This helps your vet make a diagnosis and distinguish any cancer, parasitic lung disease, pneumonia, or allergy cells in your cat.A bacterial culture sample is used in a procedure that grows any bacteria present in the lung sample to find an antibiotic that will effectively kill the bacteria.

, These advanced imaging techniques have very fine resolution and give a 3-D image, unlike an x-ray, which gives a 2-D image. This makes it easier to see small tumors that could be missed on an x-ray, and generally give a much more detailed picture of your cat’s lung pathology., Some cats can work themselves into a panic attack if they are short of breath. The simple act of calming her down can help her to relax and catch her breath.

, Avoid stressing her out, especially before a vet appointment. Keep other pets and children away from her. If she is short of breath the last thing she wants to do is be chased by other animals.

, Overheated areas cause your cat to breath more quickly to cool down. If she is already struggling with her breathing, this will only add to her stress and discomfort.

, Her natural instinct may be to go to ground and hide if she is feeling irritated. If she hides the yard and you can’t find her, she may deteriorate and you wouldn't be able to locate her to take her to the vet.

Look for disorientation.,
Note your cat’s interactions.,
Observe your cat’s sleep pattern.,
Assess your cat’s housetraining skills.",How to Deal with Cognitive Disorders in Cats1," The acronym DISH is a tool to recognize signs of cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) in cats, starting with the letter ""D"" for disorientation. Observe your cat's behaviour for things such as aimless wandering, staring at walls, looking around with confusion, or staying in a corner as if it is stuck. Disorientation might also include loss of balance and falling., For the “I” in the acronym DISH, observe your cat’s interactions to note irregularities or changes. A normally independent cat suddenly becoming clingy may be a sign of cognitive dysfunction, as would a normally affectionate cat avoiding the opportunity to cuddle. If your older cat looks at you with confusion or seems to not recognize you, CDS is a likely reason. , A common symptom of CDS is an altered sleep pattern. If your cat normally sleeps through the night, note if it is demonstrating night owl tendencies instead. This might be evident if your cat sleeps all day, or if it makes noise or vocalizes loudly while you are trying to sleep., The loss of your cat’s long-held housetraining skills may be a sign of CDS. The most obvious example would be your cat’s use (or non-use) of its litterbox. Note repeated incidences of your cat eliminating outside of its litterbox, particularly if the litterbox is clean."
"
Move target items out of your cat’s reach.,
Dissuade your cat with a bad-tasting spray.,
Offer safe alternatives to chew.,
Keep your cat busy.,
Feed your cat more fiber.,
Avoid change to your cat’s environment.,
Buy a synthetic pheromone spray.",How to Deal with Feline Pica2," The first way to deal with your cat’s feline pica is to cut off its access to the items it chews or eats the most. Move plants to high shelves, hide wires and cords (e.g. with plastic tubing) and keep laundry tucked away in drawers or closets. If your cat has a habit of chewing bedclothes, keep it locked out of any bedrooms., To keep your cat from chewing or eating certain items, spray those items with a bitter taste deterrent spray for pets. These non-toxic sprays have an unpleasant flavour that will make once-coveted non-food items unappealing to your cat. Purchase a bitter spray online or at a pet store., If your cat has a compulsion to chew, offer it suitable alternatives like durable chew toys, rawhide bones, or dental sticks. If your cat compulsively eats plants, give it cat-friendly alternatives to your houseplants like a pot of grass or catnip, available at pet stores. Treat-filled puzzle toys will occupy your cat for hours and provide the chewing fix it needs., If you suspect that boredom may be causing your cat’s pica, trying enriching its environment and giving it things to do. Get scratching posts, puzzle toys, cat trees, and interactive games to keep your cat stimulated and busy. Try to engage your cat in at least 15-20 minutes of play each day, such as chasing or hunting games., Ask your veterinarian if increasing your cat’s fiber intake would be a suitable way to curb its feline pica. Your cat’s pica may be due to it not feeling satisfied after eating its current diet, particularly if it is being fed high-carbohydrate dry cat food. High fiber, low calorie food will allow your cat to consume more without increasing its calorie intake, and leave it feeling full for longer. Be sure to consult with your vet before altering your cat’s diet, as a large increase in fiber may cause digestive distress.

, Stress can be a key factor in incidences of feline pica, so minimize stress as much as possible for your cat by avoiding change to its environment. Keep your pet’s litter box, food bowl, bed, and favorite toys in the same spot, and keep a solid routine for meal times. If a life event makes change a necessity (e.g. moving to a new home), keep things as familiar as possible for your cat by providing it with familiar items and introducing change slowly.For example, if you move to a new house, set up all of your cat’s things (e.g. cat bed, litter box, toys) in a small room and let it get settled before introducing it to the rest of its new home.

, Synthetic pheromone sprays mimic a cheek pheromone that cats release when bonding with each other or their owners, creating a calming effect. Ask your vet if this kind of spray would be an effective tool for dealing with your cat’s pica. For example, brands like Feliway, a synthetic pheromone available in spray or room diffuser form, are available through veterinary clinics or online."
"
Bring your cat for a full check up.,
Relay your cat’s symptoms.,
Inquire about medication.,
Ask about synthetic pheromones.",How to Deal with Cognitive Disorders in Cats2," For a clear assessment of your older cat's health, visit your vet for a thorough checkup. A number of ailments commonly affecting aging cats may cause the same sort of symptoms as CDS, so have your vet test for and treat any other illnesses before addressing cognitive dysfunction as a definite condition. Such illnesses could include:Vision loss
Dental disease
Hyperthyroidism
Degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis)
Kidney failure

, If you suspect that your cat is experiencing cognitive dysfunction, relay all the symptoms you’ve observed to your veterinarian. To ensure that you are presenting accurate information to the vet, record your observations in a journal before your visit. Note the frequency and intensity of certain behaviours, and be clear by saying specific things, such as:""My cat has been up every night for the past eight days.""
""It has eliminated outside of its litter box four times this week, even though the litter box was clean.""

, If CDS is affecting your cat, your veterinarian may be able to prescribe medication that will slow down the progress of the condition. While research is still being conducted in this field, the American Association of Feline Practitioners approves the use of the drug selegiline to slow down cognitive impairments and treat CDS in cats. Ask your veterinarian if selegiline would be an effective course of treatment for your cat, and inquire about its possible side effects., Ask your vet if a synthetic pheromone spray could be beneficial for your cat. Sprays like Feliway, a synthetic version of feline cheek pheromone, can have a calming effect on nervous cats and can help them relax. If the spray is approved as a treatment for your cat's CDS-related anxiety, purchase it from your veterinarian’s office or online."

Add an extra litter box.,
Eliminate access to dangerous spots.,
Leave night lights on around the house.,
Maintain a consistent schedule for your cat.",How to Deal with Cognitive Disorders in Cats3," If your cat is demonstrating signs of confusion, or showing signs that it does not remember how to get to its litter box (e.g. eliminating in alternate places), place a second litter box in a more central area. Having multiple litter boxes might help to curb elimination problems by making them easier to find and use. Place the new litter box in the easily-accessible location while leaving the first in its original spot to avoid more confusion., If your cat is suffering from cognitive dysfunction syndrome, it may be more likely to get itself into dangerous situations in its home environment (e.g. getting stuck in a closet or cupboard). Close off any areas of the home that you think might prove problematic for your cat. For instance, keep the laundry room door closed when you are not inside if you suspect your cat might get stuck behind the washer or dryer., If your cat is experiencing a disrupted sleep pattern due to CDS, leave nightlights on around the house so it can navigate more easily. Improved visibility of its surroundings may ease your cat’s nighttime anxiety and help it find its litter box or water bowl with less trouble. Opt for an energy-efficient LED night light, which will last for years and cost as little as 25 cents a year to operate., To reduce disorientation, keep things as predictable and consistent as possible for your cat. Maintain the same food placement and eating schedule every day so that your cat is more likely to recognize when it’s time to eat, and find its food accordingly. Avoid moving around furniture or displacing your cat from its usual surroundings as much as possible (e.g. if your cat spends most of its time in the living room, host your child’s play date with a friend in another room of the house)."

Get an orthopedic bed for your cat.,
Install ramps to help your cat get around.,
Get your cat an appropriate litter box.,
Get accessible food and water dishes for your cat.,
Block off areas that might pose a danger to your cat.",How to Deal with a Paralyzed Cat1," It is very important for your paralyzed cat to have a comfortable, well-padded bed. Orthopedic cat beds are designed to be easy on your cat’s joints and prevent the development of bed sores and other problems that frequently develop in cats with limited mobility. They are also designed to make it easier for cats to climb in and out without bending or crouching.Ask your vet to recommend a good type of orthopedic bed for your cat.
, If you have steps or elevated surfaces in your home that your cat needs to be able to reach, purchase a pet ramp or a set of shallow pet stairs. Ramps can help your cat access areas like beds and other furniture, stairs in your home, and even the litter box. Ramps can be especially helpful if your cat is outfitted with a wheelchair or cart., Using the litter box can be a major challenge for a paralyzed cat. If your cat still has some mobility and is able to go to the bathroom without help, it may be enough to get a very shallow litter box, or a box with a low entrance. Cats with more severe paralysis may need to use training pads or pet diapers.Consider keeping the litter box close to your cat’s bed and other necessities, so that your cat will not have to travel a long distance in order to use the litter.

, Talk to your vet about what types of food and water dishes will work best for your cat’s needs. In many cases, elevated feeders can be useful for cats with limited mobility, since they do not force your cat to bend down or crouch to access their food and water., If you are worried about your cat’s lack of coordination or mobility leading to injuries, consider blocking off areas of your home with elevated or uneven surfaces. You can use a baby gate to block off problem areas, or simply close the door to rooms that you don’t want your cat to access without supervision."

Talk to your veterinarian.,
Give your cat antibiotics or antiviral medicine for skin lesions.,
Treat acne with anti-seborrheic shampoo or benzoyl peroxide gel.,
Use anti-anxiety medicine for over-grooming or hair loss.",How to Deal with Stress‐Related Skin Problems in Cats1," It is important to talk to your veterinarian to discuss the skin condition, discover the underlying cause, and to come up with an effective treatment plan.Provide your veterinarian with your cat’s health history and let them know what symptoms you have noticed. If there have been any big changes lately, such as moving, boarding your cat, or getting a new pet, let them know.Your veterinarian will probably do a complete blood profile to check for underlying conditions.
If they think there may be a neurological cause for their behavior and symptoms, your veterinarian will recommend a magnetic resonance image (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan.
A skin biopsy may be performed on any skin lesions.;
, In addition to causing a number of respiratory problems, feline upper respiratory disease can cause skin lesions on the head, feet, or mouth. Some cats are carriers of the virus and only develop symptoms after a stressful episode like moving or boarding.If you notice these lesions, talk to your veterinarian about prescribing an antibiotic or antiviral medication to treat these symptoms., Feline acne may develop due to stress, poor nutrition, or poor grooming habits. If your cat has feline acne, you may notice some bumps on its chin or lips that look dirty.Your veterinarian may recommend that you use an anti-seborrheic shampoo or benzoyl peroxide gel on the area to treat the acne.


Your veterinarian may prescribe an antibiotic or a corticosteroid if there is a bacterial infection or inflammation on the cat acne.Consult your veterinarian. Feline benzoyl peroxide gel differs from the kind designed for humans.

, Obsessive licking, chewing, and hair loss can be caused by stress or boredom. You veterinarian may prescribe behavior modification medicine to help reduce your cat’s anxiety. In addition, you may need to alleviate stress and anxiety at home by engaging in more frequent play with your cat, or you may need to provide several safe spaces for your cat to safely watch its surroundings.If your cat is experiencing widespread hair loss, ask your veterinarian to check for any underlying causes, such as pregnancy."

Monitor if your cat is urinating normally.,
Check how much your cat is defecating.,
Look for symptoms of constipation.,
Make an appointment with your vet.",How to Cure a Cat of Constipation1," A healthy cat may urinate two to three times a day. Straining to urinate because of a bladder infection, bladder stones or a blockage are serious problems and very different than constipation. Check your cat’s litter box to see how much he is urinating every day.;
, If your cat is spending a lot of time in the litter box, he may be constipated, but he may instead have diarrhea. Cats will spend a long time squatting in the litter box if they have diarrhea. They may produce only a small amount of feces, which could be misinterpreted as constipation.


A healthy cat will defecate about once a day. The cat’s stool should be firm and hold its shape.Many times, it may appear that your cat is constipated, but there are other conditions that look similar at first. You will need to watch your cat closely to make sure there is not a different problem present.

, Your cat may have one or more of the following symptoms; if so, contact your vet to consult about possible constipation in your cat.Straining when trying to defecate
Small, hard, or dry stool
Stool covered in mucous or blood
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Lethargy
Vomiting
Signs of abdominal discomfort

, If you are noticing your cat is spending a long time in the litter box or if you suspect constipation, take him in for an examination with your veterinarian right away. Your vet will be able to determine if your cat needs medication or a diet change, such as a switch to special high-fiber cat food.


Do not leave a constipated cat too long before seeing the vet - it could be a sign of something far more serious than just a passing bout of constipation. The cat can develop many problems from retaining and staining to eliminate stool, including blocked colon and megacolon (an enlarged colon).

Bring a cat carrier.",How to Deal with Car Sickness in Cats," One of the best ways to help your cat get used to car rides is to take short rides. By taking short rides, your cat will be able to experience a car ride and get used to the movement of the vehicle.


Start with a 5 or 10 minute trip around your neighborhood.
Slowly increase the amount of time.;
, By turning the car into a calm and relaxing environment, you’ll settle your cat’s nerves and help it get used to the car ride. In the end, creating a calm environment may help your cat overcome car sickness.


Put on white noise.
Pull some shades down over the back car windows to darken the back seat.
Avoid blaring music.
Ask small children to be quiet and calm.
Make sure to bring plenty of food and water, especially if you're taking a long trip., Make sure to bring as many items as you can to entice your cat. This is important, as you’ll want the cat to have a positive association with the car. In addition, by including treats, toys, and more, you may be able to distract your cat from its anxiety and lessen the chance of car sickness. Bring:


Treats
Toys
A bed, towels, and pillows, Safety is a very important thing to consider when traveling with your cat. This is especially true since your cat could interfere with your ability to drive. However, some safety measures can potentially create anxiety for your cat.


If you use a harness or another device to secure your cat to the seat, make sure your cat is comfortable in it.
Avoid bulky harnesses and other safety devices.
Try equipping your cat with any safety equipment while at home. This way, it can get used to the feeling of a seatbelt harness while not in the car.
Consider using a cat carrier to secure your cat. This way, your cat will be secured safely in an environment it is already familiar with., If you notice your cat gets sick when riding in the car, you should visit your veterinarian and have them examine your cat. Ultimately, you won’t know how to treat or deal with your cat’s car sickness if you haven’t ruled out medical problems.


Describe the problem to your vet. For example, say “Whenever we ride in the car, Yoda starts acting weird and winds up vomiting in the back seat.”, After examining your cat and ruling out any medical conditions, the vet will likely prescribe medication to help your cat overcome the symptoms of car sickness. Depending on the vet, your cat, and other circumstances, this medication may vary.


Your vet may prescribe motion sickness medication.
Your vet may prescribe anxiety medication to help put your cat at ease while it is traveling in the car.
They may prescribe a mild sedative., Other than prescription medication, your vet may be able to make some recommendations that will help you manage and deal with your cat’s car sickness. These recommendations may range from holistic medicine to small tips on how to talk to your cat.


If you’d prefer non-prescription medication solutions, tell your vet. For example, say “Doctor, I want to avoid medications, if possible. Can you give me some tips on other ways of how to help my cat overcome car sickness without medication?”
They may be able to recommend non-prescription treatment like ginger. Ginger may reduce nausea in cats.
Your vet may recommend that you feed the cat earlier than usual so their stomach is not full when they are riding in the car., The inconvenience of dealing with a carsick cat is that their throw up may stain or ruin your car seats. To avoid this you should cover your seats to protect them from stains. Ultimately, there are a wide variety of seat covers you can use. Consider using:


Old towels or sheets
Generic seat covers
Seat covers made for your make and model vehicle

, It is important that you’re prepared to deal with any mess that your cat creates because of their car sickness. As a result, you should travel with all essential cleaning products you may need to clean up their mess.


Bring paper towels or cloth rags to pick up cat vomit or any other mess. You may also need some to wipe your kitty’s mouth.
Pack any cleaning solution you’ll need to clean your car seats.
Include a few plastic bags to put any mess-related trash., Another great way to help deal with the mess of your cat’s ca sickness is to travel with a cat carrier. The cat carrier has several benefits and will help you contain the mess and put the cat at ease.


Your cat may be more comfortable and less anxious in the carrier. This is especially true if your cat spends a decent amount of time in the carrier.
Consider covering the bottom of the carrier with newspapers. This way, if your cat becomes sick, you can simply ball up the newspapers and throw them out."

Talk to your vet about getting a wheelchair or other mobility device for your cat.,
Check your cat for sores and other injuries.,
Watch out for new or worsening symptoms.",How to Deal with a Paralyzed Cat2," Your paralyzed cat will probably have a difficult time with grooming. Many paralyzed cats have problems with incontinence, so your cat may need extra help if they are prone to soiling themselves. You will need to clean your cat every few days (or more often, as needed) to keep their skin and fur healthy and clean.Ask your vet to suggest a healthy cleanser for your cat. A moisturizing cleanser or dry shampoo may be a good option.

, Some paralyzed cats need extra help going to the bathroom. Talk to your vet about the best way to help your cat. You may need to simply place your cat in the litter box from time to time to encourage them to go, or you may have to actually help your cat pee by expressing their bladder., You may be able to outfit your cat with a wheelchair, or cart, to help them get around. Cat wheelchairs typically consist of a pair of wheels positioned on either side of the cat’s hind legs, along with a pair of harnesses that support the cat’s hips and shoulders. If you have a cat with paralyzed hind limbs, a wheelchair or cart can help restore much of your feline companion’s mobility., Paralyzed animals are prone to a variety of injuries and abrasions, which can result from spending too much time in the same position (bed sores), dragging their paralyzed limbs, or simply as a result of lack of coordination when trying to get around. Keep a close eye on your cat and look for any signs of sores, scrapes, and other injuries.Injuries often occur around joints, especially the elbows, ankles, and hips.
Your vet may be able to provide bandages or pads to protect vulnerable areas.
If your cat is unable to turn over or change positions easily, help your cat turn over every few hours to prevent bed sores.
If you notice any injuries, take your cat to the vet right away.

, Ask your vet what sorts of trouble signs to watch out for. If your cat’s paralysis seems to be getting worse, or if you notice new symptoms developing, call your vet immediately, or take your cat to an emergency vet."

Buy a cat tree or tower.,
Provide your cat with hiding places.",How to Deal with Stress‐Related Skin Problems in Cats2," While it may take time, it is important to locate the source of your cat’s stress to help alleviate and treat its skin condition. Cats do not like to have their routine disturbed, so notice if anything in your household has changed. Perhaps you moved, rearranged the furniture, or adjusted their feeding schedule. Think about what environmental changes may have occurred that may have caused your cat to become stressed and anxious.If you just moved to a new apartment or house, bring their items, toys, and blankets into the new space to make them feel more comfortable., Providing a timid or anxious cat with a safe, cat-friendly place to climb can help alleviate its stress. Vertical perches will allow your cat to survey its area from a safe and secure environment. Also, if you have more than one cat, a cat tree or tower can help provide different territory levels in a small space.Buy a cat tree or tower online or at your local pet store. They come in various sizes and heights and cost between $50 and $150., Give your cat a few safe spaces in your home where it can retreat. Leave its cat carrier in the corner of a room, or leave a closet door cracked so it can safely hide. You can even drape a towel over the back of a chair or provide it with a cardboard box to jump in."

Gradually introduce change.",How to Deal with Stress‐Related Skin Problems in Cats3," Physical activity can help exercise your cat and provide stress relief. Plan to play with your cat for 15 minutes twice a day to help stimulate its mind, prevent boredom, and reduce anxiety. Set aside certain toys for your playtime and only use them when the two of you are interacting, and rotate them every few days to keep your cat interested.Use a fishing-rod toy that has a ball or plush toy tied to the end of a string. Encourage your cat to chase and pounce on the toy.
Rub some catnip on one of the toys used during playtime.
Always reduce the intensity of play during the last few minutes. This will help calm your cat down.
Provide your cat with a treat afterward., A cat can be thrown off it there are sudden changes and adjustments to its daily routine. Try to stick to a consistent feeding, sleeping, and playing routine as much as possible.If you feed your cat every morning before you leave for work, plan to do that every day around the same time. Set an alarm on your phone each day so you can remember to play with your cat in the evening after dinner.

, If you do need to change your cat’s routine, do so incrementally to help it adjust to the new schedule.If your working schedule changes, for example, try to push back its morning feeding time by a few minutes each day. If you need to buy new cat carrier, leave the new crate out in the open alongside the old one to give it time to notice the new carrier and adjust to its presence.

Ask your vet if your cat needs medical intervention.,
Administer medication prescribed by your vet.,
Add pureed pumpkin or butternut squash to your cat’s food.",How to Cure a Cat of Constipation2," Your cat may need enemas and/or need to be sedated to have feces manually removed. The longer a cat is constipated, the harder the feces become and even more difficult to pass. An enema is a lubricant that is put into the rectum via the anus, to soften the blockage and help the cat to pass it.The enema may be a a simple micro enema, which is instilled in a similar method to taking a cat's temperature.
For more serious constipation, sedation or a general anesthetic may be necessary in order to wash the bowel out to remove the blockage.
Occasionally, a tumor may be at the root of the problem and require surgical removal. If the cat develops a megacolon from prolonged constipation, where the muscles of the colon can no longer push feces out of the body, the colon will need to be surgically removed.

, If your veterinarian has prescribed medication to manage the constipation, you may need to use a dropper or syringe to give medicine to your cat.


Be sure to have the medication measured and ready before hand. Also have treats on hand for your cat.
Give the cat a treat just before giving the medication.
Put the cat on a waist high surface like a bed or counter with its hindquarters up against you. Give him lots of reassuring strokes and face rubs.
Reach over his head and, with your thumb and second finger, hold his upper jaw just in front of the jaw hinge and press in. Your cat's mouth will open; there might be some paws wanting to interact with your attempts. It is helpful to have an assistant hold your cat's shoulders at the same time.
Hold the syringe or dropper in your dominant hand. Gently push the dropper between your cat's back (or side) teeth, getting it to the back of the mouth. Squeeze the medication out.
Immediately give the cat more treats to take his mind off of what just happened. If the cat is fighting and difficult to control, wrap him tightly in a big bath towel.
When giving liquid medication to your cat, make sure you rinse the dropper or syringe in hot water and dedicate its use to one animal. Discard the instrument after medication is completed.

, If your cat is not completely blocked and still acting and eating normally, try adding pureed pumpkin or butternut squash to his food to introduce fiber into his diet. You can also use canned pumpkin.Add a couple teaspoons of pumpkin into your cat's food. Canned food is recommended because it is easier to hide the pumpkin in canned food than dry food. Some cats may love the taste of pumpkin, other cats will need something like canned food in which to hide the pumpkin by mixing it thoroughly with something yummy.

Feed your cat a well-rounded diet.,
Switch to an all-canned food diet.,
Give your cat fish in moderation.,
Make sure your cat has access to fresh water.,
Keep your cat’s weight under control.,
Add some olive oil to canned food.,
Try psyllium husks.,
Trim hair on long-haired cats.,
Regularly groom long-haired cats.,
Give long-haired cats regular hairball remedies.,
Keep a clean litter box.",How to Cure a Cat of Constipation3," Ensure that your cat is eating a well-rounded diet formulated for cats. If you are not sure what to feed your cat, ask the vet for a dietary plan.


Your cat may require a special high-fiber diet in order to manage chronic constipation. Your veterinarian can help you determine if this is necessary.

, Feeding your cat an all-canned food diet may help with constipation. Canned food typically contains 75% or more moisture and promotes healthy digestion and elimination.

, While an all-fish diet won't supply the nutrients your cat needs, tuna may help stimulate the appetite. Oily fish like mackerel and sardines may help with constipation issues.

, Dehydration will contribute to constipation. Additionally, if your cat eats only dry food, he will need to drink more water than cats getting canned food.


Have a bowl of fresh water in an accessible location for your cat, preferably next to the food dish.Some cats prefer to drink running water like that from a dripping sink or a kitty water fountain.

, Constipation is more common in obese cats than normal weight cats.Consult a resource like the Body Condition Scoring Chart to determine if your cat is too heavy. This chart differentiates among emaciated, thin, moderate, stout and obese body conditions.


If you have any questions, consult your veterinarian.

, Olive oil can act as an intestinal lubricant and help move food through the cat’s body. Add ¼ or ½ teaspoon of olive oil to some canned food.

, Psyllium is the husk of the Plantago seed and is commonly used to aid in digestion and intestinal tract health (common brands for human consumption include Metamucil and Fiberall). Veterinary brands are available at pet supply stores.


Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon of psyllium husks to canned food to add dietary fiber to the diet to help keep digestion moving along.

, If you have a long-haired cat, trim the hair around your cat’s backside, to keep the hair from getting tangled. This will keep the area clean. It can also help prevent constipation. When stool tangles with hair, stool can get held inside the anus and cause constipation.

, Long-haired cats also ingest a lot of hair when they groom themselves. Keep your cat’s coat free of mats with regular grooming.


Some cats may benefit from being shaved down once or twice a year to manage their hair coat.

, Some cats, especially long-haired ones, may need a hairball remedy to reduce the amount of hair in the digestive tract. Hairball remedies are available in various cat-friendly flavors, such as tuna, that provide petroleum-based intestinal lubrication. Long-haired cats will benefit from receiving a hairball remedy a few times per week to keep the hair from accumulating inside the digestive tract.


Some common products include Laxatone and Petromalt, which are available in tubes. They can be offered to your cat as a treat or mixed into his food for easy consumption.

, A clean litter box will encourage your cat to use it regularly. Scoop at least every other day if you have one cat, and scoop every day if you have more than one cat.Some cats dislike strongly perfumed litters, so use litter without an added fragrance.

Find a safe and comfortable habitat.,
Keep your centipede at a reasonable temperature.,
Light your centipede’s habitat to suit its nocturnal state.,
Provide a healthy substrate for your centipede.",How to Care for a Centipede1," Centipedes are very strong and can sneak through small spaces, so it’s important to find a habitat that is difficult to escape from. An aquarium or a large plastic container with a heavily secured top could.An aquarium can be a great place for your centipede. For a large centipede, choose a 20-gallon tank, and a 10-gallon tank for a small centipede. In both cases, make sure you have a screen lid with securing clips.You can also use a large plastic container to house your centipede. A 9-10-inch plastic tub with a secured lid and perforated top could work. However, be warned that it is possible for centipedes to chew through these tubs.;
, Most centipedes can be kept at a safe temperature of roughly 80 degrees or higher. Additionally, centipedes need a humid environment of roughly 75%-85% humidity.You can use a heating pad, night bulbs or ceramic heaters to make sure their habitat is warm enough. You should also worry about keeping the humidity up for your centipede, however, since each of these methods could dry out your cage.
You can use a dish filled with water to keep their habitat humid enough. It will need to be regularly filled to maintain proper humidity.

, Centipedes are nocturnal creatures, so they do not require special lighting. If you want to observe the centipede during the evening, you can get a nocturnal light, like those used for amphibians.Your centipede’s habitat should not be brightly lit. During the evening hours, their cage should be kept in a dimly lit area.
To observe your centipede during the evening, get a nocturnal light that gives off heat without much light. You can see the centipede, but it will still think it’s night in the habitat., Centipedes like to burrow during the day. It’s important to have substrate that is deep enough for your centipede to burrow underneath.The substrate should be at least as deep as the centipede is long. They prefer to be hidden away during the daytime hours.
You can use a variety of materials for your substrate. It should be able to retain moisture and tolerate the centipede’s burrowing. You can potting compost, peat moss, or soil for the substrate. Peat moss is the best since it prevents mold growth due to the habitat’s high humidity.

, Attach a heat mat and keep it between 20 - 35 degrees, depending on the type of millipede. Place a thermometer to monitor the temperature.

, Provide artificial or natural wood for them to climb and hide under.

,,, Millipedes also need calcium, so give them crushed eggshells or cuttlebone.

, Sometimes it will curl up into a tight coil because it is nocturnal. Under right conditions, they will reproduce naturally. Have fun with your millipedes.

Buy your millipedes.,
Purchase a cage.,
Choose the right environment.,
Keep the cage clean.",How to Care for Giant African Millipedes1," In order to care for your millipedes, you need to purchase them. Most traditional pet stores will not have this species on hand. It is best to search for a reputable online retailer.Run an internet search for ""purchase Giant African Millipedes"". Once you have found some companies that sell them, do your background research.
Read reviews of current customers. Look for a company that has a satisfied customer base.
Make sure that the company has experience shipping Giant African Millipedes. You want to make sure that yours arrive safely.
Giant African Millipedes are legal in the U.S. But if you live with your parents, it's a good idea to ask permission before buying.;
, Head to your local pet supply store to buy a good home for your millipedes. Look for the type of clear plastic or glass tank that houses small pets and reptiles. You want to make sure that it has a lid that has multiple air holes.Depending on how many millipedes you have, you will need either a 5 or 10 gallon tank. Millipedes can live comfortably in groups, but they need space to stretch out and move around.
The cage you purchase should be at least twice as long as your largest millipede. For example, if you have a 12 inch millipede, your cage should be 24 inches long.
When the millipedes are babies, they can live comfortably in a small plastic container. Just make sure that there are air holes in the lid.

, Once you have the right cage, look around your home to find the best possible location. Millipedes do best when the temperature is about 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit. Consider keeping them in a small room of your house that you can keep warm.Make sure that your millipedes do not get too cold. They will not thrive in low temperatures.
If necessary, you can purchase a heating pad to place under the cage. Ask an employee at the pet store for a recommendation.
Keep the cage inside your house, not in a garage or in an outdoor garden shed.

, Millipedes do not need toys or any decorations for the cage, but they do need a clean environment. Set aside time once a week to clean the cage.Remove your millipedes to a temporary home. If you have a backup tank, that is best.
Remove old food from the cage. Using a paper towel or cloth, wipe up any excrement that is on the floor of the tank.
Using a mild soap as a cleanser, gently wipe down all surfaces of the tank. Dry with paper towels or a clean cloth.
Clean more regularly if you have multiple millipedes sharing the same cage.

Scrub the tank.,
Rinse the enclosure with water.,
Dry the tank and furnishings.,
Repeat this process once per week.,
Provide vegetables and fruit.,
Add ground cuttlebone.,
Try offering your millipede some treats.,
Feed your millipede once per day.,
Place a shallow ceramic dish for water.,
Wash your hands after handling your millipedes.",How to Make a Millipede Habitat," A glass or Plexiglas aquarium is ideal for housing millipedes. You can find one of these in a pet store. Such a tank will allow you to easily observe the millipedes and control the lighting. Plexiglas (hardened transparent plastic) will be lighter in weight, so this may be the best choice if you plan to take your millipedes along with you now and then. Get an aquarium in the 5 to 10 gallon range.You should also get a metal mesh screen lid to put on top of your millipede’s enclosure. Make sure that you can secure the lid so that your millipedes will not escape.
Wider cages are better for observing your millipedes than taller ones because millipedes spend at least as much time hiding as they do climbing.;
, Substrate is a mulch-type material. You can buy substrate commercially, but it is composed of natural materials. Add substrate composed of damp sphagnum moss and bark to your millipede’s habitat.You can put substrate material along the bottom of the tank.
Layer the substrate as deep in the tank as your millipede(s) are long. If you have more than one millipede, then use the longest millipede as your guide.
Don’t use gravel or artificial turf in substrate. They are too harsh for the millipedes.

, Millipedes will climb along any surface provided in the tank. These creatures also prefer secluded spots out of direct light exposure. Hideaways are good additions that satisfy both of these instincts in millipedes.Try placing some tree bark, half a coconut, a small pile of rocks, or some old wood in your millipede’s habitat.
Some pet stores also sell habitats for insect pets or small sections of hollowed out log to lay in the middle of the tank. Sometimes you can find these logs covered in a resin, which makes it easier for millipedes to climb them.
You may also want to bury part of the hideaway into the substrate to allow the millipedes to burrow.

, Millipedes need a warm and humid environment to thrive. Room temperature is usually enough to allow the typical millipede species to thrive. Make sure ambient temperature in the tank stays between 60-78°F (15-26°C). Humidity should be kept around 75 to 80 percent in the tank’s vicinity.Regulating the temperature and humidity is necessary to keep the millipede hydrated, ensure that the substrate stays moist, and to assist with molting.
You can keep more moisture in the tank by putting water in a bowl in one corner of the habitat. You can also layer a sheet of wax paper between the metal lid and top of the cage—but poke pinholes in it for ventilation.

, Millipedes are nocturnal creatures, which means that they sleep during the day, and are more active at night. Put the tank in a place away from direct sunlight or other intense sources of light. Use a red or blue colored bulb to observe the nightly activities of your millipedes.Try setting up an automatic light timer for your millipede habitat. You can set it so that the light goes off when the sun goes down and turns back on when the sun comes up. This will ensure that the enclosure is not being lit all of the time.
Try looking at your millipedes under a black light. Some parts of a millipede’s body will glow under a black light., You should only put millipedes that are the same species in the same tank. There are risks that competing species may consume the eggs, food, or injure one another if left together.If you want to breed your millipedes, then keeping other species in the same tank may interfere.

, Prepare a 3 percent bleach solution in water (1 part bleach, 6 parts water). Get some scrubbing brushes or a toilet bowl type brush (one that has never been used in a toilet). Dump out the substrate into trash bags and dispose of it. Then, dip the brushes into the bleach solution, and scrub any internal hideaways and furnishings in the habitat. Set them aside on a paper towel. Use a larger brush to scrub the inner portions of the tank itself with the bleach solution.Wear rubber gloves when you clean your millipede habitat.
Remove the millipedes to a temporary habitat before you start cleaning. For example, you can put them into a shoebox.

, Run each of the furnishings you just scrubbed under some water to remove the bleach solution. Use a clean brush or towel to wet-wipe the inner portions of the tank and take care of any remaining bleach solution residue., Towel or paper-towel dry the inner portion of the tank completely. Do the same for each of the furnishings including the hideaway. Add in a fresh batch of substrate, and then reintroduce the hideaway and furnishings before putting the millipedes back in.Make sure that you dry the enclosure well before replacing the habitat materials and millipedes.

, It is important to keep your millipede’s habitat clean, so make sure that you clean it at least once per week.Choose a specific day when you have time to clean the enclosure well.


You can also spot clean your millipede’s habitat any time during the week. Spot cleaning may just involve wetting a paper towel and wiping one area of the inside of the enclosure that looks soiled.

, Millipedes will eat almost anything, but they are fond of certain fruits and vegetables. Make sure that any fruits and vegetables that you offer your millipede is cut into very small pieces. Discard any uneaten food after a day to prevent it from molding and rotting in your millipede’s habitat. Some good choices for your millipede include:fresh romaine (not iceberg) lettuce
squash
melon
banana
apples
cucumbers

, You can also feed your millipede some ground cuttlebone for a supplement of lime salts. This will help to ensure that your millipede stays healthy.You can just sprinkle a little of the ground cuttlebone onto the substrate in your millipede’s enclosure


You can purchase ground cuttlebone in most pet stores.

, Millipedes are omnivores so you may want to experiment with some different foods now and then. Just make sure that any treats you give your millipede are given in moderation, such as once or twice per week. Some treat foods that you may want to offer your millipede include:dry dog or cat food
mushrooms
rotting leaves and wood
fish food
table scraps

, Make sure that you offer your millipede fresh food every day. You might have to experiment with the amount that you need to give your millipedes at first to see how much they are eating each night. Throw out uneaten portions in the morning and replace with new food., Your millipede will need a supply of fresh clean water at all times to stay hydrated. Change your millipede’s water daily and check it often to ensure that it is clean. If you notice any debris in the water, then change it for fresh water.Make sure that the water is chlorine free.
It is also a good idea to add a sponge or some pebbles to the bottom of the dish to prevent the millipede from drowning. If you use a sponge, then you will have to replace it frequently due to bacteria growth.

, It is best not to hold your millipedes too much. When you do hold your millipedes, make sure that you wash your hands before and after. Their secretions can sometimes be harmful, so don’t allow a millipede’s secretions to come into contact with your eyes, mouth or an open wound."

Take your cat to the vet for evaluation.,
Work with your vet to understand the reason for your cat’s paralysis.,
Give your vet as much information as possible.,
Follow your vet’s treatment plan.,
Talk to your vet about getting physical therapy for your cat.",How to Deal with a Paralyzed Cat3," If your cat is showing new or worsening symptoms of paralysis, take them to the vet immediately. Your vet may be able to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the paralysis. Common symptoms of feline paralysis may include:The inability to move some or all of the legs.
Limb weakness.
Dragging the rear legs while walking.
Pain in the neck, back, or legs.
Insensitivity to pain in the extremities.
Difficulty using the litter box. This could take the form of incontinence (urinating or defecating outside the litter box, or dribbling urine) or the inability to urinate or defecate.

, Feline paralysis can have many causes, including stroke, injury or infection in the spine, certain infectious diseases (like toxoplasmosis or an infection caused by a tick bite), blood clots, or cancer.Depending on the cause of your cat’s paralysis, treatment could involve surgery, or it could be as simple as a course of antibiotics.

Your vet may need to run laboratory tests on your cat’s blood or urine, or do diagnostic imaging (e.g., and X-ray, MRI, or CT-scan).

, You can help your vet diagnose your cat’s condition by providing any information you have about the cat’s symptoms and recent health history. For example:

Did your cat recently fall or experience some other injury?
Was your cat bitten by a tick?
When and how quickly did the paralysis symptoms appear?
Does your cat have any other symptoms aside from the paralysis (e.g., coughing, difficulty breathing, cold paws, dilated or unresponsive pupils, any unusual behavior)?

, Once your vet determines a likely cause for your cat’s paralysis, you will need to carefully follow your vet’s recommendations for treatment and aftercare.Depending on the severity of the paralysis and the type of treatment, your cat may need to spend some time in the veterinary hospital before coming home. This is especially likely if your cat is unable to urinate, defecate, or eat without help.
Pay careful attention to your vet’s instructions on caring for your cat at home, including information on how to give your cat any medications they might need, how to care for your cat after a surgery, and any trouble signs to look out for (like new or returning symptoms).

, In some cases, physical therapy can help relieve symptoms of feline paralysis. Consult with your vet before attempting to start any sort of physical therapy, as beginning exercise too early may aggravate your cat’s condition and make recovery more difficult or even impossible. Talk to your vet about how long to wait before starting physical therapy, and ask about what kinds of exercises might be appropriate for your cat."

Feed your centipede properly.,
Feed your centipede insects.,
Give your centipedes soft-bodied prey.,
Provide your centipede with arachnids.,
Feed your centipede small animals.,
Have water available for your pet centipede.",How to Care for a Centipede2," Centipedes like to eat live prey. Keep a regular supply of different live creatures for your pet centipede. They are fascinating to watch eat, since they are very quick and assertive when hunting.Feed your centipede at least twice a day. If there is any food left in their habitat after feeding, remove it with forceps from the habitat.
Your centipede can be injured if it has to fight its prey. Don’t give your centipede any live animals bigger than half the size of the centipede.

, Smaller centipedes eat small insects, including fruit flies, carpet beetle larvae, and small crickets. As your centipede gets larger, you can give them cockroaches, adult crickets, and silverfish.


Your centipede needs to be able to safely hunt live prey. Insects give to the centipede should be smaller than your centipede.
Do not feed your pet centipede wild insects. Wild insects could have been in contact with pesticides that could be lethal to your centipede. Purchase small insects at a local feed or pet store.

, Earthworms, slugs, and snails can work as live prey for your centipede. Be careful that the soft-bodied prey has not been exposed to harmful chemicals.


Centipedes should be able to handle soft-bodied prey easily. Only the smallest centipedes could have problems hunting an earthworm.
Buy soft-bodied prey at a feed or pet store. You can usually get earthworms at a local fishing or tackle shop.

, Centipedes love to feed on live prey, and arachnids (spiders) are a favorite treat. Your centipede will use its venom to paralyze the spider before feeding on it.


Be sure any arachnid you provide your centipede is not venomous. Venomous spiders may hurt or even kill centipedes., Very large centipedes can eat small animals, including mice, lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, or bats. Mice and frogs may be easiest to find and feed your centipede.


Use lizards and rats for a very large centipede. They should be able to use their venom to safely neutralize these animals and eat them.
You can also feed a giant centipede raw or cooked chicken, though it usually prefers to hunt animals.
Your centipede may not eat all prey. If it sits for 24 hours without being eaten, get rid of it to avoid rotting., Water provides centipedes with the right amount of humidity. It can be used by the centipede to stay hydrated. The water may come from a water dish or from everyday misting.Centipedes get most of their water from their food. However, a water dish is necessary to maintain the proper humidity level in their habitat.
Use enough water to keep your centipede from drying out. When they dry out, it is usually caused by loss of moisture through the spiracle openings.

Don't put multiple centipedes in together.",How to Care for a Centipede3," Handle it so with thick gloves and tools used for manipulating snakes. Avoid handling your unless absolutely necessary.Centipede venom is not deadly to humans. It can cause many problems, including fevers, dizziness, and difficulty breathing. Additionally, their venom can also cause allergic reactions.
Use protective gloves if you must handle your centipede. Centipedes can be deceptively quick, so make sure your gloves cover enough of your arms as well.

, Centipede’s bodies can be sensitive to being handled. Be careful to not squeeze it too hard or allow it to fall out of your hands.


Maintain a gentle, yet firm grip on your centipede. You want to be careful not to injure it, but you keep control of its movements.

, You can try to handle your centipede again when it has calmed down.

, Centipede bites are not usually fatal, but can be very painful. Ice them immediately to keep down the swelling. If necessary, consult a doctor.


Centipede bites consist of two puncture wounds with redness and swelling. They may occasionally cause headaches or dizziness as well.Wash out your centipede bite with warm water and soap. Ice the bite or use analgesic gel if the area is swollen.
If the bitten area does not stop hurting after a day or so, consult a doctor. See a doctor immediately if you have any other symptoms, including rapid heartbeat or a fever. You may be having an allergic reaction.

, Centipedes do not do well with other centipedes in captivity. If you want to have multiple centipedes as pets, keep them in separate habitats.

Feed your millipedes.,
Provide a moist environment.,
Handle them carefully.,
Monitor their health.",How to Care for Giant African Millipedes2," As with any pet, you will need to feed your millipedes a healthy diet. Millipedes are detritivores, which means that they feed off of decaying live matter in their environment. In the wild, this means trees, moss, and other plants.You can feed your millipedes a wide variety of produce. Try cucumbers, lettuce, and zucchini.
Giant African Millipedes will also eat grapes, yams, and apples.
You can place the produce in the cage and the millipedes will eat it over the course of the day. Just add more food when they are running low.

, Make sure that the atmosphere in the cage meets the millipedes' moisture needs. Millipedes thrive in slightly damp soil. Add some soil and some moss to their cage. You can purchase this at gardening stores, and it provides the needed moisture.Purchase an organic soil with no added chemicals.


You do not need to provide water unless the cage is in a very dry area. If you are concerned, you can soak some cotton wool in water and place that under the soil or moss.
You can also use a spray bottle to mist water into the cage. Do this every couple of days.

, You can touch your millipedes, just make sure to be gentle. Pick them up using two hands and hold them lightly. Remember, millipedes can be very long, so you want to support their entire body.Millipedes do not sting or bite. They will not harm you.
If you have children, you can teach them to gently hold the millipedes. This will be a great learning experience.
Millipedes often curl into a tight ball when scared. If this happens, place them gently back in their home.

, Millipedes are typically sedentary during the day. At night, they generally like to move around their cage and interact with other millipedes. If you notice that your millipede is not moving much, it could be a sign that it is unhealthy.Another warning sign to look for is remaining tightly curled. Millipedes curl up when they are scared or threatened. If it doesn't relax, it may not feel well.
Contact a zoo to ask how to treat an ill millipede. Since they are not native to the U.S., many local vets won't have experience handling them.

Do your research.,
Ask questions.,
Teach others about millipedes.",How to Care for Giant African Millipedes3," Before bringing any pet into your home it is important to learn about the species. Make sure that you are fully prepared to care for your millipedes. Find out how much you are going to spend on supplies and housing and add that into your budget.Giant African Millipedes have a typical lifespan of 5-7 years. Take this into account when considering purchasing some. They are not short-term pets.
You should know that Giant African Millipedes will breed. It is very hard to tell whether you have a male or female, so don't count on preventing breeding. Be prepared to buy additional cages if breeding occurs.

, Talk to an expert before deciding to raise Giant African Millipedes. Ask your local veterinarian if he has any experience with the species. Your local zoo can also be a resource.Contact the zoo nearest you and ask if they can provide you with information on Giant African Millipedes. You can also take a field trip to visit the bug exhibit at the zoo.
Ask for additional tips about housing and feeding.

, If you find that you have a passion for raising Giant African Millipedes, you can find ways to share your knowledge. If you are a student, ask your science teacher if you can bring your pets in to show your class. They are really interesting to observe.


Join an online message board. You can talk to other millipede owners about their ideas and experiences.

Make sure your hotel is on a flat surface.,
Try an old birdhouse.,
Use pallets and cinderblocks.,
Construct a box from cedar pieces.,
Consider the type of bugs in your area.,
Create holes.,
Gather materials outside.,
Add straw and hay.",How to Make an Insect Hotel," When looking for a location for your hotel, find an area in your yard close to other wildlife features. These are areas where it's likely bugs already linger. If you have a pond, this may be a good location. You may also want to set up your hotel near a bush, tree, or shrub., An insect hotel is meant to cater to a variety of insects. Invertebrates often prefer dark and damp environments, while bees and butterflies like sunshine. You want to place your hotel in an area that gets both sun and shade.An area near a large tree or hedge can be particularly helpful when it comes to catching shade and sunlight.
You should be conscientious of shade and sunlight while assembling your hotel. Hive-like structures and nectar-producing plants cater to bees and butterflies, and should be placed on the sunny site. Dry twigs, straw, and hay cater more to invertebrates, and should be placed in the shade.

, You do not want your hotel to fall over. This could injure and potentially kill insects that seek shelter. Therefore, make sure the surface where you set your hotel is level. If you find a surface is bumpy or uneven, pick another spot for your insect hotel., You may not want to make an incredibly big insect hotel. If you're just looking for something small to place in your backyard, go for an old birdhouse. An old wooden birdhouse can be easily repurposed as a bug hotel.You can really use any old wooden box. If you're no longer using a small chest or toy box, you can use this as the structure of an insect hotel. It's better to reuse materials than to end up throwing them away.

, Some people want a very large insect hotel. This can be easily made by using old pallets and cinderblocks to create a tall structure. If you don't have old pallets lying around, you can make a trip to the hardware store. However, any long flat object, like old boards of wood, can be used instead.The process is fairly easy. First, you'll have to select where in your backyard you want to place your structure. Then, place four cinderblocks on the ground in a rectangular shape. Then, lie the pallets across the cinderblocks to form a floor-like rectangular structure.
Take four more cinderblocks. Place them on top of where the lower cinderblocks are, so the pallets are sandwiched between two cinderblocks. Then build another floor. You can add as many stories as you would like to your bug hotel,

, You can also build your own structure for an insect hotel using cedar pieces. Much like an old birdhouse, cedar pieces will make for a fairly small hotel. You will need two cedar pieces of 5 1/2″(h) x 5 1/2″(w) for the top and bottom. The back panel will be 12″(h) x 5 1/2″(w). The right and left panel will be 12″(h) x 4 3/4″(w). You can get cedar cut at a local hardware store.Use a power drill to drill holes in the cedar box, and then use weather resistant screws to piece the different parts together.
There is no strict order for how you piece the box together as you go. It may be easiest to screw the right and left panel on to the top and bottom panel. This will give you a rectangular outline, which you can easily place over the bottom panel. Then, you can drill the bottom panel in place.

, Ideally, an insect hotel will be appealing to a wide variety of bugs. However, there may be a particular type of bug you want to attract. You may also know a certain type of bug is particularly prevalent in your backyard. In this case, you may want to prioritize certain materials when filling your insect hotel.Bees are a particularly popular guest of insect hotels. Rolled up bits of paper and leaves can be used to provide hive-like holes for bees. If you have a lot of bees in your yard, creating a bee-friendly insect house keeps them from building hives in unwanted areas.
Dry materials, like straw, hay, and leaves, are great for invertebrates. Invertebrates include worms, crickets, cockroaches, millipedes, and mosquitos.If you have a lot of butterflies and bees in your yard, you may want to put potted nectar-producing plants in your insect hotel.

, Many different types of bugs like to have crevices to hide in. It's a good idea to have at least one section of your insect hotel full of holes.Hollowed out plant stems can be put into an old pieces of drain pipe. You can then place that drain pipe into a section of the insect hotel, which makes an excellent shelter for bees.
You can also roll up paper to make holes, and pack one section of the hotel full of rows of rolled up papers.It's good to have holes of a variety of diameters, as this caters to many different insects.
You can also drill smaller holes into a piece of wood. You can then set this piece of wood into one corner of your hotel. Small holes may be better for smaller insect., You want to fill your insect hotel with as many items as possible. Once you've made a few sections dedicated to holes, find materials outside. Place these materials in other sections of the insect hotel, forming a busy habitat that caters to many different types of bugs. You should look for the following when building your insect hotel:Dead wood
Dry leaves
Old bark
Dry sticks and twigs, In addition to gathering materials outside, you should purchase straw and hay for your house. Straw and hay create cracks and crevices. They also provides invertebrates the option of burrowing and hibernating in the soft material."

Do your homework.,
Research your first pet well.,
Catch it.,
Quarantine your pet.,
Make it a home.,
Dump in the bug.,
Know what your insects will do.,
Supply ""prey bugs,"" common bugs that can be used as food.,
Document all your animals.,
Enjoy your cheap, wonderful, low-maintenance pets!

",How to Make an Insect Zoo," Research different animals in your area. (They don't all have to be bugs.) Then, decide on your first pet.;
, Say if you are going to collect a stag beetle, do extra research. Look up its feeding habits, where it lives, where you'll find it, and its life cycle. Go ahead and create a card which will tell zoo visitors all about the stag beetle.

, There are literally hundreds of ways to do this. It is easiest just to catch it with your hands or a net. Watch and wait for your chance, then grab it.

, Not really. Just put it in a jar with some cloth over the top for ventilation. That way, it won't run away as you make its home.

, Would you want to live all your life in a jar? Right. So, first, put some dirt, real dirt - not mulch, in the bottom of your container. Then, put some sticks, leaves, and rocks in it too. Soak a paper towel in water and stick it in. Do not wring it out.

,


If you get so hooked that you are thinking of breeding, you need to find a male and female (called a breeding pair). Put the male and female together. Like always, research. Learn about what form of breeding the insect takes (live bearing, egg laying, cocoon?).

, Believe it or not, some parent bugs are cannibals, so as soon as eggs or kids appear, give them a separate home.

, If you have a carnivore bug such as a spider, centipede, or certain beetles, etc., they will need a diet that is close to what they might find in the wild. Capture the common bugs around your home, like flies, and introduce them into the jar.

, Provide names or numbers, sex, age (if known), species, and feeding habits. It's super fun to do.You are creating a database for your zoo!

Check for weta in your garden.,
Select suitable bamboo to create the weta home.,
Drill an entrance hole into the piece of bamboo.,
Attach the bamboo home somewhere suitable for the weta to find and move in.",How to Make a Weta Home in Your Garden," Even urban gardens have their fair share of this amazing insect, which actually has six sub species. It could be useful to assume you have them, as providing the housing may encourage them even if they're not spending much time in your garden already.;
, Find a sturdy piece of bamboo of a length at least 10cm or more and of a good width––weta are long and quite large.


It is important that the bamboo be dry, untreated by any chemicals and not already housing any other insect. Look for pieces from a garden growing bamboo organically or ask at your local nursery.

, Weta like holes that are small and are placed at the entrance––they will happily squeeze into the hole to enter the bamboo. Provided they enter a large living area inside, this is ideal as they'll feel safer with the small entrance way to keep out other insects. You might also consider making a few extra small holes along the length to give the weta some choice but don't overdo it, as the weta needs a solid resting space.


If there are large holes, fill these in with cork, leaf matter or similar items. Make the house cosy.

, This might be on a tree, fence post or other elevated place that the weta can climb to. Tie it on solidly using twine, bendable twist ties or similar strong binding materials. Check that it is solid and won't move in the wind before leaving it to be inhabited.

Know their behaviour.",How to Recognize Giant Carnivorous Centipedes," It is usually found throughout Australia (except for Tasmania) Oceania, (New Guinea, Solomon Islands) and in Indonesia, Southeast Asia and China.If you live anywhere in these areas, you can ask locals for their knowledge about the extent and location of these centipedes.;
, These centipedes usually range from dark blue-green-brown to orange yellow with black stripes. The underside and legs are yellow. The antennae are usually yellow too, but sometimes these are found in darker colors.

, Giant centipedes usually have long and flattened bodies, 25 or 27 body segments, and 21 or 23 pairs of legs. They measure around about 16 centimeters (6.3 in) in length.

, They usually look like large pinchers at the bottom on the head.

, They are solitary, terrestrial, and nocturnal, so you probably won't see them running all about during the day.  Giant centipedes can be found in dry and moist areas.

, As their name indicates, the Peruvian giant centipede (also known as the Amazonian giant centipede) lives in parts of South America and the Caribbean. They prefer tropical or subtropical areas and are most common in St Thomas, Grenada, Jamaica, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, St Martin, Trinidad, and the northwestern regions of South America. You can check for their popularity in your area.

, These insects are usually very large, being among the largest of all centipedes, ranging in length from 9 to 12 inches. Their body typically consists of 21 to 23 well-marked segmented areas with a pair of legs on each segment. The head is covered in a shield, from which protrudes a pair of sensitive antennae. Near the head is also located a pair of modified legs with sharp claws called forcipules. The body is a coppery orange to maroon color with black bands, and the legs (and underbelly) are yellow, as its name suggests.

, These centipedes are jumpy and can move very quickly if disturbed, and can climb most vertical surfaces. This centipede is known for its extreme aggression when looking for food and can kill and eat most small animals such as birds, lizards, and mice. They are nocturnal and usually hide during the day.

Plant some weeds in the soil.,
Decorate with some sticks and other hiding spots.,
Catch some critters for your terrarium.,
Feed the new residents with fruit and vegetables.,
Keep the terrarium covered.,
Make sure the soil is damp.,
Store the terrarium in a safe location.,
Remove uneaten food.,
Replace the soil every week.",How to Make a Bug Terrarium," Plastic bug containers can be bought at pet supply stores. They come with lids that have air holes and a handle for easy transportation. You may also use glass objects such as a mason jar, an aquarium, or a fish bowl.Other containers, like cardboard boxes, should be avoided. Over time they’ll fall apart due to moisture.
For larger insects like walking sticks and praying mantises, make sure the container is at least twice as big as their body width and three times as big as their height.;
, A thin layer of either substance helps drain water from the soil. This prevents the soil from getting too damp and rotting any plants you include in your terrarium. Look for bags of sand or pebbles near the reptile and fish sections of pet stores.You may also cover this layer with a half an inch (1.3 cm) of activated charcoal. Charcoal can be found at pet supply stores. It reduces the smell in terrariums with growing plants.

, It’ll be fun to watch your bugs explore, so make the dirt deep enough to hide in. Add between two to four inches (five to ten cm) of soil. Get your hands dirty by using soil from outside. Ask your parent's permission first before digging up their garden bed!You may use potting soil, but outdoor soil is familiar to bugs. Potting soil has chemicals that may harm some critters.

, An easy way to get plants for the terrarium is to go outside and dig up unwanted weeds. Weeds are best since parents will be happy to see them gone. Gently remove them from the soil. Make a hole in the terrarium and set the plant in it.Green, healthy plants are the ones that serve as the best food. Keep in mind that some bugs, such as walking sticks, only eat fresh leaves., Bugs love hiding spots. Explore near your home for places where bugs like to hide. Small branches, rocks, or pieces of bark form perfect bug homes within your terrarium., Have fun overturning your yard in search of bugs. They’ll be in the places you thought of earlier, such as under branches, rocks, and flower pots. You can also dig a hole and find buried bugs. Anything you catch can go in your terrarium.Mealworms and crickets are common starter bugs. You’ll also come across other bugs, such as roly polies (pill bugs) and beetles. Sometimes you’ll even find critters like snails, geckos, and frogs.
Be aware of poisonous or biting insects. It's best to avoid spiders, centipedes, fire ants, and carpenter ants (large black ants).
If you’re looking for critters that move a lot, try crickets and snails.

, Keep your terrarium stocked with food. Add small slices of whatever fruits and vegetables you have around the house. Carrots, for example, are a vegetable that many bugs and snails enjoy. The food keeps them happy and healthy.

Plants and worms use the soil for food. Decomposing food, like banana peels and eggshells, or compost, keeps the soil filled with nutrients.
Fish flakes from the pet store will also be popular with the bugs.

, An uncovered terrarium can lead to escaped bugs. Critters like snails can also climb and push their way out of loose covering. If your container has a lid, make sure it’s on tight. Otherwise, cover the opening with cheesecloth or mesh netting. Secure it against the container with a rubber band.Remember to make sure there are air holes at the top of the container. Bugs need to breathe too!

, You don’t need to set out a bowl of water, but the bugs will appreciate a damp environment. Every day, check the terrarium for dampness. Use a spray bottle to mist inside it. You don’t want the soil to be soaked, but it should be kept moist enough for the bugs to dig in it.You can also try setting a dampened paper towel or cotton ball on top of the soil for extra humidity.
Consider getting a hygrometer from the pet store. It’ll indicate the humidity in the terrarium. Try to keep the humidity above 75%.

, One great thing about your bugs is that they won’t need extra heat or sunlight. However, the hands of a younger sibling or paws of a pet can knock over your bug's home. Keep it up high on a flat surface out of direct sunlight., You won’t want decaying fruits and vegetables lying around the terrarium. Once you see that they’re going bad, throw them away or else they’ll get stinky and moldy. Replace them with small portions of fresh food., Ideally, it’s best to keep your bugs safe by replacing the soil once a week. Look out for droppings or signs of mold. Those are indicators that it's time to freshen up the terrarium.Catch the bugs before you begin cleaning. Scoop them up and move them to a second terrarium or sealed container with air holes.
Terrariums with large bugs and critters will need to be cleaned weekly. If you only have a few small bugs, you may be able to leave the terrarium alone for longer without noticing bad smells or mold.

Your materials do not need to be perfectly sanded down or anything of that nature. Using raw wood will work just fine. You will be able to create an entire butterfly house with two boards. One measuring 1"" x 8"" x 8' and the second measuring 1"" x 10"" x 4'.


Consider recycling scrap wood you have around the house if available.
If purchasing materials from a store, ask to have everything cut to size for easier assembling and time savings once at home.;
, With a measuring tape, mark three equal parts, each measuring 30” in length. These three pieces will serve as the back and two sides. The remaining piece of this particular board will be used as the bottom of the house.You can customize your butterfly house as you see fit and adjust the measurements to create a larger or smaller version.


Using the jigsaw, cut out each piece. Take every precaution when using power tools like this one. Read all instructions, wear gloves and goggles. If you are not trained in using this machine, a handsaw will work as well.

, From the same board, the remaining piece of wood will measure 8” x 5 ¾”, cut this piece to measure 5 ¾” x 5 5/8”.

, Out of this piece, you will create the front of the house, the roof and roof block (the roof block with sit inside the house when closed to seal the unit shut). Measure and cut 30” x 5 5/8” to make the front. Measure and cut 5 ¾” x 5 ½” to make the roof block.

, From the remaining piece of this board, measure and cut 9 ½” x 8 5/8” for the roof.

, Butterflies will use the slots to enter and exit the house. Grab the front piece you’ve just made (the 30” x 5 5/8” piece). Measure and mark six vertical rectangles. Each should measure 4” long x ½” wide. These can be spaced as you see fit. Using the ½ inch drill bit, drill a hole through the top and the bottom of the rectangles to create 6 pairs of holes.Using the jigsaw, cut the space in between each of the paired holes to create the openings/slots.
You can add more or less slots if you prefer.
Keep in mind that making the slots any larger will encourage other, perhaps unwanted, animals to make this house their home.

, Lay the back piece flat on your work surface with a side piece up against it to create a 90 degree angle. Attach the first side piece to the back edge using a screw gun. You will only need three screws to attach the side. They should be placed 10” apart. One at the bottom, one in the middle and one at the top.


Use 1 1/2"" deck or galvanized wood screws to prevent rusting.
Repeat this for the other side of the house.
If a screw gun isn't available, you can use a screw driver.

, Put the piece measuring 5 ¾” x 5 5/8”, in the interior of the back and the sides. The floor should be flush with the bottom of the back board and side boards. Using the screw gun or screw driver, drill a screw through the side into the edge of the bottom piece and repeat on opposite side.


Drill another screw through the back wall, into the side of the bottom piece.

, Slide the 30"" long front piece with slots up against the bottom block, mirroring the back piece. Attach with screw gun or screw driver by drilling through the side, into the edge of the front piece. This is exactly how you attached the back piece, every 10”. Place one screw through the front piece, into the bottom block.

, Remember, the roof block with sit inside the house when closed to seal the unit shut. The roof block will need to be centered on the underside of the roof. Put the roof piece flat on a table lengthwise vertically. Measure 1” off the back edge and draw a horizontal line. Mark the center of this line which is 4 5/16”. Draw a vertical line from this point to the front edge of the roof piece.


Also mark a center line on the shorter edge (5 ½”) of the roof block, which is 2 ¾”.
Place the roof block along the horizontal line. Be sure to line up the center marks on both the roof piece and roof block. This will center the roof block on the roof and allow for equal overhang.

, Use 1 1/2"" galvanized nails and hammer in one on each corner.


Nails should be short enough to avoid going completely through the roof.

, Check to make sure everything looks secure and stable.

, Mix one part sugar with four parts water and bring to a boil. This will help dissolve the sugar completely. Get a brand new sponge and a small dish. Pour the water into the dish on top of the sponge so it is about halfway full. Place the dish with sponge in the butterfly house.Check the solution daily to ensure it isn’t growing mold or other bacteria.
Rather than throwing out the remaining sugar water, store it in the fridge for later use.

, Butterflies are attracted to bright colors so decorate the house. Pick a color that will really pop amongst the other foliage like yellow, pink or red. Draw flowers and trees on the house for even more appeal.


Be sure to use non-toxic paint.
Consider placing a piece of tree bark inside the house to create a more real environment.

, You probably are well aware that butterflies are drawn to certain plants and flowers.Plant a few around your home like strawberry, dandelion or blueberry. These flowers provide nectar for feeding.


You can place a few inside the butterfly house too. Aster, clover, honeydew and thistle are great choices.
Skip anything that has been treated with pesticides as this could harm them.

, Shaded areas will not attract the butterflies. They love to swirl around in the bright sun during feeding and mating. Because of this, having water around will ensure they stick around for longer periods of time.


Place a shallow water source outside the house.
Pour water on rocks or stone paths in your garden.

, This may not sound too appealing to you but butterflies love it! Throw out some fruit cores and peels whenever you have them.Overly ripe bananas are an especially good trick. Simply place pieces around the garden and watch the butterflies swarm.

Place a pond in your yard.,
Find the right water source.,
Determine if you live near a source of dragonflies.",How to Attract Dragonflies1," Ponds are beautiful additions to your backyard, and they attract dragonflies! Dragonflies are attracted to water because they breed in water. Their young hide among water plants. If you want dragonflies in your yard, put a water source somewhere in your yard. Create a pond at least 20 feet (6.1 m) (6.1 m) deep. However, a pool of just about any size will appeal to dragonflies.The pond should have a depth of at least 2 feet (.61 m) to allow the dragonfly nymphs to take cover from predators such as raccoons.
The water source needs shallow, low edges. The shallow sloping sides allow for plants to grow.;
, You can choose creative ways to put water sources into your yard. If you are into landscaping, you can start a big, fun project where you place a premolded pond in your yard, or dig and build one yourself.You can also set up a plastic wading pool, which dragonflies will breed in. Another idea is a wood half barrel.
You can find premolded ponds at home improvement stores, and plastic wading pools at most toy stores or supercenters. You can find both online.

, You will have better luck attracting dragonflies if you live near a water source with dragonflies. Some dragonflies will fly miles away from the water source, but the closer you are to a stream, lake, or other source of water, the better your chances are that you will attract them.Most people who do not live in extremely arid areas should be reasonably close to a water source with dragonflies.

"
"
Add water plants to your pond.,
Surround the pond with shrubs.,
Spread rocks around your pond.,
Make sure the pond gets plenty of sun.,
Place sticks in the middle of your pond.",How to Attract Dragonflies2," You can’t just have a pond and attract dragonflies. You need water plants in the pond to help attract them. Dragonflies love tall plants! The dragonflies will lay their eggs in the plants, and the larvae will live in them until they are grown. Then, they will use the tall plants to perch on.Stock the pond with both submerged and floating plants. They will use the underwater plants when they are larvae, and perch on the tall plants when they are adults.
Try getting eelgrass, fanwort, hornwort, anacharis, wild celery, corkscrew rush, blue flag iris, parrot’s feather, pondweed, water lilies, and lotus flowers.
You can find water plants at garden centers and online.

, Place shrubs around the edge of the pond to give the dragonflies more places to land. This also makes your pond even more beautiful and appealing. The dragonflies will have more places to perch and live. You can plant border plants and shrubs.For example, you can try lobelia, seedbox, or button bush.
You can also let the natural grass and brush around the pond grow to give the dragonflies more vegetation.

, Rocks in and around your pond will make it even more beautiful. Dragonflies also love to perch on warm rocks, especially flat rocks. Place rocks in your pond and around the edges to give the dragonflies plenty of places to land.You can try a mixture of light and dark rocks. The dragonflies may be attracted to one over the other.

, Dragonflies like sunshine, so they will be more attracted to a pond that is out in the open with full sunshine in the middle of the day than one covered by the shade of tree branches., While you are waiting for your plants to grow tall enough for dragonflies to perch on, place sticks in your pond. This gives the dragonflies somewhere to land.You can try sticks that you get from nearby trees or bamboo stakes for plants and vegetables.

"
"
Avoid placing fish in your pond.,
Add a fountain to your garden.,
Plant dragonfly attracting flowers in around your home.",How to Attract Dragonflies3," You may want to put fish in your pond so you can have fish and dragonflies. This is not a good idea. Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so the dragonflies will not be attracted to the pond and start breeding there., If you don’t want to add a pond, you can just add a fountain instead. These are much more low maintenance. You can buy pond pumps at garden or home improvement stores, and place them in a tub or trough.Often, you need additional filter boxes for your fountain when it is used outside.

, Certain flowers will help attract dragonflies to your home. You can plant them around the water source, in your flower bed, or around your home to tempt the dragonflies to visit.Plant black-eyed Susans, blanket flower, cardinal flower, goldenrod, bee balm, catmint, coneflower, golden Alexander, Phlox, Russian sage, Salvia, or yarrow.

Plant your butterfly garden.,
Observe and enjoy the butterfly activity in your garden.",How to Create a Butterfly Garden," Find out which butterflies are common in your area. Observation over a few days and the use of a butterfly field guide will help you in this pursuit.;
, Note from your research what the caterpillar (larvae) of the local butterflies eat. Two excellent examples are:



Milkweed - this attracts the Monarch caterpillar.

Parsley - this attracts the Black Swallowtail caterpillar.

, Nectar plants serve as the food source for the butterfly. There is a variety of possible plants and some of them are shown here. Excellent choices include:


A Butterfly Bush - this is suitable for a Swallowtail. Large plant: 4 feet (1.2m) tall, 6 feet (1.8m) wide, make sure it is hardy in your area. Some varieties are considered invasive, so make sure, if you purchase one of these, that you keep it dead-headed to prevent seed production.

Swamp Milkweed - suitable for the Snowberry Clearwing. This plant grows 3 feet (.9m) tall and 18 inches (.5m) wide. It also serves as the host plant for Monarch caterpillars.

Joe Pye Weed - this is suitable for the Swallowtail. It grows to be a very large plant - 8 feet (2.4m) tall and 4 feet (1.2m) wide. It is a perennial.

Aster - Asters grow to 3 feet (.9m) tall and 2 feet (.6m) wide. It is a perennial. Butterflies especially love native varieties.

Bee Balm - this plant grows 2 feet (.6m) tall and 18 inches (.5m) wide. It is a perennial.

Zinnia - this plant is attractive to a range of butterflies and they especially like the tall varieties. The plant generally grows 4 feet (1.2m) high and 1 foot (.3m) wide. It is an annual and is easy to start from seed.

Pentas - suitable for Swallowtails. This plant grows 2 feet (.6m) high and 3 feet (.9m) wide. It is an annual in cold climates.

Heliotrope - this plant attracts a range of butterflies. It grows to a height of 2 feet (.6m) and a width of 1 foot (.3m), although it is possible to contain it in a pot. It will remain a perennial in temperate zones but is only an annual in cold climates.

, Draw up a plan, or decide where to add these suggestions to a current garden. Keep in mind the full grown size of plants during this planning stage. Also consider their needs for light and water.

, You can also get these plants and seeds online. Choose robust and healthy plants to give them a good start.

, Make sure to keep new plants and seeds watered until plants are well-established or seeds germinate. Keep the weeds at bay, to give the plants a good chance.

, Watch for female butterflies laying eggs on host plants. Make notes in a record book of the butterflies that you observe and, if you can, take photographs to add to your record book. A digital record book can be a useful and simple way to do this and can be added to over the years. Observed changes in the types and numbers of butterflies coming into your garden can be information shared with biologists, ecologists and climate change specialists who use local variation information to ascertain species increase or decline, as well as temperature fluctuations and change.

Lear, the native species of butterfly in your area and coordinate your efforts at attracting these.The species of butterfly in your area will be specific to your state/region, but among these species you might find the following: Tawny Emperor (Asterocampa clyton), Monarch (Danaus plexippus), California Sister (Adelpha bredowii), Common Buckeye (Junonia coenia), Viceroy (Limenitis archippus), Baltimore (Euphydryas phaeton), Common Mestra (Mestra amymone), Isabella's Heliconian (Eueides isabella), 'Astyanax' Red-spotted Purple (Limenitis arthemis astyanax), American Snout (Libytheana carinenta), Northwestern Fritillary (Speyeria hesperis), Mourning Cloak (Nymphalis antiopa).;
, Adult butterflies have a palette for specific pigments. These winged wonders appreciate reds, yellows, oranges, pinks, and purples. Blossoms these colors, especially those with flat tops or short flower tubes, are among the butterflies' favorites.Some examples include:


Stachytarpheta jamaicensis (blue porterweed)
Buddleia davidii (""Miss Molly"")
Cosmos sulphureus (orange ""cosmic"" cosmos), Butterflies are most likely to frequent nectar sources that receive plenty of sunlight from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. Fully matured butterflies tend to avoid feeding in the shade.Choose flowers that enjoy lots of sunshine and plant these where the best light can be received.

, Keeping your garden thickly blooming with the butterfly's favorite colored flowers will improve your chances of appealing to this lovely insect. Nectar is needed throughout an adult butterfly's life cycle.To plot your bloom cycles, note the date you plant your seeds, bulbs, or seedlings on a calendar. Then, using the information on the plant packaging (like on a seed packet), and find the time it takes your flower to bloom and how long it will bloom. Mark this on your calendar, too, and try to keep your bloom dates for various flowers overlapping.
If your plant or its seed packet/packaging did not include blooming details, this information can be found easily by doing a general Internet search of the plant name online.

, This includes insecticides that are marketed as environmentally friendly. Butterflies, and butterfly caterpillars, are sensitive to many of these. A list of common chemicals to avoid are:


Bacillus thuringiensis
Diazinon
Malathion
Sevin, You may have seen butterflies in nature resting on branches and twigs, basking in the sunlight. This is because the sun provides orientation and warmth to the wings, helping these colorful friends fly.Flat stones spread throughout your garden in areas that receive good sunlight are excellent places for butterflies to land and rest.

, Mud and wet sand are optimal places for butterflies to suck up water without the danger that accompanies a large body of water, like a stream, fountain, or water feature. Coarse sand in a pan kept moist can provide your colorful little friends a convenient watering hole., Pollinators like butterflies often need a place to hide from predators, and a small tree or shrub can be just the thing to make your garden more accommodating.Some plants to consider:


Privet (Ligustrum vulgare)
Dutchman’s pipe (Aristolochia macrophylla)
New Jersey Tea (Ceanothus americanus)

, Certain plants are more widely popular among the different kinds of butterfly. No plant will appeal to all butterflies - not even butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa). Some plants to consider to attract more of your brightly colored friends to your garden are:


Butterfly Bush (Buddleja officinalis)
Everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea)
Hollyhock (Alcea rosea)
Passionflower (Passiflora)
Willow (salix)Don't forget to ask staff at your local nursery any questions you may have about planting and growing any of these flowers. Most of these plants are available at local nurseries at a reasonable cost.

, When butterflies try to lay eggs on non-native plants, their offspring have trouble surviving.Maps with a distribution of plants native to your areas can be found at http://www.wildflower.org/collections.

, These tiny structures are similar to hummingbird feeders in that nectar is provided, but the shape is more like that of a bat house. The small slots on the side allow butterflies entrance while deterring predators and providing shelter from the elements., There are many local factors that might be influencing butterfly populations in your areas, so if you see that a neighbor has a larger than average butterfly population in her garden, you may want inquire what she has planted or how she has her garden set up.

, Out of the likely many beautiful species in your area, choosing one and catering to it may make sightings more frequent. Do an Internet search for ""local butterfly species near me"" to find potential candidates, or search by state.Some common species of North American butterfly include:


Monarch (Danaus plexippus)
Painted Lady (Cynthia cardui)
Red Admiral (Vanessa atalanta)
Pipevine Swallowtail (Battus philenor), Depending on species, your butterfly may migrate hundreds of miles north to south.Now that you know the butterfly you want to attract, you can plan your flower plantings according to migration cycle, thereby increasing the odds of attracting your favorite butterfly.

, There are certain plants that each species of butterfly prefer, and planting several that your butterfly of choice appreciates will be an open invitation to come visit your garden., There are many different recipes available for you to try on the internet, but to find which works for you, you'll likely have to experiment.Some formulas are reported to work well in one region, but not another.

Leave out different sized cardboard boxes.,
Get a cat tunnel.,
Invest in a solid cat tree or perch.",How to Encourage Your Cat's Hunting Instinct1," Cats love enclosed spaces that allow them to safely observe their territory and stalk prey. The most affordable way to provide your cat with stalking spots is to leave out a few cardboard boxes. Use different sized boxes and arrange them in interesting configurations.Save your boxes whenever you make a purchase or get a delivery. Just make sure you get rid of packaging materials like plastic, tape, and styrofoam.;
, A collapsible cat tunnel can also provide a great stalking spot for your cat.  Purchase one online or from your local pet supply store for under $20 (US). You can find simple straight tunnels or more elaborate varieties that have multiple tunnel sections.You can fold up and put away a collapsible tunnel when it’s not in use, which you might find a more attractive option than keeping cardboard boxes around the house.

, Cats instinctively love seeking out high spots to observe their territory and look for prey. A climbing tree or perch will satisfy this urge. Expanding your cat’s space vertically is also perfect if limited floor space is an issue.While there are plenty of ways to save money by using boxes and improvised toys, make sure you invest in a solid perch. When shopping for one, ask a salesperson to recommend a sturdy model or, if you shop online, read the reviews.

Keep in mind the benefits of having a cat.,
Place your cat in a great new home.",How to Find a Home for a Cat," Of course it might be you are followed home by a stray and the cat really needs a home. However, you may have been followed home by a cat that is simply lost and needs to find its way home. If is important to determine which is the case before you move forward.;
, The vet can scan for the presence of a microchip that gives an id number for the cat. If the microchip is present, you can contact the database with the cat's number and reunite the lost kitty with its owners. It might be the cat got lost and has been living rough but is really a much loved family pet., If the cat is not chipped and appears to be a stray, you should still take steps to find the owners. It is ideal to reunite it with its family but it is also important to look for the owners in order to comply with local regulations, which vary from place to place. #*Consider methods such as putting up posters describing the cat, contacting all vet clinics in the area and asking them to take the details, informing local shelters, and even asking the local radio to put a call out for the owners to come forward.


After 7 days of real effort to find the owner, the cat is considered adoptable.

, Spread the word among friends, family and acquaintances that you have a cat in need of a home. Word of mouth recommendation is helpful as you are more likely to know something about the person who has come forward and be assured of their good character., They may know of someone looking for a cat. Also, they often know of people who have recently lost a cat and have space in their hearts to welcome a new feline friend.

, Put an ad in a local paper, online, or on the bulletin board of your local grocery store or place of worship. However, do not be naive and offer the cat to anyone who answers the ad. Prepare a list of questions to ask potential adopters so that you can judge whether the cat is going to a loving home.A good question to ask is ""What happened to your previous pet?"" If their previous cat died in their sleep aged 20, that is a good answer. If the cat was killed in a traffic collision, then ask them what provision they have put in place to stop this happening again. If they surrendered their last cat to the shelter, then think carefully before handing the cat over and be sure that their circumstances have changed hugely and that they are prepared to put provisions in place, such as pet insurance, in order to meet all possible eventualities.Avoid advertising a cat as ""Free to a good home."" Unfortunately, people who have been rejected by standard places to get a pet (such as from a shelter) may resort to getting pets from want ads. Some unscrupulous people who arrange dog fights will source cats from free ads to use as bait to get the dogs riled up, so don't risk this happening. At very least, ask for money to cover any veterinary expenses you have accrued or ask for a donation to the local shelter.

, Ask for guidance in finding the cat a home but also discuss the option of the cat going to the shelter.Unfortunately shelters are full to bursting with unwanted pets, and they are often too full to take in more. If you do happen to find a shelter with a slot, be certain to find out if they have a no-kill policy. Some shelters are so overwhelmed that they have to euthanize a high percentage of those they take in. In some cases the kill rate is as high as 95%, so be sure you understand what you are signing the cat up for., If the cat is a pedigree, investigate a specific rehoming group. Groups exist dedicated to rehoming specific purebred cats. They will take the cat on or find a foster home, while they find a home among enthusiasts for the breed.Search online or ask your vet for details.

, One such organization is called the Cats Protection League. They may be able to take the cat in. If they can't take the cat in, they may be able to offer one of their officials to do a home check on the person you find to adopt the cat., If the cat belongs to you, you need to take a close look at the reason why you need to rehome the cat. If you have any alternatives to getting rid of your cat, you should consider taking them.


For example, many people believe it is unsafe to have a litter tray in the house when they are pregnant and therefore look to rehome a much loved feline companion. This fear arises from the (albeit slim) chance of picking up toxoplasma infection. However, scientists now believe the main route of infection is inadequately cooked meat rather than cat feces. If you wear disposable gloves and a mask, and clear the poop within 24 hours of it being produced the risk of infection is negligible. These simple measures could prevent the need for rehoming.If in doubt speak to your veterinarian who can advise you further on protecting your health and minimizing the risk of infection.

, For example, a new baby in the house may have you feeling protective and worried about how the cat will react and if the cat will sleep on the baby and smother it. This is extremely unlikely to happen but if it's something that worries you, close the cat out of the room when the baby is alone. Take simple precautions, like keep the litter tray away from the baby and wash your hands after petting the cat.


If you are moving abroad, be aware that a pet passport scheme operates widely now. Make inquiries at the embassy of the country you are moving to and ask them about the necessary protocol to import a cat into their country. Your vet can work closely with you to ensure the relevant vaccinations, blood tests, and paperwork is issued, and it's no big deal.It might be that you are moving within the country and just noticed your rental agreement has a 'no pets' clause. Before rehoming the cat, be honest with the landlord and ask if there is the possibility of making an exception. Some landlords put the clause on as a matter of routine, to protect themselves should a tenant have a destructive pet. Many landlords are open to a discussion about pets. It is especially helpful if you can put together a portfolio of documents that illustrate how well-behaved and well-cared for your pet it. A dossier containing records of vaccination certificates, vet checks, references from previous landlords, pictures of your pet doing cute things, like sleeping, can all go some way to convince a wavering landlord.

, Indeed, cats are hugely beneficial to a growing child. It's been shown that kids raised in a house with pets are less likely to develop asthma and allergies in later life.Having a pet can reduce stress in owners of all ages.
They can also provide love and companionship to their owners, which can be especially important to people who live alone or are house bound.

, Don't just abandon your cat and don't take it to a shelter unless you have exhausted all other possibilities. You have the responsibility to find it a safe and loving home where it can thrive. This may take some time and effort but you have that obligation to the cat.

Save money by using improvised toys.,
Use interactive toys during playtime.,
Give your cat catnip toys.,
Purchase an electronic teaser toy.,
Rotate and introduce new toys for variety.",How to Encourage Your Cat's Hunting Instinct2," Many cat owners have stories about purchasing an expensive toy only to watch their cat ignore it and play with a strip of paper. Try making toys using household items like empty paper towel or toilet paper rolls, felt, gift bows, or paper bags with the handles removed.Try securely attaching a piece of felt or empty cardboard roll to a string to make a chase toy.
A laser pointer also makes an excellent chase toy.
Avoid plastic bags, rubber bands, sharp objects, or anything with small parts that your cat could chew off and swallow.

, Feather wands, plushes, and other interactive toys are your best playtime options. You can slowly drag the toy in front of your cat so it can stalk. Then, pull it away quickly so your cat can chase and pounce on its prey.Play with your cat at least 15 minutes twice a day, so it gets a total of at least 30 minutes of activity per day.

, Catnip stimulates energetic play in many cats. It has a calming effect on others. Observe how your cat responds to catnip and, if it energizes your cat, use dry catnip or catnip toys during playtime.Kittens won’t react to catnip until they’re between three and six months old. While catnip energizes some cats and mellows out others, about half of cats don’t have any reaction at all., Electronic toys are an excellent option if your schedule makes it difficult to play with your cat consistently. They include peek-a-boo toys and mouse pounce toys that engage your cat’s hunting instincts. You can even set some toys to spontaneously turn on and off throughout the day.Electronic teaser toys generally cost around $20-40 (US).

, Cats are prone to boredom, so it’s best to rotate toys in and out of its collection. Improvised toys made with household items will make this more affordable. When you add new toys to the rotation, try hiding them around the house to make them more interesting.If it’s obvious that your cat has one favorite toy, keep that toy in the rotation at all times.

Play with your cat before meals.,
Use food dispensing puzzle toys.,
Hide treats in a cat grass bed or around the house.",How to Encourage Your Cat's Hunting Instinct3," Food is an essential part of encouraging your cat’s hunting instincts. In the wild, eating comes after a successful hunt. Schedule your playtimes before meals to simulate the natural conclusion of a successful hunt.If you free-feed your cat, offer it a treat after playing with it. Just make sure treats don’t exceed 10 to 15 percent of its caloric intake.

, Watch your cat play with a food dispenser to make sure it can figure out the puzzle. Help your cat figure the toy out if it gets bored or gives up.Avoid using dispenser toys to exclusively feed your cat, especially if it’s home alone most of the day. It won’t be able to eat if it can’t get into the dispenser, and cats can’t handle going long periods of time without food.

, Look online, at a garden center, or at a pet store for wheat or oat grass meant for cats. Make sure it’s specifically marked for cats, as some plants can be toxic to cats.Grow it in a pot or planter, and hide treats for your cat to hunt."

Move toys along the ground if your cat enjoys ground play.,
Use air movements if your cat likes hunting birds.,
Change the play style periodically.,
Let your cat win.",How to Find Your Cat's Preferred Play Style1," Some cats prefer hunting on the ground and as a result enjoy playing with ground toys. This may be because the cat feels it can remain hidden while playing on the ground and stalking toys. Alternatively, it could be due to physical restraints. An overweight cat will not be able to jump through the air chasing after toys.If your cat enjoys ground play, try dragging a toy along the ground. Move the toy slowly and then quickly across the floor so your cat can stalk, and then pounce on the toy.;
, Many cats enjoy hunting birds or flying insects, such as butterflies. In order to mimic hunting through the air, you can use a wand or feather toy. Dangle the toy in the air so that your cat can leap and jump to catch the toy.Play in a safe space with lots of room so that your cat does not get injured while jumping.

, Your cat’s play preference may change as they become older and less mobile. Alternatively, your cat may become bored if you only ever engage in one style of play. Even if your cat has a preferred style, you should always mix up your play strategy. This will keep your cat engaged and you will notice if your cat’s play preference changes.

, This will provide your cat with a reward and will keep them engaged in the game. If the cat is never able to catch the “prey” they may become frustrated and bored.It is always a good idea to end a play session after your cat catches the toy.

Start looking early.,
Look in pet-friendly rental listings.,
Check online rental listings.,
Ask friends and family for cat friendly rental recommendations.,
Make sure that the rental can accommodate a cat.,
Obtain a letter of reference from a previous rental owner.,
Ask your veterinarian for a letter.,
Show the letters to the rental owner at the property you’re applying to.,
Speak to the landlord.,
Let the rental owner meet your cat.,
Read the lease closely.",How to Find a Cat‐Friendly Rental," Finding a rental property is a difficult enterprise in general, and is only made more difficult with the inclusion of a cat. To give yourself ample time to find a cat friendly rental, start looking early.This means that, if you’re planning to move at the start of a new year, you should start looking in the previous spring, around March or April.


Even if the rental owners that you contact can’t guarantee that they’ll have an apartment or house opening, at least you can find out their cat policy.;
, Rental listings compile information about rental houses and apartments in your area, and locate the data in a single publication. This saves you from having to call or email multiple separate rental agencies. Pet-friendly rental listings will inform you if a rental takes cats and if there is a monthly fee.Apartment and rental home listing publications may be available in your local supermarket.

, Many rental listings are only available online, and allow even greater customization. There are even some pet-specific rental listings sites, such as the National Pet Friendly Apartment Directory.Sites like this will present rental properties that allow pets, although you’ll likely need to contact the landlord directly for more specific information regarding cats.


Major rental sites like rent.com or apartments.com will allow you to tailor your search for pet-friendly apartments.Also check popular websites that share apartment listings, including Craigslist and Domu (in Chicago). Listings on these sites should specify whether or not you’re allowed to have a cat. If the listing doesn’t specify, contact the individual who posted the listing and ask if cats are permitted.

, If you’re moving to an area where friends or family members already live, they can be a valuable resource in your search for a cat-friendly rental. Reach out with a phone call, text, or over social media, and ask if they know of any apartments or rental homes in the area that have a cat-friendly rental policy.Word of mouth can also be a useful means to finding out about apartments that permit residents to keep cats. If your family members or friends do not own a cat themselves, ask them if they have any cat-owning friends or acquaintances that you could reach out to.
If all else fails, visit a neighborhood you’re considering living in and take a walk around, noting the location and phone numbers of potential apartments or houses with “For Rent” signs in front.

, Once you have found a rental property that will allow you to have a cat live with you, visit the apartment or house and look inside. Make sure that the rental will make a suitable home for your cat. There should be enough space in the rental to set your cat’s litter box, food and water bowls, and bed without encroaching on your furniture or personal space.


Cats enjoy having one or more windows that they can access and look out of. Make sure that the rental has windows; these will also let in natural light so that your cat won’t be in the dark if you’re gone for most of a day.

, If you and your cat lived in a rental apartment or house prior to this, contact the property manager and see if they would be willing to write you a letter of reference. This document would need to indicate that your cat is well behaved and did not cause damage or any problems while you lived at the rental property.If you live in a different city or state than where your previous rental property was located, ask the owner or landlord to email the letter to you.

, Speak to or email your vet, and request that they write a brief letter stating that your cat is fully vaccinated and in good health. The letter should also clarify that your cat is spayed or neutered. Letters like this are routinely requested from vets, so they should be willing to honor your request.In addition to confirming your cat’s good health, this letter will indicate that you are a responsible pet owner. This fact should impress the owner of the rental property, and may incline them to let you have a cat in the property if they were previously disinclined.

, Once you have a reference letter and a letter from your vet in hand, you can present them to the landlord of the current rental property. Bring the letter from your vet and from your previous landlord with you when you go to apply for a rental house or apartment. These letters should help convince them that your cat will not be a hazard, damage the apartment, or cause their business to lose money.This letter may also influence the rental owner to lower the pet deposit, or to remove it entirely.

, Even if a rental property has an official “no pets” or “no cats” policy, it’s worth asking if they’d make an exception, especially if the rental is one that otherwise meets your criteria. Speak to the landlord and explain that your cat is well behaved and will not harm their property.A face-to-face conversation is best. Speaking over the phone or email will work if the landlord is in a different city, but if the rental property is nearby, arrange a meeting in person.

, Many rental-property owners are understandably nervous about renting to cat owners. Poorly behaved cats can shred curtain, drapes, and furniture, and their urine can permanently damage floorboards. If a property owner is skeptical about allowing you to have a cat, ask if they would like to meet the animal.If your cat is well-behaved, it may change the owner’s mind.

, Even if the property owner has been friendly and has verbally agreed that you may keep your cat in the rental with you, make sure that this is reflected in the lease. Never sign a lease that has a “no pets allowed” clause; make sure that neither your nor your landlord’s copy forbids pets. Also make sure that the lease also reflects the agreed-upon pet deposit amount.If you notice any problems or discrepancies with the cat-related portion of the lease, talk to the landlord before signing.

Notice when your cat is in a playful mood.,
Recognize when your cat is overstimulated or irritated.,
Listen to your cat while you play.",How to Find Your Cat's Preferred Play Style2," When your cat is happy and enjoying play it will signal this through its body language. A playful cat will have their ears pointed forward, the tail will be up, and their eyes will be slightly dilated. This means that your cat is in a playful mood and enjoying the play. They may also crouch down and stalk a toy and then pounce on it.This signals that they are engaged and enjoying the play session.
If you notice these body language cues while playing with your cat, it means that they are enjoying the play style.

, When a cat is unsatisfied with a certain play style, their ears will be turned back and their tail will be tall and possibly twitching. They may even nip at you to signal that they are unhappy. Alternatively, a cat may just ignore your attempts to play if they do not like the game, toy, or style of play., Cats also communicate vocally by purring, meowing, or hissing. If your cat is purring or meowing while you play, it likely means that they are content and enjoying the style of play.

Purchase interactive toys.,
Buy small toys.,
Notice when your cat gives you a toy.",How to Find Your Cat's Preferred Play Style3," Interactive toys, such as wand toys, can be used to help determine your cat’s prey drive and play style. For example, you can move the toy along the ground or through the air mimicking different types of prey. Other types of interactive toys include balls and stuffed animals that can be thrown and then chased by your cat., Cats typically hunt small prey, such as mice, insects, bunnies, and small birds. As a result, the toys they play with should reflect the size of their natural prey.For example, a large toy may be too intimidating and could be seen as a predator rather than prey.

, If your cat ever gives you a toy this likely indicates that they like this toy and want to play. For example, a cat may drop a ball in your lap to signal that they want you to throw the ball. Keep track of the toys that your cat gives to you. These likely reflect your cat's preferred style of play.

disinterest in play where it used to play regularly
aggression toward other animals in the home
refusing to use the litter box

lethargy
slow, shallow breathing
temperature below normal (100 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 to 39 degrees Celsius)

Take your litter of kittens to the vet when they are about eight weeks old so they can begin receiving a series of routine vaccinations. Your vet will advise you regarding which vaccinations your kitten needs and when.When taking the kittens to the vet, have them dewormed and treated for any other maladies – such as parasites – that might be present.;
, Kittens need to be properly socialized during their formative period. The formative period is the first two to seven weeks of your kitten’s life. Lift the kittens up, touch them all over, and talk to them for at least 30-60 minutes each day.The time spent interacting with your kittens need not be continuous.

, Kittens should be exposed to a variety of sights, sounds, and smells. This will help them better adjust to domestic life when they finally find homes. Some common experiences or things your litter of kittens should be familiar with include:trips in the car
wet and dry food
music and TV
various cat litters (recycled paper, corn-based, and so on)
cat carriers and baskets
children and adults
men and women

High-quality cat food will include a healthy balance of amino acids, including taurine.Dry cat food is not generally recommended, though some cats might prefer it. Provide your kittens with dry cat food in the event they find canned food disagreeable.
If possible, obtain a cat food specially designed for kittens.
Do not feed your kittens baby food. It could poison your kittens.

, If kittens are removed from their mothers too soon, they might experience emotional and psychological trauma, and will not have time to be properly socialized to other animals.

However, keep in mind that you can have veterinarian at a smaller clinic and still take your cat to a place with emergency services when you need to do so.


You can also ask about emergency services when you call. If the veterinarian doesn't offer emergency services, ask if they send their patients to a specific place for emergency care.

, Price is also a factor, of course. Smaller clinics may be cheaper than larger ones. All-inclusive hospitals tend to be more expensive. When you go to the clinic or call them, ask for a list of basic prices so you can compare.Also, check payment options. See if they take credit cards, for instance, and if they offer payment plans for large bills., You may put off finding a veterinarian, thinking you have time. However, if your cat has a health problem, you want to have someone you can call who knows your cat's history. Pick a veterinarian out who will be your cat's primary veterinarian, just like you have a primary doctor., After you've narrowed your choices to one or two veterinarians, it's time to meet with the vet or at least talk to them on the phone. Call ahead to schedule an appointment. Make it clear that you want to meet the vet without your pet so you can ask questions and decide if that clinic is the right place for you and your cat. Most veterinarians are more than willing to meet prospective clients., Before you go in, write out the questions you want to ask the veterinarian. Keep in mind that the vet may have scheduled a short appointment for you, but you should be able to ask the staff questions even if the vet needs to move on to their next appointment.You could ask questions such as:

What are your office hours?
What are your fees like? Do you offer payment plans?
What types of services do you offer? Do you have boarding services?
Do you take after hours patients?
Do you have sedation services? How do you handle cats who aren't comfortable with the vet? (If your cat isn't comfortable going to the vet and it gets vicious while there, it may need to be sedated for visits.)
Are you members of professional organizations?



, When you're visiting, make sure you like the people who work at the clinic. Of course, you don't need to be best friends with the veterinarian. However, you should feel like you can speak up and and ask questions, and you should feel like the veterinarian is competent., While you're there, make sure to check out the facility. It should look clean and orderly, and it shouldn't smell awful. Check out the other customers and pets there. Do the pets seem happy and healthy? Of course, some pets will be there because they're sick, but don't be afraid to talk to other customers about their experiences there.Ask to see the non-public areas, just to see if they're clean as well.

, The key to getting your cat in a carrier is to make it a happy place ahead of time. Put it out where the cat can see it, and leave the door open. Add toys to it. Place a blanket inside or even a shirt that smells like you. Your cat will likely get curious and explore the carrier on its own.Put the carrier out weeks ahead of time to get your cat used to the idea.
If the cat doesn't seem interested at first, try putting some treats inside the carrier to entice the cat in.

, Sometimes, a synthetic pheromone spray can help a nervous kitty. Spray it inside the carrier 30 minutes before you need the cat to be in the carrier, focusing on the soft bedding. The pheromone spray will keep the cat calmer while traveling.This spray basically mimics the smell that cats use to mark areas with their faces and paws. It makes them feel safer because it indicates the territory is already marked., Before you take your cat for an official visit, bring your cat to the veterinarian for a practice run. You could even do it once or twice a week so your cat gets used to the idea. At the vet's, give the cat treats so it associates the vet with good things.Taking your cat to the vet's office will get it used to the environment, too, including the smells and sounds. You can also see how your cat will react to other animals nearby.

, That is, when your cat goes to the vet, the vet will want to hold it down, examine its paws, and scruff its neck. Try these techniques out at home by handling your cat's paws, for instance, and grabbing the scruff of its neck sometimes (the skin at the back of the neck just behind the head). Start out with short periods and work up to a bit longer., A well-cat visit is just a checkup, much like you'd go to the doctor for a checkup. It also establishes your cat as a patient. Make an appointment for your cat to meet the vet and have its health checked out. You may ask for a longer appointment the first time, especially if your cat has never been to any vet. That will give the cat and the vet a chance to get to know one another.Watch how the vet examines your cat. If your cat doesn't like the idea of being examined, the vet may have to use a little force, such as scruffing the neck hard. However, the vet should be talking to the cat in a calming voice and trying to soothe it. You should feel like the vet is giving their full attention to the cat.

Take the kittens to a no-kill animal rescue.,
Visit your local animal shelters.,
Ask your vet for advice.,
Check with family and friends.",How to Find Homes for a Litter of Kittens2," Animal rescues provide homes to pets through an adoption process. However, in contrast to animal shelters, no-kill animal rescue operations will not euthanize a litter of kittens just because they reach capacity. Animal rescues might be able to find homes for a litter of kittens, or direct you to other organizations or resources that can help you do so.Rescues are often full, and might ask you to house the litter of kittens until homes are found for them., Animal shelters provide animals for adoption. Unfortunately, shelters are often filled to capacity and unable to find homes for a litter of kittens. However, shelter staff might be able to recommend resources that could help you in your quest to find homes for the kittens. Engage the animal shelter staff in conversation regarding your litter of kittens and ask for their advice., Your vet might know someone interested in providing homes to a litter of kittens. Even if they do not, they might have useful advice for you regarding what your next steps might be., Ask responsible family and friends if they are interested in adopting a kitten. If they are, your problem is solved. Invite them to see the litter of kittens and let them choose the one they are most interested in.Give priority to your friends and family who have children and people who have owned pets before. People who have never owned pets might find the idea of owning a cat attractive, yet lose interest when they realize the investment in time and money pet ownership requires.

Post ads for your kittens online.,
Post flyers in your area.,
Ask potential owners to fill out an application.,
Copy all potential applicants’ ID cards.,
Meet interested individuals in person.,
Do not give kittens away for free.",How to Find Homes for a Litter of Kittens3," Post a description and a set of images in online marketplaces like Craigslist. Alternately, use a local community message board to connect with people you know are interested in obtaining a kitten., Create a flyer with images and a description of the kittens. Print out an appropriate number and post them in high-traffic public areas (restaurants, libraries, and so on). Veterinary offices and pet shops are also good locations for flyers., The application should consist of a brief questionnaire, an information-collecting section, and a set of three to five references. Ask questions like “Have you owned pets before?” and “Do you have children or plan to have children?” Ask for references – including their current vet, if applicable – and follow up.When you contact the references, ask them if the applicant is, has been, or could be a responsible pet owner. If they suggest the applicant would not make a good pet owner, do not allow the applicant to adopt any of the kittens in your litter.
Ask for identifying info like their name, home phone number, date of birth, and address.

, Ask applicants to meet you at a public office supply store or similar location where you can copy their driver's license, passport, or other form of ID that includes their address and photo. Alternately, use your phone to snap a picture of the ID for future reference.Verify the information they provided on their application by checking it against their photo ID.
With this information in hand, you’re more likely to ensure that only people interested in providing your kitten with a good home will inquire about obtaining one.

, Talk to the individuals in a public place about their background and motivations for buying a cat. For instance, you might ask, “Why are you interested in adopting a kitten?” Listen carefully for inconsistencies or incomplete answers.If at any point you feel the applicant is being untruthful, politely end the meeting. Do not allow them to adopt any of your kittens.
If the applicant seems honest and their background checks out, allow them to adopt the kitten.
It’s best to offer kittens to people who have children and people who have owned pets before.

, If you give kittens away for free, they might be obtained by people who do not value the cat, and might use it in animal research or as food for a snake or other predatory animal. Never give kittens away for free except to friends and family members you know to be responsible.Usually, you can sell a kitten for $50 or more.

Approach the cat or kitten with care.,
Lift the cat's tail.,
Look for genitalia characteristic of a male cat.,
Look for genitalia characteristic of a female cat.",How to Determine the Sex of a Cat1," To ascertain the sex of a cat or kitten, it's necessary to pick the cat up. Some cats don't like to be handled, so take a little time to let him or her get comfortable around you.


Stand or crouch near the cat and let him or her approach you. When the cat comes close, let him or her sniff your hand.
If the cat seems nervous, you may have to come back later or have a partner help you with the next step.;
, Gently pick up the cat and cradle him or her in one arm. Use your free hand to lift the tail so you can examine the genital area.


If the cat doesn't mind being handled, this may be easiest to perform while sitting on a chair or the couch, so you don't have to worry about dropping the cat.
If you're working with a partner, have the partner hold the cat securely in both arms while you lift the tail.
If the cat avoids having his or her tail lifted, try scratching him or her in the area where the tail meets the back. Cats usually lift their tails when they are touched in this spot., The surest way to tell the difference between a male and female cat is by examining the cat's physical features below its tail. Begin by looking for male genital features, which can be somewhat easier to spot.


A male cat will have an anus, scrotum, and penis, while a female cat will have only an anus and urinary tract opening.
In an entire (or tom) cat, the scrotum is covered with fur and contains two testicles, each typically ranging in size from the size of cherry pits to actual cherries. The scrotum sticks out from the male cat's rear as a fairly obvious pair of bumps. If the cat has long fur, this can make the scrotum more difficult to see, in which case try dampening the fur with water to flatten it down and make the scrotum more obvious.
A neutered male cat will still have a scrotum, though it will typically be smaller.The penis is sited below the scrotum, beneath the skin, and exits at a small furry mound between the cat's thighs. You might imagine a male cat’s genitalia resembling a colon (:).
A male cat's anus and urinary tract opening are at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, or 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) for kittens.

, If the cat’s genitalia doesn’t appear to match that of a male cat, begin looking for female traits.


A female cat will have an anus and a urinary tract opening/vulva, with the vulva in the shape of a vertical slit. You can imagine a female cat’s genitalia as resembling a semi-colon (;).A female cat will have a shorter distance between anus and vulva, typically about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) apart.

Rule out medical problems.,
Play before bedtime.,
Feed your cat prior to bedtime.",How to Deal with Your Cat Pacing at Night1," If your cat is pacing at night, the first step is to seek the advice of your vet. Your cat’s nighttime behavior could be the result of medical discomfort, so it is important to rule out significant health problems first., If your cat is not experiencing health problems, the night pacing is best treated with additional activity and stimulation. Make active playtime part of your before-bed routine. Aim to play with your cat for 30 minutes before you go to bed each night.You might try:

Dangling some string.
Tossing jingly balls for your cat to chase.
Dragging a ribbon on the floor.

, Another way to stimulate your cat and encourage restful nights is to alter your feeding schedule. Try feeding your cat their main meal within one hour of your bedtime. If your cat has a full belly, they may be more likely to rest well during the night."
"
Check the color.,
Watch for gender-specific behaviors among intact (not neutered or spayed) cats.,
Watch for signs that the cat is in heat or is or has been pregnant.",How to Determine the Sex of a Cat2," If you have a litter of kittens, look at the color of the cats; some cat colorations are gender-specific and can help you determine the sex of the cat.


Cats that are calico or tortoiseshell colored are typically female.
More orange or ginger colored cats are male than female, but this is not an accurate way to determine a cat's sex., It's easier to tell the sex of intact cats, since they naturally display the habits and characteristics of their sex.


Male cats that have not been neutered tend to be more aggressive than females and to have larger heads and thick skin. They like to roam, sometimes leaving for a few days at a time. They mark their territory by spraying it with strong-smelling urine.Female cats are less likely to spray their surroundings.

, Female cats that have not been spayed will go into heat, a state of fertility that enables them to become pregnant, every 3-5 weeks during warm weather (or in a house that’s climate controlled). Cats in heat display recognizable behaviors:


Making vocal sounds to attract males. The cat may sound like it is in pain or whining.
Moving the tail to the side to show genitalia or crouching into a receptive posture. The vulva may be secreting a clear discharge.
Rubbing up against inanimate objects, owners, or other animals more than usual.Pregnant female cats have low-hanging, distended bellies.
Female cats that have given birth may have nipples that protrude from their bellies. Be careful when using nipples to determine sex, since both male and female cats have nipples.

"
"
Encourage physical activity.,
Introduce a companion.,
Provide visual stimulation.",How to Deal with Your Cat Pacing at Night2," Pacing usually comes as the expression of anxiety and/or restlessness. The best way to alleviate such distress is to foster both regular physical activity and mental stimulation. Fortunately, these activities often go hand-in-hand.You might try to:

Walk your cat on a leash.
Play with your cat for 30 minutes per day.
Provide cat trees, paper bags, or cardboard boxes for your cat to explore.

, Sometimes cats just need a friend. Bringing a new, younger dog or cat into your household could provide the stimulation your cat needs to end their pacing at night.If the new pet is another cat, you’ll want the new cat to be:Younger.
Smaller.
The opposite gender.
Fixed.

, Give your cat something fun to watch. Put birdbaths and/or bird feeders outside your window, so that your cat can get a good view. This version of “kitty TV” entertains your cat and provides excellent mental stimulation, which can help alleviate pacing at night."
"
Begin with easy puzzles.,
Increase the difficulty.,
Make DIY puzzles.",How to Deal with Your Cat Pacing at Night3," Food puzzles--usually constructed of plastic or cardboard--nurture cats’ natural hunting behaviors by challenging them to get food and treats.To get your cat started with food puzzles, it is important for them to have success right away. Begin by using simple, see-through food puzzles, which are more than half full (making it easier to get the food out). You can also sprinkle some cat food (or treats) around the puzzle to encourage an association between the puzzle and food. You may also want to leave these out at night.Purchase food puzzles at pet stores or online, or make them yourself at home.
Food puzzles are available in a variety of styles and levels of difficulty.

, Over time, you will need to increase the difficulty of the puzzles, otherwise your cat may lose interest. Try switching to puzzles with smaller holes or different shapes, or placing puzzles in more obscure areas of your house. If your cat has become a master forager, try making or purchasing difficult two-part puzzles., Instead of simply purchasing cat puzzles, you can make these at home from materials you already have. You will need a plastic or cardboard container that can hold dry food or treats, an X-Acto knife, some food or treats, and maybe some tape.Some options include:

Shoeboxes (make holes big enough for cat’s paws to enter).
Paper towel rolls (seal ends and make holes just large enough to food to fall out).
Plastic water bottles (make holes just large enough to food to fall out).
Egg cartons (no holes are necessary).

Try an electronic pet door.,
Try an ultrasonic devices.,
Use water.,
Add bottles with water.",How to Keep Cats Out of the House1," These types of doors involve your pet having an electronic signal of some sort that opens the door for them. The signal can come from a tag on the pet's collar, but some pet doors also use the microchip that many pet owners embed in the pet for identification purposes.When an unwanted cat approaches, she won't have the appropriate signal, so the door will not open for her.;
, These devices use ultrasonic sound to keep cats away from certain areas. They're generally used to keep cats out of yards, but you can also use them near your door. They are triggered by motion when a cat (or you!) walk by. They make a sound that cats don't like. You won't be able to hear it, but the cats will., If the cat is still outside, you can try spraying the cat with your hose. Most cats do not like water and will run off. It may take a few tries, but most cats will get the idea after awhile.If the cat is too close to your house, you could try a spray bottle filled with water instead.

, Water shimmering in the sunlight will cause most cats to turn tail and run. They just aren't sure what to make of the phenomenon. Therefore, you can fill up bottles, such as green wine bottles, and place them in the sunlight near your entrances. It will help deter cats from the area."

Understand the limitations.,
Try citrus.,
Use a predator urine.,
Try certain plants.,
Add a dash of pepper.,
Sprinkle coffee or pipe tobacco.,
Try a commercial cat repellent.",How to Keep Cats Out of the House2," While smells will keep cats away, most of them need to be reapplied frequently. You may need to renew them as often as every day or once a week.

, Most cats do not like the smell of citrus. You can either spray lemon juice around your door or try scattering citrus peels near the doorway. Another option is using a few drops of a citrus essential oil dissolved in water.You can also try other essential oils dissolved in water, such as lavender, citronella, or eucalyptus. Citronella may also cut down on bugs in the area., You can use the urine of animals like mountain lions, coyotes, or foxes from online retailers.Basically, you spray the urine, creating a border around your property.It's better to use these sprays to create a border around your yard rather than your entryway.


The smell of these types of urine are going to be very strong, which is why you should only use them around the yard. You shouldn't spray these urine right by your door, as it will be unpleasant when you're going in and out. Even when you spray them in the yard, you're going to be able to smell them., Cats don't like the smell of certain plants. Therefore, if you keep those plants near your door, the cats will likely stay away. For instance, you can plant lavender, rue, or penny royal. Lemon thyme is also an option., Hot peppers such as cayenne and crushed red pepper irritate most cats. Therefore, you can try sprinkling them around your door to deter cats. You can also try mixing some hot sauce with water and spraying it in the area., Two other smells that cats don't like are coffee and pipe tobacco. You can use old coffee grounds or what's leftover in a pipe after smoking (or fresh tobacco). Just drop some of the leftovers on the ground near your entrance to keep cats away., These repellents contain smells cats don't like, and you use them the same as homemade sprays. Spray them near your entrances and around the yard to keep cats away. You can find these sprays at pet stores."
"
Look for cats.,
Scare any cats off.,
Don't pet strays.,
Don't feed strays.",How to Keep Cats Out of the House3," When you're entering your home, survey the area to look for cats. Check under bushes and other items near your door. Cats are good at hiding, so make sure to check all the small crevices.

, If you have a spray bottle handy, you can scare them off by spraying it at them. If you don't, you can try walking towards them and clapping your hands. Often cats will run off.

, If you give attention to affectionate strays, they'll likely hang around. Therefore, try not to pet your neighborhood strays, no matter how tempting it is., Similarly, if you feed cats, they will hang around. If you really want to feed strays, do it in an area away from your entrance, and create a barrier with scent around your door. That way, the cats will stay in their area and not in your home.

"
"
Try catnip.,
Spread out sand.,
Move bird feeders out into the yard.",How to Keep Cats Out of the House4," If your main goal is to keep the cat out of the house, try making a part of your garden attractive to cats. For instance, you could plant catnip or cat mint, both plants that cats love. Pick a corner that's out of the way. Be aware, though, that this method could draw more strays to your yard.Honeysuckle is also a cat-friendly option., Cats also like sleeping on sand, so you could make a bed of sand near the catnip. Cats will be drawn over to take a nap.Some cats may see this area as an opportunity to use the bathroom, so you may find yourself cleaning up after them.

, It's no secret that cats like to watch birds. Therefore, if you have your bird feeder up near the house, you're likely to have cats around. By moving the feeders out into the yard, you at least move them away from your door."

Identify why you don't like cats.,
Don't completely ignore the cat.,
Make eye contact with the cat.,
Close your door when you sleep.,
Keep the litter box in a low-traffic spot.,
Train your cat to use a scratching post.,
Grow to like your cat.",How to Deal with Cats," Did a cat scratch you when you were younger? Did your older brother torment you by locking you up in a closet with a claustrophobic cat? Do you hate the smell of their poop? Do you think cats are the ugliest things in the world? Identify why you hate cats, and try to fix it.


If you're scared, watch a family member interact with the cat. The cat's not so bad, is it? Once you've seen a family member interact, you try!
Do you hate kitty poo? Keep the litter box in a space where you won't have to smell it, and try baking soda to lessen the smell.
;
, You've heard that a cat's favorite person is the one who hates them the most, and that is usually true because you ignore them. Cats find that behavior as a ""yay, I like this kitty!"" So acknowledge your cat! Occasionally pet them and play with them.

, Cats don't like it, so to get the cat to ignore you, stare at him/her in the eye often.

, Sometimes, cats will come in and sleep on top of you. That can get annoying, so to ensure the cat won't come in, you may have to get used to sleeping with the door closed.

, Everyone, whether they adore their cat or despise them, hate the smell of litter. Keep the litter box in a spot where you don't go often, like the storage room.

, One of the most aggravating things cats do is scratch your furniture to shreds. You can't get your cat not to scratch, since it is somethings they absolutely have to do, but if you buy your cat a nice scratching post, then the cat will be deterred from scratching up your furniture.

, Face it, it's not the easiest thing to do, living with a creature you hate, so be flexible. Say things to yourself like, ""well, Fluffy is pretty cute,"" or ""you know what? Cats aren't so bad after all!""

Keep trash secured.,
Talk with your neighbors.,
Block any access points to shelter.,
Use fencing around problem areas.",How to Keep Cats Away1," Often times, stray cats will be attracted to your property in search of food. Although unappealing to humans, any trash or old garbage that a cat can find might be an attractive source of food. Always keep your trash bins secure to prevent cats from using them as a food source.Make sure the lid to your trash bin is secure and fits tightly.
Always make sure that all garbage is placed inside a secure trash bin.;
, If you have an issue with stray cats on your property, talking with your neighbor can help to resolve that issue. Talking with your neighbor can help you discover the reasons for your cat troubles and allow you to begin solving them together. Work with your neighbors to solve your stray cat problems.If there are many cats in your neighborhood, work with your neighbors to make your neighborhood unappealing to cats.
Your neighbor may be leaving trash or other food sources for cats outside. Ask your neighbor if they can help reduce the problem of stray cats by keeping any trash secure and by not feeding the strays.
Ask your neighbor to look for and seal up any potential shelter that the stray cats might be using. They may have an old barn or open porch that the stray cats are using as shelter.

, Like all animals, cats need shelter, and they can be attracted to your property as they look for this shelter. By blocking off any access points to sheltered areas you can help make your property look less attractive to any stray cats that might be passing by.Fence off any areas below a porch or deck.
Make sure any holes or narrow gaps in your house or garage are sealed up.

, If you notice any specific areas that a cat is causing problems in you can try putting up fencing to keep the cat out. Fencing can be difficult for a cat to climb over or under and can help keep them out of these problem areas.Try using chicken wire for an affordable and easy to build fence.
Free standing fences should be angled outwards to make it difficult for the cat to climb over.
Fence off any gardens that a cat might want to use as a litter box.

Install motion activated sprinklers.,
Make use of ultrasonic devices.,
Protect flower and plant beds.,
Apply commercial cat repellents.,
Try using natural scents to repel cats.",How to Keep Cats Away2," Cats have a serious dislike of water and will try to avoid getting wet. If you place motion activated sprinklers or running water features in your yard cats may be deterred from entering your yard in the first place.Motion activated sprinklers will spray water whenever a cat gets near, scaring it off.

, Ultrasonic devices emit a sound that is beyond the range of human hearing. However, cats are able to hear the tone and dislike it, causing them to avoid your yard. Try using an ultrasonic deterrent to keep stray cats off of your property.Place the ultrasonic devices near problem areas such as gardens or the usual places you catch the cats trespassing.

, Cats are likely to treat your plant or flower beds as litter boxes. This can cause problems for your garden, destroying any plants you may be trying to grow. Protecting your flower beds and gardens can help keep cats out and save your plants.You can install chicken wire over the gardens surface or just underneath the dirt.
Add pine cones, stone mulch, or ceder mulch to make the garden uncomfortable for a cat.

, Commercial cat repellents work by leaving a scent that cats dislike around your property. You can purchase and apply commercial cat repellents to make your yard smell unappealing to any cats that might be passing through. , If you are uncomfortable using commercial scent repellents you can try to use natural or homemade repellents. Try applying some of the following natural repellents around your house to keep cats away from your property. Lavender.

Use this only when necessary.,
Remove the collar.,
Find the scruff.,
Grasp the scruff and watch the cat's reaction.,
Place a clip over the cat's scruff.,
Gently push the cat onto its side.,
Add additional clips if necessary.,
Remove the clips after a few minutes.",How to Deactivate Your Cat," In one study, thirty out of thirty-one cats reacted positively, and none showed signs of pain or fear.Still, your cat may not enjoy it. Many vet technicians consider ""scruffing"" techniques old-fashioned, and too intense for regular use.Some say this technique is a more gentle option, but this is controversial.Try this when you need to trim the cat's claws or give it medicine.;
, You'll need full access to the cat's neck. If you leave the collar on, it could choke or pinch the cat.

, Cats have a loose fold of skin at the back of the neck, called a scruff. If your cat has an unusually small scruff, that you cannot easily grab, be careful. You don't want to pinch too hard.

, Firmly grasp the scruff and watch your cat's reaction. If the cat relaxes, it will most likely respond well to the next step: deactivating.If the cat struggles or meows, let go and try a different tactic, such as wrapping the cat.


If the cat neither relaxes nor struggles, look for dilated pupils, rotating ears, or rapid breathing, which are signs of fear.The closer to the ears you hold the cat, the more control you have over the cat's head., If the cat relaxed when you grabbed the scruff, the clip should have the same effect. In one study, two-inch (5 cm) binder clips had the best results.Place the clip over the scruff, just behind the ears.


You can try using a kitchen clip or clothespin. Smaller or more forceful clips may cause a painful pinch, but cats' reactions vary.

, A relaxed cat may flop over on its own. If it doesn't, a gentle push on the back legs should convince it. A fully relaxed cat may bring its paws up near its face, and/or curl up with its tail straight down or between its legs.


If the cat is standing, the tail between the legs is a sign of fear, not comfort.

, Some cats may not relax fully, but do not show any signs of fear or discomfort. If this happens, put one or two more clips on the scruff, in a line along the spine. Stop and remove the clips if the cat struggles, meows, or breathes heavily.


Some cats respond to clips placed anywhere along the skin above the spine, down the entire back. This typically has less effect than the neck., There are no expert recommendations for how long the clips can be left on. Most clips shouldn't cause any damage to your cat's skin, but your cat may become annoyed after a while. Aim for a short, positive experience to make future procedures easier.

Look for unusual shedding.,
Watch for hairballs.,
Think about any changes to your cat's environment.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Shedding More than Normal1," You've probably found cat hair that's rubbed off onto your clothes or your furniture. These are usually a few hairs here and there which are no cause for concern. But if you notice large clumps of hair throughout your home, your cat may be shedding more than normal.;
, Most cats groom themselves frequently, so you may not notice clumps of fur being shed. But if your cat is grooming itself more because of excessive shedding, you'll probably find your cat vomiting or coughing up hairballs. Keep track of how often your cat coughs up hairballs, since frequent hairballs may be a sign that your cat is shedding more than normal.Pay attention to your cat's diet. Hairballs may also form when you feed your cat a grain-based diet. You might consider switching your cat's diet to a grain-free one to cut back on the hairballs.
Some veterinarians suggest that passing hairballs is completely normal for cats, especially if they only do it every week or two., Cats are highly sensitive to their environment, which can create allergic reactions. If your cat is allergic to something, you may notice them shedding more, especially during the same season every year. For example, if you notice your cat shedding more over a short period of time when a specific plant blooms, your cat may be allergic to the plant. Your cat may be allergic to:Trees
Grass
Weed pollens
Fabrics such as wool or nylon
Rubber and plastic materials
Fleas or dust

Remove these and replace them with safe household plants.While some toxic plants may only upset your cat’s stomach, plants like lily can cause irreversible kidney failure. It is important to be informed about all toxic plants. Visit the ASPCA website for a comprehensive list of plants that are toxic to cats: https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants.
Some examples of safe household plants are cat grass, bamboo, blue echeveria, golden palm, lamb's tail, pearl plant, and Christmas cactus, to name a few.;
, Traps intended to kill pests can harm your cat as well. Place mouse, roach, and ant traps out of your cat's reach to avoid harming it. If you cannot place them out of your cat's reach, then you should remove them entirely.Call an exterminator instead of laying out traps if you have an infestation.

, Cover electrical wires and cords with covers, or place them out of reach. For cords that cannot be removed or placed out of reach, spray apple cider vinegar or bitter apple onto them. The bitter taste will deter your cat from chewing on the cords and wires.Re-spray the cords once a week.

, If you leave your windows open, then place screens on them. The screens will prevent your cat from escaping. They will also prevent your cat from falling out of high windows and injuring itself.Keep in mind that some screens may not be strong enough to resist the weight of your cat. If this is the case, close your windows, or only open the top part of your window so your cat can’t escape.

, Avoid using ammonia, scented cleaners (especially lemon-scented cleaners), detergents and deodorants to clean your cat’s bedding, toys, litter box, and food and water bowls. Instead, use hot water and a mild detergent (or a pet-friendly detergent) to clean them.Wash your cat's bedding in cycles so your cat's scent will remain on the items.
Make sure to secure household cleaners in locked cabinets.

Brush your cat.,
Look for irritated skin.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Shedding More than Normal2," Buy grooming supplies like gloves, brushes, and combs, so you can brush your cat. Try to brush your cat every few days to remove excess hair and track how much hair your cat is shedding. Regular brushing will help you decide if your cat is shedding more than normal.If you have a long-haired cat, use a long comb that can brush all the way to your cat's skin.

, After you've brushed your cat's fur, look at its skin. The skin should be white. If it looks red, bumpy, or irritated and you think your cat is shedding too much, you should take your cat to the vet. This is especially important if your cat seems bothered by a patch of its skin or fur.You should also look at the texture of your cat's fur. If some parts of the fur feel different, your cat may have a health condition that needs to be checked.

, If you're concerned that your cat is shedding more than is normal, you notice bald patches, or your cat's skin appears irritated, take your cat to the vet. Your cat might need to be treated for a health issue like:Allergies or poor diet
Ringworm
Bacterial infection
Fleas
Hormonal imbalance such as hyperthyroidism

Monitor your cat's daily shedding.,
Decide what is normal for your cat.,
Consider if your cat is in a shedding cycle.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Shedding More than Normal3," All cats shed a little hair each day. You're probably aware of what's normal for your cat without even realizing it. The fact that you're concerned your cat may be shedding more may be a sign that your cat is actually shedding more hair.


You can look at your clothes, furniture, carpets, and the cat's resting spaces to see how much hair has been shed.

, If you have a short-haired cat, it may not shed as fast as a long-haired cat. You should also remember that shedding amounts will depend on if your cat is an indoor or outdoor cat. Outdoor cats usually have two large shedding cycles when the seasons and daylight amounts change. Your cat's shedding will be much steadier if it's a strictly indoor cat.If you have an indoor cat, it will probably shed steadily throughout the year because it isn't exposed to changes in daylight.

, Your cat will go through one or two long shedding cycles during the year. This will help your cat's coat adjust for changing seasons. For example, a long-haired cat may shed as the weather turns colder, so it gets a winter coat.If your cat is going through a seasonal shedding cycle, it will shed fur from all over its body, not just in one spot or patch.

Place perches around the house.,
Provide hiding spots.,
Make your windowsill comfortable.",How to Develop Cat‐Friendly Habits at Home2," The perches should be long and wide enough to enable your cat to fully stretch and relax. Since elevated areas allow your cat to monitor its environment, perches and climbing trees provide the vertical space your cat needs to feel safe.If you have more than one cat, then make sure each cat has its own perch.

, Cardboard boxes and/or small cat-houses will allow your cat to escape to a safe place to hide if it needs to. Place the hideaways in communal spaces such as the living room or your bedroom. This way, your cat can still be a part of the family even while it is hiding.Make sure to provide multiple hideaways if you have more than one cat.

, Place bedding near various windows throughout your house. This will allow your cat to observe the outside world, providing it with some form of entertainment.It will also allow your cat to relax in the sunlight throughout the day—a cat’s favorite past time.

"
"
Separate food and water bowls.,
Place multiple water bowls around your home.,
Use a ceramic or glass food bowl.,
Place multiple litter boxes around your home.,
Provide scratching posts.",How to Develop Cat‐Friendly Habits at Home3," Cats like to feed and drink separately. Therefore, place your cat’s food and water bowls in separate areas of the house.For example, you can place its food bowl in the laundry room and its water bowl in the kitchen.

, Placing multiple water bowls in different locations in your home will encourage your cat to drink more water., Avoid plastic and metal bowls. Plastic bowls give off odors that may deter your cat from eating. On the other hand, the noise created by your cat’s collar clinking against a metal bowl may also deter it from eating., Ideally, each cat should have its own litter box plus one more. Place the litter boxes in secluded corners in your kitchen, bathroom, and/or laundry room. Additionally, make sure to place your cat’s litter box away from its food and water bowls, as well as windows and high-traffic areas in your house.For example, If you have one cat, then place two litter boxes in separate areas of the house. If you have two cats, then place three litter boxes throughout the house.
Make sure to check its litter box at least once, if not twice, a day to remove waste and refill it with fresh litter.

, The scratching posts should be tall enough to allow your cat to fully stretch while scratching. Also use horizontal and vertical scratching posts. This way, your cat will use these instead of your furniture to strengthen its nails and sharpen its claws.If you lack space in your house for scratching posts, then install scratching panels onto your walls for your cat.

"
"
Do not force your cat to play.,
Provide a variety of toys.,
Play with your cat regularly.",How to Develop Cat‐Friendly Habits at Home4," Instead, let your cat initiate the interaction. Your cat will approach you and rub its head against your leg or hand if it wants to interact. Hold your hand out and let your cat sniff it. Then proceed to rub its head, cheeks, and chin. You may even talk to it. If your cat shows more interest, then proceed to play with it.Once your cat has ended the interaction, do not force further interaction. Simply wait for your cat to return when it wants attention, or to play with you again.

, Puzzle toys are a great way to provide your cat with mental stimulation. Cardboard boxes, crumpled paper, and ping-pong balls are also great, interactive toys.Choose toys that stimulate predatory play like animated toys, as well as toys that contain fur or feathers. However, make sure to supervise your cat while it is playing with toys that contain feathers, fur, and/or string.

, In general, cats prefer frequent, low intensity playtime with humans. Therefore, play with your cat for 15 minutes twice a day, or for 10 minutes three times day, for example.If work or other obligations prevent you from interacting with your cat on a regular basis, then you may need get another cat (or dog, if it’s a dog-friendly cat) to prevent boredom in your cat.

Understand why your cat disturbs you at night.,
Do not feed her.,
Remove temptation.,
Minimize your cat's access to vermin.,
Keep your cat out of your bedroom if possible.",How to Keep a Cat from Waking You Up1," Most cats have basic, obvious reasons for being up at night. Your cat is most likely bored or hungry, or she may need you to clean the litter box.


Your cat is quite often left inside the house all day while you are at work or school with little interaction. She sleeps all day and may be bored at night with no one to play with.;
, One of the worst things you can do is jump up as soon as she meows or pounces on you and feed her. She will think that is the best way to get more food and will continue the behavior. Holding out for a long time before giving in is also a bad choice. This may even encourage her more than giving in right away. She will think it is a game to see how long it will take you to finally wake up and give her food. The delayed gratification is more like a chase, which speaks to her instincts.It's better not to give in at all.

, Cats like to jump from high places and pounce on things. When you are sleeping, you are the perfect target. Look around your room to see if there are common places that your cat pounces from. Look for high shelves, headboards, or dressers that she might climb on to get to you at night. If possible, you can remove them from your room or re-position them so she can't jump on you. If that isn't possible, put slippery cloth on them or cover them with items that she can't knock off. This will deter her from jumping up to those areas and pouncing on you., If your cat wakes you up by bringing you vermin, you need to stop the behavior. Keep the cat indoors at night if she's an indoor/outdoor feline. This will remove her ability to bring you kills in the middle of the night. If your cat uses a cat flap to have outside access instead of a litter box, this may not be an option. If this is the case, keep the cat in the room that has the cat flap. This will allow her to get out but keep her away from your bedroom so she can't bring you mice in the middle of the night.

, You can try to give her access to a secure room at night. Leave her in a nice, warm place with some food, water, and comfortable places to sleep. This will keep her out of your room at night and let you get a good night's sleep.If you want to reward your cat for good behavior, you can reach a compromise. Keep your cat out of your sleeping space on weeknights, but allow her in on weekends when you can at least sleep in if you are woken up during the night.

Look for an erect tail.,
Observe forward ears.,
Examine slowly blinking eyes.,
Look for head-butting or body rubbing.,
Identify kneading behavior.,
Listen for purring.,
Identify the Flehmen response.",How to Figure Out Your Cat's Mood1," An erect tail means your cat is happy, confident, and approachable. Additionally, an erect tail with a slight curve or hook at the end, resembling a question mark, means your cat is in a playful mood.A tail that is slightly erect and accompanied with a slow swishing from side to side signals that your cat is interested, alert, and focused on an object.;
, If your cat has its ears positioned forward, then it is in a playful or happy mood. Additionally, ears that are positioned straight signal that your cat is alert and interested.Swiveling ears also indicate that your cat is alert and listening to something.

, Slowly blinking eyes suggest that your cat feels comfortable, secure, and trusting. Additionally, half-closed eyes indicate that your cat is relaxed and content., A confident, comfortable cat will often head-but as a sign of affection. Sometimes, the head-butt is extended into a full body rub.Your cat’s pupils will be slightly constricted as well.

, Kneading, also called “making biscuits,” is when your cat is working its paws on you or a soft surface such as a blanket. It is called kneading because the motion of the cat’s paws resembles the motion your hands make when kneading dough. This means your cat is very happy., Most of the time, purring is a sign of contentment. A cat will purr whenever it is happy, even while it is eating.However, keep in mind that an anxious or sick cat may purr to calm or make itself feel better.

, Cats have an extra olfactory lobe located at the roof of their mouths. Therefore, if you see your cat lifting its head, slightly opening its mouth, squinting its eyes and curling its lips back, then it is using its extra olfactory lobe to gather more information.This is a common response in cats when they encounter new or interesting smells.

Ignore her meowing.,
Feed them before bed.,
Play with them.,
Stop them from biting.,
Be firm.",How to Keep a Cat from Waking You Up2," When your cat first starts meowing at night, you want to make sure she is okay. If you decide that she is not sick and has enough water and food, she may just want your attention. If the behavior keeps up every night, you have to ignore her. This may be difficult at first, but it will pay off in the end. If you come to her every time she meows, you will be reinforcing the negative behavior.


Don't punish her or give her any attention at all. She is looking for any acknowledgement from you, even it you are disciplining her.
If she won't stop, leave a toy hanging off a scratch post at the end of your bed for her to play with instead of bothering you.
If your cat doesn't stop, you can buy earplugs or headphones so you cannot hear her until she gets the hint., You can feed your cat right before bed if she wakes you up to get fed in the middle of the night. Don't worry about giving her a full meal, but make it large enough that it feels like more than a treat. This mirrors a cat's natural rhythm. They hunt, eat, groom, and then sleep to get more energy for the next hunt. If you feed your cat before bed, she will be full and want to sleep to regain her energy for her next hunt. It will also train your cat to know that late evening food means bedtime.


You can also buy a timed feeder that will release food for them in the middle of the night. Instead of waking you up, your cat will learn to go to her bowl on her own instead., One of the main reasons your cat may be awake at night is because she is bored. If your cat is alone all day, she will want to play and expend some energy when you are home. Try to make time to play with your cat every day. Drag a toy across the floor and let them chase it. You can even give them something distracting to play with alone. As long as she uses some of her built up energy, she will be more likely to sleep better at night.


Get toys that mimic the movement of animals such as birds or mice. Play fetch with ping pong balls or furry mice toys. You can even leave toys out with catnip in them during the day so she can play by herself when you aren't around.
Play with your cat until she seems to tire out. This will ensure that she will sleep better every night.
If your cat is social, try incorporating playtime with other cats. You can also get another cat to help her be more active during the day., If your cat likes to bite your fingers or toes, try to deter it from happening at night. Before you go to sleep, cover yourself completely with the sheet or blanket. You can also wear socks on your feet to keep your cat from seeing your toes move and thinking they are prey. Give her something else to nibble on.


Give her access to catnip toys, sisal balls, scratching posts, or anything she likes to chew on.

, Don't waver on your decision for your cat. If you do decide to shut her out, whether it's from the bedroom or from a whole range of rooms in the house, stick to your plan. Once the cat realizes you mean business, she will put up with the new arrangement. If you cave in, the cat knows things are back right to the way it wanted them to be all along.

Look for a low tail.,
Observe ears that are turned sideways.,
Examine slightly dilated pupils.,
Listen for a yowl or a howl.",How to Figure Out Your Cat's Mood2," If your cat is anxious or insecure, its tail may be tucked between its hind legs. Its body may also be low to the ground in order to minimize its presence, and it may be looking for a hiding spot., They may also be turned back. Turned back ears may indicate that your cat is over-stimulated as well, especially if you are playing with it.If your cat displays this behavior while you are playing or interacting with it, then it is time for a break.

, When your cat's pupils are slightly dilated, you will still be able to see parts of the iris. However, a majority of the iris will be covered by the pupil. Slightly dilated pupils means that your cat is feeling submissive or nervous.If dilated pupils is accompanied with a twitching tail, then your cat may be more irritated or over-stimulated than nervous.

, The sound of a howl resembles a meow that is long and drawn out. Howling or yowling may indicate that your cat is distressed; for example, it may be in pain or stuck somewhere. If you hear your cat howling, find your cat and try to resolve the issue.Unspayed or unneutered cats that howl are exhibiting mating behavior.
Dementia may cause older cats to howl.

Look for a puffed tail.,
Observe flat airplane-like ears.,
Examine dilated pupils.,
Identify an arched back.,
Listen for growling and hissing.,
Watch for a “frozen” cat.",How to Figure Out Your Cat's Mood3," If your cat is frightened or startled, its tail may be erect with its hair standing on end, resembling a pipe cleaner. Think of your classic Halloween cat.Additionally, a startled cat may have a puffed tail that is low or only slightly erect.

, These ears are flat at the top with the tips pointed outward, resembling an airplane. Flat ears signal that your cat is feeling scared and threatened.Your cat may position its whiskers back as well if it is frightened or startled.

, When your cat's eyes are fully dilated, you will not be able to see the iris.Your cat’s eyes will be fully dilated if it is frightened and on the defensive., An arched back is a sure sign that your cat is frightened. Cats arch their back to make themselves appear bigger to their aggressors., A hiss sounds like steam coming out of a kettle or an overloaded radiator. On the other hand, a growl is a deep, guttural sound that a cat can make while its mouth is closed.A frightened cat will either do one or both of these things. If this is your cat, leave it alone or try to remove the stimuli that is frightening your cat.

, Some stressed or fearful cats react by shutting down. These cats will often adopt a low body posture and tuck in their feet and tail, doing everything they can to make themselves as small as possible. Cats in this state won't react much to external stimuli and are difficult to move. If your cat is behaving in this way, give them a dark, quiet place to hide and try not to disturb them."

Look for a whipping tail.,
Observe ears that are positioned back.,
Look for eye contact.,
Identify constricted pupils.,
Listen for growling.",How to Figure Out Your Cat's Mood4," A tail that whips back and forth rapidly indicates aggression. Additionally, a tail that is thumping loudly and at a quick pace indicates irritation that is progressing into aggression.An angry cat may also have a puffed tail.

, Additionally, ears that are positioned back and close to the head signal anger and aggression., While eye contact is friendly for humans, direct eye contact in cats is a threat. If your cat is staring directly at you or another cat, this is an assertive signal that may escalate to aggression., When your cat's eyes are constricted, the majority of the iris is visible and its pupils resemble very thin, black slits. Constricted pupils accompanied with a stare indicate a challenge by your cat.Give your cat some space if you see this behavior.

, If your cat is growling while lying on its back, then this is a sign of aggression. Your cat may growl until the other cat backs down. If the other cat does not back down, then a fight may ensue.A growl may progress to a hiss if your cat is angry and feeling threatened.

Note how frequently they snore.,
Check out what position they’re sleeping in.,
Look for signs of upper respiratory infection.,
Look for other signs of illness.",How to Deal with a Snoring Cat1," Like humans, cats enter deep, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. When they do so, they are more likely to snore because their bodies are the most relaxed. If your cat only seems to snore very occasionally, they’re likely snoring during their deepest sleep, which is not dangerous., If your cat is sleeping in an odd position, their airways might be partially blocked, causing them to snore. If your cat is snoring, look at what position it’s sleeping in – is your cat’s body contorted in any way? Is it lying on its back? If this is the only time your cat snores, there are probably not any underlying issues., If your cat is snoring, it’s important to look for signs of an upper respiratory infection. Signs of an upper respiratory infection include wheezing, snorting, or coughing while your cat is awake, breathing with its mouth open, or extending its neck and panting.If you notice any of these symptoms in your cat, take it to the vet immediately.

, Your cat might also snore due to other types of illness. If your cat has any nasal discharge, facial swelling, sneezing, or a change in their voice (their meows might sound deeper or higher) along with their snoring, take your cat to the vet."

Act calmly.,
Press towards the cat.,
Do not use physical punishment.,
Make a sharp or unexpected noise.,
Restrain the cat.,
Remove yourself from the situation.,
Allow the cat to leave the area.,
Isolate the cat.,
Have your cat's health assessed.,
Change factors than may be causing aggression.,
Train your cat not to attack.,
Keep your cat out of aggression-inducing situations.,
Get your cat professional help.",How to Handle a Cat That Suddenly Attacks You," Reacting strongly can increase the cat's stress and interest in attacking you. It may even make the cat's prey instinct kick in more, spurring it on to bite down harder.Instead, stop moving and reacting to the cat. This will take away all the fun the cat gets from the attack.

If you don't ""play"" with the cat any further, it will likely lose interest and release its claws or teeth.;
, If the cat has its claws or teeth in you, then you need to work on getting the cat to remove them. Instead of pulling away, try push toward the cat further. This will hopefully confuse the cat, prompting it to let go.Pressing towards the cat will get the cat to release because prey don't usually move toward the cat after an attack.

, Hitting or smacking the cat will only increase the stress and aggression it is feeling. While physical resistance may be your first response when being attacked, resist that urge.You can, however, use a strong and stern voice to admonish the attacking cat. This will show the cat your displeasure while not increasing its attacking instinct.

, Making a loud noise can shock the cat into releasing its grip if it is unwilling to give up on its attack. Try making a loud noise or throw something across your room that will make a loud noise when it hits the floor.You can try to shock the cat by simply clapping very loudly.

, If all else fails, you may need to restrain the cat. This can usually be done most easily during an attack by scruffing the cat. Holding the cat by the scruff will disable the cat and allow you to get control of it.

Scruffing a cat needs to be done with caution. Holding the cat by the loose skin at the back of the neck in the right way is not painful, but doing it wrong can injure the cat.Ask your veterinarian how to scruff a cat and try it on a cat that is docile. This will assure that you know how to do it before you have to do it to a cat that is out of control.

, Once you have gotten the attacking cat off of you, walk away from it. Do not interact with the cat at all and just move away from it. This will help to diffuse the situation.

An aggressive cat is likely to continue its behavior if it gets a reaction or interaction due to the attack.
This is especially helpful in dealing with a kitten that is playing too aggressively. Withdrawing your attention if the cat plays too roughly will show it that the fun stops when they play too hard., Do not keep an aggressive cat in a room if it doesn't want to stay. Allow it to leave if it wants to so that it can go off on its own and cool down. For example, cats may act aggressively if they are scared, so letting it flee instead of keeping it in a fearful situation will reduce its stress and allow it to stop being aggressive.Sometimes a cat will attack because it did not want to be interacted with. If this is the case for you, then you should allow it to get the alone time that it wanted.

, If the cat is wild and you are fearful that it will continue to attack you, or injure itself, you may need to isolate it. This can be done most effectively and humanely by locking it in a room by itself until it has completely calmed down. There are other options as well, however, such as getting it into a cat carrier.

Getting a cat into a cat carrier can be done most easily with the help of another person.
If you place an aggressive cat in a room by itself for longer than an hour or so, you should supply a litter box, food, and water for it.

, Aggression in cats can sometimes be caused by medical problems. If your cat is feeling unwell or suffering, it could make the animal angry or unpleasant. To make sure that a health problem is not the cause of your cat's aggression, you should have it looked at by a veterinarian.Some medical problems that can cause aggression in cats include dental disease, arthritis, and hyperthyroidism.

, If your cat's health is fine, then its aggression has another cause. You should assess its living conditions to try and figure out what it causing its anger. The aggression may be caused by factors such as dirty litter, territory disputes with other cats, or previous trauma. If you think your cat is unhappy about one of these things, change it.It is best to figure out the source of your cat's aggression as soon as possible once aggression starts. This will help you to stop the cat's aggression from becoming habit.

, Once you have eliminated any health or situational problems that are causing your cat to attack, you should work on training it not to attack any more. This training should include interrupting aggressive behavior before it escalates. For instance, startling a cat before it attacks can sidetrack the cat from attacking.You should not use physical punishment or physical contact when training your cat not to attack. This will likely cause the cat to become more fearful and unsettled, thus increasing the likelihood of an attack.
If your cat is food focused, then treats can be used to reward non-aggressive behavior. For example, if your cat is aggressive toward strangers, you can give visitors treats they can give to the cat if it is calm with them.

, If you have figured out what triggers your cat's aggression, then you should try to keep it out of those situations. For example, if your cat is triggered by strangers in your home, then you should keep it sequestered away when strangers come to your home., If you have tried to ease your cat's aggression and have not had any success, then it's time to call in a professional. Contact your veterinarian and see what they can do about your cat's aggression. You can also contact a professional pet trainer or therapist to help your cat overcome its aggression.Your veterinarian may suggest giving your cat medication in combination with behavioral training. This can ease your cat's stress and minimize aggressive outbursts.

Take your cat to the vet.,
Try medication.,
Get your cat’s weight down.",How to Deal with a Snoring Cat2," If your cat is snoring but you can’t tell if it’s a benign snore or the sign of a more serious health issue, take your cat to the vet. Your vet will examine your cat more thoroughly than you can at home and determine if the snoring is a cause for worry., If your vet says that your cat’s snoring is nothing to be concerned about, ask them to suggest medication that you can give your cat. For example, Snore-Stop is used in dogs and cats to lubricate their airways and reduce snoring. Your vet can tell you the best and safest type of medication to stop your cat's snoring.If you do use medication to decrease your cat’s snoring, be sure you follow the directions very carefully. You don’t want to over-dose your cat.

, Snoring in cats can be caused by obesity, so getting your cat’s weight down can help reduce snoring. Your cat is likely overweight if they have a little pouch of fat between their back legs. You can also tell if your cat is overweight if, when you look down at your cat from above, you don’t see a clear indent at their back hips.

If your cat is overweight, you can try feeding them different food – lots of brands have a “healthy weight” formula. You can also encourage more exercise in your cat by playing with it more. Chasing games are especially good at getting your cat’s weight down."

This will probably mean keeping your door closed.If your cat is used to sleeping in your room, making this change can be difficult. Your cat will likely meow loudly outside your door when it realizes it can’t come in. Stay consistent and don’t let your cat in, and it should get the message within a few days.

, Wearing noise-cancelling headphones can help you block out your cat's snoring if you want to allow them to stay in your room.

You'll have to choose your headphones based on what you're willing to spend., Noise machines are a great option for blocking out your cat's snoring. Most white noise machines allow you to choose from a range of sounds, from white noise to rain storms. This type of sound won't keep you awake but will be decrease the volume of your cat's snoring.

There are also white noise apps that you can download if you have a smartphone. This option is more affordable than buying a white noise machine.

, If all else fails, you can simply get a soft pair of ear plugs from any home improvement store. They'll block out your cat's snoring without disrupting your partner. They're also a good option if you are trying to train your cat not to sleep in your room and your cat meows at the door."

Follow the instructions provided by your vet.,
Give the medicine daily.,
Administer the antidepressant orally.,
Have the cat’s blood tested once a year.,
Discuss the effectiveness in changing unwanted behaviour.,
Determine how long your cat should be on the antidepressants.",How to Give Antidepressants to Cats with Behavior Problems," As a cat owner, you should monitor your cat’s behaviour throughout their life. In many instances changes in behavior will signal an underlying medical or health issue. For instance, some cats may develop severe behavior issues, such as excessive grooming, aggression towards other animals or humans, anxieties and fears, or failure to use the litter box.For example, some cats may begin biting at their tail or licking their paws until the skin becomes raw and infected. This type of problem likely needs to be treated medically.;
, Any behavioural problems that may cause harm to the health and safety of your cat, other animals, family members, or property, should be treated medically. Your veterinarian will be able to assess the health of your cat and come up with solutions.For instance, your vet will likely refer you to a pet behaviorist to work on modifying your cat’s environments and behaviours.
If behavioral training alone doesn’t work, your vet may prescribe antidepressants. These have been shown to be successful in treating a variety of behavioral issues among cats.

, Prior to prescribing antidepressants to your cat, the vet should run a blood test to make sure that the kidney and liver are working properly. Antidepressants are processed through the liver and kidneys so it they should never be prescribed to a cat with a poor functioning liver or kidneys., Once your vet prescribes a type of antidepressant, typically these include Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), you should ask about any potential side effects that your cat may experience. This way you can monitor your cat and watch for negative side effects.For example, possible side effects for antidepressant medication in cats includes, lethargy, dry mouth, excessive thirst, and diarrhea.

, Certain antidepressants do not mix well with other medications and could result in severe health problems for your cat. Make sure that your vet is well informed about all drugs your cat is taking prior to prescribing an antidepressant., If your cat is only supposed to take half a pill per day, then you should not exceed this amount even if you don’t notice behavior changes. These drugs are very strong and may be toxic to your cat if they overdose. As a result, it is very important that you follow instructions carefully., Antidepressants need to be given daily in order for them to have an effect on your cat. To remind yourself to give the medication to your cat each day, write it down in your daily planner, or set a reminder alert in your phone. Alternatively, you could store the medication near your cat’s food. That way you will be reminded each day when you feed your cat., Antidepressants typically come in pill form and you will need to give the pill to your cat. This can be done by mixing it with their food, hiding it in special pill pocket treats, or inserting it into the back of the cat’s mouth using your finger.

If your cat resists taking a pill, you should place the pill in the back of the cat's mouth, close and hold the cat's mouth closed, and then blow air into your cat's face. This will cause your cat to swallow the pill on reflex.
You can also play with your cat to tire it out before giving the pill.

, While your cat is taking antidepressants, your vet should perform a blood test at least once a year. This way, they can determine if the drugs are having a negative impact on the liver or kidneys. A blood test can also determine if your cat’s body is tolerating the drugs., There is very limited information available concerning the effectiveness of antidepressants in cats. As a result, your vet may need to adjust the dosage or change the type of antidepressant, if no change in behavior occurs. It typically takes a few weeks for these drugs to begin working. If no change in behavior occurs after a month, talk with your vet to make changes to the medication., Antidepressants are typically prescribed for short term use and are combined with behavioral therapy. In some cases the unwanted behavior will return once the cat is taken off of the antidepressants. When this happens the cat may need to remain on the drugs for over a year, or even for the rest of their life."

Use stones or rocks.,
Try seashells.,
Place pine cones in a plant.,
Wrap the base of the plant in aluminum foil.,
Try double sided tape.",How to Keep a Cat out of Potted Plants1," If you're struggling to keep your cat out of potted plants, a barrier method may be your best option to keep him out of the soil. Some owners find using rocks or stones can be a fun, aesthetically pleasing option.


Lay the rocks around the base of the plant, making sure not to crush any stems or dig up the roots. When you water, the water should easily slip through the cracks of the rocks and get through to the soil. Your cat will not be able to dig or urinate in the soil as the rocks block her access.You can gather large rocks from outside. You may be able to order decorative rocks or gems online if you're going for a particular style or color scheme.;
, Seashells work similar to stones. You can line the soil surrounding your potted plants with seashell, creating an attractive barrier that water can easily pass through when necessary. You can collect them at the beach or buy them online or at a store., Pine cones can also work well for keeping your cat out of your plants. Line pine cones around the bottom of your plant. Like seashells or stones, this blocks your cat's access but allows water to get through to the soil. You can simply collect pine cones outside when you see them.


Pine cones may be flimsier than seashells or stones. Your cat may be able to remove pine cones if she wants to get to the plant.

, Most cats dislike walking on aluminum soil as it's slippery. You can try to lay aluminum foil over the soil surrounding the plant and lift the foil when you need to water. This is a fairly simple method to use. The main downside, however, is that many people dislike the aesthetic., Your cat probably won't like getting her paws sticky. If you dislike the appearance of aluminum foil, you could try laying double sided tape over the soil surrounding the plant. The tape might pull up some dirt, but it shouldn't uproot the plant too much. As with the foil, you can lift when you need to water.Some cats are prone to chewing or eating plastic. If your cat has been known to eat or chew on plastic bags or wrappers in the past, this might not be a great method for you. You wouldn't want your cat to eat the tape and get sick.

Consult your veterinarian.",How to Get Your Cat to Stop Hissing," Cats don't usually hiss to show dominance or threaten other animals. They usually hiss when they feel vulnerable, frightened, or in pain.However, cats may still hiss out of aggression. Either way, trying to punish a cat for hissing will only make it more upset, and likely to hiss even more.


When a cat is being aggressive, it is more likely to growl or yowl. Give your cat some space until you figure out why he is hissing.;
, Though every cat behaves differently, there are some characteristics that will almost always accompany hissing if the behavior is a sign of aggression.


Swatting or scratching with the front paws.Biting people or other animals.Growling, shrieking, or yowling.Barring teeth and/or claws., Have you moved your cat into a new home or apartment? Have you introduced a new pet to the household? What about a new roommate? Have you changed the arrangement of furniture? Any of these could cause your cat to feel ""off,"" and it's possible your cat's fear or confusion could be expressed through hissing., If your cat is hissing and there haven't been any changes in his environment or his temperament, he may be hissing because he is in pain. Consider taking your cat in for a visit with your veterinarian., Whether you've gotten a new pet, or undergone a recent move, your cat will probably need some time to adjust to his new surroundings.

, It may be a good idea to introduce them in a neutral area outside your home, so that they can become familiarized without either pet feeling intruded upon.If bringing a new pet into your home, keep the new pet separate from your current cat(s), and provide the new pet separate food, water, and a litter box. Allow the pets to socialize in your home gradually, over a period of several days to several weeks.Introduce them first by scent by letting the cats each sleep on a piece of your old clothing that has your scent on it as an intermediary. The next night, swap the clothing over so the cats get a whiff of each other's scent. This ""Scent handshake"" can smooth over the introduction as they learn about one another.
Keep an aggressive cat in his carrier during introductions, if he has displayed hissing and other aggressive behavior toward the new pet.Humans often cannot detect cat scent marks. Use a handheld blacklight, available at any pet store, to look for cat urine stains on walls and furniture.

, When cats fight, they often receive wounds that are not obviously visible. Carefully examine the animal by approaching the cat slowly, and gently running your hands over its body looking for tender spots. Your cat will let you know if you've found one, so don't poke or prod. If you find an injury, take the cat to the vet or animal hospital right away.


Common locations for fighting injuries include the head, chest and legs.Be very careful, an injured cat will lash out to try to protect itself, and can cause serious injury.

, If your male cat is displaying excessive aggression, including hissing, it's possible that he is hyper-territorial. Neutering an aggressive male cat may help correct this behavior and reduce his undesirable aggression., If your cat does not like to be petted, or held, or picked up, hissing may be his way of letting you know. Respect his boundaries, and don't handle your cat in a way he is not comfortable with.Always make sure the cat has an escape route to avoid you if she feels threatened. Many cats will hiss when they are cornered, as a sign they're not comfortable with how close you are and would you please go away. Having a quick look around you and making sure the cat has a clear line of sight way to get away of her own accord is likely to ease some of the tension.

, It's possible that your cat is hissing at you because he feels threatened by a neighborhood cat or dog that has challenged your cat through the window or screen door. If you believe this to be the case, try keeping the curtains and door closed as much as possible., It's possible that your cat was physically harmed or neglected by a previous owner, or even by someone who currently interacts with your cat.Investigate how other people treat the cat. Is there a chance that someone or something is harming or harassing your cat that you are not aware of? Ask around, and keep a close eye on children who may not know how to treat a cat properly.
If you are suspicious that someone is harming your cat while you aren't around, consider installing a nanny cam, or setting up a laptop or phone to discreetly film the cat's environment for a few days.

, When your cat hisses, back off. It's important that a cat not feel trapped or threatened, so don't corner it in a room. Just leaving a door open a crack so the cat knows it can run if it needs to can help soothe an anxious animal.When approaching a nervous cat, go slow, and give it ample time to adjust to your presence and your scent.
If your cat does run out of the room, don't chase it. That will only increase its anxiety.
Make sure to warn children and guests to give your cat space, and to not try to force it to be sociable.

, Clean up any cat spray that might be in the home using a specially-formulated cleaner. If a neighbor cat is lurking outside a particular window or sliding glass door, use opaque contact paper or cardboard to cover the window so your cat can't see the intruder.


If your cat is an indoor animal, you can use cayenne pepper or a specially formulated cat repellent around the perimeter of your yard to try to keep other cats from intruding., If your cat is stressed out by a new baby or pet, time will often help, but you can further assist your cat by providing him with ample resources and places to hide.


Make sure the cat has at least one place to perch that will keep him out of reach from any would-be pesterers, like a tall climbing post or kitty shelf.
If you have more than one cat, make sure that there are enough litter boxes, food dishes, and water bowls for everyone. Cats are much happier when they don't have to share., Spend more time playing with your cat, and try introducing new ways to stimulate him. Hide little treats around the house where your cat can find them, and never underestimate the therapeutic power of catnip.

, There are a number of products on the market that help soothe stressed cats by releasing soothing pheromones into the air. Check with your vet or local pet store for a specific recommendation. These products can be pricey, but they may be worth it.

, If you still can't figure out how what's bothering your cat, or how to fix it, have your pet checked out by the vet. There may be something going on physically with the cat that you can't see, or the vet may have suggestions for medication or other treatments that can help soothe your distressed animal.

Call your cat’s name.,
Use food to get your cat back inside.,
Search for your cat.,
Do not vent your frustration at your cat.,
Never chase your cat.",How to Get Your Cat to Come Inside1," Obvious of course, but if your cat doesn't respond in the first 30 seconds, she's either out of ear shot or not wanting to come in.


If this is the case, don't let your voice betray your frustration. Instead, shut the door and do something else for 5 minutes, and then try again.
A cat that is hiding may change her mind and be there the next time you call, once she realizes the open door is not permanent.;
, Only let the cat out when she is hungry. Take food away several hours beforehand so that she is partially focused on when the next meal is going to arrive.


This way when you need her back inside, if she refuses to answer to her name try shaking the box of cat biscuits. When she comes running, be sure to reward her with food.

, If it's important to get the cat inside and you can't see her, go and look. If it's raining or the cat is fearful, she may hide under a bush and refuse to move.


If she is hiding from danger, or merely keeping dry, she is unlikely to run off and you can pick her up to carry her indoors.

, When the cat is ready to come in and she appears after hours of calling, don't vent your frustration on her.


If you tell her she's a naughty girl for leading you a merry dance, or give her a gentle smack, she will associate coming inside with punishment. This will discourage her next time, and a vicious circle is established.
If you are angry about how long she kept you waiting, or because you were worried, just walk away. At least this way she does not learn an aversion to coming inside.

, On a similar note, never indulge in a game of chase to catch her. If she runs away, don't go chasing after her.


This only reinforces her decision to flee, and very few people can outrun a cat, especially if she decides to go up a tree.
The next time she sees you she will pre-emptively run and by chasing, you have taught her to run away rather than come to you.

Clean out your litter box at least once a day.Make sure your cat's litter box is easily accessible. A box with sides that are too tall may be difficult for your cat to climb in and out of. If you keep your litter box in a space that's often closed off, your cat will not be able to find the box when necessary.

Call it and offer food. Quickly inspect its favourite places and look for an open window or door.


Don’t forget to check the garage and the garden. Your cat might just be napping on the grass. Look below the car and in warm places, where cats love to sleep.;
, If your cat just left the house, don’t panic. Ask your household and your neighbours to explore the area around your house. Cats usually don’t travel much and are likely to be close by.


Be organized. Assign a street or two to each member of the search party. Ask them to be systematic and to look below cars and behind bins.
Leave your front door open. The cat might want to come home after a while. Make sure that it can access the house. Leave its favourite blanket or litter box outside to let the smell travel. It will help your cat if it lost its way. Don’t forget to leave someone inside to check for potential intruders.
Don’t run. You might want to hurry while searching for the cat in the streets. Sudden movements will scare your pet. Cats dislike sudden movements and are wired to hide when threatened.
If you live near a major road, make sure your cat hasn’t been hit by a car. Cats are unfortunately prone to these accidents. , If you have a pedigree cat, it might be worth going to the police station. Breeds have a monetary value and are targeted by thieves.Bring a picture and a description with you.

Try to make sure that your cat hasn't escaped. You don't want to waste the time of the police.

, It is worth searching again in the evening if you didn’t find your animal during the day. Cats hunt at night.They also dislike noise and are more likely to get out when everything is quiet outside. Remember that they have a better night vision than humans.


Begin your search at dusk when the sun is still shining. The setting sun will create long shadows, which are ideal to spot your little friend.
Don’t forget to take a lamp torch with you. Remember that a cat’s eye will reflect the beam of your torch, making it very visible at night. Point your lamp torch in all directions and below the cars. Look for the typical reflection in the retina.Shake a can of the cat’s favorite food as you walk around. The sound might attract it.

, Cats like to sneak inside neighbours’ houses for a nap or to eat food. It might be worth ringing bells to investigate. Start with the houses close to your home and extend the perimeter progressively. Don’t forget to bring a picture of your cat.


Give your coordinates to the people you meet. They might spot your cat soon after your visit.
Be polite and apologise if you are disturbing someone. If you leave a good first impression, people might be more willing to help.

, Your cat is gone for more than a few hours and it’s time to be efficient. Create a poster with your computer and ask for a few friends to placard copies all over the area.


Your poster should include a colour picture of your cat, its name, your name, the date and location it disappeared from, a phone number and an email address.
Ask local business to placard your poster inside and outside their shops.
Don’t placard a poster if it’s illegal to do so. You don’t want to be fined.

, Cats usually stay in the area where they live but can occasionally travel further.Using social media, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, is the best way to alert a lot of people quickly.


Target local website and popular social media. It’s the fastest and most efficient way to make sure that the whole area where you live is covered.
Publish an ad in the local newspaper. It is less effective but you want to be thorough.
You could offer a reward. This might encourage children or other people to look for your cat actively.

, Your cat might have been found and brought to a shelter. It is always worth visiting them and making sure your cat is not there. There are also charities helping with the search process. Check online to see if there is one in your area.


If you go to a shelter, bring a picture of your cat and its documents. They might want to make sure that you are the rightful owner.
Don’t wait too long to visit a shelter. In some countries, animals are sometimes put to sleep to make space for others. Fortunately, this is not such a common practice and most shelters will put only aggressive animals down.
Call local veterinarians. They might have your animal.

, If you or your friends spot the cat, be careful. Your animal might be afraid or wounded.Call your friends for backup and try to talk to the cat. Look for potential escape routes and try to anticipate its movements. Approach slowly and, if possible, offer food. Let the cat sniff your hand and give it time to trust you. Gently take the animal in your arms.


If your cat is visibly wounded, try to be extremely careful. You don’t want to aggravate the situation or cause unnecessary pain.
Make sure you take the right cat! It’s not always easy to distinguish similar animals. Look for distinctive marks and try to see if he recognises you.

, If your cat was away for a long time, you don’t want to traumatize it further. Let your animal rest for a few days and offer plenty of food. Talk to your animal and show your love.


Don’t let your cat out too soon after its disappearance. It needs to find its marks and get used to the environment.
If you decide to let your cat go out again, go with it. Let your pet explore a small area at first. Increase the zone in which it is allowed each day.

, If you cat was out for a few days, it might be worth bringing your animal to an animal clinic. Injuries, such as a rib fracture, are not always easy to spot. Your cat might also have caught a skin disease or flees. If there is a visible wound when you recover your cat, don’t delay the visit. An infection might spread quickly.
Don’t forget to take its medical history with you. It might matter in a treatment.

Don't feed the cats unless you have a TNR Trap/Neuter/Return program started first.,
Remove other food sources.,
Remove or block sources of shelter.",How to Get Rid of Cats1," Feeding unaltered cats will keep them coming back to your property and encourage population expansion.


Talk to your neighbors about whether people are feeding the unaltered cats. If people who live nearby are feeding them, it could be causing the population in your neighborhood to get out of hand.
If you do feed cats, put the food well away from your house. Don't place it at your front door unless you want to encourage cats to collect there.;
, Cats can subsist on very little, so it may be impossible to completely remove their food sources in your area. You can start by making sure your trash isn't overflowing from the can, and that you secure the can with a tight-fitting lid.


Talk to your neighbors to make sure everyone agrees to use tight-fitting lids to seal their trash cans.
Restaurant dumpsters are often sources of food for stray and feral cats, especially because they're frequently left open and only emptied once they're completely full. If a dumpster in your neighborhood seems to be attracting cats, talk to the restaurant owner about strategies for keeping the trash more secure.

, Cats seek a warm, dry space for shelter from the elements, and if they're unable to find a nesting place, they will move on to the next neighborhood. Fence off the area under your porch or deck, and make sure your shed door is tightly closed. Cover any small openings under porches, decks, or foundations.


If you notice cats gathering in a particular place in your area, figure out what they're using for shelter and block access to it.
Plywood and chicken wire are inexpensive, yet effective, materials for covering openings.

Find a food that motivates your cat.,
Decide on the cue that you want your cat to respond to.,
Begin making your cat work for her treats.,
Keep training sessions short.",How to Get Your Cat to Come Inside2," The key to training is finding a food that motivates your cat. Every cat is a sucker for at least one particular food, be it a flake of tuna, chicken, ham, prawns or even steak.


You need to find out what food is the ""must have"" treat for your cat, the food that she will do anything for. This may take a bit of experimentation, offering different morsels until you hit upon the one she really perks up for.
This food is going to be the treat you use as motivation.

, It might be her name, or a command such as ""come"" or ""here"", or it could be a clicker. The general idea is to get the cat to associate that command, or a ""click"" with getting her must-have treat.


Start off by ""clicking"" each time you put her food down. Clickers are small handheld gadgets that make a loud ""click"" when you press down on the trigger. They are widely used in dog training, and are equally suitable for cats.
Next, keep a supply of treats in a container in your pocket. When you are relaxing, for example watching TV, place a treat on your finger tips and hold within the cat's reach. Eventually she will stroll over for the treat. At the very moment she takes the treat, ""click"".
Think of this as taking a photo of the good behavior. The importance of clicking at the exact moment she takes the treat is to strengthen her association between clicks and treats.
Reinforce these first lessons by being consistent. Take every opportunity to get her to associate food with clicks. Teach her that clicks mean treats.

, Now she has learned that clicks mean treats, start making her work for the treat a little. Click when she is in a different room, and when she comes running, give her a treat and a click. Then several more clicks and treats so that she considers the trip it worthwhile.


At this stage, you may want to try letting her out when you has an empty stomach. Initially, let her out of the door, and immediately click. When she comes for a treat, click again.
Each time, let her wander a little further away before you click. The aim is that eventually, no matter where she is she will come to the click.

, Cats will not concentrate for more than 5 to 10 minutes at a time, and it takes repeated exposure to a command and reward system in order to train a cat.


Try to keep each session short, 5 minutes or less, and repeat the sessions 2 – 4 times each day.
If during a session the cat is looking around and not focusing on you or the treat, stop the session, and resume at the next allotted time.

Consider what has changed in your cat’s life.,
Understand that if a cat feels threatened, she will be less likely to spend time at home.,
Consider whether or not your cat is neutered.",How to Get Your Cat to Come Inside3," First things first. If your cat used to come inside, but now she refuses to come home, ask yourself what has changed. Has something happened, such as the arrival of a new dog, to make her feel insecure when inside?


Take a look at her body language. Does she stroll around with her tail up, rubbing her head against furniture in a confident manner?
Or does she skulk close to the ground, her head twitching from side to side on the look-out for danger? The latter indicates that she is scared about something she might encounter.
If you fix this problem then the likelihood is that she will come home willingly once more.

, If your cat doesn't feel safe, then she will prefer to remain outside and only come in when driven there by hunger. Take a look around you and try to see things from your cat's perspective.


Does she get chased by another cat when she comes in? Can she cross from the door to a favorite sleeping place without having to pass a noisy washing machine?
It doesn't take much to frighten a cat, so your aim is to eliminate the scary, and make the home as safe and welcoming as possible.

, Unneutered cats are more likely to roam, tom cats especially so. A tom has a strong hormonal drive to patrol his territory to secure it from intruders.


Get him neutered so that his testosterone levels are no longer working against you. He will become more focused on home, plus he's less likely to fight and therefore at a reduced risk of picking up serious infections like feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

Cover your glass when you leave the room.,
Put a slice of lemon in the glass.,
Put the drink in a place your cat cannot reach.,
Give your cat something to distract it.",How to Keep Cats from Drinking Out of Glasses2," You can use tin foil or plastic wrap. This way, your cat will not be able to gain access to the glass.


You can also use a glass that come with a lid. Your cat will not be able to access the liquid if it cannot access it.
Be careful not to leave any loose tin foil or plastic wrap, as your cat could eat it and choke. Make sure the foil or wrap cannot come off either, since that could be dangerous to your cat as well.

, This will make the lemon float on the top, but move back when you tilt the glass to drink. Best of all, most cats dislike lemon and won't be tempted to try it.Cats really dislike bitter or sour tastes. It will likely spit out any liquid and run away from the glass.
Lemons or limes are also good because these additives do not change your behavior drinking out of a glass. Ideally, you should not have to change anything to get your cat to stop drinking from your glass.

, Many cats can jump nearly everywhere, but they need to climb up to high places. If you can find a tall surface without any medium sized surfaces near it to act as a springboard, this would be ideal for placing your glass out of your cat's reach.Your cat cannot leap directly onto high surfaces. Place your glass on a high enough top without other surfaces nearby to get your cat to stay away from your glass.
Cats dislike sticky surfaces. You can also put down double sided tape near your water glass so your cat will not go near it.

, Try a toy or a cat jungle gym. Cats are curious, so giving them something to do will make them less likely to drink our of your glass.Your cat may be getting into your glass because it has nothing else to play with. If you have toys, you can play with your cat and give it something to do when you're not in the room.
A cat jungle gym can also be a lot of fun for a cat. Your cat will usually stay entertained for a long period of time when using one.

Observe why your cat is drinking from glasses.,
See if your cat drinks more from glasses of certain liquids.,
Change your cat’s bowl.,
Figure out if your cat has to fight for its water bowl.",How to Keep Cats from Drinking Out of Glasses3," Cats may drink from your glass for many reasons. Watching your cat while it drinks can tell you its motivation for drinking from your glass.Your cat may stick its paw in your glass and drink from its paw. This may mean it is soothing its paws or interested in tasting what’s in your glass.
Cats are driven by instinct. They may be trying to satisfy some need (thirst) or instinct (aversion to threat) in drinking from your glass rather than its water bowl.

, Your cat may try to drink from your water glass, which can mean it is simply thirsty. It may also want to drink from more flavorful liquids, which can tell you what supplements may be useful in its diet.Cats are drawn towards sweeter liquids. They can’t taste sweets, but enjoy the smell and texture.Many liquids are dangerous for cats, including tea, coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. If your cat is trying to drink any of these liquids out of your glass, stop this behavior immediately.

, Your cat may not like its bowl, so it prefers to drink from your glass. Not changing out the water regularly can cause the water to become stale and unappetizing to your cat.Cats are sensitive to the size and shape of its water bowl. Try a few different sizes of bowls to see which type your cat likes best.
Fill the bowl each day with roughly one day’s worth of water. You’ll want to clean the bowl with soap and water every day as well.

, Having multiple cats in your household can lead to them to fight over water. If one cat is drinking more from your glass than another, see if it is not getting enough water from the water bowl.


If you have more than one cat, they can be territorial about their food and water. One cat may be scaring off others from going to the water bowl often.Observe your cats during feeding time. If you find that one cat is bullying another, use a verbal command such as “No!” to get them to cooperate together.

Scare cats away naturally.,
Install a motion-sensing sprinkler.,
Sprinkle pepper around the area.",How to Get Rid of Cats2," The sight and sound of these natural enemies will cause cats to give your property a wide berth.

, It's a well-known fact that cats and water do not mix, so felines will happily stay out of the water's range and off of your lawn. An added bonus is that your grass and flowers will get a nice watering in the process.

, The cats will be bothered by their spicy paws at grooming time, and, with habitual application, will learn that your property is the culprit. You can temporarily keep them from spending time in a certain area by sprinkling plenty of pepper around.


Sprinkle pepper under your porch, in your shed, on your back patio, or wherever you see cats playing or napping.
Pepper works on grass, too, but you will have to reapply it frequently, especially after heavy rains.

"
"
Contact your local shelter or animal rescue for advice.,
Trap the cats.,
Take the cats to the veterinarian.,
Return the cat to the neighborhood.There are a various reasons to return cats to exactly where you trapped them.",How to Get Rid of Cats3," You may not realize all aspects of your situation and the possible solutions.

, The most humane and effective way to get rid of cats long-term is to first trap them so you can take them to be neutered or spayed. Buy a cat trap, a plastic or metal trap with a door, and bait it with tuna, sardines or cat food. Place the trap near where the cats regularly feed and cover it with a blanket.


When you catch a cat, don't let it out of the trap. Make sure the vet you use is aware in advance that you're bringing a feral cat in, as they may not handle feral animals.
Cover the trap with a blanket to calm the cat down.

, Many vets have programs that allow them to spay or neuter feral cats at no cost, since the feral cat population is known to be a problem. Call around to vets and shelters in your area to find a program suitable for your situation.


Spaying or neutering the cat is a humane way to keep it from reproducing and control local cat populations.
Know that once you bring the cat to the vet, you'll be responsible for it afterward. Prepare to take it home with you and to make sure it is fit/healed enough to live in the wild once the procedure is complete. Never release a cat that is injured or anesthetized into the wild (outdoors).

, Here are a couple: 1) Males (regardless of being in-tact or not) serve the purpose of keeping strange males away from their colonies (keeping any in-tact females from additional opportunities to mate, which helps to control population). 2) The animal is likely already feeling traumatized and will adjust best to familiar turf. Remember: the end-goal of the Trap-Neuter-Return strategy: to prevent the continuation of breeding of free-roaming cats, so that the cat may live out its life in peace.


In order for the Trap-Neuter-Return method to be an effective way to control a cat population, most or all of the cats in the population need to be trapped, neutered or spayed, and returned. In time, the population will decrease, since the cats won't be reproducing.
If you employ the Trap-Neuter-Return method, it's safe to feed the cats once you bring them home, since they will no longer be reproducing.

"
"
Call animal control if you can't control the population on your own.,
Don't take cats to the animal shelter.",How to Get Rid of Cats4," Animal control agencies usually trap the cats and euthanize them. Unfortunately removing cats from where they are living creates a vacuum effect. New cats quickly move into the vacant area and start using the resources to thrive and survive. The most effective method of reducing the population of cats in an area is TNR. You may also be able to ask animal control to help you employ the Trap-Neuter-Return method if you're uncomfortable trapping cats by yourself.

, Most shelters don't accept feral cats, since they are most often not adoptable. Feral cats that enter shelters are euthanized over 90% of the time after entering shelters. Feral cats are often shy and unsociable, so they shouldn't be invited into people's homes.

Gather the supplies:


Dry oatmeal, or cornmeal.,
Pour a one inch/2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) layer of oats/cornmeal into the bottom of each plastic container.,
Deposit some vegetable slices into each bin.,
Pour the live mealworms into one of the containers.,
Place a few scraps of cardboard material on top of the oats.,
Label the containers accordingly.,
Seal the containers and place them in a warm, dark area.,
Maintain the containers periodically.,
Keep an eye out for pupa in the mealworm habitat.,
Separate the pupa as soon as you start to notice them.,
Continue to check both containers regularly for advances in the life cycle.,
Remove adult beetles from the pupa container immediately.,
Check the adult beetle container regularly for eggs.,
Move the mealworms out of the adult beetle habitat and into the mealworm container upon hatching.,
Continue daily or weekly maintenance of the habitats.",How to Raise Mealworms,"
An organic source of moisture that is not likely to mold quickly. Carrots work best for this, but you can also use other fruits and vegetables such as sliced or chopped potatoes or apples.
Three plastic containers with air-holes drilled in the tops.
Several bits of cardboard in the form of egg cartons or used toilet paper rolls.
Mealworms, also known as darkling beetle larva. You can start with anywhere from 500 to 1000.;
, This serves as bedding and food for the mealworms in their various stages of development.

, You may use any kind of fruit or vegetable for this, such as celery, lettuce, potatoes, or apples. Carrot seems to take longer to develop mold than other fruits and vegetables. If you decide to use other moisture sources, be sure to replace them often.

, Some mealworm farmers also like to add a few slices of bread, some ground up cereal, or dry dog food to the mix.

, These little creatures enjoy their darkness.

, One of them will be for mealworms (larva), one for pupa, and one for adult beetles.

, Warmth speeds up the life cycle process, so your mealworms will pupate faster if they are kept warm.

, Some farmers like to check things out daily, and some only do this once per week.


Remove any rotted vegetable matter, dead insects, or clumps of mold from the oatmeal substrate.
Add more vegetables and oatmeal as needed and move the bedding around to prevent mold.

, Depending on the temperature and how old the mealworms were when you purchased them, transformation into the pupal stage can take anywhere from a week to a couple of months.


Maturity is marked by gradual darkening of color in all stages of the life cycle.
Pupa start off extremely pale white and look more like little curled up beetles than segmented worms.
You may notice that mealworms shed their skin (moult) several times before turning to pupa. This is normal.

, You can do this with tweezers if it happens to gross you out.


Pupa do not move around very much and do not require any food. Moisture doesn't hurt, but pupa will not eat away at the moisture sources you place inside the container with them.
It is important to keep pupa separate from larva and adults because they cannot defend themselves and run the risk of being eaten before they have a chance to hatch.
The pupal stage lasts anywhere from one to several weeks depending on the temperature. You will know they are getting close to hatching as they begin to darken in color.

, This becomes more important as you have more insects in the various stages of development.

, They will begin to feed on other pupa if they are not taken out swiftly.


Place the adult beetles into a separate container with the same setup as the mealworms. It never hurts to put a little extra oatmeal in there so they have more room to nest.

, These will become more plentiful the more adults are in there. They can usually be found along the bottom of the container.


It is not necessary to remove the eggs, but they serve as a signal that you will have more larva (mealworms) soon.
Adult females will lay about 500 eggs at a time.
Eggs will hatch within 4-19 days depending on the temperature.

, Since the females lay so many eggs at once, you will have a lot of work to do with each generation of hatchlings.

, This includes replenishing food and moisture sources, keeping the insects separated according to their phases of life, removing dead insects, and moving the bedding around regularly.


If you notice that you begin to produce more mealworms than you can feed to your pets, you can cook and eat some yourself, or humanely cull them by freezing some. Do not release them into the wild (mealworms are not native to North America). You may also feed some of the pupae to the adults, or place extra mealworms inside a bird feeder in your yard.

Make sure the kitten has no bowel or urinary problems.,
Check for other health problems.",How to Get a Kitten to Fall Asleep," Create a soft, cozy bed for the kittens, large enough to include the mother cat if there is one. Use a soft blanket or towel to cover the base and sides of a box or basket. Leave the top of the bed uncovered, and make sure the kittens can leave and enter the bed themselves, unless they are not yet weaned.;
, Place a warm, but not hot, rubber water bottle or microwavable heat pad underneath the blanket. Kittens love warmth, and will usually fall asleep in a warm, enclosed space.


You can also warm the towel or blanket over an electric space heater or in the dryer, just for a few minutes.

, If the kittens do not have a mother, an object that produces a quiet, regular sound may help the kittens relax. An alarm clock or a kitchen timer next to the bed might work, but make sure there isn't a noisy alarm set to go off.

, Make sure other animals, besides the mother cat, do not have access to young kittens, and that all humans know not to step into the kitten area without watching the floor.


Don't keep kittens in an attic, garage, or basement, since these areas can rapidly become too cold or too hot.

, Near the bed, the kittens should have access to water, a litterbox, and toys. If the kittens have access to food around the clock, place the food dish in this area as well.


Empty the litterbox regularly, or the kittens may not wish to sleep there — or they may use their bed instead.

, Cat pheromone products mimic the natural, calming chemicals cats produce when they rub their face on objects. This may be useful if the kitten won't sleep in its bed, or if a kitten old enough to be potty-trained still uses the bed as a litterbox. Spray the pheromones on the kittens' bed, never on the kitten directly, and allow 20 minutes for it to dry before you allow the cat access to it., While the kittens are in bed, move conversations and television elsewhere. Some kittens find gentle music relaxing, but in many cases complete silence is more effective.

, Put a blanket over your lap so you can slide the kitten off once it's fallen asleep. Gently pick up the kitten and encircle it with your arms, making a warm, enclosed space.


You can place young kittens under your sweater, or under a second light blanket. This might be enough to send them to sleep by itself.
If the kitten won't stay in your lap, read the tips in the section on hyper kittens first. If the kitten is leaving because it is uncomfortable around you, don't force it to stay.

, Starting about halfway up the bridge of the nose, stroke the kitten's nose upward with one finger. Move up to the top of the kitten's forehead, then lift your finger and repeat again from the nose. The kitten should reflexively blink or close its eyes while you do this, encouraging it to fall asleep.

, Different kittens have different preferred petting areas, but there are plenty of common places you can try. Stroking the forehead usually calms cats, as does rubbing under the chin or the top of the neck. When getting a cat to sleep, always stroke the fur in the direction it lies, repeating the same motion slowly.


Some kittens like their front paws gently massaged, but this area is too sensitive for some others. Try it, but let the kitten pull away if he doesn't like it.

, Move your face near the kitten and blink or close your eyes. If the kitten is watching you, it might respond the same way. Yawning might also work, but keep your face a bit further away to avoid scaring the kitten.

, Once the kitten is dozing off, read a book or find some other quiet activity. Breathe deeply and slowly, since kittens can pick up on this sign of calm. If the kitten keeps squirming, you can try blowing onto the kitten's back on the exhale, or holding it near your chest so it feels your heartbeat.

, Choose a cloth with a slightly rough weave, but rub gently. Wipe the kitten's cheeks, forehead, and bridge of the nose. This mimics the mother cat licking the kitten's face, and may make it more comfortable.

, If a kitten is running around or batting at you, it doesn't want to sleep. Tire the kitten out by making it chase a string, feathers, ribbon, or other cat toy.


Moving up and down will tire the kitten out sooner. Try making it run up and down stairs, or across a plastic netting draped on the back of a sturdy chair.

, Schedule one of the kitten's feeding sessions right before bedtime, since a full belly will help it feel sleepy. For best results, heat the food to a warm, but not hot, temperature. Placing a closed container of food in a pan of hot water should accomplish this safely. If you microwave the food, stir it thoroughly to mix in hot spots.


You might be able to make the kitten sleepier by mixing in a small amount of carbohydrate-rich food, such as cooked rice or sweet potato.
Also make sure the kitten has constant access to water.

, Feed the kittens and encourage them to sleep at the same times each day. Newborn kittens are on a much shorter cycle and require feeding every two or three hours, but after about four weeks old this can gradually change to a more convenient schedule.

, Constipation can be a serious, even life-threatening condition for young kittens, and may be a source of discomfort preventing the cat from sleeping. If a young kitten has not eliminated urine or feces within the last 12 hours, take it to a veterinarian immediately.


Newborn kittens (under four weeks) without a mother cat need to have their genitalia rubbed with a warm, wet washcloth after each meal. Rub gently in one direction only, and continue until the urine flow has stopped.

, If a kitten has all the necessities it needs, but is still mewing or refusing to sleep, it might be kept awake by itching or pain. Check the ears for mites and the fur for fleas, and treat these with kitten-safe medication if present. Consult a veterinarian if the kitten is uncomfortable for no apparent cause, or if you discover a more serious medical issue.

, The scruff refers to the loose skin found around the kitten's neck, behind the head. The mother cat uses this area to carry the kittens around. Picking up the kitten from here usually won't hurt the kitten because it doesn't weigh much, provided you do so very gently and only use the loose skin with a gentle but firm hold.For more details, read How to hold a cat (or kitten) by the scruff.

, If you have a cat that is like this, then you'll just need to deal with it as best you can, and only handle the cat for such occasions as needing to move it, taking it to the vet and giving it medication. You can still groom and pet the cat.

, This is much less threatening to an animal than coming at it front on. Anitra Frazier also recommends turning the cat to face away from you before picking it up (in other words, approach the cat from behind).Begin by putting your hand forward for the cat to sniff. This is a sign of respect for the cat and lets it know that you are familiar and calm. Do not make any sudden jerky movements; instead, just rub your fingers and thumb together.
Give the cat a scratch between the ears and on its chin or down the sides of the cheekbones.
Place your first hand behind the cat's front legs, near the armpits.
Lift the cat up, quickly scooping the hind legs up with your other hand, coming in from below. It helps to lift the cat's head up higher than the back part; this will tilt the cat's weight onto your rear-end supporting hand.
Bring the cat gently but swiftly close to your body to provide additional support. This reassures the cat that it has plenty of support and will ease a desire to struggle against being held.
As much as you can, leave the cat's legs free from the hold. This allows the cat to feel free and gives it a sense of being safe and able to get moving if it needs to; it is also reassuring that its free legs will land first as you put the cat back down.
To put the cat back down, tilt the head downward so that the cat can see where it is headed for landing.

, There is debate about the acceptability of this hold for adult cats because if it is done incorrectly, it can hurt the cat. As such, some experts recommend that it not be used at all on adult cats.If using this method, always quickly support the hind end with your other hand, to provide additional support and ease the weight pull.If in doubt, you are best not using this hold at all, and it should never be used on a large, heavy cat as the weight may just make it too difficult to do safely.


If the cat relaxes when you use this hold, this can be an indication that you are doing it correctly and that the cat is tolerating it.
For more details, read How to hold a cat by the scruff.

,
Be sure to support the cat's hind legs with your hands.
Cuddle with care.

, There are some things that you should never do by way of handling the cat, as they can cause injury to the cat, and possibly to you if the cat retaliates. These include:


Do not ever pull a cat by its tail. If the cat is stuck under furniture or some other place, the tail is not a retrieval device.
Ditto for legs. Do not ever pull a cat towards you using a leg or legs. The cat's limbs are fragile and human strength can easily dislocate the leg.Do not squeeze or hold the cat's paws or forelegs.Cats find this threatening.
Do not squeeze the whole cat. The cat's structure is not designed to be squeezed and the cat can be hurt if you do this.
Avoid breathing in the cat's ears, eyes or nose.To the cat, this is a form of unbearable tickling and the cat may take it as a sign of aggression.

, If you think that it might bite, scratch and struggle, place a towel or blanket over the cat before picking it up. The fact that the cat cannot see can help to calm the cat down.Always have its carrier case close so that you can place the cat straight into it for safety and carriage to the vet.

, Gauge how receptive the cat is to being pick up by the behavioral clues it is giving out. If it appears irritable, unfriendly and not interested in your proffered hand for sniffing, it's probably best to leave the cat well alone until it has calmed down and is more receptive. If you really need to handle the cat for safety reasons, try the towel or blanket approach as suggested in the previous step.

, Cats can sense and read your body language and vibes.If you feel scared, worried or incompetent about handling the cat, the cat will pick this up and will possibly react to your lack of confidence by refusing to cooperate. Be gentle but firm, and have trust in your own ability to handle the cat correctly.

, The cat should recognize that skin and flesh is not a toy for biting. Injury to yourself can occur you if you teach the cat to play with your hands and it then bites them whenever it sees your hands flying about. Do not ever encourage this habit.

, The playfulness is a sign to encourage you to interact through wriggling, tossing, pulling about toys on strings, sticks, etc. It is recommended that you let the cat's playfulness dissipate before trying to pick up or cuddle the cat.

, Also be aware that closer to the time of birth, she may be less likely to be in the mood for cuddling but you can still show affection by spending time with her on her terms, sitting yourself near wherever she chooses to sit.


Some cats won't like being picked up during pregnancy, due to increased sensitivity. Gauge it from your cat's reaction and follow her preference.

, Just be extra careful not to squeeze her belly region or to place any pressure on it. Don't lift her too high; try bending down to her level, then keeping her at a lower level, such as taking her to the couch and sitting together.


Her weight should rest on your arm when held close to your body, so that you're not holding the stomach.

, Ensure that she has a quiet, stress-free location away from all disturbances. No matter where she chooses to give birth, wait until the kittens are all born before moving her and them to your preferred kitten-raising location. If you try to move her too early, she may stop labor and this can be life-threatening."

Notice if your cat seems sick or dehydrated.,
Give your cat wet food.,
Take your cat to the vet if it seems sick.",How to Keep Cats from Drinking Out of Glasses4," Your cat may also be drinking out of your glass because it is not getting enough water. Any increase in water consumption by your cat should be some cause for investigation, since it can be the sign of disease.There are a few signs to tell if you cat is dehydrated. Its coat may look rough and the skin on its back may be inelastic. Additionally, whitish gums are a sign of dehydration. Besides drinking a lot of water, your cat may exhibit some behavior common to dehydration. If your cat is particularly lethargic, has a low pulse, but a high heart rate, than it may be dehydrated.

, Cats that eat mostly dry food need more water. Mixing in canned food into its diet will give your cat additional water through its food.Both canned food and dry food benefit your cat. While dry food is good for your cat's teeth, canned gives them important moisture and keeps them better hydrated.
Try mixing both canned and dry food in your cat's diet. If you find it is drinking a lot of water, increasing canned food in its diet may be a good idea.

, If your cat seems particularly tired and dehydrated, it can be a sign of a larger issue. It's a good idea to get your cat checked out, so you can prevent long-term issues from your cat being sick.An increase in water consumption can be a sign of kidney disease, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism. These are costly and life-threatening illnesses, so bring your cat in immediately if they seem ill.

Prepare a habitat.,
Hunt for them in spring.,
Include leaves and stems in your habitat.,
Check your inchworm daily.",How to Take Care of Inchworms1," Purchase a terrarium with a ventilated top from a pet store. Or, make your own habitat with a lidded container made of glass or plastic. Poke several small holes through the lid with a thin nail or similar tool (no thicker than the tip of a pencil) so air gets in, but the worm doesn’t get out. Line the bottom with about an inch of dirt or wood shavings.Inchworms aren’t that strong, so you can use aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or something similar as a lid so poking holes is easier.
Pick a spot for it on a windowsill or near a window so your inchworm gets plenty of sunlight.;
, Be aware that inchworms have pretty short lifespans. Expect them to cocoon and turn into moths toward the end of summer. So, to spend as much time with them as possible, look for them soon after they first hatch from their eggs in spring.Eggs typically hatch when the weather rises to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius).When they first hatch, they’re very, very small, which means they’re harder to find.
They usually take about three months to grow full-sized (about an inch long, or 2.5 cm)., There are thousands of different types of inchworms, and each one eats different foods.So when you find one for your habitat, also trim some of the leaves and pieces of the stem from the tree or plant that you find them on. Add these to the habitat so your inchworm has something to eat.Remember which tree or plant you found them on, or at least what type it is.
This way you can collect more leaves if needed to keep your inchworm fed.

, Check the leaves and stem pieces that you added to make sure it has enough food. Once they look like they’re beginning to rot, clean out the habitat and collect more leaves, stems, and dirt from outside. Spray a mist of water inside every so often so they stay hydrated. Also, keep fresh air circulating in the room by keeping the window open.If it’s too cold or hot outside to keep your window, at least crack it open a few times throughout the day.
Eventually they will cocoon themselves and then turn into moths. Keep their area moist and with sufficient light; they will turn into moths in about a few weeks. When that happens, you need to let the moths go outside. Simply unseal the container in the area that you originally found the inchworm.

"
"
Look for signs of feeding.,
Search in shaded areas.,
Check areas with crowded vegetation.,
Look at night, too.",How to Take Care of Inchworms2," Check leaves of trees and plants for lots of little holes, which show where inchworms have been munching. Also look for leaves that have been stripped totally clean. They’ve probably moved on from that leaf by now, but this shows they’re in the immediate area and will help narrow down your search.Since you’re probably searching during the spring, plants and trees may still be blossoming. If so, you can also check the buds for signs of munching, since inchworms will eat those, too., Lots of animals feed on inchworms, so expect them to hide. Check the underside of leaves to see if any are clinging directly to them.Also check for them in midair, since they spin webs just like spiders, and may be dangling well below leaves and branches.You may also find them on the ground, but this usually happens when they’ve fully matured and are ready to cocoon underground. So if you’re looking for inchworms to keep as pets, these are no good, since they’re ready to change into moths.

, When an inchworm is done feeding on a leaf or plant, it spins a web long enough for it to swing to the next, like a rope.So look where the leaf cover is pretty dense, where they can do this more easily. Also, since each type of inchworm feeds on different types of food, look in areas with lots of the same type of plant or tree.If you’re looking in trees, also check the plants growing around its base. The inchworms may have worked their way down to them., Start searching in the daytime, since it’s easier to spot where they’re feeding in natural daylight. Some inchworms feed during the day, so you may find them right away. If not, this particular type may be nocturnal, so grab a flashlight and double-check after dark."

Identify signs of damage.,
Ask yourself if it’s really a problem.,
Let predators do the work.,
Treat the affected area with pest control.",How to Take Care of Inchworms3," Inchworms are small and may feed at night, so recognize other signs of infestation, since they may stay out of sight. Look for little holes in the leaves of your trees, bushes, and garden plants. The more you see, the more likely it is that you have a large population of inchworms.Inchworms are commonly attracted to elm, fir, hickory, maple, oak, and pine trees.
Since they also eat fruit, they can often be found in berry bushes and fruit trees., Before you go through the trouble of trying to solve it, decide if it’s really worth the effort. Consider where you found evidence of inchworms, and how pervasive it is. For instance:


Individual inchworms don’t eat much, so if you only find sporadic leaves that seem to be eaten, the population is probably small.If the leaves in question are confined to trees, the trees may offer enough food to support the population without widespread damage.Smaller plant life, like garden plants and bushes, are more at risk, since they offer less material for the inchworms to feed on.

, Lots of small animals feed on inchworms, so encourage their presence. Birds are perhaps the easiest (and preferable) to attract, so hang bird houses and feeders around the affected area. In addition to birds, inchworms are also prey to:Lizards
Yellow jackets
Wasps

, Spray the leaves or the worms directly with insecticides, which are an effective means of dealing with inchworms. Or, if you’re worried about toxins, use a non-toxic remedy. Instead of traditional chemical poison, use a natural pathogen, like bacillus thuringiensis, which you can find online or in garden stores.Bacillus thuringiensis only affects insects, making it an ideal solution for gardens, fruit trees, berry bushes, or other crops.
Treat the area again next spring to eliminate any eggs that may have been fertilized during your last infestation. Different types of inchworm reproduce at different times, but all types hatch in spring."

Understand why it is important to determine the underlying condition.,
Recognize signs of bacterial folliculitis.,
Treat demodectic mange.,
Know that telogen defluxion can be caused by stress.,
Treat ringworm as it occurs.,
Recognize and treat Cushing’s disease.",How to Deal with Hair Loss in Cats1," For each of these conditions, the key to dealing with the hair loss is treating the underlying illness. It is unlikely that hair loss will be the only symptom of the condition.


For instance those with skin infections of whatever sort (bacterial folliculitis, demodectic mange, and ringworm) are likely to be itchy, whilst a cat with Cushing's disease will be thirsty.;
, When your cat has this condition, his skin becomes heavily infected with bacteria which grow down the hair shaft into the root, which can cause a good deal of damage. This damaged hair is then accidentally licked away when the cat grooms himself.Treatment may require sedation of the cat so that he can be bathed with a medicinal shampoo in order to decrease the numbers of bacteria on the skin surface. The cat may also be given a course of oral antibiotics for four to six weeks. A broad spectrum antibiotic such as amoxicillin is generally prescribed.

, The demodex mange mite likes to live near your cat’s hair shafts. This mite can cause damage to the hair, which causes it to shed easily. When a cat's hair sheds easily, it can result in bald spots.


Use caution when treating demodectic mange, as some treatments are toxic to cats. Topical treatments like lime sulfur dips and 1% selenium sulphide shampoos can be effective and are safe for cats. Follow the directions listed on the container.

, This condition leads to a symmetrical hair loss that happens all at once. Telogen defluxion is generally triggered by a stressful event, like pregnancy, lactation, severe illness, or surgery. The hair loss tends to happen about a month after the stress.


No treatment is needed for this condition because the skin is not damaged and so the hairs grow back on their own once the stressful event has passed.

, Ringworm is not a worm but a fungal parasite called microsporum canis, which grows down a cat’s hair shaft. The cat’s body will recognize that hair shaft as damaged, and the hair will fall out.


Treatment includes clipping your cat’s hair short to reduce contamination from shed hairs, and an oral medication such a griseofulvin, ketoconazole, or itraconazole.
Griseofulvin acts by stopping fungal cell division.Absorption of the drug is enhanced by fat, and the medication is best given with a knob of butter. A typical dose is 125 mg twice daily for an average-sized cat.

, Hyperadrenocorticism, which is also known as Cushing's disease, is extremely rare in cats. It occurs when a cat’s body produces too much natural cortisol. This makes the cat hungry and thirsty, and physical changes take place such as a potbelly, thin skin, and hair loss.Treatment involves giving a daily capsule containing trilostane which inhibits the glands that produce cortisol.

Feed your earthworms only as much as they can eat.,
Feed worms intended for use as bait more food.,
Avoid feeding your earthworms anything dangerous.",How to Raise Earthworms," Determine your priorities regarding what you hope to achieve by raising worms. While many types of worms can be used for different purposes - such as both composting and fishing bait - choose a specific type based on the main reason you’re raising worms. Furthermore, the climate in which you live is an important factor if you intend to raise worms outdoors.Plan to sustain an environment that is moist and dark. If climate allows, outdoors compost is the easiest and best form of a worm system.
Know that you can also raise worms indoors if you live in a cold climate or do not have space outside.;
, All earthworms eat organic matter and excrete high quality soil, red wigglers are simply the best choice for your home vermicomposting setup. In part, their favorability has to do with compatibility - they prefer temperatures between 55 °F (13 °C) and 77 °F (25 °C), which is the temperature range humans also tend to prefer. In fact, in established vermicomposting beds, they can survive temperatures as low as 40 °F (4 °C) and as high as 100 °F (38 °C). Buy red wigglers online or from a local bait shop, as these worms are different from the nightcrawlers that live in your backyard.Plan to keep red wigglers in proportion to the amount of organic waste you produce. As a benchmark, one pound of red wigglers will eat a half a pound of food waste per day.
Since red wigglers depend on a richer, denser feeding medium - such as organic waste - they will not leave an outdoor compost pile by burrowing into the standard soil below.Red wigglers will grow to 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10.2 cm) inches, and can be used in either indoor or outdoor vermicomposting. They also reproduce very quickly. One worm can produce as many as 99 offspring in 11 weeks.
Red wigglers also make a great food item for chickens, pet turtles, lizards, and aquarium fish., The European nightcrawler is a larger type of earthworm, known predominantly for thick skin, a longer lifespan on your fishing hook, and it’s ability to tolerate salt water. In no uncertain terms, it has been argued to be the best bait worm there is. European nightcrawlers can also tolerate temperatures as low as 40 °F (4 °C), but they do better in bedding temperatures between 68 °F (20 °C) and 80 °F (27 °C).They will grow up to five inches long, and roughly 4x the thickness of a red wiggler.
European nightcrawlers can also be used either indoors or outdoors.

, If you live in a warmer climate, such as the Southern U.S., African nightcrawlers may be ideal. This large tropical earthworm can tolerate higher temperatures, preferring bedding temperature from 70 °F (21 °C) to 90 °F (32 °C). It will not survive drops beneath 45 °F (7 °C) however.The largest of the earthworms mentioned in this article, the African nightcrawler will produce a large amount of waste and breeds rapidly. They can also be used as fishing bait.
African nightcrawlers can be used in indoors or outdoors vermicomposting.

, If you’re looking for a type of worm to add directly to your yard or garden, Alabama jumpers are prized for their ability to survive in many different types of soil. Further, they are especially capable and willing to burrow to ground that is problematic for other earthworm species. They do require, however, the addition of organic matter to the soil if you want their population to expand.Before adding Alabama jumpers to your yard or garden, have leaves, hay, manure, decaying plants, or another type of organic waste tilled into the topsoil.
Moisten the soil with a hose or watering can, and add the worms right before the sun sets, distributing them evenly and covering them lightly with the moistened soil. If organic material is available, their numbers will rapidly increase.

, An earthworm population can actually double in size within 60 to 90 days, since earthworms are hermaphroditic and have quick gestation periods. Accordingly, an established earthworm colony will replenish its own population as long as you don't take too many out. If you wish to remove worms to feed other pets or to improve your luck at the fishing hole, feel free to do so, but only take out the amount you need each time.If you're only taking out a few worms at a time from a healthy colony, you do not need to make any additional effort to maintain the colony's size.
Optimal conditions are required for particularly rapid population growth. Aside from maintaining as close to ideal temperatures within the bedding, you'll likely need to add additional food as the population increases.

, Truth be told, you don’t even need a container or any sort to maintain a vibrant vermicomposting setup. If you have a fully shaded spot in your yard, rake your leaves and grass to this area and add any other organic waste, such as kitchen scraps. Water the pile every other day for a week or two, and add a few hundred red wigglers. Use a pitchfork to turn the pile once a week.An additional benefit of a basic compost pile is the increased likelihood that you’ll attract native earthworms to your compost as well.
Monitor the moisture level of the pile. Make sure it stays moist, but not actually wet, as a pile that is too wet will get too warm for the worms to survive.

, Build a simple wood frame outdoor to maximize the space you have and to keep costs low. Build your bin as wide and as long as you want, and in whatever shape works best. You can use chicken wiring for walls attached to wooden posts, or use boards for walls as well as supports. The important criteria is that the bin is 8 inches (20.3 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm) inches deep, as this is the depth required for the worms to move around and feed., You can use a plastic storage container to build a bin for use in your garage, shed, or even in your home. Essentially, all you need to do is drill 8 to 12 holes that are a ¼ inch in diameter on the bottom and sides of a roughly 18 gallon (68.1 L) gallon plastic storage bin . These holes allow for aeration and excess water drainage. If the bedding consistently stays sopping wet, you can add more holes later.Start with about 3 pounds of red wigglers, and know that they will reproduce until there are about 9 pounds of worms in the bin!
Build a shallow collection tray beneath the bin to collect the natural “tea” that drips from the bin, which makes an especially good fertilizer for your houseplants.
Be sure to keep plastic bins in a relatively cool location, out of direct sunlight. If you live in a hot climate, know that you may not be able to leave a plastic worm bin outdoors year round. Further, keep indoor bins loosely covered to keep light out.
Do not use a clear bin, as the sunlight will stress your worms and keep them burrowing towards the center of the bin., You can also simply purchase a manufactured worm bin system. The Can-O-Worms is an especially reliable and simple container you can buy at home improvement stores or online.Structures such as these - usually simply multi-tiered plastic trays stacked together. These bins benefit from portability and are the easiest way to start raising worms indoors.

, Your worms require a bedding material that will help maintain moisture and aeration within the bin. For indoor bins, the best options include shredded paper, coconut husks, and peat moss. Outdoor bins should use leaves, grass, straw, or hay. You’ll need about a pound of bedding per square foot of bin space. Moisten the bedding before adding, and fluff the bed weekly.Fluff or turn an small bin’s bed by digging to the bottom and bringing the bedding to the surface. Your goal is exposing the contents of the bin to the air, as oxygen facilitates decomposition. Turning the bin also allows your worms to move more easily.

, Newspaper is best, and can easily be shred by hand. Keep strips two to three fingers wide.Moisten newspaper with water from a spray bottle to prevent making the water overly soggy.


Believe it or not, worms can survive on newspaper alone - though they stay very small. However, if you don’t produce many kitchen scraps, newspaper will keep your worms fed.

, While peat and sorghum moss have long been go-to vermicomposting bedding material, they are not produced in environmentally conscious ways and can lead to harmful acidity in your bin. Using leaves and grass from your yard is not only environmentally friendly but an affordable way to provide bedding to outdoor worm bins. You do not need to shred leaves., For outdoor vermicomposting, manure is a potentially cheap option. Manure, in fact, is essentially earthworms’ ideal natural habitat. Particularly if you have access to rabbit manure, use it as bedding to provide lots of beneficial microorganisms and nutrients that will greatly excite your worms.If using cow or horse manure, there are two important factors you need to be aware of. First, you must allow these types of manure to compost separately for two months. Further, you must be certain the animals were not fed de-worming drugs, as their manure will be fatal to your earthworms.

, You want to avoid evenly distributing scraps throughout the vermicomposting setup. Ideally, dig halfway down on one side or in a corner and cover the food scraps - the worms will go to the food over the course of a week. Once the food has mostly been consumed, repeat the process in a different area of the bin.Since worms feed on the surface, you can also place the food on the top of the pile. They will come up to eat it.
To aid your worms, chop up your kitchen scraps. Vegetables and fruits are perfect food scraps. Though raw veggies will take a while to breakdown, boiling them will make the process go even quicker.
Aside from a list of dangerous materials included in a different step in this article, your worms will eat almost anything you do - including coffee grounds, tea bags, eggshells, pasta, and bread.

, The most common mistake in raising earthworms is overfeeding. Further, forget numerical assessments of what they can or can’t handle - use your fist. Seriously, make a fist, and add an amount of food that is equal in size to your fist. After a week, check to see if there is any food left or if it is all gone. If it’s all gone, add more next time around. If there’s a still some left, add a bit less once it’s gone and check back again in a week.Avoid feeding your worms too many kitchen scraps. The breakdown of food items will lead to heat in your bin. If your worms seem to be trying to escape - they probably are. One reason they may be doing this is that the bin is too hot.
You can remove decomposing food to cool a bin down. Further, if the bin begins to stink, this indicates you’re putting more food in than the worms can handle, and that you should remove some food scraps and feed them less the next time around.

, If you’re raising nightcrawlers for use as fishing bait, you’ll want to fatten them up intentionally. Kitchen scraps alone may not be sufficient to do so. Manure bedding is best for literal worm growth, in addition to a grain-based diet.You can even purchase food for worms from a local pet store. Alternatively, rabbit food or chicken laying mash will also fatten up your worms.

, Certain common kitchen scraps should not be included in the materials you feed your earthworms, both for your sake and theirs. For instance, meat products will lead to an offensive odor and will attract undesired pests to your compost. Further, worms cannot process bones. Avoid the following items as well:Junk food. Do not feed your worms fast food or salty snack foods. Salty foods can be soaked overnight and fed to your worms, but dispose of the salty water elsewhere.
Pet excrement. Dog and cat food may be detrimental to your worms health, and may even contain toxins that are dangerous to you as well.
Freshly cut grass. The early stages of decomposition of yard waste will create dangerously high temperatures in your compost. Allow yard waste to decompose elsewhere for a few weeks before adding it to your compost.
Alcohol. Keep all alcohol out of your compost, as it is extremely toxic to earthworms.
Too much citrus. While the occasional orange peel is fine, too much citrus can be toxic to earthworms.
Pressure treated wood. Wood that has been treated with chemicals also poses a danger to your worms - and to you. Keep it out of your compost.

In this case, addressing the underlying issue will help to make your cat more comfortable and your cat may even start grooming himself again. Treatments might include dental attention for a cat with a sore mouth or pain killing medications for the elderly arthritic.If your cat’s fur is severely matted, then seek the help of a professional to remove the matted fur. It is traumatic to the cat to have large matts removed and it is often kindest to sedate the cat so that he is happily oblivious to the procedure.;
, When your cat is not grooming himself as well as he once did, one of the best things you can do is to incorporate regular brushing into your routine. Brushing the cat from head to tail removes loose fur, dirt and other debris and stimulates circulation and sebaceous gland secretions. This helps return shine and luster to the coat and prevents the formation of painful mats, especially in long-haired cats. , Do not brush your cat while he is agitated.Gently pet your cat and talk soothingly to him. He will respond better to you.


If your cat is not used to being groomed then he may resent being brushed. Try to help him understand it is a pleasant experience and keep the first sessions short so that he doesn't lose patience.
Try brushing your cat right before you feed him so that he associates being brushed with a food reward afterwards. This may increase his tolerance levels for being brushed.Keep in mind that brushing can be a bonding experience between owner and pet. But if your pet is agitated or stressed, he may start to associate negative feelings with you instead.

, In some cases you may need to groom your cat right away even if he is unwilling. For example, if you cat has soiled himself, then it might be necessary to groom your cat even if he is agitated. In these cases there are several options to help you calm and control your cat.



Use a towel. If it is essential to groom the cat right away and he is agitated, try wrapping him in a towel with only the dirty area left out. Having his eyes covered can help to calm him down. Plus, having his teeth and claws inside the towel will protect your hands from bites and scratches.

Hold onto your cat’s neck scruff. Some cats will calm down if you hold onto their scruff, which is the skin on the back of a cat’s neck. When a mother picks her kittens up by the scruff it has a calming effect, and this persists in some adults. However, do not pick the cat up by the scruff, merely grasp a handful of skin over his shoulder and hold it firmly while he rests on a flat surface.

Work at a height that is comfortable for you. It might be easier to clean your cat is you put him on a high tabletop or on top of a dryer. This will prevent you from having to bend and strain your back. Help the cat to feel secure by placing a blanket or towel on the table top so that he is less likely to slip and slide around.

, Long-haired cats need to be brushed frequently, preferably on a daily basis.Otherwise, their fur may become matted and dirty. Short-haired cats can be brushed less often, such as a few times per week and as needed.

, Take your time when brushing your cat so that you do not pull the fur or frighten your cat. Be aware that elderly cats with painful joints and arthritis, can become hissy when you go near their joints. It is all too easy to bang a comb or brush against a bony cat's hips, shoulders, elbows, or knees, and cause pain, so work slowly and carefully over these areas.

, Take a few moments as you brush your cat to check his skin for any abnormalities, raw or bare spots, or other problems. If you notice anything abnormal, make sure that you contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.Make sure to check for fleas while combing your cat as well. Part the fur and look for small shiny brown insect about the size of a sesame seed. Check for flea dirt as well. These look like little specks of dirt. If you find something suspicious put the speck on damp cotton wool. If it is flea dirt the moisture will rehydrate the dried blood and you will see an orange halo.
Run your fingers over the cat's body to feel for lumps and bumps. If you find a new lump, or an existing lump is growing or seems to bother your cat when you touch it, take your cat to see a vet as soon as possible.

, A metal comb can be used to remove debris and other matter from your cat’s fur. It can also help to untangle the coat, which is especially useful for longer-haired cats.Start by combing the hair on your cat’s tummy and legs. Then comb the fur on the back, combing it upward and toward her head. Comb out the tail too., If your cat has long hair, take extra care to untangle knots before they become a bigger problem. If you find any knots, gently untangle them. You can use a comb, a mat splitter, or your fingers.No matter what you use, try to hold onto the base of the mat near the skin so that you do not pull on the skin as you work through the mat.

, If you find a mat that you cannot untangle, remove it with clippers rather than scissors to avoid cutting the cat's skin.Cats have very delicate skin underneath their fur. If it gets nicked, your cat might get an infection. In worse cases, your cat may need stitches.


If you do not feel comfortable removing the mat yourself, contact a groomer who is experienced with cats or contact your veterinarian.
If you do not have clippers, use scissors but with care. The safest method is to slide a comb between the skin and the base of the knot. Then cut above the comb on the knot side. The comb shields the skin and makes it less likely you will nick it. If you cannot get a comb under the knot then this is a job for a professional groomer or the vet tech, and do not attempt it yourself.

, After combing the coat, use a rubber or bristle brush to remove loose hair.This will grab the last of the loose hair and it will also feel good to your cat. Even short-haired cats need to be brushed, otherwise the hair that they shed can get stuck in their coat.

If your kitten isn't too dirty, wipe her down with a wet cloth.,
Aim to clean her after every feeding.,
Wet a soft, dry cloth with lukewarm water.,
Start washing the kitten's back.,
Gently wipe your kitten from front to back.,
Pay special attention to the area beneath the tail.,
Keep on wiping your kitten until she is clean.",How to Clean Kittens1," Kittens habitually clean themselves with their tongues, but there are some spots that they have trouble reaching – namely, the head, the back, and the behind. Mother cats usually help kittens clean these spots. Your job, as surrogate mother cat, is to clean your kitten regularly to ensure that she is healthy and hygienic.Wiping with a wet cloth also uses less water than a full bath. This makes it a good way to gradually and safely introduce kittens to water and washing.;
, Many kittens, especially young kittens, are very messy eaters. After the kitten has eaten, massage her entire body with a clean, moist cloth. Pay special attention to the abdomen and genital region – this may encourage her to relieve herself.

, Make sure that the towel is not rough enough to irritate your kitten. If the kitten is particularly dirty, consider dabbing the cloth with a vet-recommended pet shampoo. You can find special kitten shampoos in most pet shops.

, Use a cloth wet with warm water. Always follow the direction of the fur to avoid hurting or irritating your cat. Hold your kitten and talk to her in a soothing voice to make her comfortable. Many kittens are used to being petted on the back, so restrain your cleaning to that area until the kitten is okay with the cloth.If your kitten gets nervous or scared at any time in the cleaning process, stop washing for a moment and hold her close. Continue to talk in the soothing voice. Your kitten may begin to trust you more once she knows that you will respond to her complaints.

, Start from the face and forelegs, move to the back and abdomen, and finish with the hindquarters. Avoid the kitten's eyes, ears, and nose! Unless the kitten's head is extremely dirty, it may be best to avoid the head altogether. Don't worry, however: the kitten will likely clean its head on its own after the bath.

, Kittens have trouble cleaning this area by themselves, and it is where their mother likely helped them the most. This is why cats will often turn around and stick their back ends in your face while you're petting them: it's a sign of trust, like they trusted their mother at a very young age.Consider cleaning your kitten's behind every few days, especially if she does not clean herself. This will help keep your kitten happier and healthier, and it will keep odors away.
If your cat isn't cleaning herself, it can be a sign that she is overweight.

, If there is still more dirt on her coat, you can repeat the process by using another cloth. When your kitten is completely clean, put her in a warm place to cuddle up while she dries out.


Blot the excess water with a dry towel to make sure that your kitten is almost completely dry. If you leave her wet and shivering, she may be at risk of falling ill.

Ensure that whatever container you use has plentiful ventilation for the worms.,
Keep the moisture in.,
If collecting the vermicompost, add drainage holes at the base of the container.,
Keep worm habitats away from sunlight and heat.,
Return the worms to the garden if they're not thriving.",How to Make a Worm Habitat1," Worms need air to breathe just as we do, so the container must ensure this and not be sealed.;
, The worms need good moisture content in the container. This can be ensured by keeping the worm habitat properly covered using a waterproof lid, which will provide a dark environment.

, Also, situate the container on a tray or other flat item that can be easily removed for capturing the vermicompost.


If you're wanting a worm farm, as opposed to a worm habitat, read How to make a backyard a basement worm farm for more details.

, Worms like it dark and cool.

, Don't force a bad container habitat onto worms if they're not thriving in it. It is better to place the worms back in the garden than to cause them to suffer.

Understand why cats may lose their hair because of allergies.,
Monitor your cat’s hair loss.,
Put your cat on a trial hypoallergenic diet.",How to Deal with Hair Loss in Cats2," Cats can develop allergies to irritants in the environment around them, as well as to different foods. These allergies manifest themselves as itchy skin and occasionally diarrhea or vomiting. This itchiness can result in the cat licking herself too much, which damages the hair shafts; this in turn can make it look like she is losing patches of her hair.

, You may get a clue that your cat has an allergy to a certain pollen or grass if his itchiness or baldness is seasonal. For example, your cat may only lose fur in the spring or summer when a certain pollen is in the air.


If you see that your cat does appear to have seasonal allergies, talk to your vet about trial steroids. Some veterinarians will give cats some allergy-fighting steroids that may help to reduce the itch and allows the cat’s coat to return to normal.

, Unfortunately, food allergies cannot be controlled by steroids, and the cat will continue to react poorly unless the allergen is eliminated from his diet. Put your cat on a commercial, prescription diet (like Hills ZD or Purina HA). Do not feed your cat anything else.


It may take up to eight weeks to flush your cat’s system of the allergen.
If a food allergy was the problem, then after eight weeks on a hypoallergenic diet the cat should be more comfortable and should have stopped over grooming, which should result in the regrowth of the bald patches.

Understand that arthritis can lead to hair loss.,
Consider giving your cat meloxicam.,
Do not give your cat meloxicam if he is dehydrated.",How to Deal with Hair Loss in Cats3," A cat who is suffering from arthritis may lick the joint that is causing him pain. This arthritic pain can be controlled by giving your cat pain killers, which should reduce his desire to lick the affected area. Talk to your vet if you think your cat is suffering from arthritic pain.

, Meloxicam (Metacam) belongs to a family of drugs called NSAIDs (Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs). Meloxicam works by inhibiting an enzyme, COX-2, which triggers prostaglandin release, which in turn limits the inflammation that leads to fever and pain. This medication may help reduce your cat’s arthritic pain.


Talk to your veterinarian before giving your cat this medication.

, Meloxicam should only be given to well hydrated animals. Dehydrated animals may have impaired renal function and the additional decrease in blood supply to the kidney caused by the medication may tip the animal into renal failure.


Likewise, meloxicam must be given with or after food.
Do not give your cat meloxicam if he is taking other NSAIDs or steroids of any kind.

Remove crust from around your cat’s eyes.,
Clean the facial folds.,
Examine and clean the ears.,
Examine your cat’s face for health problems.",How to Clean Your Cat When He Can't Do It Himself2," If your cat has crust in the corners of the eyes or has an eye problem that is causing tearing or other discharge, you will need to clean around the eyes. This will keep the cat comfortable and prevent further irritation. You should also take your cat to the vet to have the discharge looked at. Sometimes cats get colds and other viruses that require some medication to clear them up.


Blot tears with a cotton ball or soft cloth.
Use a moistened piece of cotton to remove crusted debris or other dried or thick material around the cat's eyes.
Make sure to use a separate cloth or cotton ball for each eye to help prevent the spread of infections between the eyes. Avoid using eye washes or drops in the eyes themselves unless directed to do so by a veterinarian., Facial folds are prominent in flat-faced breeds like the Persian and Himalayan. These should be cleaned, especially for cats with chronic eye discharge. Tears and other discharge can build up in these folds and predispose the cat to skin disease.To clean facial folds, use a piece of moistened cotton or a moist soft cloth to gently remove tears and other debris in the area.Make sure to get the skin between the folds as well as the skin on either side.
Chronic moisture is a concern here, so make sure to use a damp rather than wet cloth.
Gently pat the cleansed area dry after wiping.

, Take a look at your cat’s ears. They should be pale pink in color, and there shouldn’t be any debris, wax build-up, or odor. If you are in doubt as to whether there is a problem or not, compare one ear with the opposite side - they should both look the same. If one side looks different to the other, then you will know there is an issue. To clean the ears:Ask your vet to recommend a liquid ear cleaner, which is generally available at a pet supply store.
Use a small amount of cleaner on a cotton ball.
Fold the cat’s ear back and use the cotton ball to wipe away dirt.
Do not clean the ear canal, as this can cause trauma and/or infection.
Do not put cotton tips down into the ear canal, because if the cat moves suddenly you could damage the ear or cause pain. Never put water down into the ear as this softens the skin and makes ear infections more likely.

, While you’re cleaning your cat, this is a good time to examine him for any problems. For example, if your cat has eye discharge, redness of the eyes, is blinking his eyes a lot, has watery eyes, a vet visit is in order.


See your vet if the skin in your cat’s facial folds is red, darkened, seems irritated or the cat is losing hair.
Your cat’s ears may be irritated if he is scratching them a lot. You might also find evidence of ear mites. Talk with your vet if you have concerns about your cat’s ears.

Remove fecal matter from your cat’s fur as soon as you notice it.,
Wear gloves.,
Clean the hind end with a wet paper towel.,
Dry your cat with a towel.,
Consider getting your cat’s behind clipped.,
Keep the litter box clean.,
Call the vet if you suspect problems.",How to Clean Your Cat When He Can't Do It Himself3," When you have a cat that cannot or will not groom himself, you should be concerned about feces getting stuck in the fur under the tail. This is especially true in long-haired cats and pets with diarrhea. If stuck fecal matter is not promptly removed, it can mat in the fur and eventually cause skin problems and prevent the cat from defecating normally., Slip on a pair of latex or rubber gloves while cleaning feces from your cat’s fur. Cat feces can contain toxoplasmosis, a parasitic condition that is especially dangerous for pregnant women. If you’re pregnant, have your partner clean the cat (and the litter box)., If the fecal nuggets are dry, try pulling them out of the fur. If this fails then use a dampened paper towel to wipe feces from the cat’s hind end. There are also kitty wipes, which are generally available at pet supply stores. You can use baby wipes, but make sure they are not scented at all.Your cat will lick his fur after you clean him, and if there is any residue from the baby wipes, he will ingest that.


Clean the area once a day or as needed.

, Once you have removed the feces, it’s important to dry the area. Leaving your cat wet can lead to further matting of the fur and skin irritation.

, If you cannot remove the matted feces easily, consider having the hair around the anus clipped to prevent feces from being trapped in the fur. Cat groomers commonly perform this procedure and refer to it as a hygiene clip or sani-clip. , If your cat’s litter box isn’t clean, he may try to defecate in the corner of the box, getting more feces on his fur. Or, he might try to go elsewhere, which can also increase the chance of getting feces on his fur. Scoop out the litter box every day. Replace the litter every one to three weeks., If your cat has open sores in the area or is having problems defecating due to matted fur, take the cat to the veterinarian rather than the groomer. Your cat may need treatment for the sores and any other issues he is dealing with.

If your cat gets into something sticky, rolls around in dirt, has a particularly nasty episode of diarrhea or does something else to foul large areas of his coat, however, you will need to bathe him.


If you don’t want to bathe your cat yourself, you can take him to a professional groomer.

, Your cat won’t get as stressed in the tub if you choose a time when he is calm and mellow. Try playing with your cat for a while to tire him out and then start the bath. If your cat seems agitated, wait until he calms down before trying to bathe him.

, Before you get your cat into the tub, you may want to trim his claws. If your cat protests during the bath, you won’t get scratched as much.Make sure that you do not trim them down too far, just trim the ends so that they are not so pointy. If you trim too far down, you may strike the quick, which will be very painful for your cat and may bleed as well.


If you are nervous about trimming your cat's nails, you can take your cat to a groomer or to your veterinarian to have them trimmed.

, Running a brush over your cat will help remove loose hair and debris. It’s important to remove mats as well, since shampoo could get lodged in a mat., Have a helper on hand to restrain the cat or hand you necessary items. Bathing a cat alone is very challenging, so don’t try to do it on your own unless you have no other option.

, Before involving the cat in the process, gather necessary supplies so you are prepared once you get your cat in the tub. These include:


Cat shampoo: Don’t use dog shampoo.
A plastic cup or pitcher
Towels
Washcloth
Rubber mat

, You can either bathe your cat in the tub or a sink if your sink is big enough. Place the rubber mat in the sink or tub. This mat will prevent the cat from slipping. Fill the tub with three to four inches of lukewarm water., Place the cat in the tub, and have your friend hold onto the scruff of your cat's neck. Then, use the cup or pitcher to thoroughly wet your cat's fur. Only wet your cat from the neck down and try your best to avoid getting water in your cat's eyes, nose, and ears.


Speak soothingly to your cat as you do this to help keep him calm. Reassure him and be gentle.

, Use a solution of one part cat shampoo and five parts water to wash your cat. Have your friend continue to cold your cat's neck scruff while you mix the solution. Pour the solution over your cat, avoiding the eyes, ears, and nose. Then, use your fingertips to gently massage the shampoo into your cat's fur.


If you need to clean around your cat's behind, wear a pair of latex or vinyl gloves.

, Using the pitcher or cup, gently pour warm water over your cat's fur. Again, avoid the eyes, ears, and nose. Make sure that you’ve thoroughly rinsed all of the shampoo residue off of your cat's fur. You may need to use several cupfuls or pitcherfuls to get all of the soap out of your cat's fur.

, When you are finished, have your friend gently lift your cat out of the tub and place him onto a towel. Then, wrap another towel around your cat to help him dry off and get warm. Take your cat to a warm room where he can dry off.

Fill a shallow basin or sink with warm water.,
Gently set your kitten into the washbasin.,
Lather your kitten with cat shampoo.,
Completely rinse your kitten.,
Use as little water as possible.,
Wrap the kitten in a dry, clean towel when you're done.",How to Clean Kittens2," Again, cats naturally lick themselves clean, so your kitten only needs a full bath if she is especially dirty – or if she has fleas. To clean a heavily soiled kitten, you'll need to her a bath rather than just a simple wipe-down. Bathe your kitten immediately after she gets soiled; if you wait too long, she may be uncomfortable and she may develop a rash. Prepare the supplies before you bathe your kitten:


A clean flannel and towel(s)
Cat shampoo; avoid human soaps, and harsh chemicals or cleaners
A basin, sink, or any watertight tub. Avoid washing your kitten outdoors — if it tries to escape the bath, you will have much more trouble tracking it down outside.

, Do not use human shampoo, human soap, or dish soap to wash your kitten! Your kitten's fur and skin are very sensitive, and human soaps will dry out its skin.

, Once you have chosen a bathing location, you should also prepare a warm and welcoming space for the kitten to wind down after its bath. Choose a room in the house that you can close off with a door, a curtain, or a pet gate.


Prepare a warm, cozy spot beneath a desk lamp (or other light source). Plug in a pet-specific heating pad, if you have one. Your kitten will be cold and wet after its bath, so it will want to find a warm location to clean itself.Have a treat (or dinner) ready so you can give it to your kitten after its bath. A yummy treat will be a nice reward for your kitten.

, Use lukewarm water – neither too hot nor too cold. The water should feel comfortable on the skin of your wrist. It is very important to use temperate water. Kitten skin is sensitive: hot water can burn your kitty, while cold water can reduce its body temperature to a dangerous level. Make sure that the water is not deep enough to completely submerge your kitten.

, Fill the basin before you introduce your kitten to the water. Many cats aren't actually afraid of water itself, but of the loud noise of running water. Once they are startled by running water, they learn to fear it. Gently stroke your kitten to make her feel safe and calm. Talk to her in a soothing voice throughout the cleaning process.


Introduce her to water slowly at first. Set her down in the water and let her stand in it for a few seconds. Then, pull her out and dry her feet. Give her a treat to reward her good behavior.
If your cat is very resistant to bathing, ease her into it over the course of two weeks. Towards the end of the second week, you should be able to wash her without a struggle, even under the tap., Make sure that your kitten is completely wet before you start to lather. Squeeze a small amount of shampoo onto a cloth or your hand, and rub it into her coat. Gently lather the shampoo over the kitten's whole body, from her head down to her tail. Use a wet finger to remove any urine or feces that have dried onto the fur.


Avoid washing kittens with soap unless you are treating for fleas. If this is the case, consult with your veterinarian to find a soap that is safe for your kitten.
Keep everything—water, soap, etc.—out of her eyes and off her face. This might irritate her eyes and cause her to panic. If she panics, she'll develop negative associations with bathing.

, Fill a cup of water and pour it slowly over her body. Pour slowly and carefully, and try to be efficient. Wash away all of the lathered shampoo. Use a damp flannel or washcloth to wipe soap from your kitten's face. Speak to her in a calming voice if she's resisting or seems afraid.


If your kitten is getting feisty at this point, have someone else hold the kitten down while you pour the water over its body.
If your sink is outfitted with a detachable spray nozzle, feel free to use this. Make sure that it isn't on a powerful setting, or you might hurt your kitten.
Do not run tap water directly onto a young kitten's head. If you do, water might get into her eyes and startle her., Do not submerge your kitten in water deeper that it can comfortably stand in. Your cat may not be strong enough to pull itself out. Instead, use your hand to wet the kitten's hindquarters and lower belly.

, Bathe your kitten as quickly as possible, then dry her fur with a clean towel. Swaddle the kitten with another soft, dry towel, and put her in a warm place until dry. Stay with her, if possible, and cuddle her to help her calm down.


Hasten the drying process by rubbing the soft towel in the direction that your kitten's hair grows. This will get her warmer faster if she seems cold.

Brush your kitten's coat if she isn't terribly dirty.,
Choose the right brush for your kitten.,
Brush your kitten from head to tail, in the direction of her fur.,
Try using two brushes in case your kitten resists the first brush.",How to Clean Kittens3," It may not be appropriate to brush kittens if they are too heavily soiled – wash first, then brush. However, if your kitten isn't very dirty and the fur doesn't seem contaminated, you can easily clean her by brushing.


Brushing is very helpful to remove any fleas from wild rescued kittens. It also helps to stimulate subcutaneous blood circulation, and it may actually improve the condition of your cat's skin.
Brushing is especially important for long-haired cats. With long fur, it's much easier to get things stuck, smeared, and generally dirty.

, The brush or comb will differ from kitten to kitten based on the length and pattern of her coat. Check your kitten for fleas: if she is flea-ridden, you will need a special thin-toothed comb to remove the pests from the skin.You can purchase specially designed metal combs from most pet shops. Consult with your local vet if you are confused about which brush to select.

, Brushing in the wrong direction can irritate your kitten and cause her to lose hair. Brush her whole body thoroughly, focusing on the abdomen, back, and hindquarters.


Some kittens may resist brushing. Be gentle, and do not force. Use a calm, soothing voice when you're grooming your kitten, and try to make her feel comfortable.
Clean your brush periodically during the process. Dirt and hair may clump on the bristles, making the tool less effective.

, Cats naturally groom themselves, and your kitten may take offense when you try to help her. She also may just be curious. If she begins biting at the brush, simply lay it in front of her so she can smell it, then use the second brush to keep brushing. This gives the kitten a chance to see the brush while she is being groomed. Eventually, she may learn to love brushing, and she may allow you to groom her freely


Repeat as needed. Keep switching out the brushes. Whenever she grabs the brush you are using, just pick up the other one and continue to brush.

Understand that fleas can be a common cause of hair loss.,
Treat your cat regularly for fleas.,
Treat all of the animals in your house.",How to Deal with Hair Loss in Cats4," Biting parasites like fleas can be a common source of irritation that can lead to hair loss. However, these pests can be difficult to spot. Instead, look for flea dirt, which is the dried blood left behind when a flea bites your cat’s skin.


Brush your cat’s hair in the opposite direction and look for brown flakes or specks.
Wet a paper towel and put some of these flecks on the towel. When the flea dirt comes into contact with the moisture, it should become red or orange again as the blood is reconstituted.

, Flea medication generally acts by inhibiting nerve transmission in fleas, which causes them to become paralyzed and die. Common flea medications contain fipronil or selamectin.


The recommended dose of flea medication is generally 6 mg/kg that is applied to the skin on the back of the cat's neck.

, If you have more than one pet in your house, it is important that you treat all of them for fleas, so long as they have fur. If you only treat one animal, it is very likely that they pick up fleas again from the other animal in your house.


You should also consider using an insecticide (or ‘flea bomb’) in your house to remove fleas from your furniture and carpets.

Consider psychological issues if all other causes of hair loss have been ruled out.,
Be aware that cats can become addicted to licking their fur.,
Reduce your cat’s stress to help him break the habit.,
Consider using a synthetic pheromone.",How to Deal with Hair Loss in Cats5," Psychogenic behavior is sometimes called obsessive-compulsive behavior and is a reaction to stress. In order to reach a conclusion that the cause of the over-grooming is psychological, all other possible causes of hair loss need to be tested for and ruled out.

, The act of licking causes the release of endorphins (natural occurring morphine-like substances) into the cat's bloodstream. This gives the cat a natural ""high"" to which they can become addicted.The trigger to the original episode of licking is usually a stressful event such as a stray cat moving into a new home. The cat resorts to licking to calm himself, and becomes hooked on the habit.

, To do this, try to show your cat that he has no competition for resources such as food, water, or sleeping spots. Provide plenty of toys to keep your cat occupied.


You should also give your cat plenty of places to hide if he is feeling stressed.

, Synthetic pheromones, such as Feliway, are chemical messengers that you can pump into the air to make your cat feel calm. The scent the synthetic pheromone produces is a scent that reassures the cat because his body interprets it as a feeling of safety.These synthetic pheromones come in spray bottles, which you can use to spray on the cat’s bedding, or as room diffusers, which help to make your whole house smell safe to your cat.

Try professional grooming if you can’t keep up with your cat’s grooming.,
Find a groomer that specializes in cats.,
Consider your cat’s stress.,
Ask your vet about clipping your cat.",How to Clean Your Cat When He Can't Do It Himself5," If you aren’t home a lot or you’re too busy to regularly groom your cat, you might consider taking your kitty to a professional grooming service. Among the services offered by a groomer are: brushing the fur, shaving difficult mats, clipping nails, cleaning ears, and bathing.

, Look online or ask for a referral from your veterinarian. Check to see if the groomer is part of the National Cat Groomers Institute of America. This association institutes and maintains standards for cat grooming.

, You need to balance how much your cat might get stressed out if you take him to a groomer. Consider how well your cat does in the car riding to the groomer. The experience of grooming can be difficult for a cat. But if your cat’s fur is in really bad shape, it might be worth the stress to get him cleaned up., If daily brushing and occasional spot cleaning are not sufficient to keep your cat clean, speak to your veterinarian about whether or not clipping your cat’s fur is advisable. Clipping is often not necessary for cats with normal grooming habits or for those that can be easily groomed by their owners. But long-haired cats tend to mat easily. They often object to daily brushing and do not adequately groom themselves. These types of cats may do better if most of their fur is clipped.Depending on the cat's temperament, this procedure may require sedation by a veterinarian.

Get a referral from your vet.,
Speak to other cat owners for a recommendation.,
Find a groomer through your local pet store.",How to Find a Professional Cat Groomer1," One of the most efficient ways to find a good cat groomer is to ask your vet for a recommendation. Your vet likely knows your cat well and is aware of its temperament as well as its grooming needs. They may be able to recommend a groomer that will be a good fit for your cat.For example, you may ask your vet, “You know my cat well. Can you refer me to a good groomer for my cat?” or “Do you know of a reputable cat groomer in the area?”;
, You can also approach friends and family who own cats and use a groomer for a recommendation. If you notice a friend’s cat is looking well groomed and clean, ask them where they got their cat groomed. If you know a family member often gets their cat groomed on a regular basis, ask them for more information on their groomer.For example, you may say to a friend, “Your cat looks great and so well groomed. Where do you get them groomed? Can you recommend a good groomer?”

, Another option is to see if representatives at your local pet store can recommend a good cat groomer in the area. Usually good cat groomers will have a reputation and are known in the community. Sometimes pet stores are actually located close in the same building or right next door from a pet groomer.For example, you may ask a representative at the pet store, “I’m looking for a good cat groomer in the area, do you have any recommendations?”

One way you can confirm the groomer’s credentials is to call them and ask them about their level of experience with grooming cats. Find out if they have many clients who are regulars and discuss their grooming techniques so you have a sense of what your cat is in for. Ask if they have a license to practice cat grooming.You should also ask the groomer about their staff and determine their credentials. You want to be sure that the groomer has staff who will treat your cat gently and carefully as they are being groomed.
For example, you may ask the cat groomer, “How long have you been grooming cats?” “Do you have a lot of regular clients that you groom on a regular basis?” “What kinds of grooming techniques do you use on cats?” “Is your staff knowledgeable and responsible when grooming the cats?”

, You should also find out some information about the grooming facility. You can do this over the phone with the groomer by asking questions or by visiting the facility in person to check it out. The groomer may also have images of the grooming facility on their website.If possible, try to arrange a tour of the grooming facility before you bring your cat in to be groomed.

Search for signs of fleas.,
Look for ticks.,
Check under the tail.",How to Brush a Cat1," This is a precautionary measure if you find signs of irritation on your cat's skin. You'll be less likely to pass germs into any open wounds. If you find ticks, you'll be able to remove them before they can do further harm to your cat.;
, Make sure the fur is glossy and smooth. After your stroke it, it should spring back into place.Make sure the skin is soft and free of blemishes.


Call your vet if you find dandruff, bumps, bald spots, or wounds. Although these symptoms might signal conditions that can be treated with simple lifestyle changes, they might signal something more serious like mange or a hormonal imbalance., Do this especially if you notice your cat scratching more than usual. Use a flea comb for this step.Look for flea droppings. They're small, dark objects that look like grains of sand. You should also look and feel for flea eggs. Because they're white, they can blend in with your cat's skin. Like flea dirt, they feel like grains of sand. Other symptoms include bald spots, skin irritation, and pale lips/gums.If you find one or more fleas, your cat probably has many more. Call your vet as soon as possible to work out a treatment plan.

, This usually isn't a problem for indoor cats, but it's a good idea to check no matter where your cat spends their time. Ticks are very small when they're not gorged with blood. They're brown with teardrop-shaped bodies. When they're full of blood, they look like large gray cysts hanging out of the animal's skin.


If you find a tick unattached to your cat's skin, grab it as quickly as possible with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to pinch your cat's skin. Kill the tick by drowning it in a small container of rubbing alcohol.
If the tick has its head in your cat's skin, smother the area with petroleum jelly first. This will cut off the tick's source of air and cause it to back its head out. When it does back out, grab it with the tweezers and drown it in the rubbing alcohol. Disinfect the area before proceeding with grooming., Look for any fecal matter that might have gotten matted in with your cat's hair. This is often a problem in older cats and cats with long hair. You should also check for small tan objects that look like grains of rice. This could indicate tapeworm, which requires immediate veterinary attention.If you do find fecal matter in your cat's fur, try removing it with a fine-toothed comb.

Pet your cat as you normally would. This will help to relax them and give their coat a glossy shine. It will also pick up any loose hairs that the comb or brush missed., Depending on how thick your cat's undercoat is, you might have to do this several times per brushing session. Quickly pull the fur out of the brush. Place the fur ball(s) to the side until you're completely finished.

, Make a note of how much shedding you see at different times of the year. Depending on the climate, your cat might need an extra brushing session on certain weeks. Stick to a regular schedule so that your cat can get used to the routine. This will also lessen the risk of hairballs."

Start combing at your cat's head and gradually move toward their tail., Continue to move with the grain of the fur. Look and feel for tangled balls of fur called mats, which are very common in these areas. Be very gentle as you brush and search. Many cats feel threatened when touched in these areas. It might take them several brushing sessions to get used to being combed there., Try using your fingers first. Gently work out each mat in downward strokes. Start at the bottom of the matted hair and gradually work your way up as it detangles. If this doesn't work, use a mat-splitter, working in the same manner as your did with your fingers.You can buy a mat-splitter in any pet supply store.


If you encounter one or more stubborn mats, don't try to cut or shave them off yourself. You might unknowingly cut your cat's skin. Call your vet or groomer for a professional detangling as soon as possible.Breeds like the Norwegian forest cat require extra care due to the long tufts of fur that grow from the pads of their feet.If you're lucky enough to have a cooperative kitty, comb any mats or kitty litter out of these tufts with a finer-toothed comb. If they put up a fuss, contact your vet.

, After you put the mitten on, pet your cat in a normal fashion. This will pick up any dead hair from the undercoat or topcoat. It will also help to relax your cat, especially if you had to de-mat their hair.Rubber mittens are available in most pet supply stores.

This will help create a more seamless and less traumatizing experience for your cat.


One large and soft towel for the initial wipe/wash down.
Two or three soft wash clothes for extra dirty areas on your cat.
One large and soft towel for drying.
Shampoo, if you choose to use it.
Use an extra towel if you plan to use shampoo.;
, You need to find the perfect location to wash your kitty. It should be relatively warm, small, and safe. Your cat should also feel comfortable there. Consider:


You should have access to a sink.
The area should be neither too hot nor cold. Preferably between 72 and 76 degrees.
The area should be relatively small and enclosed so that your cat can’t escape. Bathrooms and laundry rooms are often ideal locations., Gather everything you'll need before hand, and do everything you can before you bring your cat into the room. Things like running a sink, and going in and out of a bathroom while your cat is detained will just cause undue anxiety for the detainee. You don’t want to spook your cat or cause anxiety for no reason. Consider the following:


Make sure not to have running water on when your cat comes to you.
Pre-fill a sink with water.
Pre-dampen a towel.
Have treats or toys on hand to help relax your pet.

, When detailing your cat for the bath, do everything you can to make it a calm experience. If you can, call your cat into the room in which you’ll be washing him or her, rather than bringing her in by force. Consider the following:


Avoid chasing after your cat to bathe her.
Don't pick a busy time of the day, like when everyone is coming home from school or work, to wash the cat.
Use treats and positive reinforcement to lure your cat into the washing room.

, Before you begin the process of wetting poor kitty, make sure to properly comb her in order to remove any loose hair or dirt from her coat. This is one of the first important steps in the bathing process, and will save you time and help produce a cleaner kitty., Even the most docile, sweet kitty can do serious damage when she is anxious and trying to get away from you. Trimming kitty's claws can reduce the blood-letting of not only her human, but of herself whenever her claw gets caught in something. Take this opportunity to reduce the damages done to furniture. It is extremely important that you are careful during this step ; as there are Blood Vessels running through the middle of each kitty's claw called the Quick . Cutting this part of the claw can cause excessive bleeding . (NB: Declawing is amputating the front part of a cat's toes and is highly-discouraged). Trimming kitty's claws will spare you from walking away from this bath with dozens of cuts.

, It's likely that after you catch your pet, she'll be pretty nervous, anxious, and might just fight for her life to escape your clutches. You need to do everything you can to calm and sooth your cat. This will save you from cuts and scratches, and make future baths easier affairs.


Pet and rub your cat.
Give your cat a treat.
Use verbal positive reinforcement, tell her that she is a ""good kitty.""

, Cats are good self-cleaners. If your cat violently opposes her bath, and is relatively clean, you might want to reconsider. It could turn out to be a costly bath for you in terms of cuts, and a traumatic experience for your cat. Consider:


The length of your cat's coat.
Environment -- is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?
Self-grooming behavior. Does your cat already take care of grooming adequately., The towel should be wet, but not dripping, and the water should be warm, but not hot. You don’t want to wipe down your cat with a cold, wet towel. Make sure to do this in a slow and calm manner, as to not scare your cat., Move from her neck to her tail with your warm damp towel and slowly dab and wet your cat. Wash her head last, and with extra care. Make sure to go slowly and to not spook your cat.


Make sure to re-wet the towel when appropriate.
Start with a small wash rag for the rear area.
Use another towel when you're done with the rear area, as to not spread fecal matter.
Pay special attention to the rear area, especially on kittens. This area is often cleaned by a mother cat, and if she’s not around, you’ll have to give your kitten extra care.
Make sure you clean your kitty’s belly, although they won’t be happy with this.
Make sure to clean her armpits and in between her toes.
As you approach your cat’s head and face, move slowly and don’t be rough., This is up to you. Often times, shampooing cats is not necessary. You should also avoid using shampoo with kittens, unless they have fleas or the vet recommends it. If you do use shampoo, do so after you’ve already rubbed your cat down with the damp towel and wet her already.


Fill a sink with water and put a little bit of shampoo in the water. Make sure that you don’t have many suds.
Mix the water.
Dip a fresh towel in the sink and dampen it with the shampoo water.
Rub down your cat with the shampoo, beginning at her neck and moving toward her tail.
Pay special attention to in between toes, under the belly and armpits, and her rear.
Use a clean wash rag for extra dirty areas.
Avoid contact with your cat’s eyes., Rub your cat down with a towel dampened only with water again. This is important because you don't want your kitty walking around with shampoo still in her coat. You need to be diligent in this process, as prolonged exposure to shampoo could cause irritation. Consider the following:


Use a towel dampened with lukewarm water to rub your cat down and remove the shampoo and suds from your cat.
Repeat this step until you are confident all of the shampoo has been removed.
If you see any suds, you need to continue rinsing.

, Don’t surround your cat with a towel at first – this might prove traumatic. Simply begin dabbing your cat dry, starting at her tail and moving toward her head. Remember, you want this to be the least traumatic of a experience possible. Work toward the goal of getting your cat used to and comfortable with her bath!

, If your cat is comfortable with this, you can try a more direct approach by surrounding her with a towel and rubbing her dry. Make sure to do so gently, and if your cat responds negatively by being covered by the towel or being rubbed with it, back off and go back to dabbing her.


Wipe gently.
Wipe slowly.
Wipe in the direction of her fur, the way she would lick herself. By following the grain of her fur you will make her feel more comfortable., Make sure your house is ready for your cat to be released. Make sure no exterior doors are open. Make sure your home is a neither hot nor cold. You don’t want to release your cat into a house that is very hot or very cold. Check your thermostat before releasing your cat.

, Before you release your cat, make sure to love on your cat and give her a treat. It is important that you give her a treat in the room she’s been bathed in, as she hopefully will see this as a positive experience. The more positive you are during and after the bath, the less traumatic it will be next time.

, After you release your cat, monitor her for a couple hours afterwards. Do this especially if it is cold outside or the temperature fluctuates in your home. You don’t want your cat becoming ill or coming down with a cold. In addition, tell her she's a ""good kitty"" as she's walking (hopefully not running) away from you.

Follow vet advice on medication.,
Change the bandages.,
Check the surgery site daily for swelling and drainage and signs of infection.",How to Care for Cat After Claw Removal," Your cat may exhibit odd behavior for the next 10 to 24 hours due to the anesthesia given during the operation.

Try to keep small children and other pets away from your cat at this point because the cat may be unpredictable due to the medication and pain from surgery.;
, Make sure that your cat is comfortable and in a quiet room in the house. Even better if it is his/her favorite room of the house. You can place the cat in a small box, or carrier with a blanket or towels for padding. Or, use a nice comfy cat bed. Your cat needs his/her rest in order to heal, so try to keep other pets and children away from him/her.

, Try to do so later in the evening because the cat will most likely still be nauseous. It may take up to 24 hours for the cat to get his/her appetite back. But don't worry, as he/she will get there.

, Regular cat litter can get into the wounds and cause infection.

, Only give the cat medication you specifically got from the vet, in dosages advised by the vet. Other medications can be toxic to the cat.

, The bandages must be taken off the day after surgery. Give one dose of the pain medication provided by your vet about 20 minutes prior to taking off the bandages. This way it will be less painful and less stressful for your cat.


To remove the bandages, loosen the tape at the top of the bandage and all the way around. Then gently pull the entire bandage down as if you were trying to take off a sock. The entire bandage should slide right off.
If you are having trouble getting the bandage off, your vet can do this for you free of charge.

, Keep your cat's paws dry. You may notice blue or green on the toes near the surgery site, this is just the glue used by the vet after surgery to keep the wounds closed. Most cats are healed in 2 to 6 weeks but if your cat is still limping after 5 to 6 days, take him/her to be checked by your vet because this can indicate infection. Also, if your cat is older or bigger, they may take longer to heal as well.

Some breeders recommend Johnson’s No More Tears Baby Shampoo. , Double check that the water is warm but not hot.


If you can’t use a sink, a large bowl will do. The bathtub will also work, but it might be difficult for you to lean over and wash your cat, and you will use much more water than is really necessary.

, Turn off any loud radios or televisions that might startle your cat while they bathe. Remind the other members of your household that it’s bathtime so that they don’t shout, slam doors, or run in and out of the room where you are bathing your cat.


It’s important that you not startle your cat while bathing her, because she might scratch you in her alarmed state. She might also completely escape your grasp if she is very scared. , This will prevent your cat from slipping and sliding, which can be frightening and cause your cat to panic and either claw at you or try to flee., Let her feet touch the water slowly, first the back feet, and then the front. Then lower her rear end into the water, followed by the front of her body. Your cat may start to struggle at this point if she is not used to bathing. It’s okay. This is normal. It may feel distressing to you, but proceed. Bathing your sphynx is important enough that you should fight through the feelings of guilt that may arise when he seems unhappy about the bath.

, Don’t force her downward by pushing in her back. Put your hand around her body to remind her that you’re there and keep her comfortable while ensuring that she remains in the water. If your cat struggles, wait a few minutes before you wash her. Make it clear to your cat that she is not getting out of the water. , You can also use a cup to pour water gently all over her body. Avoid the head. Just wet your cat’s back from the neck down. (The rest of her body - the lower half- should be submerged already.), You can use an exfoliating glove or a small sponge. Use short, firm strokes. Emulate a mother cat cleaning her kitten. Be sure to wash in between any wrinkles and folds on her body by stretching them flat. Don’t forget her tail.

, Hold one paw in your hand very gently. Put a little pressure on the toe pads. This will make the claws extend slightly. Clean the dirt from the pads and around the base of the claw with soapy water on the sponge. This will help prevent infections that can happen if dirt builds up in around the sensitive skin near the claw. , Sphynx cats do not have eyelashes, so dirt can more easily get into their eyes. Ask your vet if they recommend a particular product for cleaning your cat’s eyes. Particularly if their eyes are very sensitive, you may need to use the product more often than you bathe your cat (every day or every other day). You may want to use a cotton ball for this stage, or you can keep using the sponge that you’ve been using to clean the rest of your cat’s body.

, If the water gets too cool, you can drain a little and then add a bit more warm water from the tap. The running water may startle your cat, so either run the water very gently, or take her out while you add water. , Especially if you are instituting a new bathing regimen, this behavior is perfectly normal. Use a low, calm voice. Praise your cat when she does well, and speak gently to her if she struggles or yowls. , You can use a bit of running water or gently pour clean water over her with a cup. Be sure that the water is still nice and warm at this stage. You don’t want to startle her by freezing her. Be sure all of the soap is gone.

, If you have a towel warmer, it’s a good idea to use it for your cat’s towel, but check to make sure it’s not too hot when you pull the towel out. Be sure that your cat is completely dry before letting it go. Never share a towel with your cat without washing it in between uses. You could pick up bacteria and transfer it to yourself.
It’s okay to dry vigorously. By this time, your cat will probably be sick of you and ready to leave, so dry quickly. , Use a cloth to wipe around the inside of the ear. If your vet has recommended that you use ear drops, this is a good time to put them in. Drop them into the base of the ear. Then use a Q-tip to remove the dirt from the surface of the ear. Don’t go too far in, or you could damage your cat’s hearing. It’s also okay to wash your cat’s ears while she is still in the bath, but since that just prolongs the experience, there’s no reason you can’t do this part once your cat is out of the water.

, Especially if your cat isn’t a fan of bathtime, you will want to reward her a little after bathtime. Give her some extra petting and affection or offer her a treat if you want.

Allow for a break period after each treatment cycle.,
Do not use for younger or pregnant cats.",How to Control Feline Heat Cycles with Megestrol Acetate1," Call the vet and explain that you would like to discuss possible options for discussing your cat’s heat cycles. MA requires a prescription, so you will need to meet with vet before moving forward with care. Be prepared to talk about your cat’s medical history as well as their current health situation., Before you give your cat a medication, your vet will likely want you to consider other avenues of care, including spaying surgery. Or, they might suggest a less invasive procedures, such as an ovariectomy, which is the surgical removal of just the ovaries. A birth control shot could be another approach., As with any medication, there are potential side effects and risks associated with your cat taking MA. Some cats experience vomiting or even an increased risk of diabetes. Talk with your vet about all of these possibilities before starting the course of treatment.Make sure that you carefully read any documentation that comes with the medication itself, as potential health risks may be listed in this literature as well.

, MA is a very strong medication with potentially severe side effects. As such, talk with your vet about starting your cat off on the smallest possible dosage and increasing it, if needed, over time. A lower level dosage is usually 0.625 mg/kg a week. The dosage may also depend on your cat’s weight, age, and health condition., Because of the health risks, MA should only be considered a temporary solution to any heat-cycle concerns regarding your cat. Extending the medication beyond just a few weeks use can tax your cat’s system and lead to uterine infections and other issues. Talk with your vet about using MA in conjunction with other treatments.

For example, some pet owners combine an MA prescription with a policy of keeping their cat confined during heat periods.If you get an indication that MA is having an negative effect on your cat’s health, get ahold of your vet and discuss the possibility of halting treatment immediately.

, A treatment might involve one week on the medication and one week off. Most cat owners end up keeping their pets on MA through January up until mid-summer. This will provide general contraceptive coverage while protecting your cat’s health.Work with your vet to estimate the intensity and duration of your cat’s heat cycles. Many cats have irregular cycles unless they are mated.

, If you suspect that your cat is pregnant at any point during MA treatment, call your vet immediately. They will likely advise that you cease giving your cat their medication until a test can be performed. It is also a good idea to delay using MA if your cat hasn’t had her first heat cycle."

Monitor your cat’s future reproductive health.",How to Control Feline Heat Cycles with Megestrol Acetate2," At the time of your initial appointment, go ahead and make a series of future ones. These additional meetings will be opportunities for your vet to check your cat’s physical condition and to discuss any behavioral changes with you. If your cat’s weight changes, the dosage may need to be adjusted, too.The careful monitoring that MA requires means that it is not a good treatment option for feral colonies or other free-ranging cats.

, Keep a close eye on your cat’s eating, drinking, and litterbox habits. Make sure that they are continuing to groom themselves. Some of the possible long-term side effects from MA include pyometra (a uterine infection), mammary cancer, and diabetes. Short-term side effects include weight loss, lethargy, and vomiting.Be aware that some of these side effects can occur immediately after you cat begins treatment.

, Make note if your cat begins to exhibit any destructive or problematic behaviors. The combination of stress and MA can make some cats start urine marking or furniture scratching. Other cats exhibit overt aggressiveness by biting or scratching., When you talk with your vet, make sure to disclose any and all medications or supplements that your cat is currently taking. If your vet is concerned about a possible drug interaction, then they may request that you monitor your cat even more closely or more frequently. MA does have some known interactions with drugs such as rifampin., When you’ve finished giving your cat MA, continue to take your cat in for yearly appointments. Also, watch for any warning signs of possible uterine infections, such as loss of appetite. It is important to catch these issues early on, so that proactive treatment can take place."

MA usually comes in tablet form in a variety of dosages. Make sure to give your cat the entire run of the medicine or it could cause additional side effects.It can be easier if you give the medication at the same time every day. If you skip a dose, do not double up the next one., Check with your cat's vet or a pharmacist before proceeding with this step. Then, get out two spoons. Place the pill in one and place the other on top, applying pressure until the pill is reduced into a fine powder. Carefully handle the spoons until you know where you want to put the pill powder. Try to use the medication as soon as possible after crushing.Another option is to use a pill cutter, often sold at pharmacies, to break it down into smaller pieces.
It is also a good idea to read the MA’s medication label to make sure that it is okay to crush or cut the pill before moving forward., Place your cat’s normal food portion in their bowl and mix the pill dust or pieces into it. Or, get some soft cat treats and place pill pieces into the center of each one. Watch your cat eat in order to make sure that they get most of the medication.To trick your cat into eating, try giving them a first treat without any medicine and then following this with the mixed ones.

, If your cat is docile enough, gently grab their jaws and open them. Hold them in this position while you drop the pill toward the back of their throat. Push their jaw closed and watch to make sure they’ve swallowed it successfully.Only try this method if you think that you can do so without hurting or scaring your cat.

, It may be tempting to delay giving your cat their medication, but stick closely to the dosage schedule agreed upon with your vet. Talk with your vet about what to do if your cat decides to eat only part of the pill."

Use the correct type of container for collecting the sample.,
Label the container.,
Collect a sample from the litter tray.,
Store the sample correctly.,
Deliver the sample to the vet.,
Understand that you may need to provide a pooled sample.,
Figure out how to collect a fecal sample in a multi-cat household.,
Collect a sample from a cat who doesn't use a litter tray.",How to Collect Fecal Samples from a Cat," Your veterinarian may supply you with a special fecal specimen pot. These plastic containers are usually color coded with a blue lid and come with a collecting scoop attached to the underside of the lid.


Where possible use these containers. Not only are they leak-proof and smell-proof but they are specially designed for the job. This makes it is easier for the lab technician to retrieve the sample from the pot for analysis.
Theoretically you could use a glass jar with a tight fitting lid, but this presents the lab technician with a problem when it comes to scooping the sample out, so where possible be considerate to their needs and use the special pot.;
, Before you start collecting the sample, clearly label the container with the cat's name, your surname, and the date.

, The easiest way to collect a fecal sample is to harvest it from the litter tray. It is fine to use cat litter as normal.


Wearing disposable plastic gloves, use the scoop from inside the fecal pot to break off a small nugget of feces and drop it in the container (a half inch square is plenty).
If the cat has diarrhea then scoop up a teaspoon's worth into the pot.

, The vet will usually require you to collect multiple sample over a number of days. This means that you will need to store the samples you collected earlier.


Be mindful of hygiene. Never store feces in the same room where food is stored, prepared, or eaten.
Place the fecal pot inside another container such as a clean ice-cream tub with a lid, or a heavy duty plastic bag.
Keep this in a cool dry place such as a garage or outside cupboard. Do not allow the sample to freeze or expose it to high temperatures.

, Fecal samples are more robust than urine samples. Whereas the latter need to be taken to the clinic as soon as possible after collection, there is no great urgency with fecal samples.


Although it's preferable to take the sample on the same day, if you happen to collect the last sample on a Sunday, don't worry, dropping it off on a Monday is just fine.

, Sometimes the veterinarian requests a ""pooled"" fecal sample. This refers to putting 3 fecal specimens in the same pot, collected over 3 days.


A pooled sample is more likely to give a reliable result. Some pathogens are only excreted intermittently and are not present each time the cat has a bowel movement.
It is therefore possible to get a false negative result from a single sample, if the sample happened to be on a day when the pathogen wasn't shed.

, Simply collecting a sample from the litter tray is easy if you own one cat, but if you have a multi-cat household things can get more complicated. However, there are a couple of things you can try to ensure that you collect the sample from the right cat.


Keep the cat in a separate room. To ensure you collect feces from the correct cat, keep that cat isolated in another room and provide a litter tray.
If the patient has a problem, such as diarrhea, but the other cats' feces are normal, it is fine to keep arrangements as normal, but only sample the diarrhea.
If you can't separate the cats and the feces all appear normal then feed the other cats sweetcorn for 2 – 3 days prior to sampling, and continue until you have the required samples. Sweetcorn passes out undigested, so you can easily avoid collecting feces containing sweetcorn.

, This is a tricky one, however, most cats will use a tray if given no other option. Try keeping the cat confined to one room, with food, water, and a litter tray. Eventually, rather than soil his living space most cats opt to use the tray.


An alternative would be to watch the cat and see where he deposits feces outside. Many cats mark their territory by ""middening"" or passing feces to act as a scent marker for other cats. Places to look are the boundaries of your property and garden.
Cats usually have a regular toileting area so once you have found the feces; watch to check it is your cat that is toileting there.

For a very dirty kitten, give her a bath.,
Run the tap water to adjust the temperature of the water.,
Shallowly fill a basin or sink with warm water.,
Use shampoo by squeezing a small amount on a cloth and rubbing it into her coat.,
Rinse her off completely.,
Use as little water as possible.,
Finish quickly and wrap her when you're done.",How to Clean an Orphaned Kitten1," Clean the kitten straightaway if it is soiled. Leaving a kitten in a soiled condition for too long will be uncomfortable for her and can lead to a rash in much the same way as a baby left in a dirty or wet nappy for too long will end up developing nappy rash. Cleaning a heavily soiled kitten will mean giving her a bath rather than just a simple wipe down with a flannel. Prepare the supplies before you begin bathing the kitten so that the kitten is not alone at any time. Here's what you'll need:


A clean flannel and towel(s)
Mild hand soap (no harsh chemicals or cleaners)
A basin or sink;
, The water temperature should not too hot or too cold. It should be comfortable on the skin of your wrist. The best method is to touch the water with your hand, place it on your wrist, and feel the degree of temperature on your own.


It is very important to maintain a reasonable temperature of the water as the kitten’s skin is sensitive much like a human baby. Water that is too hot can burn the skin easily while cold water can reduce the body temperature at a threatening level.

, Cats aren't really afraid of the water, but the noise running water makes! Once startled, they learn to fear it. To avoid this, fill the basin before your kitten gets introduced to the water.


Do this for another day or two and then set her down in the water and let her stand in it for a few seconds. Then pull her out and dry her feet always followed by the treat. Towards the end of the second week, you should be able to completely wash her, even under running tap water.
When kittens are startled, they will fear whatever startled them for a long time. For example, a kitten may not be afraid of the water, but if the sound of running water startled the kitten, it will associate being scared with water. Talk to your kitten constantly throughout the cleaning process to help her stay calm and feel safe.

, Using the cloth, gently rub it over the kitten's whole body, not forgetting to clean her face, abdomen, legs, and back. Start shampooing her head and move on down to her tail. Try to remove the feces or urine excreta from the fur by using your finger.


Soap or shampoo is not necessary at this age unless you are treating for fleas. If this is the case, consult with your veterinarian to find a soap that is safe for your kitten.
Keep everything – water, soap, etc. – out of her eyes and off her face. This will cause panic and could irritate her eyes and, most importantly, will scare her for good.

, After properly spreading the shampoo on your kitten’s body, rinse her thoroughly by using a cup of water and pouring it slowly over her. As you're doing this, speak to her in a calming voice if she's resisting or seems afraid during bath time.


It is not recommended to pour direct tap water on a young kitten's head to avoid the risk of water getting into her eyes and startling her. When it comes to her face, use a flannel wet with clean water to get rid of soap.

, You should not submerge your orphaned kitten in too much water because it may be too weak and young to withstand it should anything go wrong. It is better to use your hand to wet the kitten's hind quarters and lower belly first.


Too much water may also frighten the kitten. When you're washing or rinsing her, always try to use as little water as possible.

, Be sure to complete the above procedure as quickly as possible and dry the body of your kitten with a dry towel. Then wrap (like a human baby) the kitten with another soft and dry towel and put her in a warm place until dry.


You can rub the soft towel on the direction of kitten’s hair to hasten the drying process. This will get her warmer faster if she seems cold.

"
"
If your kitten isn't too dirty, spot-clean her.,
Choose a soft and dry cloth and wet it with lukewarm water.,
Gently wipe your kitten in a downward motion.,
Keep on wiping your kitten until she is clean.,
Aim to clean her after every feeding.",How to Clean an Orphaned Kitten2," Kittens only require full baths if they are especially dirty or have fleas. For normal kittens, spot-cleaning works well and is plenty for a hygienic regimen. Daily cleaning of their behinds will help keep your kitten happier, healthier and keep odors away.


Sometimes it is difficult to arrange a bath for an orphan kitten or the kitten may not be dirty enough to necessitate a complete bath. In these cases, just using wet cloths is very helpful. It also involves less water, thus less risk of getting cold and causing hypothermic complications for your orphaned kitty.

, Make sure that the towel is not so rough that it irritates your kitten. Then wet the towel in lukewarm water. You can use shampoo on the cloth to clean the kitten if you'd like.


Special kitten shampoos are available in most pet shops, but water is usually enough unless the kitten is particularly dirty. If you're unsure which shampoo to select, consult your vet.

, It is better to start from the fore legs and face and move to the back, abdomen, and finish with the hindquarter.


You should take special care during the cleaning of hindquarter as kittens are unable to clean this area by themselves. It also is the area that gets dirtiest.

, You can repeat the process by using another cloth if there is still more dirt on her coat. After a complete cleaning of your kitten, put her in a warm place to facilitate thorough drying.


Make sure to blot the excess water with a dry towel to prevent pneumonia and the common cold. She should be mostly dry when you're finished.

, Many kittens, especially young kittens, are very messy eaters. After the kitten has eaten, massage her entire body, paying particular attention to the abdomen and genital region, with a clean, moist cloth to encourage her to pass a bowel movement or urinate.


If this works, then cleaning will only be minimal. However, not all kittens eliminate waste straight after a feeding. Keep checking up on the kitten at regular intervals.

"

If your kitten doesn't need a thorough washing, consider just brushing her coat.,
Select the right brush for your kitten.,
To make the grooming brush/process easier, give your kitten a brush to distract her with.,
Brush your kitten in the direction of her hair from head to tail.",How to Clean an Orphaned Kitten3," Another commonly practiced method for cleaning a rescued kitten is using a comb or brush. Sometimes this method is inappropriate for rescued kittens as they are too dirty and soiled. However, if your kitten isn't very dirty and there doesn't seem to be any contamination to the fur, you can easily clean her by brushing.


Brushing is very helpful to remove fleas (if there are any) in wild rescued kittens. It also helps to stimulate subcutaneous blood circulation and may improve the condition of her skin.

, Take a careful look at the skin and fur of your orphaned kitten to detect the presence of fleas before selecting the right brush for your kitten. The brush or comb usually differs from kitten to kitten based on the length and pattern of her coat.


You can purchase specially designed metal combs from most pet shops. Please consult with your local vet if you are confused about which brush to select for your kitten.

, Cats naturally groom themselves and can take offense when you try to help them. They may also not know what's going on and become especially curious. When you brush her and she begins biting at the brush, simply place one in front of her so she can smell it and use the second brush to keep brushing. This gives the kitten a chance to see the brush while continually being groomed. She will eventually learn that brushing feels good and allow you to groom her freely


Whenever she grabs the brush you are using, just pick up the other one and continue brushing.

, Reverse direction of brushing can cause unnecessary irritation and hair loss for your kitten. You can brush her whole body thoroughly including the abdomen, back and hind quarters.


Some kittens may show resistance during brushing. Be gentle and use a calm, soothing voice when you're grooming her to calm her.
Make sure to clean your brush periodically during the process as dirt and hair may clump on it and make it less effective.

Check for the label hypoallergenic.,
Examine the ingredient list.,
Be selective when choosing flea products.,
Consult your vet.",How to Choose Hypoallergenic Feline Grooming Products1," If a product contains this label, then you can have reasonable confidence that this product is hypoallergenic. However, be aware that the label “hypoallergenic” is not regulated by the FDA in the U.S. Therefore, any company can define hypoallergenic for itself, which means that these products may still contain ingredients that your cat is allergic to., Because hypoallergenic products may still contain irritating or harmful ingredients, you should examine the ingredient lists of all products before purchasing them. In general, avoid products that contain artificial dyes, fragrances, mineral oils, parabens, petrochemicals, and sodium laurel sulphate.Avoid products that contain essential oils, as cats are often sensitive to them.
Many “natural” products may still contain harmful chemicals, so be sure to check these products’ ingredient lists as well.

, Many flea and tick products contain harmful chemicals for cats. Avoid flea products that contain pyrethrins/pyrethroids, organophosphate pesticides (OPs), and carbamates. Instead, choose flea products that contain safer chemicals like pyriproxyfen and s-methoprene. Oral flea medications may be a better option.Avoid products that contain permethrin, pyrethrin, or other pyrethroids. If a chemical on the ingredients list ends in “-thrin” that is a sign that the product contains pyrethroids. These are common in flea shampoos, dips, and spot-on products labeled for dogs. Some cat products contain pyrethroids in low concentrations. Cats are sensitive to these compounds, which can cause tremors, seizures, and even death.
Avoid products that contain OPs like tetrachlorvinphos.
Avoid products that contain carbamates like carbaryl and propoxur.
Your veterinarian will have the best idea about what flea and tick products work well in your area, and will be able to recommend a product that is less likely to cause a reaction in your cat.

, If you are unsure about a product, you can always double-check with your veterinarian. Your veterinarian can recommend hypoallergenic products that cater specifically to your cat’s allergies. Additionally, your veterinarian can recommend grooming products that are safe and non-toxic."
"
Use a shampoo.,
Pick a spray.,
Try wipes.",How to Choose Hypoallergenic Feline Grooming Products2," Cat shampoos can come in liquid or solid form (bar shampoos). Only bathe your cat if it is excessively dirty, for example covered in mud, or if it has something sticky or smelly stuck in its fur. Baths are also only recommended if your cat is calm enough to tolerate them., Waterless sprays (and foams) are great alternatives to the traditional shampoo. These cleaning products are great for cats that detest water. Simply spray your cat’s coat with the product and let it do the cleaning.Because sprays are being left on the coat, be sure that they are hypoallergenic before using them on your allergy-prone cat.

, Wipes are a great, no-fuss way to clean your cat as well. You can purchase safe, hypoallergenic wipes online or from your local pet store. Earthbath, GNC, and Whisker City sell hypoallergenic cat wipes."

Pick clean high surface for the brushing.,
Pet your cat to calm it down.,
Give your cat a treat.,
Work the metal comb through your cat’s coat from head to tail.,
Run the bristle brush in the direction of your cat’s head.,
Use the rubber pad to remove dead hair.,
Look for any bumps, wounds, or tangles on your cat.,
Check for fleas and ticks with the flea comb.,
Finish the brushing with praise and a treat.,
Brush your short haired cat at least three times a week.,
Get your cat used to brushing when at a young age.,
Have the same brushing routine every week for your cat.",How to Brush a Short‐Haired Cat," Start by choosing a spot in your home that is clean and easy for you to move around. A high table or counter that is wide enough for your cat is a good option. Spread all the brushing tools for your cat on the surface so they are easy to access.If your cat is more comfortable standing or sitting on the ground, you may brush it on the ground on a clean, hard surface, like hard wood.;
, Most cats will need to be in a calm and relaxed state to be brushed. Prepare your cat for the brushing session by giving it some attention and love. Pet its head and body, especially in spots that it likes. Place your cat on the high surface with the brushing tools on hand and pet it a few times to calm it down. Massage its head and start to brush its coat with your fingers to relax your cat.You may also say calming words as you pet your cat. For example, you may say, “Who’s a good kitty?” or “Are we ready to be brushed?” Continue to do this until your cat appears relaxed and at ease. This will make the brushing session much more enjoyable for you both.

, If your cat starts to get upset or annoyed when you prepare it for brushing, give your cat its favorite treat to snack on while you brush it. This could be catnip or other treats that it likes.


You can also have cat treats on hand so you can give them to your cat if it starts to get annoyed or move around too much while you brush it.

, Brush your cat with the metal comb in the direction your cat’s coat grows. Move from its head to its tail in long, sweeping motions. Make sure you brush its entire body, including its chest and abdomen. Focus on brushing one section of its body at a time.Brushing your cat in the opposite direction of its coat can cause the hair to lift up and make your cat feel uncomfortable. Stick to brushing with its coat, in the same direction, not against the growth of its coat.

, Use the bristle brush to sweep any dead hair or skin that appears off your cat’s coat. Run the brush towards your cat’s head to do this. Then, smooth its hair down again with your fingers or by running the brush away from your cat’s head. Do this anywhere you see dead skin or dead hair on your cat’s coat.Keep in mind some cats may not like the sensation of being brushed in the opposite direction of its natural hair growth. It may take your cat some time to get used to this part of the brushing process.
If your cat does not like to be brushed with the bristle brush or appears uncomfortable, you can skip this step.

, The rubber pad will be helpful for removing dead hair and stimulating blood circulation. Run the rubber pad from head to tail, making sure you remove any dead hair or flakes of skin. Do this all over your cat’s body, from head to tail, to ensure you remove as much dead hair and skin as possible on the surface of your cat’s coat.If you notice any dead hair or skin sitting on the surface of your cat’s coat after you are done using the rubber pad, you can remove them with a damp cloth or a rubber glove. Simply rub your cat’s coat lightly with the cloth or rubber glove to remove any remaining hair or skin.

, As you brush your cat, make sure you check for any bumps or wounds on your cat’s coat. If you notice any bumps or wounds, examine them carefully and consider bringing your cat to the vet for a check up. Sometimes bumps or wounds on your cat’s coat can be a sign of a skin condition or a medical issue.If you notice any tangles or mats on your cat’s coat, do not try to remove them on your own. Often, pulling on big tangles or mats can make them worse and be painful for your cat. Instead, bring your cat to a professional groomer to have them clipped off.
You can also bring your cat to the vet to get mats or tangles removed, though this will likely cost you more than going to a professional groomer to get this done.

, During your cat’s brushing, make sure you also check for fleas and ticks. Use the flea comb to gently part your cat’s coat to check for any black specks of dried blood left behind by fleas. Look for any dead ticks in your cat’s coat, which will be very small and black.You can also check your cat’s anus for any tan, rice-sized objects as these may indicate the presence of a tapeworm.

, You should only brush your cat for as long as your cat tolerates it. If you notice any signs of stress in your cat, like growling, hissing, shaking of the head or swishing of the tail, stop the brushing session. Give your cat verbal praise, like “good kitty” or “great job,” and give it a treat. This will end the brushing on a positive note for your cat, making it easier for you to brush your cat in the future.Keep in mind the more often you brush your cat, the more comfortable it will become with the process. Over time, your cat should become less stressed or agitated when being brushed.

, Short haired cats do not need to be brushed every day. Try to brush your short haired cat three times a week on a regular basis so its coat is maintained and healthy. You may plan to brush your cat the same time and place three times a week so it gets used to the routine.Sticking to a regular brushing schedule for your cat will help you stay on top of any injuries as well as any fleas or ticks on your cat’s coat. Cats who are brushed regularly also tend to swallow less hair, which means you will not have to deal with hairballs.

, Try to get your cat used to a brushing routine at a young age, starting when it is a kitten. This way, your cat will grow accustomed to be being brushed and be less stressed or agitated when you brush it.Starting early will also allow you to bond and connect to your cat, as brushing and grooming it can help you maintain a close relationship with your cat.

, Follow the same procedures and steps every time you brush your cat. This way, your cat gets used to the routine and knows what to expect. Try extending your cat’s brushing sessions to be longer and longer as time goes on, as your cat may feel more relaxed and comfortable with the brushing routine.


If you notice your cat does not like certain elements of the brushing routine, such as being brushed against the natural growth of its coat, change it up so you are brushing with the natural growth of its coat instead. This will ensure your cat is comfortable and enjoys the brushing sessions.

Choose a plan that protects against common health issues.,
Make sure cancer is a covered illness.,
Find options that cover long-term health problems.,
Inquire about dental care.",How to Choose the Right Cat Insurance1," A major difference between available insurance plans is which medical problems are covered. In order to make a plan worth the cost, you'll want to make sure it includes certain protections.This can include accident coverage, illnesses, and even dental care. Knowing your options and the needs of you and your cat will help you make the best choice., Cancer is a common and very expensive disease to treat. While most plans do cover cancer treatment, be aware of payment caps that limit the insurer's liability. Calculate a ""worst-case scenario"" cost by asking your vet what cancer treatments usually run. Do not choose a plan that leaves you on the hook for a substantial amount of the worst-case scenario's cost., Your cat may deal with a long-term disease or health issue that can't be simply cured with a treatment. This can require daily medications, visits to specialists, and other expensive maintenance to keep them healthy. Chronic diseases like kidney failure or diabetes are common examples of ailments that require on-going treatment. Since these can be very expensive, finding an insurance plan that helps financially help with treatments can be a very important component of a policy.Hereditary and congenital diseases often fall under this category. Depending on the particular breed of cat, some hereditary diseases may be more common than others. Purebred cats are more likely to face hereditary diseases than cross-breeds. Some insurance companies will define congenital diseases, which are present at birth, differently than hereditary diseases,which can appear later in life. Knowing these details of a policy can dictate how much an insurance policy is willing to pay.

, Teeth problems that require a pulling or cleaning of teeth can quickly add up costs. You may want to make sure that your plan has a policy that covers preventive care, like teeth cleaning, but also that will help costly oral procedures.


Separate dental plans may be available to supplement a traditional health insurance.

"
"
Choose a plan that fits your living circumstances.,
Choose coverage for medical conditions common to your cat's breed or age.,
Decide what type of treatment you'll most commonly use.",How to Choose the Right Cat Insurance2," Sometimes an insurance company may only cover certain geographical regions, help cover basic costs like check-ups, or only catastrophes. If you are someone who travels a lot with your cat, you'll want a policy with a larger coverage area. Also, you'll need to evaluate your financial situation to know what instances you'd need help most.


Accident only policies. These plans generally cost less, but only cover accidents the pet may incur that require vet treatment. These typically have a certain time period you'll have to make your claim within and a fixed amount for specific types of accidents. Make sure you get a plan that is worth the cost and will offer help for common accidents (e.g. a broken bone, being hit by a vehicle).Plans that help with routine care. These types are usually add-ons to comprehensive policies. These plans will pay toward your annual visit, vaccinations, microchipping and, other routine health tests. Typically it is not worth it to buy one of these as stand alone policy as you will pay more in a yearly premium than the cost of routine care. But if you are already buying a plan for your cat for other issues, this could be an add-on to help with routine costs on top of other treatments., Some cat breeds can commonly have problems, such as kidney disease in Persian cats. You will want to make sure those common diseases are covered in your plan. Also, older cats are more likely to have health problems needing care.


In terms of age, there are usually restrictions. Kittens under a certain age cannot usually by insured for the first time and similarly older cats will usually need a pre-existing policy from when they were younger. Don't wait until you have an elderly cat with deteriorating health problems to look for a policy.

, Most people choose the traditional vet route, but natural health care is becoming increasingly popular with cat owners. There are insurance plans that will cover holistic treatments to combat life-long or hereditary diseases whereas others will only cover traditional healthcare through a vet's office. If you intend on using only holistic and natural options, make sure you choose an insurance provider that can help."
"
Decide on a plan that meets your financial needs.,
Compare payout details.,
Ask about waiting periods.,
Look beyond the premium price.,
Always shop around for insurance before you make a choice.,
Look at major insurance companies.",How to Choose the Right Cat Insurance3," Buying insurance for your cat will always involve a calculation of risk versus reward. If you have a healthy cat who seems to have good genetics, the odds your cat has a long-term health ailment is less likely. If you have an older cat, you may want to be preventive and proactive knowing potential problems looming.


This can also depend on your financial situation. If you will have no problem coming up with quick funds for an emergency, you may have no issue going without. However, if a monthly premium is doable for you, but not the large sums of money necessary for an emergency, hedging your bets may be a worthwhile risk.

, Most vets require you to pay a bill up front. Your insurance provider may have a waiting period before they release funds. Make sure you are either able to front the costs or have an arrangement with your vet. If this is a problem, choose an insurance with a very short payout period.

, Sometimes there is a period between when the insurance coverage actually starts and when you are expected to first begin paying your premium. These can be different for injuries, illness, and diseases. If you are buying it for a cat who is recently diagnosed with a disease, make sure you know how long you will have to wait until you get help with vet bills, or whether they exclude pre-existing illnesses.Just like any health insurance, there may be restrictions on pre-existing illnesses. Make sure you are aware of this so you are not expecting help with something the insurance company does not cover.

, You may think you should look for the best deal and lowest monthly premium. However, a lower premium may also mean that they are excluding key services, have high deductibles, or low payout caps that reduce the effectiveness of the policy.Make sure to know the deductible, co-pays, and caps very clearly because this will define how much the insurance company will help you when those vet bills begin to appear., You can easily get quotes online but reading the details of each policy carefully is important. The premium you can expect to pay will vary on a number of factors including your location, cat's health, age, and what you want covered. However, typically with most plans you can expect to pay between $30-50 USD a month.Talk to your vet. They may have certain recommendations based on their experiences.
Look out for extra fees. Some insurance companies will charge you a one-time fee up front, or extra money per month if you elect to pay your premium monthly, rather than annually. Make sure you take these into account as you shop around for the best price.

, The four largest that specialize in pet insurance include Hartville Group, Veterinary Pet Insurance, Pethealth, and Petproject. This does not mean they will be the best, but you should look first at reputable insurance companies to get a common baseline for comparison sake.Sometimes your house or auto insurance company may be able to include a pet policy in your current monthly plan. Bundling plans together can usually help you save money.

Block off any dangerous hiding spots or spots that you can’t easily access.
Keep children and other pets away from the cat. Your cat needs to rest and recover, and this is harder to do if it’s constantly interrupted or bothered by others.;
, Make sure your cat has a comfortable place to sleep. If your cat doesn’t have a regular bed, try lining a box with a soft pillow or blanket.


If you can, put your cat's bed in an area with tile or wood floors. Cats enjoy cooling off their abdomens by stretching out on cool, solid floors, and this may help soothe the surgical site.If possible try to keep the bed low, and prevent them from having to jump a whole lot.

, Cats who have had anesthesia are usually sensitive to light. Dim the lights in your cat’s resting area, or turn them off.If this isn’t an option, provide something like a domed bed that offers some escape from the light.

, In order to heal after surgery, cats should not jump, climb stairs, or exert themselves to reach necessities.Don’t use regular cat litter for at least a week following surgery. It can get into the surgical incisions and cause an infection, especially in male cats. Use shredded paper or newspaper, “Yesterday’s News” litter (made with shredded paper), or uncooked long-grain rice in the litter box instead., Do not allow your cat outdoors for at least two weeks after surgery. This will help the surgical site stay clean, dry, and free of infection., Looking at your cat’s incision can help you get an idea of what it looks like and will help you monitor its progress. If possible, ask your veterinarian to show you the incision before you take your cat home.You may want to take a photograph of the site on the first day for a reference point.


Female cats and male cats with undescended testicles will have incisions on their bellies. Most male cats will have two small incisions on the scrotum area (under the tail).

, Your veterinarian may provide this collar, or you can purchase one at your local pet store. This type of collar extends up past your cat’s face so that it can’t bother the incision area.These collars may also be called “protective” collars, “E-collars,” or “cone” collars.
Your cat may or may not need this depending on the behavior. Try going with/without it but make sure to watch your cat. If they start to excessively dig at the wound put it on.

, You can offer your cat a little bit of water in a shallow dish (or an ice cube) as soon as you get home from the vet.Your vet will probably give you feeding instructions, and you should follow those. If you did not receive instructions, consider the following:


If your cat seems alert and responsive, you can offer your cat about a quarter of its normal portion of food about 2-4 hours after you get home from surgery.Don’t force the cat to eat or drink, though.
If your cat is able to eat, give it another small meal in 3-6 hours. Repeat this until the cat has eaten a full portion of food, and then resume the cat’s normal feeding schedule.If your cat is younger than 16 weeks old, feed your cat a small meal (about half the normal amount) as soon as you get it home and settled after surgery.If your kitten will not eat after returning home, you can try putting a small amount of maple or corn syrup on a cotton ball or q-tip and rubbing it on your cat’s gums.Don’t give your cat any “special” foods, treats, or junk food after surgery. Your cat’s stomach may feel upset, so keep your cat’s diet as regular as possible.Don’t give your cat milk; cats can’t digest it.

, Don’t try to pet or play with your cat immediately after surgery. While this may feel reassuring to you, it may just keep your cat from feeling safe and rested.

, You can easily tear your cat’s surgical incision if you lift or move your cat too much. For male cats, avoid putting pressure on the scrotum (under the tail). For female cats (and male cats that had surgery for undescended testicles), avoid putting pressure on the abdomen.


If you have to lift your cat, try this approach: Cup your cat’s hind end with one hand and use the other hand to support your cat’s chest just under the front legs. Lift the cat’s body gently., For the next week after surgery, make sure your cat doesn’t jump around, play, or move too much. This can irritate or cause infection at the surgical site.Remove cat trees, perches, and other furniture that your cat may enjoy jumping on.
Keep your cat in a small room, such as the laundry room or bathroom, or in a kennel or crate when you are not able to supervise it.
Consider carrying your cat up and down any stairs. The cat is unlikely to harm the incision or operation site by going up and downstairs, but this is a sensible precaution.
Understand that cats who are in distress -- such as those who’ve just had surgery -- may try to escape. Be very vigilant in supervising your cat, especially for the first 24-48 hours after surgery.

, Don’t bathe your cat for 10-14 days after surgery. This can cause irritation or infection at the surgical site.If necessary, clean around the surgical incision with a slightly damp cloth (no soap), but don’t get the actual incision area wet. Do not scrub the surgical area., Your vet may send you home with prescription medications for your cat. If so, make sure to give this medication as directed, even if you don’t observe that your cat is in pain. Cats are very good at hiding pain and may be suffering even if they don’t show it. Never give your cat any medication that has not been specifically prescribed by its veterinarian.Human medication, and even medications meant for other animals such as dogs, can kill cats! Do not give your cat any medicines, even over-the-counter medicines, that your vet has not verified as being appropriate for your cat. Even medications such as Tylenol can be fatal to cats.Don’t apply any products to the surgical site, including antibiotics or disinfecting creams, unless your veterinarian has approved them for your cat., If your cat vomits after eating the night you bring it home from surgery, remove the food. Try feeding a small amount of food again the next morning. If your cat vomits again, or if it has diarrhea, call your vet., For 7-10 days after surgery, check your cat’s incision site every morning and night. Compare its appearance to the incision site on the first day after surgery to judge how your cat is healing. Call your veterinarian if you observe any of the following:Redness. The incision may initially be pink or light red around the edges. This redness should fade with time. If it intensifies or the incision appears dark red at any time, this could be a sign of a developing infection.

Bruising. Some slight bruising that goes from red to purple as it heals is normal. If the bruising spreads, gets, worse or is severe, or if new bruising occurs, however, you should seek follow-up care right away.

Swelling. Some swelling around the incision site is a normal part of healing, but if the swelling persists or worsens, you should call your veterinarian.

Discharge. You may see a very small amount of light red discharge around the incision when you bring your cat home. This can be normal, but if the discharge persists for more than a day, the amount of discharge increases, the discharge is bloody or the discharge is green, yellow, white or foul smelling, your cat needs veterinary attention.

Separation of the wound edges. In a male cat, the scrotal incisions will be open, but they should be small, and they should close rapidly. A female cat or a male that had abdominal surgery may or may not have visible stitches. If the cat has visible stitches, these should remain intact. If the cat does not have visible stitches, the wound edges should remain closed. If they start to separate or you notice anything, including suture material, protruding from the wound, take the cat to your veterinarian right away.

, Your cat’s gums should be pale pink to red in color. When you press lightly on the gum and then let go, the color should return quickly to the area.If your cat’s gums are pale or don’t return to their normal color when pressed, call your vet., Cats don’t always display pain the way humans (or even dogs) do. Be on the lookout for signs of discomfort in your cat. If you see any signs of pain, your cat needs help and you should call your vet. Common signs of postoperative pain in cats include:Persistent hiding or attempts to escape
Depression or lethargy
Loss of appetite
Hunched posture
Tense abdominal muscles
Growling
Hissing
Anxiety or skittishness

, Make sure that your cat is recovering by keeping an eye on its behavior. Anything that doesn’t seem “normal” should go away within 24 hours of surgery. If you notice unusual behavior or symptoms in your cat, call your vet immediately. The following are signs to watch for:Lethargy for more than 24 hours after surgery
Diarrhea
Vomiting after the first night
Fever or chills
Decreased appetite for more than 24-48 hours after surgery
Failure to eat anything after 24 hours (for adult cats) or 12 hours (for kittens)
Difficult or painful urination
Not defecating for more than 24-48 hours after surgery

, In most cases, contacting your normal veterinarian when you’re concerned will be enough to help your cat recover. However, in certain cases, you should seek emergency care for your cat. Call an emergency vet or animal hospital if you observe any of the following in your cat:


Unconsciousness
Unresponsiveness
Difficulty breathing
Signs of extreme pain
Altered mental state (the cat does not seem to recognize you or its surroundings, or is behaving very unusually)
Distended abdomen
Bleeding

, Your cat may not have skin sutures (visible stitches). However, if your cat does have sutures, your vet will need to remove them in 10-14 days after surgery.


Even if your cat doesn’t have sutures, keep any follow-up appointments that your veterinarian recommended.

This type of brush suits both long haired and short haired cats, and most cats enjoy being brushed with it. Buy a slicker brush online or at your local pet store and introduce it to your cat slowly (e.g. let your cat sniff it and rub up against it before you attempt to use it for grooming)., If you have a long haired cat, try using a wide tooth brush with long, beaded bristles, which will be gentle and less likely to get caught in the fur. If you have a short haired cat, try a soft-bristle brush to gently remove dead hairs and keep its coat healthy. Both types of brush should be available at pet stores or online., If your cat refuses to cooperate when you try to brush it, purchase a grooming glove. Grooming gloves fit over the hand and allow pet owners to pet their cat while brushing them inconspicuously. These rubber gloves have tiny bumps that are gentle enough to remove dead hair without alarming your cat., Fleas comb are not just useful for detecting fleas in your pet, they can also help you remove dead hair. These fine toothed combs work well with both short haired and long haired cats. Purchase a flea comb at your local pet store or online and use it regularly to keep your cat free of dead hair, dirt, and other debris., For long haired cats prone to shedding, purchase a de-shedding tool (available online or in most pet stores). These tools have a unique stainless steel edge that removes shedding hair without scratching your pet. De-shedding tools can reduce up to 90% of shed fur., Scissor-style nail trimmers are a popular choice and have the advantage of being easy-to-use. Unlike regular scissors, they have shorter blades with a contoured edge designed to fit the cat’s nail in. If you are a beginner to cat grooming, purchase this style of trimmer at a local pet store or online., If your cat’s nails are strong and difficult to cut with simple, scissor-style clippers, opt for plier-style clippers instead. This tool offers a better grip and stronger cut than scissor-style clippers, despite being a bit less intuitive. Look for plier-style trimmers at pet stores and online., If you have an easy-going cat who doesn’t spook easily, try an electric style nail trimmer. This tool has the benefit of having safety features to prevent harm to your cat (e.g. cutting the quick of your cat’s nail, which could cause bleeding). It is not a good option for impatient or fearful cats, however, as the electric trimmer can be time-consuming and makes a great deal of noise, which your cat may not appreciate., For easy, on-the-spot grooming, purchase ""kitty"" wipes online or from a pet store (e.g. Whisker City Gentle Tearless Cat Wipes, available at Pet Smart).These non-toxic disposable wipes can be used to gently clean your cat's ears and nose. They can also remove dander and to refresh your cat's coat., To ensure that your cat's teeth stay clean, buy a toothbrush with flexible, soft bristles from a pet store. Since regular toothpaste is not an option for cats (as it may include ingredients that are toxic to cats, such as Xylitol), purchase cat-friendly toothpaste from a pet store. Pet toothpaste comes in a variety of flavors (like chicken and fish) to make it appealing to your cat., For the rare occasions that you cat needs a bath (e.g. getting something stuck in its fur), purchase a cat-specific shampoo from a pet store. Opt for an all-natural, veterinarian-approved shampoo with mild ingredients like oatmeal. Never use human shampoo on your cat, which can severely dry out its skin and coat., To clean your cat's ears, buy an ear cleaning liquid from your veterinarian or from a pet store, with your veterinarian's recommendation. Ear cleaning liquid evaporates quickly and should be used to clean your cat's ears instead of water, which can build up in your cat's ear canals. You should also purchase gauze or cotton balls to gently apply the liquid."

Examine your cat monthly.,
Take your pet's temperature.,
Clean your cat’s nose.",How to Check Your Cat's Nose1," In addition to a yearly veterinarian visit, you should give your cat a home health check at least once a month. Doing this regularly will ease your cat’s anxiety about it over time and make the process easier. This full exam, including its nose, should also cover:Ears
Eyes
Mouth, teeth, and gums
Body
Skin and coat
Claws
Chin;
, If you notice nasal discharge and accompanying symptoms, take your cat's temperature. For the most accurate reading, purchase a rectal thermometer at a pet store or online. If you get a reading of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or more (indicating a fever), contact your vet immediately., After examining your cat’s nose, wipe it clean using water and a cloth or cotton ball. Gently brace your cat’s face and wipe its nose as quickly as possible. Follow up by giving your cat a treat."

Make an appointment with your local veterinary clinic.,
Try to neuter your cat before he reaches sexual maturity.,
Ask for help if you cannot afford the procedure.",How to Castrate a Cat1," Castration is a surgical procedure that must be performed by a veterinarian. It is illegal for anyone other than qualified veterinarian to perform this surgery. Cats undergoing castration must be fully anesthetized during the procedure because performing surgery without anesthesia is an act of animal cruelty.;
, Neutering, desexing, or castrating males (these are all different ways of expressing the term castration) is commonly done from 5 -6 months of age, before the cat reaches sexual maturity. There is however, much ongoing debate about the best age to neuter a male cat.Many cat welfare organizations now recommend neutering at a very young age, such as 8-16 weeks old.
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) supports early age neutering, because of the problem of feral cat populations. In some states neutering before 12 weeks of age is required by law., There are many resources available to make spaying and neutering affordable.If you cannot afford the cost of neutering your cat, speak to your veterinary clinic or an animal welfare charity. Most clinics will be able to put you in touch with charities that offer vouchers for the cost of neutering, or else castrate the animal for you through their own veterinary clinics.


Due to the resources available to those who cannot afford this procedure, it is totally unnecessary to resort to a home procedure.

Consult with your vet.,
Choose a novel protein diet.,
Maintain a strict diet for 6‒8 weeks.,
Wait for symptom improvement.,
Decide which protein to feed your cat.,
Choose an easily digestible diet.,
Determine how much fiber your cat will need.,
Consider whether to feed your cat a grain-free diet.,
Talk with your vet about raw food diets.,
Purchase a commercial raw food diet.,
Prepare a homemade raw food diet.",How to Choose a Diet for IBD Cats," A good diet is an important aspect of successfully managing a cat’s IBD. To choose the right diet for your cat, you’ll first need to know what food is causing the problem. While you and your vet discuss dietary options for your cat, they may first recommend a food elimination trial.


A food trial will identify the ‘culprit’ ingredient and help you and your vet choose the best long-term diet for your cat.
Proteins commonly cause food allergies in cats. Therefore, changing the protein source is often the first step in choosing the right diet for a cat with IBD.;
, Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require animal protein sources in their diet.However, some of these proteins, like beef and fish, can cause food allergies that can inflame the GI tract and lead to IBD.Your vet will recommend putting your cat on a diet with a protein your cat has never eaten before (‘novel’ protein).


Examples of novel proteins are duck and rabbit.Commercial and prescription novel protein diets are available. Although more expensive, prescription novel protein diets are less likely to contain traces of non-novel animal protein sources.An alternative to novel proteins is hydrolyzed proteins (usually chicken). These proteins are broken down to sizes that are too small for the immune system to detect., During the food trial, your cat can eat only the new diet—no treats, human food, or flavored medication.It can take up to several months for dietary changes to improve IBD symptoms, so you will need to keep your cat on the new diet for at least 6‒8 weeks.Cats do not like switching diets, so make the switch gradually. Mix a small amount of the new diet into the old diet. Then, over the course of at least a week, increase the amount of new diet until your cat is eating only the new diet., With the novel protein diet, your cat’s IBD symptoms should start to improve. If they improve, you will need to ‘re-challenge’ your cat with its old diet to see if the symptoms return. This re-challenging process is needed to confirm which ingredient is upsetting your cat’s GI tract.If your cat’s symptoms don’t improve, your vet may recommend a new food trial with a different type of diet. For example, a low fiber, low fat, easily digestible diet may be good for your cat., If the food trial identified the ‘culprit’ ingredient as a protein, choose a diet that does not contain that protein. For example, if chicken was the culprit, feed your cat a diet with a novel protein like kangaroo.Keep in mind that, over time, a novel protein will no longer be novel. You may need to keep changing the novel protein source to prevent your cat’s IBD from coming back.
If your cat's symptoms improved on the food trial diet, consider keeping your cat on that diet.
Even if your cat’s symptoms didn’t improve, your cat will still need an animal protein source in its diet. Choose a different protein that wasn’t in your cat’s old diet or the food trial diet.

, When your cat’s GI tract is inflamed from IBD, it will have a hard time digesting and breaking down food. If a novel protein diet didn’t seem to help your cat very much, consider an easily digestible diet. This type of diet contains proteins, carbohydrates, and fat that are easily broken down.Rice is a highly digestible carbohydrate.
Low fat diets are usually easily digestible. Some cats with IBD will have less diarrhea with a low-fat diet.Chicken and lamb are high-quality proteins. High-quality foods are usually more digestible than low-quality foods.Talk with your vet if you’re having trouble determining whether a particular diet is digestible.

, Fiber helps draw water into the GI tract. This will bulk up the feces and make them less watery. If your cat has IBD, extra fiber in the diet can help treat the diarrhea. Be aware, though, that a high-fiber diet does not help all cats with IBD.Dietary fiber comes from plants. Because cats prefer animal protein and fat, your cat may not prefer a high-fiber diet.A low-fiber diet may be better for your cat.
Try feeding your cat a high-fiber diet to see if your cat likes it, and if IBD symptoms improve.

, Because cats are obligate carnivores, they do not need carbohydrates in their diet.Although grains have been suggested (and marketed) as sources of feline food allergies, there is not yet scientific data to prove that grains cause food allergies in cats.Examples of grains are rice, corn, and wheat.
Because grains are unlikely to inflame your cat’s GI tract, it is not necessary to feed your cat a grain-free diet. However, if you are unsure, your vet can help you determine whether a grain-free diet would be good for your cat.

, A diet for a cat with IBD should be free of additives, preservatives, and coloring agents.However, finding a commercial food, canned or dry, that is free of those ingredients can be difficult.A raw food diet does not contain these ingredients and, therefore, makes a good dietary option for a cat with IBD.


Making a homemade raw food diet takes time and require extra attention to ensure complete and balanced nutrition.
If you are thinking about making a raw food diet for your cat, talk with your vet or a veterinary nutritionist first. They can provide helpful advice on nutritious raw food diets.

, If a homemade raw food diet seems like too much work for you, consider purchasing a commercial raw food diet. In addition to saving you time, commercial raw food diets have the advantage of being nutritionally complete.If you would rather prepare the raw food yourself, be aware that transitioning a cat to a homemade raw food diet can take a very long time. Feed your cat a commercial raw food diet first., When preparing a homemade raw food diet, use fresh, high-quality, whole meat (turkey, rabbit, chicken) from your local grocery store or butcher. Avoid buying pre-ground meat, since the ground meat can sit in the display case at the store for a long time and develop bacterial growth.Instead, grind the meat yourself and immediately freeze the portion you're not using.


Grinders are available at your local kitchenware store. The store’s staff can show you how to properly operate the grinder.
Other than a grinder, you’ll need other kitchen equipment, including meat shears, an electronic scale, and mixing bowls.To make the diet nutritionally complete, you'll need vitamin supplements. Pre-mixed supplements are available that can be added to the meat.Several websites, such as http://www.catinfo.org/?link=makingcatfood#Raw%20vs%20Cooked, have homemade raw food recipes for cats. You can also get recipes from a veterinary nutritionist.

Check for signs of nosebleeds.,
Check for flaking skin.,
Assess the temperature and wetness of your cat's nose.,
Look for discharge.,
Watch for other symptoms of medical issues.",How to Check Your Cat's Nose2," Short of actually seeing your cat having a nosebleed, there may be evidence present on your cat’s nose that they are experiencing them. Look for swelling around the area, pus coming out of your cat’s nostrils, or bruising on the nose. If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian immediately as nosebleeds can be a sign of injury or serious illnesses such as:Cancer
Anemia
Kidney failure
Blood clotting disorders
Bacterial infection
Dental abscess

, Chapped or flaking skin could be a sign of a dermatological problem in your cat. If you observe this symptom for more than a few days, contact your veterinarian. Dry skin on your cat's nose can also be attributed to:Time spent near a heater or other heat source
Poor air circulation
Sun exposure
Dried saliva from licking its nose

, A cat's nose can vary in temperature and wetness, which generally are not a cause for concern. Most cats have moist, cool noses, but dryness does not usually indicate a serious issue unless accompanied by a fever. Sudden wetness, however, could be a sign of an upper respiratory infection.If your cat's nose in unusually wet, observe it for a day or two and look for other URI symptoms (e.g. red or watery eyes). Bring your cat to the vet if the runny nose persists.

, It is not unusual for cats to have runny noses, but the discharge should be clear. Check for thick, bubbling, or dark discharge (yellow, green, or black), which could be the sign if an infection. If you notice this dark mucus, contact your veterinarian immediately for an exam., If your cat's nose is expelling mucus, look for other symptoms that might provide an explanation. Observe your cat and note any sneezing, panting, or difficulty breathing. These symptoms could be indicative of a respiratory infection or other illness."
"
Use calming herbs.,
Apply pressure to its torso.,
Try a pheromone spray.",How to Check Your Cat's Nose3," There are several herbs that are calming to cats and may help to keep your pet relaxed while you examine its nose. Valerian, for example, causes an active, “high” state usually followed by a sleepy feeling for cats and is safe for them to chew and eat in plant form. Give your cat valerian about a half hour before examining it to allow it to go through the initial period of excitement and settle into a relaxed mode.Catnip, known for eliciting a hyper effect, also induces a relaxed state. Give it to your cat to play with (a pinch in a fillable toy, or in a paper bag crushed into a tight ball) 15 minutes before examining its nose to make it more amenable., Applying gentle, constant pressure to your cat’s torso is a proven way to alleviate anxiety. While examining your cat, have a family member or friend hold your cat firmly, securing its body and putting light pressure on it. For added security, wrap your cat in a blanket and hold it that way.Another option is a ‘’pressure shirt”, a snug garment with adjustable straps designed to apply light, even pressure to the torso to keep your cat calm while it wears it. The “Thunder shirt”, for instance, is available online for approximately $40., Ask your vet about pheromone sprays as a way to relax your cat. These sprays contain a synthetic version of a smell that cats use to bond with each other and loved ones by rubbing up against them.For instance, Feliway, a synthetic copy of cats’ facial pheromones, is available through many veterinarians."

Make sure your cat fasts before his procedure.,
Bring your cat to the veterinary clinic in a secure carrier.,
Take comfort knowing your cat will be anesthetized for the procedure.,
Expect your cat to have some shaved areas after the surgery.,
Learn how the testicles are removed.,
Care for your cat after the surgery.",How to Castrate a Cat2," Prior to castration, it is important to starve the cat overnight so that his stomach is empty for the anesthetic. This is because a cat may vomit while under anesthesia. If he brings up food and then breathes in the vomit, he may suffocate or inhale food down into the lungs where it could cause pneumonia.Your veterinarian will likely instruct you to remove your cat’s food the night before surgery, but it is fine to leave water out for your cat overnight. Make sure that you remove the water at around 7 am on the day of surgery.

, Cat carriers are essential to keeping your cat safe when you travel with him. A carrier will also to keep your cat safe and away from other animals at the clinic.


It is a good idea to arrive around 10-15 minutes early. You will have to complete some paperwork, such as signing a consent form for the anesthetic and the surgical procedure.

, The veterinarian will check your cat to make sure there are no health issues such as a heart murmur, which may require your veterinarian to choose a different kind of anesthesia. The vet will select the safest most appropriate anesthetic for your cat.After your cat has been anesthetized, the vet or vet tech will administer lubricant drops into your cat’s eyes to stop the surface from drying out. This is because not all cats close their eyelids while under anesthesia.

, A vet tech will clip the fur away from your cat’s scrotum before the surgery. The vet tech will then scrub the skin of the scrotum to make it as clean as possible. This step helps to prevent infections.The veterinarian will scrub up to ensure that his or her skin is as clean as possible.

, After the area is prepped, the veterinarian will make a small incision using a surgical scalpel. The incision will be less than 1 cm long over one-half of the scrotum. Then, the veterinarian will apply gentle pressure to the testicle and the testicle will pop out through the incision.Next, the veterinarian will tie the spermatic ducts and blood vessels to each other to prevent bleeding and to eliminate the need for sutures.
After the spermatic ducts and blood vessels have been tied off, the veterinarian will sever the vas deferens and remove the testicle.
Then, the veterinarian will repeat the procedure on the other side.

, Your cat should be able to go home the same day. Healing takes 7 - 14 days, so during this time it is best to keep the cat indoors and avoid strenuous play. After he has healed, he may return to his normal activities.Check your cat’s wound daily to ensure that it is healing well. If you notice any signs of redness or swelling, call your vet.
Prevent your cat from licking his wound. Licking may cause an infection, so stop your cat from licking his wound if you notice him doing so.
Monitor your cat’s behavior. If you notice any unusual symptoms in the days following the surgery, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, constipation, black tarry stools, not urinating, or vomiting, call your veterinarian right away.

Know that you will be helping to reduce the stray cat population.,
Be aware that you will be helping to eliminate disease.,
Consider the benefits of eliminating or preventing spraying behaviors.",How to Castrate a Cat3," Unneutered male cats have a natural drive to mate and perpetuate their genetic line. It has been estimated that about 50 million stray cats live in the United States.Stray cats live short, difficult lives. They often die young due to disease, parasitism, fighting, or accidental injury.
The best way to help stray cats is to reduce their number by humane methods such as spaying and neutering.

, Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is spread by bodily fluids such as blood and semen. An unneutered male cat is at increased risk of acquiring the virus, or spreading it to other cats. The rate of FIV infection in the US cat population varies from 1.5% to 15%., If your unneutered male cat lives indoors, you may have noticed some unpleasant smells as a result of his urine. The pungent smell of unneutered Tom cat urine can fill an entire house, even if your cat uses the litter box.


In addition, unneutered cats experience a strong natural drive to scent mark their territory by squirting urine against walls. Neutering can prevent this habit from forming in young cats. If your cat has already developed this habit, then neutering along with behavior modification training can eliminate spraying behavior."

Gather the necessary supplies.,
Warm up the cat’s ear.,
Find the marginal ear vein.,
Prick the vein with the needle.,
Put the blood sample on a test strip.,
Apply a cotton ball or gauze to the cat’s ear.",How to Collect Bodily Fluid Samples from a Cat1," You may need to collect a small amount of blood from a cat to monitor the cat’s glucose levels. This is a common practice for cats that have diabetes. To collect a blood sample from a cat, you will need:A sterile hypodermic needle
Medical gloves
A test strip
Cotton balls or gauze
You can find these supplies at medical supply stores or online.;
, You will be getting the blood sample from the cat’s earflap, as this is the easiest spot to draw blood from the cat. Put the medical gloves on and warm up the cat’s ear to make it easier to draw blood. Hold its ear between your hands or apply a warm compress to the ear for one minute.If the cat squirms in your grip, place a towel over its head. This will calm the cat down and help it to stay still. You can then reach under the towel to warm up the cat’s ear.
Say calming words to the cat as you rub its ear to help it remain calm. For example, you may say, “Good kitty” or “Let’s be calm now.”

, Flip over the cat’s ear and locate the hairless part of the ear. You should see a vein that runs just on the inside of the top of the cat’s ear. This is the marginal ear vein, which is the vein you will be drawing blood from. It is painless to draw blood from this area for the cat.Do not confuse the marginal ear vein with other veins on your cat’s ear. You should only be focusing on the vein that runs on the inside top part of the cat’s ear.

, Pet the cat as you use your other hand to carefully prick the marginal ear vein with the needle. Do this quickly and gently so the cat does not get startled. The cat should not feel the prick at all.


Once you prick the vein, a small drop of blood should appear on the surface of the cat’s ear.

, Place the test strip just underneath the cat’s ear and let the blood drip onto the strip. You should only need one to two drops of blood on the strip to test the cat’s glucose levels.If you are using the test strip to test the cat’s glucose levels, place the test strip in a glucometer. The glucometer will then produce a read-out detailing the levels of glucose in the cat.

, Once you have the blood sample, use a cotton ball or a piece of gauze on the prick area. Gently but firmly apply pressure to the cat’s ear by holding the cotton ball on the spot. It should stop bleeding after a few seconds.As long as the bleeding stops, you do not need to put a band aid or gauze on the prick. It should heal just fine on its own.

",How to Care for Orphaned Kittens Above 3 Weeks of Age," Since they are above three weeks of age or are about that age, they should have a warm place to stay. Decide a place that's quiet and peaceful. You can't expect them to sleep in a place with rock music or whatnot.;
, After that, you can make a place to sleep by placing shirts, clean, old quilts and sheets or even pillows inside a roomy box. Be aware that they may not be potty trained so choose your quilts wisely! Kittens need to be warm, and very young ones need more heat.

,, While at the vet buy substitute milk. You can buy this at a pet shop. If you buy the liquid type of kitten formula, do not microwave it because this creates it creates areas in the formula that are too cold and too hot; it is not evenly warmed. Try putting the formula in a container, then putting the container in hot water.

, See whether they are able to eat solid food. If not, give them warm proportions of canned sardine or tuna or anything moist and soft. Keep this balanced with moistened kitten kibble. Rich foods will give them diarrhea.

, By doing this, your bond will be stronger and you'll be attached to it. Unusual names are okay as it expresses individuality. Something like 'Squinkle' or 'Winky'. If you'd rather go for a different name, don't let others stop you by saying rude things like,""What?! That is SO common!"" or ""What kind of name is that?""

, There is a loose baggy area of skin that the mother cat uses to pick them up. You pinch that area lightly and then place your hand under their tail to scoop them up then quickly place the other hand below their front paws. If it squirms, put it down unless it's important.

, Their soft little fur needs warmth.

Feed your FIV positive cat a nutritious diet.,
Feed your cat dry kibble.,
Feed your cat food that is appropriate for its age.",How to Care for an FIV Infected Cat1," It is important to give your cat a good diet in order to keep him or her as healthy as possible despite the FIV. Ask your veterinarian about good, quality brands of cat food.;
, Dry kibble is the best food you can feed your cat, as wet food has a tendency to build up on teeth, causing tartar buildup that can lead to infections. Your primary goal should be to do everything you can to keep your cat infection-free because FIV causes it to be very susceptible to infections., Vets often recommend life-stage diets from Hills, Purina, and Royal Canin. These diets provide for the specific nutritional needs of young animals (under 12 months of age), adults (classed as 1 – 7 years), and senior animals (over the age of 7 years). Matching the life-stage diet to the age of your cat can promote longevity.

Consider the guillotine trimmer.,
Hold the clippers with the top side facing you.,
Squeeze the handles to clip the nail.",How to Choose Nail Trimmers for Your Cat1," Guillotine trimmers are trimmers that have a circular hole that you place the nail through. This is called the stationary ring. When you squeeze the handle, a cutting blade appears from the bottom of the stationary ring and slides upwards to snip the nail., When you use a guillotine trimmer, you will hold the trimmer in your dominant hand. The top side is the flat side, and the underside is the side with the movable part you squeeze. When you trim your cat’s nails, the flat, top side of the trimmer will be turned towards you. The side with the cutting blade will face you, and the screws will face the cat.Angle the handles either down towards the floor or up towards the ceiling.

, When you use a guillotine clipper, hold it in your dominant hand. Place the cat’s nail in the stationary ring, making sure that you don’t go so far as to cut the quick. Then, squeeze the handles to move the cutting blade. It will snip off the tip of the nail.Make sure the nail is being cut on the top and bottom, not along the sides.
The quick is the pink, living part of your cat’s nail. You can clearly see it through the white nail. Only clip the dead, white part of the claw.
Clipping the quick will cause bleeding. Apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding, or if you don't have it on hand you can use some tissue paper to apply pressure. If the bleeding persists for several minutes call your vet for advice.

Get your cat vaccinated.,
Don't forget flea control.,
Get your cat microchipped.",How to Care for Indoor Cats," An indoor cat get makes its own amusement, which often means exploring the home and playing with anything that catches its eye. It is important you check around your house from a ""cat's eye"" point of view and look for things it might hurt itself on and make sure they are safe.Be aware cats may jump up onto all kinds of surfaces. Just because a surface is waist-height, or even head-height, doesn't mean that your cat won't thoroughly explore it.
Put away things what will be attractive to a cat. For example, tinsel, shoelaces, wool, string, sewing supplies are all attractive to cats. If it's long, thin, and snake like then the cat will want to play with it. Make sure these are all tidied away because if the cat investigates with its mouth and swallow a piece of wool the cat could end up with a serious bowel obstruction that requires surgery to correct it.
Cats and candles don't mix. Cats love to jump up, so even putting a candle on a high shelf doesn't mean it's safe. In the worst case scenario, the cat won't know it's there, knock it over, and cause a house fire.;
, Always make sure cleaning agents and other chemicals are locked out of harm's way. There are many chemicals we use in our homes that are severely toxic to cats.


For example, many common floor cleaners contain benzalkonium chloride. This chemical can cause burns to delicate tissue, such as the tongue or the lining of the mouth of a cat. If a cat walks across a floor still wet with cleaner, and then licks its paws to clean them, it could develop nasty tongue ulcers which prevent it from eating.

, Many are. Indeed lilies have no place in a cat household, since the pollen is extremely toxic and causes severe kidney failure. Other plants to avoid include azaleas, hydrangeas, poinsettias, daffodils, and mistletoe. This is not an exhaustive list so always check to see if your plants are feline friendly before bringing them into your house.

, Cats like privacy when on the toilet. Place the tray in a quiet area where the cat won't be disturbed or frightened by a sudden noise (such as a washing machine in a laundry room). If you have several cats, be aware that you need one tray for each cat. Its even a good idea to have a spare. Thus if you have five cats you should have six trays.


Keep the trays clean so they are pleasant places for your kitty to visit. This means daily pooper scooping and spot cleaning, and a weekly complete clean of the trays., Be aware that indoor cats are prone to weight gain. To prevent this, measure out the food and give the amount recommended on the package. If your cat is putting weight on (its ribs get more difficult to find), then reduce its daily allowance.


Keep fresh water on hand at ALL TIMES! This is very important.
Consider feeding foods made for ""indoor"" or ""sterilized"" cats, since these are slightly reduced in calories to take account of the cat's lifestyle.
It is a good idea to give the cat an outlet for hunting behavior by using puzzle feeders so kitty works for its supper. These are available online and through most pet stores.

, It's important that the cat has a little space of its own, even if it actually sleeps with you at night. This little space could be a cat bed or a cat tree that the cat can curl up inside of., Scratching is part of normal cat behavior. When is scratches the cat deposits tiny amounts of scent, which lets other cats know it has claimed the territory. If you don't provide a scratching post then the cat will find its own and it could well be your best sofa.Watch your cat to see if it scratches horizontally (along the carpet) or vertically (up the sofa). Provide your cat with a scratch post that is either flat (horizontal) or vertical to match its natural scratching preference.
Make sure the post is taller than the cat is and anchor it firmly, so it doesn't move when the cat scratches. Place the post near an entrance or exit, since this is where cats like to deposit their scent.
Also put a post near the cat's bed, since cats like to scratch when they get up after sleeping.

, Play with your cat regularly. Make sure you have regular play sessions, several times a day. Cats are sprinters rather than marathon runners so three or four, 5 - 10 minute sessions are better than one 20 minutes play.


Get a little feather wand, some toy mice, or even just a piece of string (they never get tired of it...). Shake the wand around at the cat's height, not yours. Throw the mouse and watch the cat wrestle with it. Hold one end of the string and either run around the house with it, or just wriggle it around.

, Cats are hunters, which means that they have periods of inactivity interspersed with hunting activity. Just because cats like to sleep doesn't mean that they don't need the mental stimulation with scenting out a mouse, stalking, and catching it would provide.Many behavioral issues such as house soiling, scratching, or aggression to other pets are caused because of boredom or frustration. So be sure to provide plenty of interesting things for your cat to play with.

, Make sure it has a high perch with a window view. This allows the cat to be entertained by the sights outdoors and to fulfill the feline need to be high up, as cats are naturally tree climbers.If you live in an apartment make sure the balcony is cat safe and the cat cannot fall from a balcony rail. You may consider caging in an area of the balcony so the cat can lookout over the neighborhood but without the risk of injury.
Likewise, make sure any opening windows are escape proof. Check screens to make sure they are secure and not damaged, so the cat cannot slip out when you're not looking.

, It's not only dogs that benefit from obedience training. Try clicker training your cat, which provides vital mental stimulation for your feline friend, and also helps it to bond with you. This training is done in a similar way to dogs, but just be patient with the cat and be aware you need to find a treat that really motivates the cat to follow commands.

, Leave out toys for your cat to play with when it isn't able to play with you. You could leave out toy mice or catnip, but you can also leave out items that are less expected, but safe for your cat. Try putting out a paper bag or a cardboard box for your cat to explore and play with., Give it lots of love and attention, if your cats desires it. You have about 20 years ahead of you with your cat, so make the best of it by building a bond of mutual affection.

, Indoor cats need their nails clipping more frequently, as they are not wearing them down going outside. Either have your vet tech or cat groomer cut them, or ask them to show you how to do it. Clip the tips once a month.


Also brush your cat wherever it lets you. It may even roll around and let you brush its furry stomach if it's in a really affectionate mood! Brushing your cat is not usually necessary to keeping your cat's coat in good condition (cats usually groom themselves) but it is a good way to form a bond with your pet. This is also a chance for you to inspect your cat's coat and its body for potential health issues.
Look for black dots or things moving in the cat's fur. Separate the fur and look at the exposed skin. If you do see things moving or lots of small black dots (flea feces), get it a flea and tick collar or spray or take the cat to the vet to get suggestions about treatment.
Sometimes as cats get older they are no longer able to groom their coats completely. They loose flexibility, making it impossible for them to reach their entire coat. If this is the case with your cat, you may need to do more regular grooming to keep your cat's coat healthy., Unneutered animals are much more territorial and likely to mark their territory (your home!) with urine or feces. Also, they are more likely to attract strays to the house, which in turn can leave your cat feeling threatened or distressed by the sight of other cats in its yard.

, Even though the cat doesn't go out, you should still get it vaccinated. Some viral infections, such as feline distemper, are caused by hardy viruses that can be walked in on your shoes. Also, if your cat does slip out one dark night, because its immune system has never been exposed to outdoor bugs, there is a greater risk of it catching disease.


Cats that don't hunt or go outdoors still require worming twice a year. This is because they are born with worms that they acquired from their mother, and the worm eggs dormant in the body tissues hatch out over the pet's lifetime.

, While the risk of acquiring fleas is lower with an indoor cat, if your pet does pick up a flea you are liable to have a population explosion. There are many excellent safe and effective flea products for use in the cat. Have a chat to your veterinarian to discover which is the best product to meet your needs and that of your cat.

, This is a small microchip that is implanted under the skin of the scruff. When the chip is scanned it gives a unique number that is registered on a data base with your details. Should your cat escape, the chip provides a foolproof way of the rescue realizing it is owned and reuniting the pair of you.

Put the medical gloves on.,
Collect stool from the cat’s litter box.,
Place the stool in a sealed plastic bag.",How to Collect Bodily Fluid Samples from a Cat2," Getting a stool sample from a cat will require you to touch the cat’s stool. Before you do this, always put on medical gloves. You do not want to contract any bacteria or pathogens by touching the stool with your bare hands.Stool samples are often requested by a vet if they want to test a cat for parasites and other pathogens. You will need to bring the stool sample into the vet so they can run various tests on the sample and diagnose the cat.

, With your gloved hands, pick up stool from your cat’s litter box. Try to get stool that does not have a lot of litter attached to it. Fresh stool is best for testing so try to pick up the stool soon after your cat has gone to the bathroom.If you plan to get the stool sample tested, book a testing appointment with your vet in advance. Then collect the stool from the cat’s litter box on the same day as the appointment. The fresher the stool samples are, the more accurate the results of the testing of the samples will be.

, Use a plastic bag with an air tight seal. Once the stool sample is in the bag, label the bag “stool sample” as well as the date. Then, bring the sample to the vet for the testing.If you are not bringing the sample into the vet for testing right away, you can store it in the refrigerator overnight. Do not keep the sample next to open food items or fresh foods. Double bag the sample and place it on its own shelf so it does not come in contact with the food in your fridge.

Get your cat vaccinated regularly.,
Keep your cat parasite-free.,
Boost your cat’s immune system with vitamins it can eat.,
Talk to your vet about giving your cat injectable vitamins.,
Give your cat L-lysine supplements.,
Consider interferon treatment for your FIV-positive cat.,
Seek veterinary help if your cat shows signs of illness.",How to Care for an FIV Infected Cat2," FIV causes your cat’s immune system to become weak, which means that it is very susceptible to other illnesses, like cat flu. Because of this, it's important that you get your cat vaccinated against illnesses every year.


Talk to your vet about which vaccines to give your cat, as some diseases are more common in certain areas than others.Your vet will most likely suggest that you get your cat vaccinated against feline distemper and other cat viruses.

, A FIV-infected cat’s body is less likely to handle infections well. FIV-infected cats also need all the nutrients that they can get and many parasites will rob your cat’s body of those nutrients. You need to treat your cat for both internal and external parasites.Control worms (internal parasites) with milbemax (containing milbemycin.) This wormer is effective against all classes of worms. Indoor cats should be dosed once every three to four months. Cats allowed outdoor access, especially those that hunt rodents, should be wormed monthly.
External parasites such as fleas and ticks can also compromise your cat’s health. Vets often recommend Stronghold (UK)/ Revolution (US). This external parasite medication combats all external parasites in the same way that milbemax fights internal parasites.

, It is a good idea to boost its immune system with vitamins. You can give your cat vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin C, selenium, and zinc.Talk to your vet about the proper dose for your specific cat. Your vet will most likely recommend something along the lines of 3 to 5 ml of LC-vit daily or 5 ml of Nutri-Plus Gel daily.

, If your cat is very weak and has a hard time eating, you should consider giving him or her injectable vitamins to boost its health. Again, it is always important to talk to your vet before giving your cat any supplements or medication.


An injectable supplement that is often recommended by vets is Coforta, which is injected at 0.5ml to 2.5 ml per cat once a day for 5 days during a single treatment period., L-lysine is a supplement that can help prevent flare-ups of infections that are common in FIV-positive cats. L-lysine aids in protein synthesis and is involved in tissue repair and maintenance. The recommended dose is generally 500 mg daily mixed with food.


Talk to your vet before giving your cat supplements.

, In interferon therapy, your cat is injected intravenously with interferons, substances that are part of the immune system and help to fight viral and bacterial infections. By increasing the number of interferons in your cat’s body, your cat becomes more resistant to infections, which means that it has a better chance of living a long, happy life.Interferons are speciality medications that are veterinarian administered. They can be costly, but studies have shown they have minimal side effects in cats., FIV-positive cats have a much harder time fighting off infections and other illnesses. Because of this, it is best to take your cat into the vet as soon as you notice that it is sick, rather than waiting to see if the situation will resolve itself. Generally, your cat will simply need to be put on antibiotics to help his or her body fight the infections. You should always be on the look out for signs that your cat is feeling unwell, including:


Coughing.
Sneezing.
Runny eyes or nose.
Decreased appetite.
Increased thirst.
Vomiting or diarrhea.

"
"
Minimize the amount of stress your cat feels.,
Keep your cat’s routine the same.,
Use a plug-in diffuser.",How to Care for an FIV Infected Cat3," Stress can have physical effects on your cat because his or her immune system is already weak. When an animal is stressed, its body releases a natural steroid—cortisol—in order to help the body cope with the stress. Long term exposure to cortisol suppresses the immune system and, in a cat that already has a weakened immune system, this will decrease his or her limited ability to fight infection.:

, Change can really stress a cat out, from having a new pet around to moving to a new house. Try to keep your cat’s environment as normal as possible.


Don't forget to continue to play with your cat. Give it toys and spend quality time with it as usual. You don't want to exhaust a cat with FIV but you do want to continue to enjoy the company of your pet.

, You can purchase diffusers that emit feline pheromones that will keep your cat calm. Vets recommend Feliway, which contains a synthetic version of the pheromone (a hormone messenger) that a contented cat gives off.


Feliway is odorless to people, but to cats it sends of a reassuring message that all is well with the world.

Understand how FIV is transmitted.,
Consider keeping your FIV-positive and FIV-negative cats separate.,
Spay or neuter your FIV-positive cat.,
Keep a male cat indoors if he is likely to get into fights with other cats.,
Talk to a vet about the health of cats in your area, particularly if you live in a city.",How to Care for an FIV Infected Cat4," It is important to know how FIV is spread so that you can keep your FIV-free cats healthy and make sure that your FIV-positive cat still has a happy life. FIV is most commonly spread through a cat’s saliva, though it can also be spread through blood and semen. The most common way for a cat to contract FIV is through getting bit by an FIV-positive cat. Keep in mind that FIV is a relatively fragile virus that cannot survive in the environment beyond a few seconds. Outside the body, FIV is rapidly damaged by drying, UV, heat, light and basic disinfectants, and poses no risk to other cats. The virus requires direct transmission from infected saliva of one cat, into the bloodstream of a healthy cat.

, Studies have shown that it is not absolutely necessary to keep your healthy cats separate from your FIV-positive cats if they get along well. If your cats have a tendency to fight, however, it is a good idea to keep them separate.


In studies done by the University of Glasgow, it was found that when FIV-free and FIV-positive cats were around each other, there was a 1-2% transmission rate.You will have to decide whether that 1 to 2% is too much of a risk to take.

, When cats get spayed (females) or neutered (males), they become less aggressive, which means that the chances that they will get into fights is greatly reduced. If you have an FIV-positive cat that you want to remain an outdoor cat, it is a good idea to get it fixed so that it is less likely to bite another cat in a fight., As a responsible cat owner, your priorities should be to keep your FIV-positive cat healthy, and to make sure that it does not infect any other cats. Male cats tend to roam over large distances, sometimes across several acres and are likely to encounter other cats on their travels. If he is likely to scrap with these cats, then it is essential to keep him indoors.Keeping a territorial cat indoors might not be the most ideal situation, particularly if he is used to roaming around outside, but it might be the only way to keep him from spreading FIV to other cats in your neighborhood.

, If you live in a city, it is a good idea to talk to a local veterinarian about the incidence of FIV in the area. If there is a large population of feral cats who are FIV-positive, you may want to keep FIV-free cats indoors but may feel alright about letting your FIV-positive cat stay an outdoor cat. If FIV is rare in a high cat density neighborhood, then, as a responsible owner, you should keep your FIV-positive pet indoors.


If you live in an area with a low population of cats, such as remote countryside, then the risk of cats meeting and fighting is low, and it is acceptable to let your FIV-positive cat out.

Use a human nail clipper.,
Slide the nail between the blades.,
Try scissor clippers.,
Place the bottom of the nail against the blade.,
Use a nail file to smooth rough edges.",How to Choose Nail Trimmers for Your Cat2," Another way you can clip your cat’s nails is to use a regular pair of human nail clippers. These work almost just as well as guillotine clippers. Just make sure that the clippers are sharp enough to cut the nails.You should not use the nail clippers on yourself after using them on your cat. Instead, buy a different pair to use just for your cat.

, To clip the claw with human nail clippers, place the clippers perpendicular to the claw. Don’t cut the nail sideways because it will not cut as easily and may end up jagged and splintered. Slide the nail between the two blades and squeeze the clippers., Scissor clippers look like scissors, except they have a curved edge on the blades. Many vets use scissor trimmers.Scissor clippers are generally smaller than guillotine trimmers. This means they may be difficult to use and hold if you have larger hands. Scissor clippers may be better for smaller hands.Because of the way the trimmers are shaped, scissor trimmers are helpful to clip nails that have grown so long they are curling and growing into the toe pad., When using scissor clippers, make sure you place the nail into the blade the correct way. The scissors have a sharp curved edge. Place the bottom of the nail against the blade so you will cut the top and bottom.This prevents splintering and fraying. If you cut the nail side to side with the scissor blades, the nail will split.

, Make sure to keep the nail clippers or scissor clippers sharp. Dull clippers can leave a rough, jagged edge. If the clippers leave a jagged edge, use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges."

Choose clippers that are easy to use.,
Consider the size of your hands.,
Make sure the blade is sharp.,
Clean your clippers after each use.,
Invest in high quality trimmers.",How to Choose Nail Trimmers for Your Cat3," It doesn’t matter what type of clippers you use in the long run. Make sure you choose clippers that are easy for you to use. If you choose clippers that you can’t handle or squeeze, then it is going to be more stressful for you and your cat.Many trimmers have soft padding on the handles, which may be easier for you to use.

, Some trimmers may be too large or small for your hands. This can make cutting your cat’s nails very difficult. When you buy a trimmer, make sure the trimmers are a size that will be easy for you to clip the nails., No matter what type of trimmer you use, you need the blades to be sharp. Dull blades can make it harder for you to clip the nails, which can irritate and stress your cat. Dull blades can also leave jagged edges or splinter the nail. If you find the blades dull, you should sharpen them or replace them with a new pair.

, Even if you usually do a good job trimming your cat's nails, the nail may split or you might accidentally hit the quick. Clean them with soap or rubbing alcohol to limit the chances of infection. Dry them well to prevent rust., Since the trimmers will be part of your frequent grooming routine, you want to make sure you buy a quality product. Make sure that the clippers are durable. Stainless steel is a common material used for blades. Durable trimmers will last a long time.You also should make sure the trimmers are safe. You can injure your cat and yourself if you buy unsafe trimmers.
Ask your vet for recommendations or read product reviews online to get a sense of which products work well.

Replace your cat's litter with non absorbent litter.,
Pour the urine into a container.,
Keep the sample in the fridge overnight, if needed.,
Bring the sample to the vet's office.",How to Collect Bodily Fluid Samples from a Cat3," You may need to get a urine sample from your cat if your vet wants to test your cat's urine for health issues. Start by replacing your cat's litter with non absorbent litter so the urine is not absorbed when your cat goes to the bathroom. Time this for when your cat usually goes to the bathroom, replacing the litter right before it goes. This way, the urine sample will be fresh.You can find non absorbent cat litter online or at your local pet store. Inert litter beads are a good option, as are any litter beads that are labeled ""non absorbent.""
If you do not have access to non absorbent litter, you can line your cat's litter box with paper towels or bubble wrap instead.

, Once your cat has gone to the bathroom, take the litter box and carefully pour the urine into a an airtight plastic or glass container. A test tube would also work well. Wear medical gloves to do this so you do not come in contact with the urine.If you find it difficult to pour the urine right out of their litter box and do not want to get litter beads in the sample, use a clean medical dropper to suck the urine out of the box and into a container.

, If you are not bringing the sample to the vet right away, store it in the refrigerator. This will keep the sample fresh for the vet. You can also store the sample on ice in a cooler if you do not have access to a refrigerator to keep it fresh., Take the urine sample to your vet's office as soon as you acquire it, as this will ensure it is fresh and lead to the most accurate test results. Try to schedule the vet appointment in advance and collect the urine sample the day of the appointment.The vet will test the urine sample for traces of blood, as well as glucose, ketones, and concentration level. This can help your vet determine your cat's general health and if it is at risk for health issues like diabetes or a urinary tract infection.

Wear medical gloves.,
Place the cat in a relaxed position.,
Insert the swab between the cat’s cheek and gum.,
Remove the swab and place it in a plastic sleeve.,
Send the DNA swab out for testing.",How to Collect Bodily Fluid Samples from a Cat4," Getting a DNA sample from a cat requires getting up close and personal with the cat’s mouth. To protect yourself from bacteria and from getting bite, wear medical gloves when you take the sample.You should also have the cotton swab within reach so it’s easy to insert into the cat’s mouth.

, If the cat tends to dislike having its mouth open, try relaxing it before you take the sample. Say calming words to the cat and pet the cat. Position the cat between your legs so it can relax against your chest. This may make it easier for you to then insert the swab in the cat’s mouth.


If the cat gets agitated or annoyed, trying placing a towel over its head. This can help to calm it down.

, Once the cat is calm, carefully open the cat’s mouth. Then, insert the swab between the cat’s cheek and gum. Twist or rub the swab against the cat’s cheek a few times to collect cheek cells.Do not rub the swab on any other part of the cat’s mouth. This can contaminate the sample.

, Once you have collected cheek cells on the swab, gently remove it from the cat’s mouth. Place the swab into a plastic sleeve to protect the sample. You can use a plastic bag if you do not have a plastic sleeve for the swab.If you are using a swab that came from a DNA testing service, it usually comes with a plastic sleeve to protect the sample.

, Ask your vet to recommend a DNA testing service for the cat or look up services online. You can then mail the DNA sample to a DNA testing lab for analysis.


For a small fee, the DNA testing lab send back an analysis of the sample with the genetic makeup of the cat as well as the breed. This can be useful for cat breeders or for cat owners who want to know the breed of their cat.

Take your cat to be examined if it gets bitten by another cat.,
Be aware that your cat will become a carrier and might not exhibit symptoms.,
Look for signs of terminal illness that are commonly associated with FIV.",How to Care for an FIV Infected Cat5," Check your cat for bite marks regularly. You should take your cat to the vet if you notice a bite mark and at the same time that it develops a fever. FIV causes a severe fever that will last for 3 to 7 days. When you take your cat to the vet he or she will check for:


Swollen lymph nodes. When cats become ill, their lymph nodes swell up. Your vet will check to see if this is occurring in your cat.White blood cell levels. FIV causes decreases in white blood cell counts. Your vet will take a blood sample to see if your cat has low white blood cell counts.

, Most cats recover from the first stage of the disease (the fever and low white blood cell counts). When they recover, they will stop exhibiting signs of illness but will still carry the disease. This period of ‘health’ can last for several months to several years.Doing all of the things will help lengthen your cat’s life and prolong this stage in which she is just a carrier of the disease.

, FIV causes immune deficiency that can lead to your cat developing other illnesses. You should monitor your cat for any signs of illness including:


Chronic respiratory infections caused by bacteria and viruses.
Gastrointestinal infections and diarrhea (Gastroenteritis).
Skin lesions (sores).
Mouth lesions (sores).
Neurological symptoms like psychomotor problems (like trouble moving around), psychological problems, dementia, and convulsions.

Start at a young age, if possible.,
Introduce your cat to the car gradually.,
Practice driving before a vet visit.,
Take safety precautions.,
Get your cat used to public transportation.,
Understand vets dislike cats coming in without carriers.,
Know the safety features carriers provide.,
Find ways to make a carrier less stressful.",How to Bring Your Cat to the Vet Without a Carrier," You need to make sure your cat is not disruptive in the vet's office. Simply carrying your cat in your arms can pose a problem, as cats are hard to secure when frightened. If you don't want to use a carrier or don't have one, one alternative is a sports bag.


Sports bags are bags designed to carry clothing and other equipment to and from the gym or other sporting events. Many sports bags have nylon material lining the sides, filled with holes that allow for a cat to breath easy through the bag.
Owners who feel carriers are uncomfortable for cats sometimes use a sports bag made from nylon to carry their cat and from the vet. Make sure you find a sports bag with at least some nylon or mesh sides so your cat can breath and see his environment when being transported to the vet's office.
You also want a sports bag with a secure, flat solid bottom. A bottom that is not supported will sink in when you pick up the bag, causing discomfort for your cat.
Many owners equip sports bags with toys, blankets, and other items their cat might find comforting.;
, A cat harness is a device owners use to walk their cats. If you want to take your cat to the vet without a carrier, you could consider using a harness.


Make sure you purchase a harness specifically designed for cats. Harnesses designed for small dogs might be dangerous for a cat to use.Let your cat familiarize himself with the harness before you strap him in. Gently drape it over his body. Let him sniff and explore it. Then, gently guide his body into the harness and secure the buckle. Some cats may resist, so you might need another person to help restrain your cat.Allow him to wear the harness for a bit, under supervision, with no leash. Once he seems comfortable in the harness, to the point he's no longer wriggling or attempting to unfasten it, you can secure the leash.Practice walking your cat around the house for a week or so before taking him outside on the leash. Let him adjust to the restraints and wait until he's no longer pulling or resisting before taking him outside with the leash on.Once your cat is comfortable being walked inside, practice taking him on short walks around the block. You should be practicing for a few months before you attempt to take your cat to the vet's office. Remember, a vet's office will have a lot of unusual stimulations, such as ringing phones, strange people, and other animals. You need to practice a lot before you can safely take him to the vet's with a harness., If your cat is older and particularly docile, you may be able to secure him in a basket or bed. However, this is only a good option if you're sure of your cat's temperament. You do not want to risk the safety of your cat and other people and animals present in the waiting room by having your cat jump out and cause a stir.


Use this method with caution, as even the most docile cats can get spooked in an unfamiliar or frightening environment such as the vet's office.

, If you want to take your cat to the vet without a crate, you need to get him used to being in the car without his crate. If you get a cat as a kitten, it's much easier to introduce him to the car.


Kittens tend to adjust to new experiences much faster than adult cats. If possible, start training your cat to travel when he's less than a year old.If your cat is older, you can still train him to travel in the car safely. It just might take a little more time., Slow introductions work best, as a car can be a frightening environment for a cat. Introduce him to the car in intervals.


Bring your cat into the car when it's not running. Keep him calm and give him treats and attention as he adjust to a new environment. Spend a couple of weeks letting him explore the car in short intervals and familiarizing himself with this new territory., Once your cat is used to the car, you should transition into driving with him.


First, try turning on the engine and letting him get used to the noises it makes.After he's used to the engine, practice short drives. Even driving the car around the block is enough. As your cat adjust to being in the car, you can practice longer drives. It's a good idea to do a few test drives to the vet's office to get your cat used to the route before any appointments.Use positive reinforcement in the form of treats and praise throughout the process.

, Even the most calm cats can cause problems in the car if frightened. Alternatives to carriers, like bags or baskets, can be used to secure a cat so he does not cause problems for you driving. You can also have a harness or strap to safely secure him to the seat. You do not want your cat to crawl under your feet or the break/gas pedal while you're driving as this could easily cause an accident.

, If you do not have a car, you'll need to get your cat used to public transportation before you take him to the vet's office. You can practice short trips on a bus, train, or subway. However, understand the vast majority of public transportation options in a city require that your cat be contained in some kind of crate or bag. You probably cannot bring your cat on a subway, for example, with just a harness or in a basket without a lid. If that's how you plan to keep your cat secure at the vet's office, you might want to take a cab or ask a friend for a ride.

, Veterinarians and their staff generally dislike it when people bring cats into their offices without carriers. Understand you'll be met with some resistance if you make the decision to take your cat in without a crate.


Bringing your cat in without a carrier, especially if he's not secured in something like a sport's bag, puts a lot of unnecessary pressure on the staff. Workers in the waiting room have to take extra precautions to make sure your pet is safe and is not injured by dogs or other animals. Also be aware the clinic cannot guarantee your cat's safety when not in a box. For example, a dog off lead may enter the waiting area who likes to chase cats, and bounds at your cat, who may then get injured.Some vets may actually require cats to be in a carrier. You might want to call ahead and ask first before bringing your cat in without one., Carriers are recommended by veterinarians for a reason. Understand a carrier has several safety features important for your cat.


Carriers ensure a safe car ride by making sure your cat does not roam around the car, causing an accident by interfering with your driving.Cats are likely to run away when they're frightened. If your cat bolts out the car door, he might be difficult to find. Vet's offices are generally in areas where there area lot of cars. This could prove dangerous for your cat.Even if your cat is docile, you can't necessarily predict the behavior of other animals. Many dogs are not friendly with cats and your cat is better off secure inside a carrier if a dog gets aggressive., If you're mainly opposed to using a carrier due to worries over stress, there are measures you can take to make a carrier less stressful for your cat.


Do not just take the carrier out when it's time for a vet visit. Leave it open and out in the living room. Cats are den animals and they may actually enjoy sleeping in their carriers from time to time.Take your cat on short rides in his carrier now and again. A ride around the block in his carrier will make going to the vet less jarring.As with a sports bag, you can make a carrier more comfortable by putting treats, toys, and other items your cat enjoys inside the crate with him."

Check for symptoms.,
Consult with your veterinarian.",How to Treat Bladder Stones in Cats1," Certain cat breeds, such as Himalayans, have a genetic predisposition toward developing mineral deposits in the bladder.But other factors can cause bladder stones in any breed.


A diet high in acidity or calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus may cause mineral buildup.Decreased water consumption may lead to the concentration of minerals in the bladder.A urinary tract infection may lead to bladder stones.Certain medications and supplements, including Lasix, Cortisone, Ascorbic Acid, Tetracycline, and Sulfa drugs, may cause bladder stones when used over prolonged periods of time if the cat has a genetic tendency to do so.;
, It is important to be alert for signs that your cat may have uroliths. Common signs to look for include:


Straining or distress when urinating (dysuria)Bloody urine (hematuria)Frequent urination in small quantitiesExcessive genital lickingUrinating in unusual places

, Your vet will be able to diagnose bladder stones, and may be able to determine how severe the blockage is in your cat.


Report any unusual behavior or problems you've noticed in your cat.
Your vet may take an X Ray or conduct other tests, such as palpating your cat's abdomen, checking its urine, or taking an ultrasonography test.
If the cat has bladder stones, a stone, or group of stones, will be seen in the urinary bladder, or other parts of the urinary system such as the kidney, ureter, or urethra."

Add carpeting and cushions to your home.,
Purchase a litter box with an easy entrance and high sides.,
Make an accessible eating area.,
Use ramps and stairs to make elevated spots more accessible.,
Add bumpers to sharp furniture and corners.",How to Care for a Cerebellar Hypoplasia Cat1," Cats with CH are prone to falling because of their disability, so it is best to have carpeted surfaces in your home.It is also wise to install carpeting and cushions under elevated spots, so that your cat has a soft landing area.If you currently have slippery hardwood or other flooring, consider getting some carpets to make life easier for your cat.
Carpets are especially important for cats with moderate or severe CH.If your cat has only mild CH, carpeting is preferred but not absolutely necessary.;
, A litter box with high sides will offer your cat greater support. The entrance should be low and free of obstructions.If your cat has mild CH, you may be able to use a normal kitty litter box.If your cat has moderate CH, you should use a low entry litter box.
If your cat has severe CH, you may need to stabilize them while they use the litter box. If you don’t have time to hold them in the litter box, you may want to use puppy training pads.

, You want to use raised food and water dishes, so that your cat can eat without too much trouble.In addition, it is best to locate their eating area in an area of the house that can be easily cleaned since there will be frequent messes to clean up.Use soft dishes so that your cat is less likely to chip its teeth.
Elevated dishes will allow your cat to eat in a more relaxed manner and reduce stress on the spine and the digestive system.The dishes should be raised between four and six inches, depending on the height of your cat. The top of the dishes should align with your cat’s lower chest.
Look for elevated dishes that are not easily tipped over.

, Since cats with CH cannot typically jump, you could use ramps to make their elevated hiding spots more accessible. Make sure the ramps or stairs are covered in carpet so that your cat is less likely to slip.You might consider installing a ramp to your sofa.
If they like the view from a window, you might consider adding a ramp that allows them to access a windowsill.
You can find folding ramps that can be moved from one location to another.You can get ramps with scratching posts.
Cat ramps and stairs cost anywhere from $20 to $120.

, Since cats with CH often have a hard time navigating turns, you may want to add bumpers to soften the blow if they run into a piece of furniture. You can get foam bumpers from home hardware and furniture stores.If you have a low coffee table with sharp edges, you could put bumpers on the corners.
Bumpers are especially important for cats with moderate or severe CH.
Depending on the severity of the CH, you may want to install baby gates. For instance, you could place baby gates in front of stairways and garage doors.

Watch your cat's behavior.,
Examine the cat's tail for injury.,
Take your cat to the vet if you suspect a tail injury.,
Understand treatments.,
Allow your cat to rest in a quiet space.,
Monitor your cat's habits.,
Give your cat medication.,
Keep any wounds or incisions clean.,
Watch for infection.",How to Treat a Cat's Broken Tail," Your cat's changed behavior might be one of the first signs you notice that alerts you to a tail injury. Your cat may begin dragging his tail or keeping it low to the ground all the time, dribbling urine randomly, or having diarrhea. Your cat may begin walking unevenly or losing coordination in his back legs.Dribbling urine and having diarrhea are not symptoms of a broken tail on their own. If the tail injury was severe enough to cause these signs, the cat will definitely be dragging the tail.;
, Gently feel along the length of the tail. Signs of injury or break include tender, swollen or bent areas. If you notice redness, tenderness, and swelling with fluid underneath, there may be an abscess, or pocket of pus, forming on your cat’s tail. If there is exposed bone or if the skin has been stripped from the tail leaving only bone this is called a ‘degloving’ injury.If you happen to notice a hard, non-painful kink in your cat’s tail, it’s probably because he was born with the kink in the tail or it's an old, already healed injury.

Never pull or try to remove a severed portion of tail since there are tough tendons and sensitive nerves. If you pull or stretch the tendons, you'll damage the use of the tail, hind limbs, bladder and bowel functions. It may also cause arterial bleeding, which is difficult to control and potentially life-threatening for your cat.

, The vet can address the injury without additional damage to the tail. Your cat may need a partial or full amputation of his tail if he has a degloving injury, deep cut, or if his tail is deeply or mostly severed.Your vet can also prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection which is highly likely with any open wound. Even if there are no external wounds, the vet can check your cat for other injuries. The vet may find neurologic damage from the tail being pulled during the accident.The vet will examine the tail for signs of physical or neurological damage. If the vet suspects nerve damage, your cat may have an electromyogram test. Anal sphincter and tail muscles are tested for nerve input. This lets the vet know if the tail will be able to recover.
Your cat may still be in pain when you bring him to the vet's office. Stay close to him and speak in gentle comforting tones. You may want to loosely wrap your cat in a towel and place him in his carrier when you bring him to the vet's. This will calm him., Depending on where and how the tail is injured, your veterinarian will determine surgery or another treatment. If the tail is paralyzed, but your cat can still walk, the vet will probably amputate the tail. If the end of the tail has a break that's not causing problems for your cat, the vet may tell you to let it heal on its own.Your cat may need to stay at the veterinarian's for a few days to either rest and heal, or to determine the extent of the damage to the tail.
If your cat's tail must be amputated, don't worry. It may take him a while to adjust to the lack of nerve sensation and change in balance. But, your cat will adapt to the change and his mobility won't suffer in the long run., Keep the cat inside to let him rest and prevent further trauma to his injuries.Try putting your cat in a small room (like a bedroom, bathroom, or laundry room). This way, you can easily find him, check on the injury, and administer medications.


Cats that are sick or injured often prefer to be away from children, other pets and a lot of noise or activity.

, You'll need to pay attention to your cat’s appetite, water intake and litter box habits. Tail injuries can sometimes affect bladder or bowel functions. If your cat is leaking urine or feces or not urinating or defecating at all, he could have nerve damage affecting these functions.


If you notice these problems continuing, talk to your vet.The vet may need to test your cat's urine for infection and adjust any medications., It's easiest to remember if you give medications on a schedule. You'll probably need to give antibiotics to prevent infections for any open wounds. Only give pain medication if your vet instructs you and gives a prescription. Never give over-the-counter pain medications.


Many of these, like aspirin, or tylenol, are very dangerous to give to cats. They can have severe, even fatal, side effects in cats., Check the wound at least once a day. Your cat may soil himself with urine or feces since it may be too painful to lift his tail or if there's nerve damage. Sometimes wounds will have crusted blood, discharge, hair, litter, or other debris stuck to or around them. You may need to clean the wounds gently with lukewarm water or very diluted betadine or chlorhexidine solutions, and some gauze or a washcloth. Tail wounds usually don't need to be bandaged.


Don't use soap and peroxide since they're irritating and damaging to tissues. If you see dry scabs, remember that they're good and don't scrub or pull them off.

, Whether or not you take your cat to the vet you will want to monitor the injury (or surgery) site very carefully. Don't let your cat lick any wounds. While there are some compounds in saliva that can help heal wounds, excessive licking can irritate the skin and bacteria from the mouth can cause serious infections.Signs of infected wounds are redness, warmth, swelling, and discharge that is white, green or yellow in color.


You may want to keep an Elizabethan type collar on your cat to keep him from licking the injury. It could take up to 2-3 weeks for a tail fracture to heal, depending on the severity of the injury. Note that it may not heal perfectly, leaving a kink in the tail, but there should be no pain. All open wounds should also close up.

Act fast.,
Consider your options.,
Prepare your cat for surgery.,
Provide post-surgical care.",How to Treat Bladder Stones in Cats2," If your cat is suffering from bladder stones, time may be of the essence. Stones have been shown to grow to problematic sizes in as little as two weeks.Bladder stone growth may lead to severe pain, vomiting, and depression.If a blocked ureter is not diagnosed and treated quickly, the blocked kidney may become irreversibly damaged., Depending on the severity and location of your cat's bladder stones, your veterinarian may recommend something as simple as a change in diet, or a major surgical procedure.


Your vet may prescribe a special diet that will dissolve mineral deposits in your cat and alter its pH to prevent future deposits.Your vet may flush your cat's bladder. This involves the use of a catheter to remove deposits and any residual sediment.Your vet may perform a cystostomy, in which the bladder is surgically opened and the mineral deposits physically removed.Your vet may recommend a perineal urethrotomy, in which the urethra is surgically widened.

, If your veterinarian recommends surgery as the best option to remove a severe bladder stone, there are several steps you may need to take to prepare it for surgery.


Have your cat fast before receiving anesthesia. Any time an animal is anesthetized, there is a risk that, if vomiting occurs, it may be inhaled into the lungs. The best way to prevent this is to keep your pet from eating any food prior to the scheduled procedure. Fast times may vary, depending on your cat's age and size, and the specific anesthesia being used on your cat. Consult with your veterinarian to determine how long your cat should fast prior to surgery.Keep your cat hydrated. Unless your vet advises otherwise, you should be able to give your cat water overnight until the morning of the procedure.If your cat requires daily medication, ask your veterinarian whether or not to administer those medications prior to surgery.

, If your cat has undergone surgery, your vet will provide you with the information you need to care for your cat after its surgery. This will probably include giving your cat medication regularly, and may call for more frequent veterinary check-ups.


Your vet may want to send the stones away for analysis in a laboratory. Knowing the precise mineral content of the stones can make it easier to determine the appropriate prevention methods, including prescription medication to prevent the formation of future bladder stones."
"
Change your cat's diet.,
Give your cat plenty of fresh water.,
Go for regularly-scheduled follow-up visits.",How to Treat Bladder Stones in Cats3," While animal experts are not completely certain why bladder stones form, they have noticed an increase in one particular type of stone, calcium oxalate, in recent years.There are many different types of mineral stones. The type depends on the minerals from which they are formed. Your veterinarian will send the stone away for analysis and from that recommend a diet low in the minerals from which your cat's stone was built.


Choose the diet appropriate for your cat's urolith type. For example, for oxalate stones try a non-acidifying diet diet with low- to moderate-levels of calcium, as well as magnesium and citrate components. This type of diet can help reduce urinary calcium and may prevent buildup of calcium oxalate.
Use canned food instead of dry food. The extra water content found in canned cat food may help dilute urine and prevent the buildup of minerals., Cats generally prefer fresh water, and may not drink water that has been out for several days.Empty and refill your cat's water bowl every day. This will also help you monitor how much water your cat is drinking.

, Your veterinarian may recommend that you bring your cat back for urinalysis and urine cultures periodically in the months that follow a bladder stone procedure.Keeping regular vet appointments can help ensure that your cat has a full recovery and does not have a repeat incidence.

Purchase a cat wheelchair or cart.,
Introduce your cat to the wheelchair.,
Put your cat in the wheelchair for progressively longer periods.",How to Care for a Cerebellar Hypoplasia Cat2," If your cat’s CH is severe, a cat cart or wheelchair can help improve their quality of life, as well as improve muscle development and mobility.You can purchase adjustable pet wheelchairs or carts for your cat with CH.

Cat wheelchairs can be found at some pet stores, as well as online specialty retailers with a focus on pets with mobility challenges.Consult with your veterinarian about the purchase of a cat wheelchair.You can also make their own cat wheelchair with PVC piping, fabric and cart wheels., Prior to putting your cat in the wheelchair or cart, you want to inspire curiosity and create a feeling of comfort around it. You want to create a positive association with the wheelchair. Try keeping it around when you have playtime with your cat, so that it has positive associations., Put your cat in the wheelchair for a few minutes. Let your cat explore with the new device. Then, slowly build up the amount of time that your cat spends in the wheelchair.You can use toys to encourage your cat to move around in the wheelchair.
You should block stairways so that your cat doesn’t fall down the stairs in the wheelchair.Remove obstacles in your house so that your cat doesn’t get stuck in the wheelchair.

Keep your cat inside.,
Play with your cat.,
Take care of your cat’s claws.",How to Care for a Cerebellar Hypoplasia Cat3," Since cats with CH have a hard time getting around and could easily fall or get stuck, you should avoid letting them outside. In comparison to cats without a mobility impairment, they are also more vulnerable to predators., Cats are hunters and need to express their natural instincts. They also need regular exercise in order to stay healthy and reduce the risk of illness.Cats with CH also require regular exercise and play, so you should make time to play with them every day.For cats with CH, play can help increase their confidence.

In order to gather the most accurate data, your cat should remain at home for the duration of the Holter monitor’s operation., When your cat starts wearing the Holter monitor, begin an activity log. Include what the cat is doing and the time. This will help the vet match the Holter monitor data to a particular activity as recorded in your activity log., After 24-48 hours, the Holter monitor will have collected enough data for the veterinarian to analyze.

Head shaking
Gagging
Salivation
Difficulty swallowing or breathing
Bad breath
Pawing at the face and mouth
Coughing
Retching

, In most instances a foreign body, such as a blade of grass or a piece of a stick, will enter your cat while they are smelling or chewing these objects. Keep a close eye on your cat while it is playing outside. This way you will have a better indication of what might be the problem if your cat starts to develop symptoms., If you notice any common symptoms associated with a respiratory foreign body, or you believe your cat may have ingested a foreign object, you should take your cat to the vet immediately. If left untreated, a foreign body in the respiratory system could cause an infection or lead to chronic lung disease. In some cases the foreign object may travel through the body, causing severe complications and even death.Your vet will need to run a number of tests in order to rule out other possible illnesses and to find the exact location of the foreign object.

, Your vet will likely need to administer a number of examinations in order to determine the exact location of the foreign object. An examination can also provide your vet with more detailed information concerning the type of object that has been lodged in the respiratory system. Your vet may administer any of the following tests:A complete blood count (CBC), biochemical profile, and urinalysis.
An x-ray of the throat and chest.
Skull/nasal radiographs.
A scope may be used to evaluate the nasal cavity, trachea, and bronchi.
A CT Scan or MRI may be useful in some cases.

, This is often done by administering a local anesthetic and then reaching in and grabbing the object from the throat or nasal cavity. This type of removal is only possible if the object is visible and easily accessible.In some cases, you may be able to do this without the help of a vet, if you are able to see the object and are certain you can remove it completely and without causing any damage to the nasal passage. It is safest to let the vet do any removal, however.

, Your vet may be able to encourage the foreign object to dislodge itself, by flushing the respiratory tract. A lubricant will be flushed through the respiratory tract in the hope of dislodging and washing out the foreign object., To remove a foreign body using a scope, the vet will place a tube into the cat’s nasal cavity or throat and pull out the object. Typically the object will be removed using forceps or a balloon catheter.If the lodged object is sharp, a protective tube can be placed down the cat’s throat to protect the esophagus while the object is retrieved.

, In severe cases, the foreign object may be lodged deep within your cat’s internal respiratory system. In these instances, the vet may need to complete a surgery to remove the object. Your vet may use a local anesthetic or full anesthesia, depending on the location and invasiveness of the procedure.This type of surgery is relatively common and safe, and has a 93% recovery rate., Although cats generally recover quickly from removal procedures, it is still a good idea to schedule a follow-up appointment with your vet. During this appointment your vet will check to make sure that your cat is not suffering from any lingering pain or infection as a result of the lodged object or removal procedure., Your vet may notice that the foreign body has caused a secondary infection. This happens if the foreign body contained bacteria that was spread to the cat. If this is the case, your vet will prescribe antibiotics to help treat the secondary infection.Follow all instructions provided by your vet for administering the antibiotic.

, If your vet suspects that your cat is still experiencing residual pain as a result of the foreign object removal, they may prescribe pain medication during the follow-up appointment. It is very important that you follow of the instructions provided by the vet when administering medication.For example, your vet may prescribe a corticosteroid, such as methylprednisolone., Giving your cat wet food can also alleviate pain following this procedure. This type of food is typically softer and will be less irritating if your cat experienced a foreign body lodged in the throat. Talk with your vet to see if this is a suitable option for your cat."

Use a stationary electrocardiography device with sick cats.,
Keep your cat away from electric devices that could interrupt the Holter monitor’s signal.,
Do not let your cat get wet.",How to Care for a Cat with a Holter Monitor2," If your cat is sick, your vet might recommend the use of cage confinement combined with a stationary (non-ambulatory) electrocardiography device placed near the cage instead of equipping your cat with a Holter monitor. This will prevent your sick cat from experiencing an additional rise in stress levels. This might be especially appropriate for cats demonstrating signs of cardiac decompensation., Most electronic devices will not disrupt the Holter monitor. However, certain appliances or devices could cause the device to malfunction. Your vet will give you more specific instructions regarding your specific Holter monitor, but a partial list of devices that could potentially disrupt it includes:electric toothbrushes and razors
electric blankets
microwaves
magnets
MP3 players
cellphones

, Typically, this won’t be a problem, as most cats do not like swimming, and do not need baths.However, be sure to keep your cat from getting wet, since the water can damage the sensitive electronics within the Holter monitor."

Ask about the cats' personalities.,
Discuss where the cat came from.,
Look for cats that are okay in the shelter environment.,
Skip the kittens.",How to Choose a Kid Friendly Cat1," The staff has been around the cats, and they know what each one's strengths are. Discuss what you're wanting with a staff member, and they may be able to point you towards a cat who will be perfect for your family.For instance, you could say, ""I'm looking for a very friendly, laid-back cat. I have small kids, and the cat would need to be pretty tolerant. Which cats fit that description?""
Alternatively, you could narrow your choices down, and then say, ""Can you tell me some about this cat's personality?"";
, Knowing a cat's background can tell you how they'll do in your family. Of course, the background of every cat at a shelter isn't known, but many come from families who couldn't keep them. Certain cats may be used to being around kids already.For instance, a cat that lived with a family before is more likely to be okay in your home. However, you can ask, ""Can you tell me what you know about this cat's background? I'm looking for a family cat. Do you know why the family gave this cat up?"" Sometimes, the family may have had no choice but to give up the cat, as it is often due to unforeseen circumstances, such as having to move overseas.
However, if a cat lived in a single-pet household with an older person, they may not adjust well to living with a family with kids.

, A home with kids tends to be loud and busy. Often, shelters are the same way with so many pets and people coming through. Therefore, a cat that seems happy and engaged in the shelter may fit in well in a loud home environment., While kittens are adorable, you don't really know what you're getting with a kitten, though you do have more of a chance to mold their personality. However, kittens are not a good option with small children, as they are delicate, and kids may not be as gentle as they need to be with them."

Before shopping for a new houseplant, research common plants that are not toxic to cats, so that you can focus on bringing safe plants into your home. If you have your eye on a plant that you are unsure of, take the time to research it before bringing it home.


There are extensive lists of toxic and non-toxic plants on the websites of organizations that focus on the humane treatment of animals, such as the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals).
If you know the name of a plant you are considering buying, simply do an internet search for the name of the plant and the words ""toxic cats."" This should give you appropriate results to read through.;
, If you take the time to become familiar with some common plants that are not toxic to cats, you can be more comfortable bringing plants into your home. It is especially helpful if you are gifted a plant, so you know immediately that it won't be hazardous to your cat. Some common houseplants that are safe for cats include:African violets
Air plants
Orchids
Ferns
Spider plants
Palms
Christmas cactus

, There are some plants that are very toxic to cats and are commonly found in homes. Do an online search and find lists of plants that are toxic to cats.

Chrysanthemum
Calla lily
English ivy
Oleander
Anthurium
Philodendron
Spathiphyllum

, If you are bringing a cat into a home that has houseplants, you should make sure that none of your existing houseplants are toxic to cats. This can be hard to do if you are not sure what type of plants you have. Spend some time identifying what you have so that your cat is safe in its new home.


If you cannot identify a specific plant, you may want to consider rehoming it. It is better to be safe than sorry when it comes to houseplants and cats.

, There are some plants that can be grown for cats to chew on and enjoy. If you like having houseplants and you want your cat to have one of its very own, choose cat grass. Cat grass, which is a small grass that many cats love chomping on, is usually a mix of rye, barley, oat, or wheat grass which grows very easily indoors.Growing cat grass in your home can help you to keep your cat out of other houseplants, as it will focus its attention on the grass.Buy plants specifically marked as ""cat grass"" or get seeds marked that way from your local pet store. This will help ensure that the grass you are growing is safe for cats.
You can also grow catnip indoors, however it can cause some cats to get a bit wild. If you want to let your cat have it, grow it for them.

Try to set aside some time every day to watch your cat. You may want to do this when your cat is more likely to behave poorly, like at meal time or when you have company.;
, Before beginning a counterconditioning regimen, you’ll need to accurately identify a proper course of action. To do this, you need to consider what is causing the cat to behave in an undesirable way. Most negative cat behavior manifests because of:

Fear
Aggression
Territorial problems, After you’ve watched your cat and identified issues you’d like to work on, you should write down and rank the goals of your counterconditioning program. Without ranking goals, you may not work on behaviors in a logical fashion.

Consider what behaviors or problems are linked together. These should be ranked accordingly. For example, if your cat has food aggression and also appears territorial, you’ll need to work on these issues together., By working on less severe issues, you’ll be able to phase the cat into a counterconditioning program that eventually focuses on the most problematic or severe issues.

Do things the cat is most comfortable with. For example, if a cat doesn’t like to be handled by people, but does favor some people, employ those people to get your cat used to being handled. Don’t have people the cat doesn’t favor handle it first., Whenever your cat engages in behavior that is desirable, you should reward it with a treat. By rewarding your cat with a treat, you’ll set the expectation that certain behavior is desirable. As a result, the cat will be more likely to engage in behavior that earns it a reward.

Give the cat their favorite snack when they engage in a behavior that is pleasing to you.
Work the cat into expecting a reward for good behavior. For example, if you’re working with a cat that doesn’t like to be handled, work toward the cat walking over and sitting in your lap to get a treat.
Make sure not to overfeed your cat., Almost all rewards should be paired with positive verbal reinforcement. By creating several levels of positive reinforcement, you’ll help countercondition the cat quicker. In addition, the cat will more easily associate positive verbal cue with other aspects of its counterconditioning training.

Start with the cat’s name, if they don’t know it already.
Employ simple words like “yes,” “good,” or “hold.”
Pair verbal reinforcement with food rewards. For example, say “good” when you give your cat a treat.
Verbal reinforcement is not as useful with cats as it is with dogs., In addition to verbal reinforcement, you may need to offer physical reinforcement. While this may not work for all cats, some cats may benefit from a pat on the back or a friendly pet on the head.

Use touching along with food rewards. For example, if the cat doesn’t like physical contact, pet the cat lightly after they’ve come to you expecting a treat.
Use verbal reinforcement whenever you use physical reinforcement. By repeating phrases like “good cat” while petting the cat, you’ll be conditioning the cat to a certain behavior.
Avoid physical contact if the cat seems averse to it. Make sure you’ve made progress on other parts of your counterconditioning regimen, first., Before you start any conditioning program, you need to make sure that the space you conduct it in is a calm space that is conducive to training. If it’s not, your cat may be distracted, stressed, or anxious.

Remove other pets or small children from the room. If for some reason they are necessary, make sure you control interaction as much as possible. For instance, create separate spaces for the cat in question and others in the room.
Turn off music, television, and other distractions., The most effective counterconditioning goes beyond planned training time. To be effective, you need to make sure you include it your daily regimen. This way, you can constantly reinforce the behavior you want.

Use positive verbal cues.
Reward positive behavior daily., Negative reinforcement may undermine your counterconditioning program by making your cat fearful or anxious. As a result, try to limit negative reinforcement to only the most necessary circumstances.

If the cat is destructive, you may need to use verbal cues like “no” or even employ a spray bottle to send the signal that the cat should not destroy an item.
Negative reinforcement rarely works when trying to get a cat to overcome fear of contact with humans., Perhaps the most important thing to do when counterconditioning a cat is to go as slow as you need. If your training is rushed, the cat will feel anxiety and may not result positively to your efforts.

Set aside regular time every day to conduct explicit counterconditioning training. This could be as little as 10 minutes or as long as an hour.
Create a schedule based on realistic expectations. For example, don’t expect to eliminate territorial behavior over the course of a week or even a month. The process may take months or even longer."

Pick an adult cat if you have a busy schedule.,
Consider veterinary care.",How to Choose Between Getting a Kitten or Adult Cat," Although an adult cat is in many ways easier than a kitten, there is nothing that beats the level of playfulness and entertainment value offered by a new kitten. Tumbling, rollicking, silly kittens may offer you and your family hours of entertainment.If you decide on a kitten, remember that they should be between nine and twelve weeks of age before you adopt them. In order to socialize properly, kittens need lots of time with their mother.;
, When you buy or adopt an adult cat, what you see on day one is more or less the cat you will end up with. In contrast, kittens may change in any number of ways, such as hair color, temperament and level of sociability. With an adult cat, you at least know what you are getting. On the other hand, with a kitten, you have a chance to witness and help shape their development and personality., Kittens can be playfully annoying. They often knock over cups of juice or wine and otherwise make a mess. Although kittens can be adorable, this kind of behavior can get really annoying. On the other hand, an adult cat will be more calm and collected., If you take a look at your home from a kitten’s perspective, you may notice all kinds of things that could hurt them, such as electrical cords. You may also notice things they could easily break, such as fragile pots. If the thought of kitten-proofing your home is formidable, you may want to get an adult cat instead., If everyone in your family is away from home during the day, it may be difficult to devote enough time and energy towards training a kitten. As such, an adult cat may be a better choice if you are a working family., By pairing a kitten with your adult cat, your adult cat may feel less threatened by the new pet in your home. Whereas adult cats can get quite threatened and territorial with the introduction of a new adult cat into the household, they are often more accepting of kittens, who are less of a threat.If you really want a second adult cat, choose a second adult cat that is very laid back and similar in personality and physical stature., Toddlers tend to be a bit hard on kittens, often grabbing their tale or fur in a rough manner. In this sense, it might make more sense to get an adult cat. Regardless of your decision, you should teach your toddler how to safely and respectfully play with the cat or kitten.If you have children and want a kitten, you can train your kids to interact in a respectful manner with the kitten.

, There are few better ways of spending your time than with a kitten, whose love and affection will continue to pay dividends for many years to come.It is important to keep in mind that kittens are at a crucial stage of learning that will shape their entire adult lives. As such, you need to devote time to teaching your new kitten how to be well-behaved and sociable around other animals and humans in your home.

, Your schedule may be a factor in this decision, since adult cats require less of a time commitment. If you are very busy at work or with other personal commitments, an adult cat may be a wise choice., Veterinary care can be expensive for the first year, if you choose a kitten. On the other hand, if you choose an adult cat, they may have their vaccinations done and already be declawed. If it is an older cat, however, veterinary costs could get expensive.Kittens need several vaccinations and examinations during their first year, such as fecal exams and calicivirus vaccinations.If you get a kitten, consider the expensive first-year veterinary costs, which range from $491, on the low end, to $3,125, on the high end.If you get an adult cat, yearly veterinary costs range from $310, on the low end, to $1,169, on the high end."

Consider a prescription diet.,
Discuss the best protein and nutrient sources with your veterinarian if you plan to use a home-prepared diet.,
Provide foods that your cat likes.,
Give your cat phosphate binders.,
Make sure your cat drinks plenty of water.",How to Care for a Cat with Kidney Failure1," If your cat has kidney failure, talk to your veterinarian. He or she may prescribe a special renal diet that contains restricted amounts of high-quality protein and minimal amounts of phosphate and certain minerals. Protein, phosphate, and minerals are very difficult for the kidney to filter, so prescription diets that restrict these substances place less strain on the organ.


Studies show that phosphate can also cause scar tissue to build up on the kidney, so it is doubly important to restrict phosphate in your cat’s diet.;
, Veterinarians used to suggest relying primarily on white meats – chicken, turkey, and white fish – because they are easier to digest and place less strain on the kidney than other foods. However, a cat with kidney failure still needs to consume a balanced diet, including good sources of vitamins and certain minerals – especially calcium, which is essential for the heart, bones, and eyes. Your veterinarian may therefore recommend a more balanced mix of foods.


Over time, a diet made up only of white meat may cause your cat to develop swollen joints, fragile bones, failing vision, or heart failure.

, The most important thing, for a cat with kidney failure, is to make sure it eats something. Some cats will starve themselves if they don’t like the food they are offered; there’s no point, then, in providing a prescription or home-prepared renal diet that remains uneaten. It’s better to compromise and give your cat something appealing to eat.


If your cat won't eat, it may develop a form of liver failure called hepatic lipidosis, which is just as dangerous as kidney failure. Talk to your veterinarian if you think this may be a concern.
If your cat has a poor appetite (a common symptom of kidney failure), try hand feeding – many cats will start eating if offered food straight from their owners’ fingertips.
Alternatively, try dabbing a spot of food on your cat’s whiskers, so that it grooms the food off and gets the flavor in its mouth. Doing so can sometimes encourage a cat to eat.
You can also try warming the food in the microwave so that it has a slightly stronger aroma and a more appealing temperature. Some cats will refuse cold food but eat if you warm it up.

, Phosphate binders cling to the phosphate in food, so that it remains in the digestive tract rather than crossing into the blood. Feeding your cat a phosphate binder will therefore lower its blood phosphate levels and slow the rate of scar tissue formation in the kidney. Talk to your veterinarian about the best phosphate binder for you cat. One of the most common, Renalzin, comes in a paste; you simply mix it with your cat’s food, and it starts working with the first mouthful.


For most cats, one pump of Renalzin, twice a day, is the optimal dose. If you have a larger cat and serve it bigger portions, your veterinarian may recommend two pumps of Renalzin, twice a day.

, A diseased kidney loses its ability to retain water and begins to produce weak urine. This loss of fluid must be replaced, so make sure your cat drinks lots of water.


If your cat likes to drink from running water, consider purchasing a cat drinking fountain. Otherwise, try serving water in a very wide bowl; some cats seem not to like their whiskers to touch the edge of a dish.

See which cats try to get your attention.,
Spend time alone with the cat.,
Try the pet test.,
Pick the cat up.,
Bring the kids.",How to Choose a Kid Friendly Cat2," Walk through the shelter, giving all the cats a good look. Watch to see if any of the cats try to follow you or look especially interested in getting to know you. An engaged, curious cat is more likely to do better in a family than one who's not.However, don't rule out the nappers. A cat sleeps up to 16 hours each day, so the perfect cat may be conked out in the corner.

, If the shelter has an area to do it, sit down on the floor with the cat. Give it a chance to warm up to you. Don't drag it over to you. Let it investigate you and come over. Hold out your hand for it to smell, so it gets a chance to learn about you., Once you've narrowed down your options, try petting the cats you've picked out. Of course, the cat will likely be wary at first, but a cat that reacts aggressively to being petted (such as biting or hissing) likely isn't a good one for a family home., If the cat seemed okay with the pet test, try picking it up. Most cats will be a little nervous, but if the cat accepts being picked up without too much animosity, that means it is likely fine with being handled. That's a good personality trait to have in family cat., Once you've decided on a good option, have the kids come meet the cat. If the cat is aggressive towards the kids, obviously you don't want to bring that cat home. If the cat seems interested but a little cautious, that cat will likely be okay. If the cat is very interested and asks for attention from your kids, that cat is likely a great choice.


Prep your kids before entering the shelter. No cat is going to take kindly to being pounced upon by a whole gaggle of kids or having its tail pulled. Tell your kids they need to be quiet and gentle, as well as let the cat approach them.

Look at the Manx.",How to Choose a Kid Friendly Cat3," These cats are longhaired and very laid back. They love attention and are curious.They also enjoy playing when the opportunity arises, so they are great at keeping your kids entertained. They need to be groomed often because of their long fur.These cats do tend to be on the large side, averaging 9 to 18 pounds., Another longhaired cat option is the Persian. Persians are similar to Maine Coons in that they are gentle, sweet cats. They also need regular grooming, but they do very well with families., The American Shorthair is the classic American domestic cat. These cats are usually very sweet cats. The are also very laid back and gentle, perfect for a family with kids. They do need regular grooming., Burmese cats love their families and want to be around them. They are also very tolerant of kids' rambunctious behavior.They are also curious and energetic, so they'll enjoy playtime with your kids., Bombay cats look like tiny black panthers, which was the original breeder's intention. However, they are also love attention and won't be shy around your family. They are very smart, so your kids may be able to teach them tricks, like walking on a leash or playing fetch., These cats are also gentle giants, much like the Maine Coon. They also have long hair, but it doesn't need to be groomed quite as much as the Maine Coon or Persian. They also are usually okay with being handled; in fact, their name comes from the fact that they let their bodies go limp when picked up.These cats tend to be calmer than other breeds. They'll enjoy hanging out with your kids while they're reading or watching a movie., A Birman is a good option for you if you don't want a cat who's crying for attention all the time. They enjoy affection, but they are also independent. They are rarely cross, and they are usually great with kids., Manx cats can be shorthaired or longhaired. They sometimes do not have a tail. These cats are easy-going, and they get along well with families. However, they may bond the most with a single person in the family."

Place plants out of reach.,
Move plants that are of special interest.,
Train your cat to leave plants alone.,
Make sure your plants aren't an injury hazard for your cat.",How to Choose Safe Houseplants when You Have a Cat2," If you want to keep your cat from digging in a potted plant or chewing on its leaves, you will need to move it out of reach. While this can be difficult to do with cats, it is possible. One of the best ways to place a plant out of reach is to hang it from the ceiling in an area that doesn't allow the cat to get up to it. You can also place plants on window sills or shelves that the cat cannot access.


Plants can be hung from the ceiling relativity easily. You will need to install a hook in the ceiling that can hold the weight of the plant. Then place the plant in a hanging pot which can be hung from the hook.
If you are hoping to place a toxic plant out of reach of your cat, remember that they can still drop leaves when they are hung, which can endanger your cat.

, If your cat is obsessed with a particular plant, you will likely need to move it out of the cat's area to keep it undisturbed and alive. If there is an area of your home that your cat doesn't go in, move the plant there.


If your cat currently has full reign of your home, you may need to make an area off limits to save your plant.

, There are some cats that can be trained to leave plants alone. If you have trained your cat in the past, it's worth a try to keep it out of your houseplants.


Training your cat should not involve physically or verbally punishing the cat. Instead, you should use positive reinforcement for good behavior and correction for behavior that you don't want occurring., When relocating your plants to keep them away from your cat, make sure that they don't actually pose a new threat to it. It is important to place plants so that they can't fall and cause injury, if the cat does find a way to get to them. For instance, a large floor plant could tip over onto the cat, or a plant could fall onto the cat from a tabletop or shelf if it is not placed in a completely isolated location.


It is especially important to think about the physical risk to your cat if it is very interesting in playing with the plants.

"
Give your cat antacid medications.,
Supplement with B vitamins.,
Consider stimulating your cat’s appetite with medication.,
Medicate with ACE inhibitors.",How to Care for a Cat with Kidney Failure2," Cats with failing kidneys tend to develop inflamed stomach linings, which causes heartburn and, in some cases, gastric ulcers. To provide some relief and encourage your cat’s appetite, your veterinarian may recommend antacids. The typical prescription is omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor that is extremely effective at reducing gastric acid secretion. Smaller cats usually get 1 mg/kg by mouth once a day; larger cats usually take half a 10 mg tablet once a day.


If you do not have a prescription for omeprazole, you can also try famotidine, which is sold over the counter as Pepcid. Pepcid blocks histamine-induced gastric acid production. Unfortunately, dosing can be difficult. Larger cats typically need a quarter of a 20 mg tablet, but smaller cats usually need an eighth of a tablet, which can be impractical.

, B vitamins are important for digestive health and a good appetite. This group of vitamins is water soluble, so your cat’s increased thirst may wash them away too quickly into the urine. Your veterinarian may therefore recommend a course of injections – usually one injection a week for four weeks – to keep sufficient B vitamins in your cat’s blood.

, If your cat has no appetite – even if you’ve given antacids and made sure there’s no problem with dehydration – you may need to provide an appetite stimulant. Ask your veterinarian about a low dose of intravenous diazepam, which sometimes gets cats to eat. Another possibility is Periactin, an antihistamine that has appetite-stimulating side effects. The usual dose is 0/1-0.5 mg/kg twice per day. Larger cats may require half a tablet, twice a day.

, When given in the early stages of kidney disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) can prolong the life of the kidney. These drugs change the blood flow through the kidney and lower the pressure gradient so that less damage is inflicted on the micro circulation within the kidney. A common prescription is a 2.5 mg tablet of Fortekor once daily. Talk to your veterinarian about the best option for your cat.


Note that ACE inhibitors will not cure kidney disease; they will simply protect your cat’s kidney from some wear and tear. These drugs are not effective in advanced kidney disease.

"
"
Understand the problems associated with hypertension.,
Check your cat's blood pressure regularly.,
Watch for urinary infections.",How to Care for a Cat with Kidney Failure3," Cats with failing kidneys tend to have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension). This problem places them at greater risk of throwing blood clots and having strokes. In addition, hypertension can cause fluid to accumulate between the retina and the back of the eye, causing retinal detachment and sudden blindness.

, Because hypertension is such an issue, you should make sure that your veterinarian checks your cat’s blood pressure regularly.


If your cat's blood pressure is slightly high, an ACE inhibitor may reduce it by as much as 10%.
If the hypertension is more severe, your veterinarian may recommend an antihypertensive medication, such as amlodipine. The average dose is 0.625-1.25 mg once per day – this is about an eighth of a 5 mg tablet.

, Because cats with failing kidneys have weaker urine, they are more prone to urinary infections. Lower-grade infections may produce no symptoms, but they still need to be treated because bacteria can travel from the bladder into the kidney, contributing to renal damage.


Your veterinarian should perform a urine culture at least twice a year in order to identify infections. He or she may prescribe antibiotics if the culture turns up positive.

Get flea shampoo if your cat has fleas.,
Consider a special shampoo for skin issues.,
Try medicated shampoos for skin irritation.",How to Choose Shampoo and Conditioner for Your Cat1," It is important that you choose a cat shampoo that is made specifically for cats. Don’t use human shampoo or dog shampoo on your cat. Shampoos not made for cats can dry out their skin.Human shampoo could also hurt your cat if they groom their fur and the human shampoo has chemicals that are toxic to a cat.
Human shampoos may also contain harmful dyes and chemicals that can irritate or hurt your cat's skin.;
, Look for products that have simple ingredients you recognize. This is important because cats groom themselves all the time, which means they will be licking and ingesting whatever is on their coats. You can avoid problems if you know exactly what’s in the shampoo.


Don’t put stock in labels like “natural” and “organic.” They don’t mean much. Lots of perfectly “natural” ingredients like tea tree oil are toxic to cats and can make them very sick.Also remember that just because a shampoo claims it is all-natural doesn’t mean it doesn't contain chemicals. Read the label to double check.
There are certain instances, like if your cat has a bad case of fleas, that may require shampoos with chemicals. However, talk to your vet before choosing one of these shampoos.

, Whenever you buy any shampoo, make sure to read the label. There are certain chemicals you should avoid. These chemicals may even show up in products labelled as ""natural"" or ""organic."" Don’t buy cat shampoos that contain artificial dyes, parabens, sulfates, or petrochemicals.


Make sure to read the label before purchasing your cat shampoo.

, If your cat has fleas and ticks, you can bathe them with a flea and tick shampoo. This can help reduce allergic reactions to bites and kill the fleas on your cat’s body. You can’t use a flea shampoo on kittens that are under six weeks old.Flea shampoos are a temporary solution. They get rid of living fleas but do not kill eggs, so they won’t help prevent future outbreaks. There are lots of effective options – talk to your vet about flea other prevention methods.
Be sure to use flea shampoo designed for cats. Flea shampoos made for dogs can have ingredients that are harmful to cats, even if “natural.”

, If your cat has itchy skin, dandruff, irritated skin, or sensitive skin, find a shampoo made to treat these issues. Some shampoos contain ingredients to help soothe your cat’s skin problem., If your cat suffers from skin irritation and allergic reactions, you may want to try a medicated shampoo. These shampoos can work to reduce inflammation and redness, along with decreasing the itching.Be careful when it comes to ingredients. We often think things like aloe vera, tea tree oil, or chamomile oil as good for soothing skin. But these can actually be toxic for cats.If your cat has badly irritated skin, it may have a serious medical issue. Consider talking to a vet about your cat’s skin and how to treat the problem.

Since cats self-groom (i.e. lick their fur), they can end up ingesting this and getting sick. Only use coat conditioners that are made specifically for cats., For the most part, cats don't need to use separate conditioners. However, if your cat has dandruff, dry skin, or a brittle coat, a dandruff shampoo may help. This product contains oils and other conditioning agents that will help make the coat softer and add moisture., You don’t need to use conditioners on short-haired cats. Conditioners are made specifically for cats that have a medium or long coat. They help keep the coat silky, shiny, soft, and free of tangles., If you have a cat with a long coat you'd like to look shinier or silkier, then you can use a leave-in conditioner. To use this product, you spread a small amount of the leave-in conditioner over the coat. Don't rinse it off, but let it soak into the coat., Some cat shampoo brands sell formulas that contain both shampoo and conditioner. This may be a good choice if you want to condition your cat's coat at the same time you bathe them.A combination formula may help make your cat's fur softer and shinier, help with dry skin, or moisturize a dry, brittle coat.

You don’t have to get your cat wet and can apply directly to a dry coat. Just use the pump to apply the foam directly onto the cat’s fur. Massage the foam into their coat all over their body, making sure to avoid their eyes.Let the foam dry and then brush their coat.
Read the directions and follow carefully.

, Powder is another type of waterless cat shampoo. Powders can soak up oils and grease on longer coats. To use powders, sprinkle it over your cat, making sure you don’t get it in the eyes. Massage the powder into the coat all over their body. Then, brush the coat until the powder is absorbed.Wash your hands afterwards. You may want to use gloves and apply it outside.
Read the directions and follow carefully.
Since cats will try to groom off shampoo and condition, always be sure to choose a kind that is made specially for cats.

However, long-haired breeds may need to be bathed more regularly than short-haired cats due to the length of their fur.This long and silky hair can become greasy if they do not get bathed enough.

, Even if you want to bathe your cat regularly, make sure you don’t bathe them too much. Bathing your cat too often can remove all their natural skin oils, which keeps their coats healthy.At the most, you should only bathe your cat once each week.

, Sometimes, wiping your cat with a wet cloth or cat wipe may be a better option that bathing them. However, if your cat got into mud or dirt, or if they are have fleas or dandruff, you may need to bathe them. Older cats that have mobility problems may also need bathing more often.Some cats can develop skin issues that lead to unpleasant odors or skin irritation that may need to be taken care of by bathing.

, If your cat needs bathing often due to certain problems, like allergies or odors, take them to the vet. Your vet may recommend certain types of shampoos specifically for your cat’s problems that won’t dry out or irritate their skin."

While your cat may not appreciate a birthday cake loaded with sugar, you can make a cake using meat, treats, and other things cats enjoy.Buy a can of pate-style cat food at the supermarket. Choose a brand and flavor your cat loves, but one that's solid enough to hold a shape. Open the container, turn it upside down, and let it slide onto a plate so it stays in a cake-like shape.
Decorate the cake with other treats your cat likes. You could top it off with some slices of turkey, or you could sprinkle your cat's favorite kibble or treats over the cake.

, Your cat will love having special foods and snacks for its birthday. If you're having people over as well, make sure to provide food and snacks for these guests as well. Think about cute, cat-themed snacks you could offer guests.See if you can find any special treats at a local pet store. You could also put out small amounts of meats like tuna and poultry, which your cat is sure to enjoy.
If you have people over, you can provide small finger foods. Something fun could be a cake shaped like a cat. You can make one yourself, using a specialty cake tray, or order one from a local bakery. You can also make cupcakes decorated with cat whiskers and noses, or make cut-out cookies shaped like cats., If you're having a lot of people over, think about making the event into a charity. If you love your cat, think about other cats in need. You could ask a local shelter what kind of supplies they need donated. Ask guests to bring things like old beds, toys, and other items for cats in need.You could also ask for monetary donations. Keep a shoebox out during the party and ask people to leave a little cash for your local shelter.

, If you decide to have people over, you can send out invitations. It can be fun to include a cute picture of your cat in the invitations. You should also inform people how old your cat is turning this year, if you know.If paper invitations are out of your budget, you can send out electronic invitations that include a picture of your cat. You can also make something like a Facebook event page and include a photo of your cat there.

, Cards may seem like something only a person would enjoy. However, if you make an interactive card a cat can play with, your cat may love receiving a card. Many cats enjoy puzzle games, so a card with a small toy or treat hidden inside could be fun for a more playful cat.You can make a card at home with construction paper. Add decorations your cat can play with, like dangly ribbons and strings. Just make sure not to include anything your cat could potentially swallow.
Tape a toy or treat inside the card for your cat to find. A toy scented with catnip can be particularly fun, if your cat tends to enjoy catnip.

, If you're having guests over, decorations can be fun. However, try to include things your cat can enjoy. You can decorate with things like dangly strings and puffballs, and keep them hanging low enough for your cat to tear off the wall.Make sure any interactive decorations are cat-friendly. Some strings and smaller items could be swallowed and potentially cause damage. Stick to toys and items your cat has played with safely before.

, A homemade toy can be a fun, inexpensive way to show your cat you care. You can set up a temporary fort made with pillows and blankets for your cat to play in on its birthday. You can also sew a toy using scraps of felt and stuffing. You can make something super simple by balling up a piece of tinfoil. Your cat will love chasing this new toy., You can also stop by a local supermarket or pet store and purchase some toys for your cat. Try to find a variety of fun, new toys your cat will enjoy.Think about toys your cat has loved in the past. If your cat loves puzzle games, this can be a nice option. This can be particularly nice if you're gone a lot during the day. A puzzle game can keep your cat from getting bored without you.
You can also encourage guests to bring over new toys, if they feel like doing so. You do not want to pressure anyone into giving a gift, but some guests may want to offer your cat a treat.

, Your cat deserves to be spoiled a little on its birthday. From the beginning of the day to the end, make an extra effort to make your cat feel loved.Put fresh blankets in your cat's bed.
Allow your cat access to a spot you would normally restrict. For example, clear off breakables from a mantel for the day.
Open the curtains near a spot where your cat likes to snuggle. Allow it to sunbathe.
Pet your cat extra throughout the day. Allow it to climb into your lap and cuddle.

, Cats love having perches in your home. A nice birthday surprise would be to provide a new window perch. Try clearing off a shelf or table near the window to allow your cat to gaze outside throughout the day.You can also invest in a kitty condo. They can be a bit pricey, but your cat will love having its own space to lounge. This can be a great birthday treat.

, You want your cat to feel loved on its birthday. Throughout your cat's special day, play with it. Encourage your cat to use any new birthday toys, or play with old favorites. Start off the morning playing with your cat so it feels cared for on its birthday., A birthday party can be fun, but there are some safety concerns to keep in mind. Your cat won't enjoy its birthday if it ends up getting hurt during the festivities.If you're including a pet guest list, only include pets your cat is familiar and comfortable with. Unfamiliar animals during a party can cause unnecessary stress.
Be careful when inviting families with small children. Make sure any children in attendance know how to safely interact with animals.
Keep first aid items on hand, as well as the phone number of a veterinarian.

At the exam, you can talk with the vet about any concerns you have about your cat's health or care. Mention if you notice anything different with your cat, such as the way she's meowing, walking, eating or acting. At the exam, your cat's vaccines will be updated and a stool sample will check for internal parasites. Your cat will be treated for any conditions.Your vet may recommend more testing to check for other parasites, heart function, kidney function, or for diabetes.
Older cats should be examined twice a year, since they're more prone to diseases.;
, If you've just gotten kittens, taken them to the vet within the first week of getting them.They need to see the vet more frequently than adult cats starting at around 8 weeks old. They'll need 2 to 3 visits for their vaccination series (distemper and rabies at a minimum). At the first visit, the vet will talk with you about particular risks your kittens face for other diseases, like feline leukemia.


Your kittens probably have roundworms, which can stunt growth and may be transmitted to people. Your vet will recommend treating them with oral medications.

, If your cat becomes sick, you may need to take her to the vet. It's a good idea to save up money for such illnesses or emergencies. Some vets accept pet insurance, which provides some coverage in the event of an unplanned medical visit. While signs of illness can vary between cats, contact your vet immediately if you notice changes in:Eyes: discharge, redness, squinting, rubbing at eyes, cloudiness
Ears: itchiness, discharge, foul smell
Breathing: sneezing with discharge, persistent cough, difficulty breathing/catching breath
Skin: lumps or bumps, swelling,excessive/persistent itching, wounds, redness, yellow discoloration
Urination: bloody urine, straining when urinating, excessive urination, spraying
Digestion: vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation
General: malaise/lethargy, restlessness, seizures, confusion

, Spaying a female cat and neutering a male cat will help with behavior issues such as roaming and the tendency to spray urine. It can protect your cat against a number of diseases including mammary gland tumors, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, and testicular cancer.Also, it will decrease the number of unwanted litters of kittens.


If you have kittens, your vet will probably recommend that they be spayed or neutered anywhere from two to six months of age.

, If your cat has long fur, use a pin brush to work through the long coat. A flat and slicker brush works better for short fur. You can also use a smaller, triangular shaped brush for smaller areas, like around her face and ears. If you want to use a comb, choose a wide-toothed comb for long fur, and a fine-toothed one for short fur. You may want to buy a smaller and gentler brush for a kitten.


This is a great time to check your cat for fleas and check for lump and bumps on the skin.
Grooming is very important since it strips out dead hair, prevents hairballs, stimulates your cat's' blood flow, and provides good bonding time for you and your cat., Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and veterinary toothpaste (not human, since fluoride is toxic to cats). Start by offering your cat a taste of the vet toothpaste. The next day, let her taste the toothpaste and run your finger along the gums of her upper teeth. Do this again the following day with the toothbrush, making small circles working back to front. Gradually, brush a little bit at a time, working the bristles along the gum line and slightly angled up and under the gum line. It should take you less than 30 seconds to brush your cat's teeth.


Dental care is important for good health, since many diseases are linked to poor teeth care and gum disease. Bacteria and plaque can enter the bloodstream and rest of the body, leading to heart and kidney disease,mouth pain, poor eating, and tooth loss.

, Even with tooth brushing, some cats may still need an occasional professional cleaning. While brushing reduces the plaque and buildup on the visible surfaces of the teeth, it cannot get to the buildup just under the gum line.A dental cleaning also gives the veterinarian an opportunity to fully examine the cat’s mouth—an impossible task unless the cat has been sedated which happens during a dental cleaning.

, Make sure your cat has some space of her own. She should have a soft, comfortable space that offers her a bit of privacy. This way, your cat can retreat when feeling overwhelmed, or have a relaxing place to sleep. Offer soft blankets or pillows so that your cat can have a warm place to snuggle.Wash your cats pillows or bedding on a regular basis.

, Make sure to clean it every day, since cats prefer a clean bathroom. A clean litter box will attract a cat. But, a dirty one might repel her and make her look elsewhere to relieve herself. If you have more than one cat it is a good idea to have more than one litter box (placed in different areas of the house) in order to prevent any “turf” guarding of the box by one cat.For example, if you have 2 cats, you should have three litter boxes available.
Avoid placing the litter box in a busy area or near noisy appliances, which may scare your cat. Your cat should be able to easily access the litter box., Ask your veterinarian to suggest a quality cat food specific for your cat. Follow the feeding instructions on the package of cat food you select. Cats are usually fed according to age, weight, and activity levels. They generally like to eat small meals throughout the day.Don't feed your cat human food, unless you've discussed it with your vet. Some human foods can make a cat very sick or are toxic.


Cats need animal derived food since they're carnivores. This means they need animal derived food to get essential amino acids, components of protein. If they don't get them, they'll develop severe health consequences.Always offer fresh water, not milk which cats have a hard time digesting., If your cat does not have access to ad lib feeding of dry food, consider feeding 2 - 3 small meals spaced over the day. If you feed specific canned meals, throw any uneaten food away after 30 minutes. You can also choose to feed your cat dry food, which can be left out. Offer your cat treats every once in a while. Give her fresh fruit or vegetables, like cooked broccoli, corn, or cantaloupe. Avoid packaged treats which don't offer many nutrients.If you have young kittens (6 to 12 weeks old), feed them 4 times a day. Older kittens (3 months to 6 months) should be feed 3 times a day.

, If your cat is new to you, or is simply shy around other cats, never force your cat to interact or play. Instead, start slow and follow your cat's cues. Let your cat become familiar with you or the other cats. Simply spend time sitting around your cat. Avoid standing over your cat, which may intimidate her. Once your cat starts feeling more comfortable with her environment, she'll begin to approach you or the other cats.


When your cat approaches you, let her get closer to sniff you. You might encourage her to come to you by placing treats in your hand., Help your cat get needed exercise by being your cat's personal trainer. Use toys like feathers, fake mice, or even a rolled up piece of paper to get your cat to run around. Toys are a great incentive to get your cat moving. Try tossing small toys for your cat to hit and chase. If you're too worn out to play, use fishing pole style toys or pocket flashlights to give your cat a workout.


Playing with your cat every day will help alleviate your cat's need for your attention., Your cat should have plenty of objects to play with on her own. A useful and fun object is a scratching post or tree she can climb. Cats love tall places and love to scratch. A large, sturdy cat tree will not only give a place to scratch, but will let her climb and enjoy a bird's eye view of her surroundings.Try placing a cat tree or tower near a sunny window. The view will also give your cat something interesting to look at.

, This is especially important if your cat is strictly an indoor cat and can't chase or forage for food. Try putting your cat's food in different containers and cut holes in the sides. Place some of the cat's food in the containers, letting her shake and roll the containers to get to the food.This keeps your cat active and engaged, which can prevent boredom and unhappiness., While cats are often solitary creatures, they do enjoy the company of other cats. This doesn't just mean you should place two cats together without properly socializing them. Instead, let your current cat get used to the new cat's scent by offering a cloth the new cat has slept on or letting her sniff around a room that the new cat has been in. You should also play with them separately for a while, so they learn to associate the scent with something positive.


Take care to offer food in separate bowls, but set the bowls next to each other. That way, the cats will spend time enjoying each others company while they eat.

Be sure the kitten is actually abandoned.,
Estimate the kitten’s age.,
Try to find a mother cat who is already nursing.,
Keep the kitten warm and dry.,
Purchase kitten formula.,
Make emergency kitten formula.,
Feed the kitten based on a schedule.,
Burp the kitten after a bottle.,
Stimulate the kitten so she pees.",How to Care for a Stray Kitten1," Mother cats are not always able to stay with their kittens, they have to leave the kittens alone in order to find food for themselves. If you find one or more stray kitten, you need to be sure it has actually been abandoned by its mother before you take it inside.Unfortunately the only way to know for sure if the kitten is abandoned is to wait and watch the kitten. You’ll need to do this from a distance where the mother cat cannot see or smell you.
If you wait a few hours and the mother cat doesn’t return, there is a good chance she’s not going to return.
If the mother cat returns, it is best if the kitten stays with her until the kitten is weaned. Until then, you can help the mother cat by providing her with food, water, and some shelter.
Once the kitten is weaned, you can decide if you want to bring her inside and try to socialize her, or leave her to live outside.
Many stray cats and kittens actually live in colonies. If a kitten is at least 4 months old it can survive in the colony on its own.;
, A kitten needs different care depending on its age, so the first thing you should do is try to estimate how old the kitten is. You can perform this estimation before touching the kitten and bringing it inside, if you can see her clearly.A newborn kitten who is less than a week old will: weigh approximately 3 to 8 ounces, have her eyes closed, have her ears folded down, and be unable to walk. She might even have a piece of her umbilical code still attached to her belly.
A kitten who is between 1 and 2 weeks old will: weigh 8 to 11 ounces, have slightly open blue eyes, slightly open ears, and will attempt to move around.
A kitten who is around 3 weeks old will: weigh 8 to 15 ounces, have open eyes and ears, be able to take tentative steps, and respond to noises and other movements.
A kitten who is between 4 and 5 weeks old will: weigh 8 to 17 ounces, be able to run and play with her litter mates, be able to eat wet food, and will no longer have blue eyes.

, Mother cats who are nursing have very strong maternal instincts and have been known to adopt other kittens into their litters. Since a mother cat’s milk is the absolute best food a kitten can be given, and a mother cat already knows how to take care of a kitten, being able to give the kitten to a nursing mother is the best option.Call your local humane society, veterinarian offices, and rescue organizations and ask if anyone has a mother cat who could take on an extra kitten (or two).
Even if the kitten can be given to a nursing mother, you can still agree to take the kitten back once it’s been weaned.

, Kittens have a lot of trouble regulating their own body temperatures (in fact, they cannot control their body temperatures at all until they’re at least 3 weeks old), therefore they need a lot of help to stay warm. Usually kittens will cuddle with their mother to keep warm, or they’ll cuddle with each other (often in a pile, one on top of the other).If the kitten is cold to the touch, warm her up with your own body heat. Use your hands to rub her body and increase blood circulation.
Use a box, laundry basket, plastic tub, etc., and build the kitten a nest. Put blankets and towels inside the box to help keep her warm and prevent her from falling or climbing out.
You can also put a heating pad inside the box (under a towel) if you need to, but make sure it’s only under a portion of the towel so the kitten can move away from the heat if she’s too hot.
Because the kitten doesn’t have a mother cat to clean up after her, the bedding is going to get messy. Make sure to change it often so the kitten doesn’t get wet. If she does get wet, wipe off the mess and dry her with a towel.

, A kitten can only drink kitten formula. Do not ever give a kitten any other type of milk that you may have on hand. This likely means you’ll have to go out and purchase some kitten formula at the pet food store as soon as possible.In addition to the formula, you’ll also need to purchase a bottle for the kitten. They’re likely sold in the same section as the formula.
If available, purchase an elongated nipple for the bottle as they’re easier for the kitten to drink from.

, If you need to feed the kitten, but there are no stores open, you can make up an emergency formula from things you may have at home. If you don’t have all the ingredients, chances are there’s a grocery store open even if the pet store is closed. This formula should only be used for emergency purposes.Option 1 — Mix together an 8 ounce can of evaporated milk with 1 egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of karo syrup. Strain the mixture to remove any lumps. Keep the mixture in the fridge until you need it for feedings. Make a bottle with ½ this mixture and ½ boiling water when it’s time for a feeding. Allow the mixture to cool before giving it to the kitten.Option 2 — Mix together 2 cups of whole milk, 2 raw egg yolks (organic if possible), and 2 tablespoons of protein powder. You may need to use a fork or a whisk to mix these ingredients together. Warm them up by putting the bottle in a bowl of warm water.

, Kittens need to be fed as often as every 2 hours, depending on their age. Kittens also need to be fed while on their tummies, with the bottle upwards but at a slight angle. The milk you feed a kitten must also be warmed up, but not hot.Kittens 10 days old and younger need to be fed every 2 hours, around the clock, including the middle of the night.
Kittens between 11 days old and 2.5 weeks old need to be fed every 3-4 hours, around the clock.
Kittens between 2.5 and 4 weeks old need to be fed every 5-6 hours, around the clock.
Once a kitten is 4-5 weeks of age, you can start weaning them off the bottle. You can do this by mixing formula with wet food and giving it to the kittens in a bowl, instead of a bottle. You can also start to give them dry food to see if they’re interested.

, Just like human babies, kittens who are drinking formula via a bottle need to be burped when they’re done feeding. A kitten will usually stop drinking when she’s full, unless she’s having trouble latching onto the nipple of the bottle.If the kitten isn’t latching onto the bottle, you can pull on the nipple when she's trying to drink to help encourage her to suck harder. You can also move the nipple around, again, to encourage the kitten to suck harder.
If the kitten is ill you may need to feed them via a tube directly into their stomachs. You’ll need to go to a veterinarian before you attempt to do this.
Once the kitten has finished drinking, place her on your shoulder or on her belly and pat her back gently until she burps.
Once she’s burped, use a warm and wet cloth to wipe her off and remove any excess milk that might have missed her mouth.

, Kittens under the age of 4 weeks need help going pee and poo. Normally their mother will lick them to stimulate them to pee and poo, but since they have no mother, you’ll have to do this. Thankfully you don’t have to lick them, you can simply use a soft tissue or warm, moist cotton ball to do the job.Use the tissue or cotton ball to gently rub their bum until they pee and poo.
While they’re only drinking formula, a kitten’s poo won’t be solid or in normal poo shapes.

Think carefully about your decision to take in the kitten.,
Weigh the kitten regularly.,
Begin litter training.,
Watch the kitten for health problems.,
Take the kitten to the veterinarian for a wellness exam.",How to Care for a Stray Kitten2," A kitten is adorable and it can be really hard not to want to take care of them. But raising a kitten (especially one that is still nursing) and socializing it to be a pet is a difficult and long process. You need to be sure you’re ready for that type of commitment.Also keep in mind that a stray kitten will need veterinarian care at some point. Standard care (e.g. vaccinations, spay/neuter, flea treatment, deworming, etc.) can cost several hundred dollars. Non-standard care (e.g. emergency visits, treatment of parasites or ringworm, upper respiratory infections, and more) can be very expensive and it can be hard to predict which kittens will need such treatment.
If you aren’t able to take on such a commitment, you might be able to find someone else who can. Start with animal control and your local humane society. Also try local cat rescue organizations and other rescue organizations. You can also call veterinarian offices to inquiry if they know of someone who can help.

, In order to ensure the kitten is growing, weigh her every day. You might want to get into a schedule of weighing the kitten before every feeding, or at the same time every day. Record the kitten’s weight on a chart so you can keep track of it over time.A kitten should double her weight in the first week of her life.

, Once a kitten is 4 weeks old you can start teaching them how to use a little box. If a kitten starts looking for a place to go to the bathroom before 4 weeks of age, you can try putting out a little box even earlier.Use a very shallow box for kittens. Many shelters and rescues use the box canned cat food is packed in.
Use non-clumping litter for kittens. Do not use paper or towels to train a kitten as this may cause them to develop bad litter box habits that a future owner may not appreciate.
After the kitten has eaten, place them in the litter box to encourage them to use it. You can also put a used cotton ball or tissue in with them to give them the idea of what they’re suppose to do.

, Unfortunately kittens, especially those who were born outside, can have a variety of health problems when they’re young. Watch for these problems while you’re taking care of them and take them to a veterinarian if you notice any of these problems developing.Upper Respiratory Infections (URIs) are very common in kittens. If a kitten has yellow discharge coming out of their nose, or they’re having trouble breathing while they eat, they may have an URI. Depending on the severity of the infection, they may need to be given antibiotics.
Fleas can also be quite common on cats that have come from the outdoors. For a kitten fleas can be deadly. If the kitten you’re caring for has fleas, start by combing them off with a flea comb, then give them a warm bath. Do not use flea shampoo on a kitten or a parasite medication like Revolution.
Parasites can also be found in kittens from the outdoors. Parasites usually cause poo problems. If you notice this, take the kitten to your veterinarian who can provide you with a deworming treatment for a kitten as young as 10 days old.

, As your kitten gets older, you need to take her to the veterinarian for a wellness exam and vaccinations — assuming you haven’t already taken her to the vet due to illness. Vaccinations are usually given in multiple doses over several weeks or months."
"
Keep an eye on its weight.,
Give your cat a consistent amount of food.,
Shop for quality cat food.",How to Care for an American Bobtail Cat1," You need to feed the American Bobtail cat so that it doesn’t get overweight. An American Bobtail cat generally weighs between eight and thirteen pounds.Weight is also correlated with gender:Males typically weigh between twelve and sixteen pounds.
Females typically weigh between seven and eleven pounds.;
, Cats love routine, so you should give your cat the same daily portion of food at a regular mealtime.The specific amount of food should be based on your veterinarian’s advice. Your cat’s nutritional needs will evolve as it ages. In consultation with your veterinarian, tailor your cat’s diet according to age:Kittens need a lot of protein and healthy fats to grow and mature properly.
Adult cats need a lower-calorie diet to maintain a healthy weight.
Senior cats need a lower fat diet with high digestibility.

, When you buy cat food, look for quality ingredients. Near the top of the listed ingredients, you should see the protein source (e.g., beef, chicken, fish), followed shortly by taurine (essential amino acid), vitamins, minerals, fatty acids and water. Fillers such as corn or wheat and then artificial ingredients will come next, but better brands will have fewer of these filler and artificial ingredients."

Ask your friends, family, and neighbors, or even your coworkers. If you ask enough people that you trust, you are bound to get a few suggestions. You may even get someone who is willing to do it themselves.In some cases, your friends and family may suggest a teenager or neighbor that is not experienced with cats but is responsible and willing to cat sit. You will need to judge whether you trust that person and if you want to take a chance on someone with no cat experience.;
, Ask the pet professionals that you interact with if they have anyone they can suggest. They may has the name of someone that has been recommended by other clients or someone that they use themselves.These pet professionals are very likely to know which cat sitters in your area are highly regarded and which are not.

, If no one you know has suggestions for a reliable cat sitter in your area, do an online search. Go to a search engine and search for ""cat sitter"" or ""pet sitter"" and the name of your town. This should give you a variety of search results. You can also look at the websites of pet sitter organizations. These will have lists of professional pet sitters.


Once you get some names of local pet sitters, then you can do more internet research to look for reviews of their services. Look for reviews that give specifics about the strengths of the sitter and give details about their services, costs, and general demeanor.

, Some cat sitters will have websites where you can review a variety of information about them. They may include prices, reviews, and calendars of their availability in the near future, along with contact information.


Not all cat sitters will have websites, so you probably don't want to make that a prerequisite for hiring one.

, Once you get the contact information for a cat sitter, you should call them or email them. Tell them what you are looking for as far as services and timeline for cat sitting. Ask about their experience and their general interest in caring for animals.A potential cat sitter should have some questions for you as well. They may ask about where you live and how often you think you will need a sitter, as well as asking about your cat and its personality and behavior.

, A good cat sitter will have references from happy customers that can attest to the cat sitter's skills and reliability. Don't be afraid to ask for references, as it's important to get as much information as you possibly can about someone before you let them in your home.If a potential cat sitter doesn't have any references, it is best to choose someone else. There are likely to be other cat sitters in your area that do have references that can be checked.
You should call references during business hours and leave a call back number if no one answers.

, It is important to discuss pricing before you agree to have a pet sitter work for you and even before you have a preliminary meeting with them. Potential pet sitters typically have a set price for specific services, so this discussion will typically include discussion of your needs and the amount of time you need a cat sitter for.


Asking about price before you meet with a potential cat sitter will save time for both of you if the sitter's price is too high.
This is also a good time to ask about specific services, such as administering medication or taking care of plants while you are away.

, Once you talk to a potential sitter and their references check out, arrange to meet with them. This initial consultation allows you to meet the person that will be in your home while you are gone. It also allows you to watch this person interact with your cat.Whether or not you need to pay a potential pet sitter for this initial visit will vary. Discuss the issue of cost before the sitter comes for their visit and be clear about what you will be paying them for a consultation visit.

, If you have several cat sitters to choose from, pick the one you like the most and that has the best references and experience. This can be a hard decision sometimes, so in the end you may just need to go with your gut and your research., In some cases, you will have several qualified cat sitters to choose from. If this is the case, you should keep the contact information for all of the ones that you would hire so that you have backups. This will allow you to have several people to call if you need to leave town, which will make it more likely to find someone that is available when you need them.


Having the names and numbers of backup sitters on hand can be especially helpful if you have a cat sitter cancel at the last minute. Instead of calling the numbers of random cat sitters, you will have the numbers of some that you have already vetted.

, It's important to give your cat sitter some notice when you want to have them stay with your cat. This will increase the likelihood that they are available when you need them. Let the cat sitter know when you will need them and if you have any flexibility about dates.It is especially important to make a reservation with your cat sitter in advance if you need them to cat sit during the holidays or other busy times of year.

, Before you leave your cat home with someone new, be sure that it has up-to-date ID tags on its collar. This is especially important for indoor cats, in case they get scared by the stranger and gets out of your house on accident.


Your cat's identification tags should have your name and phone number on them, as well as the cat's name.
You should also consider getting a microchip with your information implanted in the cat. This can be done at any veterinary office. This guarantees that your information will be on the cat if the cat gets lost., When you are leaving town you want to make sure that the sitter has enough food and other supplies to last your cat the whole trip. In fact, you want to supply more than enough, so that if you are held up or late coming back, the sitter won't run out of food and supplies to give your cat.Depending on how long you are gone, try to give your sitter at least a week more of supplies than it will likely need. It's better to be safe than sorry.

, It is important to let the cat sitter know what you need them to do and what your expectations of them are instead of assuming that everything will get done. Being clear about the cat's needs will help the cat sitter to know when they need to be with the cat and for how long each day.For example, if you want the cat sitter to spend some quality time with your cat, in addition to feeding it and cleaning its litter box, tell them that. If you don't tell them, then they likely won't spend quality time with the cat.

, Even if you have given the cat sitter instructions verbally, it's always a good idea to write them down and leave them for the sitter. This takes the pressure off the sitter to remember every detail. The instructions you leave should include:The cat's feeding schedule
Any particularities the cat may have
Emergency veterinary information
Where and how you can be reached
Where all supplies are located
Instructions for the house, such as alarm codes or what lights to turn on and off

Put the kitten in her own room.,
Keep things quiet.,
Avoid punishment or scolding.,
Be patient.,
Use food as an incentive to be around humans.,
Play with the kitten at least 2 hours a day.,
Introduce your kitten to new friends.,
Give the kitten more room to play.",How to Care for a Stray Kitten3," While a kitten is very young (less than 2 months at least) she should be kept by herself someplace safe and warm. As she gets older, you can expand the amount of space she has to move around and play.Make sure the location doesn’t have any hiding spots that your kitten can get into.
You can use a cage if you don’t have a room small enough.
Make sure their space has a bedding area, a litter box (when she's older), and a place for food and water dishes.
The bedding should be setup in such a way that the kitten can comfortably hide in the blankets should she feel scared.

, Whenever you’re around the kitten, move slowly and quietly. You should also speak to her often so she gets use to human voices — but speak softly. Make sure the room she's in doesn’t have a lot of outside noise (if possible) and don’t play music in that room until she's really comfortable.Once the kitten has been in your house for a little while, consider leaving a radio playing softly in her room when you’re not there.
If the kitten isn’t scared, put her cage or bed in a more common area of the house (when you can supervise) so she gets use to the hustle and bustle of the house.

, A kitten is not going to know any better, so she may do things that you consider to be “bad.” If this happens, do not punish or scold her. Instead, reward her for good behaviour so she begins to realize the type of behaviour you’d like her to have. Once she catches on, she’ll start to repeat that good behaviour over and over., Depending on how old the kitten was when you brought her inside, it can take a while to socialize her and get her use to humans. Don’t rush the process. If you’re taking care of more than one kitten, consider separating them and spending one-on-one time with each of them., All kittens love food — so you can use it as an incentive to help encourage your kitten to be more social. While you can leave dry food out for the kitten all day, only feed her wet food when you’re in the room. Get her to associate the wet food with you (the human) so she appreciates a human’s presence.Put the wet food bowls as close to you as possible while the kitten is eating.
Gently pet and touch the kitten while she’s eating to get her use to your touch.
Feed the kitten with a spoon to help them get use to you as well.
You can also use pure meat baby food as a treat for a kitten. It cannot have anything else mixed in, only meat.

, You should spend at least 2 hours a day with your kitten. This can be all at once, or multiple short periods, whatever works for you. Play with your kitten at ground level. If you have more than one kitten, take the time to handle each kitten individually everyday. Hold the kitten as much as you can, especially cuddling her close to your body. Introduce toys once the kitten becomes interested., If a kitten is comfortable with you and not stressed, you can start introducing her to other pets. You should always supervise these interactions as you cannot predict how anyone will behave. You can also start introducing the kitten to other humans, so she gets use to humans other than you., Once your kitten get older and starts to play with toys, you can make her play area larger and include more fun stuff for her to play with. In addition to toys, you can add a scratching post or cat tree (start with a short one), tunnels, cardboard boxes, etc."
"
Take your cat for a walk.,
Give it puzzles and toys to play with inside.,
Get a scratching post or toy.",How to Care for an American Bobtail Cat2," This breed is very active, so it will benefit from short walks around the block. Use a cat leash and collar to walk them around the block. If you live in a rural area, you could also just let the cat outside to explore for periods of the day. However, if you like to let your cat outside, you should consider the impact of your cat on local wildlife, as well as risks such as traffic and predation.Try training your cat to walk on a leash as a kitten, since they are more open to new experiences at a young age. That said, you can train a cat to walk on a leash at any age., The American Bobtail cat is very smart. If you leave the cat inside during the day, you need to give it something to keep its mind occupied.Puzzle toys such as food mazes, prize games, treat ball games and massagers are all good options. Line toys are another great option, such as wands and teasers with furry animals on the end., If your Bobtail cat were in the wild, you might find them exercising their muscles on trees. In the comfort of your home, they may want to scratch your expensive furniture. Instead of your furniture, find a scratching toy that your cat will enjoy. Consider the height, material, surfaces and sturdiness of the scratching toy.


Scratching posts, for instance, should have a very sturdy base, a variety of surfaces to scratch and be made from sisal fabric or another attractive material. The sturdiness of the post is especially important, since you don’t want your cat to get injured climbing a poorly made post."
"
Brush your cat twice a week.,
Trim the nails.,
Monitor your cat’s ears.,
Remove any discharge from their eyes.,
Brush their teeth.,
Keep a clean litter box.",How to Care for an American Bobtail Cat3," The American Bobtail sheds a lot in the spring and fall months, so you will need to brush your cat more during those seasons. Generally, brush your cat a couple times a week to remove dead hair and keep the coat looking shiny.Use a slick brush such as a rubber curry., It is important to stay on top of nail trimming for this breed, especially if you value your furniture and skin.Ask a friend to hold your cat firmly in their lap. While they are holding your cat, grab one of your cat’s paws. Gently press down on the top and bottom of the paw to extend your cat’s claws. While they are extended, clip off the pointy part of the claw.Don’t cut too close to the pink part of the claw where all the nerve endings are located.

, It is important to keep an eye on your cat’s ears, including occasional cleaning and watching out for infection.Every week, you should wipe out your cat’s ears with a soft damp cloth. Moisten the cloth with half cider vinegar and half warm water, then clean out their ears.Cotton balls should be avoided because they may damage your cat’s ears.
If you observe any loss of balance, pawing or sensitivity of the ears, you should get your cat checked out at the vet., To get rid of angel dust or any discharge, you should use a damp napkin to wipe any debris out from the corner of their eyes., Since this breed can be vulnerable to teeth problems, you should regularly brush their teeth.It is best to brush their teeth three times per week. Holding your cat firmly but gently in your lap, brush their teeth with feline toothpaste and a cat toothbrush. Always brush away from the gum line. At the end of the session, you don't need to rinse their mouth because feline toothpaste is meant to be eaten., This breed is sensitive about bathroom cleanliness, so you should make sure you regularly clean out their litter box.You should clean the litter box once or twice per day."
"
Remove any hazardous items from your home.,
Hide all electrical cords.,
Keep your cat indoors.",How to Be Responsible when You Have a Cat1," Cats need to be in a safe place where there is little chance they can get hurt. If you have any breakable objects, they should be removed or placed out of your cat's reach. For example, vases, figurines, and glassware should be kept behind closed doors. You should also remove any small items, such as rubber bands, beads, safety pins, hair clips, etc. that could be choking hazards.Certain household plants, such as jade and aloe, can be toxic to cats and should be removed from your home. Ask your vet about poisonous household plants.;
, Make sure all wires for televisions, phones, computers, etc. are hidden carefully. Cats are naturally playful and curious and they will likely bite on or play with cords if given the opportunity. This can be very dangerous and your cat could get seriously harmed from biting on an electrical wire.Store wires behind furniture.
Alternatively, you can tape cords to the floor or other furniture so your cat can’t access them.

, Responsible cat owners will not let their cats roam the neighbourhood unsupervised. This can be dangerous to both the cat and other animals in the area. Cats who are allowed outdoors can get into fights with other animals, or eat poisons substances. They are also more likely to be killed by traffic.Outdoor cats may also hunt and kill local songbirds and small rodents, which can have a negative impact on the local environment.

"
Pick the right age.,
Adopt a socialized kitten.,
Take your time.,
Help with the transition.,
Balance your attention.",How to Teach Your Kitten to Be Calm and Relaxed1," Kittens are most easily socialized between the ages of two to seven weeks. This means that the kitten is more likely to accept new animals, peoples, and situations during this age range. Although most respectable mother cat owners won’t separate the kittens from the mother until the age of eight weeks, this falls outside of the proper time frame. This means that it is typically the original owner's job to socialize the kittens while she is still with the litter and her mother.


If you know you are going to get a cat before this time period passes, visit the litter and mother to make sure your future kitten is socialized to humans and to you.;
, When you adopt a kitten from a home after this time period or if you adopt from a shelter or animal society, you need to ensure the kitten is socialized to humans. Make sure the kitten you choose will come up to you, showing curiosity and wanting your attention. She shouldn’t hiss or raise her fur at you after the first few minutes of meeting you.


Be cautious of kittens that do this and make sure she warms up to you., When you are choosing a kitten to adopt, you need to take your time before you take her home. This will give you ample time to see if her temperament matches yours. Plan to spend at least an hour getting to know your potential kitten candidate to get a true understanding of her personality. Pet her and love on her to see if she is okay being handled and to ensure she likes humans.


You’ll know the kitten is truly comfortable with you when she begins to purr while in your arms., When you first bring your kitten home, expect her to be shy and cautious for a few days. The experience of changing locations is a total disruption in her life. It makes sense she would be uncertain and shy at the beginning as she is adjusting to her new home.


You can help this transition by asking the previous owner for a blanket or towel the kitten, her littermates, and her mother used. This will provide a familiar scent for her to connect to and help put her at ease in her new home.
If you adopt from a shelter, ask if you can take home the blanket she used while she was there or if there is any blanket from her litter there as well, to provide the same scent., When you get a new kitten, you want to play with her and give you attention all the time. Instead of doing this, balance your attention. Give your kitten attention, but don’t constantly handling her. If she wants to get away from you, put her down and let her run away. She will eventually seek you out for attention.


Pay extra attention to this problem if you have children, especially young ones. They won't understand the concept of letting the kitten have its space. Make sure you supervise any interaction your children have with the kitten so neither the child nor kitty get injured or become frustrated. "

Reciprocate her affection.",How to Amuse Cats," Build a “cat tree” near a window so that your cat can observe birds, squirrels and other small creatures. This may be an especially great way to amuse indoor cats, or outdoor cats that may be inside.


Construct your “cat tree” from items around the house or build an actual structure with different level platforms and perches. You can also purchase commercial cat trees at most pet stores.
Open the blinds or curtains for your cat to watch outside. Be aware that your cat may make noises or even lunge at the window if she tries to “capture” her prey. If you have sheer or lace curtains, it’s not uncommon for cats to get stuck on or rip them.
Incorporate the cat tree into your playtime with your cat. Sit on the sofa or a chair and pet her or let her come to you in between “hunting” from her tree.;
, Because cats are naturally curious, they love to explore and forage. Placing items such as boxes around your house can encourage exploration and hours of amusement for your cat.


Open up a paper sack without handles, which can choke your cat, and place it on the floor. Your cat may naturally just go into the bag or you might need to tap on the outside of it to get her attention. You can also crumple up a piece of paper into a ball and toss it inside the bag. Avoid using plastic bags, which can suffocate your cat.
Place a box on the floor and leave an opening for your cat to get inside. Put a toy inside the box or toss a small jingle-bell ball for your cat to bat., Whether your cat stays indoors or spends time inside and outside, give her toys that promote hunting and the predatory sequence of searching, stalking, chasing, pouncing, catching, and manipulating .Purchase toys at your local pet store that you think your cat might enjoy. There are a wide array of toys that range from simple to very involved. For example, you could get a squeaking squirrel or a chirping bird that are soft and small enough for your cat to toss around with her mouth. Consider getting toys filled with catnip to further attract her to play. But remember, your cat may love a plastic ball that has a jingling bell in it just as much.Give your cat simple items you have around your house as toys. Balled up paper, wine corks, pieces of rope can provide just as much stimulation and for your cat as store-bought toys.Some other household items that your cat may enjoy are shower curtain rings and cardboard tubes from toilet paper or paper towels.Hide the toys or items throughout your home to promote her “hunting” skills. You may want to rotate the toys every week so that your cat doesn’t bore of them., As easy as it is to amuse your cat with toys and simple household items, it’s important to know what could harm your cat. Many toys contain small bits that a cat can swallow, which can cause intestinal issues and even death.Store the following items or remove them from toys to minimize the risk of harm:


Ribbons or string
Feathers
Tinsel
Sequins or other small decorations
Paper clips and rubber bands
Pins and needles., Catnip is a plant that is a member of the mint family. It has a chemical that attracts some cats and doesn’t affect others. Give your cat a bit of dried catnip leaves and see if she goes nuts.Be aware that catnip is safe and non-addictive for your cat. How she reacts to it is entirely dependent on her genes.Roll your cat’s toys in catnip if she enjoys the plant. You may notice that the catnip stimulates even more vigorous play with the toy.
Buy some dried catnip or consider growing your own from a plant you purchase at a pet or home store.

, Cats naturally love to chase and catch objects. Toss small lightweight toys across the room for your cat to chase, catch, and manipulate through batting or pawing.Use items from around your house such as ping pong balls or wadded up pieces of paper if you don’t have any toys.
Make sure to get your cat’s attention before you throw the object so that she can anticipate the direction she needs to run. Consider faking her out by moving your hand in a throwing motion and then saying her name as you throw the object towards or away from her.
Shine a laser light on walls and on objects around the room. Your cat will chase the light, so fast and erratic movements will keep his attention. Shining the light high on a wall will provoke your cat to jump high in an attempt to ""catch"" the light. Make sure to not shine the light in your cats eyes and award her with an actual toy to grab when you are done with the laser.Consider teaching your cat to fetch. Although most cats won’t fetch like a dog, you may be able to teach your kitty to bring back objects you have thrown to her., Many stores sell wand toys, which are made up of a stick with a toy attached by a string. Wiggle the stick to flutter the toy and watch your cat go crazy trying to catch it.


Pull the toy away just as your cat is about to catch it to keep the game interesting for her. You can also move it in different directions to keep her guessing and interested. Make sure to allow her to catch the toy on occasion.
Remove any objects, such as feathers, from the wand toy that your cat could remove with her claw or swallow.

, Wiggle a long piece of yarn or string in front of your cat. Pull it across the floor and make it dash back and forth. She’ll likely enjoy chasing after you to catch the string.


Tie several pieces of yarn at the end of the string to a small puffball your cat can enjoy.
Store any string or yarn toys away from your cat when you are not supervising her play. This can minimize the risk of her swallowing them and harming herself., Close a door slightly and leave your cat on one side of it. Push a small stick or cat toy under the door to get you cat's attention. Slide the toy under and around the door and then hide it on your side again just before she catches it.


Allow the cat to ""win"" by pulling the toy to his side of the door when you’re done.
Be aware that your cat might slide her paws under the door in anticipation or to find her toy. Avoid pulling at her paws if she does this, which can hurt her.

, Tease your cat with small, lightweight stuffed toys. Once your cat becomes interested in the toy, he will likely grab it from you and beat it up with his mouth and paws. Get an appropriately-sized toy, smaller than your cat., Remember that play often stimulates a cat’s natural predatory instincts. If you are playing with your cat, make sure to keep your fingers, hands, or arms clear of her claws and mouth so that she doesn’t accidentally swipe or bite you.


Avoid yelling at or punishing your cat if she accidentally hurts you. Not only can this traumatize her but it may discourage her from playing in the future.
Wash any scratches or bites immediately with soap and warm water.

, After you finish playing with your cat, give her a small treat as a reward. This tells her that you enjoy her company and can strengthen your bond.


Avoid feeding your cat too many treats, which can cause her to gain weight. If you are concerned about this, give her a taste of canned food or some catnip instead., There are times when cats want to be alone and shouldn’t be disturbed, such as when she is cleaning herself or eating. Watch for the following signals that your cat wants to play and indulge her whims as much as you like:


Spontaneously playing with toys or objects
Sudden, short movements
Dilated pupils
Flattened ears, if no other cats are present
Frozen postures
Crouched legs
Making vocal noises
Running around like crazy, Make sure that any play you enjoy with your cat is always gentle and loving. This can get her to seek your out for more play and deepen your bond.


Pet and praise your cat during play. Talk to her by using her name. For example, you can say “Do you want the mouse, Sam? Look at you! Good girl, you’re ferocious!”Avoid squeezing your cat or pulling her tail as a part of your play. Only pick her up during play if she seems receptive to it.
Avoid using a loud tone or yelling at your cat, which may confuse her and discourage her from playing.

, Consider positioning yourself at your cat’s level during playtime. Sitting or lying on the floor or the sofa may relax her and promote bonding.Sitting on the sofa or in a chair may also be another way to get your cat to comfortably approach you.Sitting near the window to give your cat several different types of entertainment from which to choose., Your cat may show you affection during your playtime. Make sure to show her you are enjoying your time together by giving her back the affection. Some typical ways your cat may demonstrate she loves you during play are:


Bumping her head against yours. Let her rub her head against you and offer your head back.
Showing you her butt. You can show her similar affection by blowing gently at her bum.
Licking you. You don’t have to lick your kitty back, but you could stroke or pet her and say “I love you, too, Sam. You’re such a good girl.”

Take your cat to the vet.,
Get your cat spayed or neutered.,
Give your cat an identification tag or microchip.",How to Be Responsible when You Have a Cat3," Your cat should visit the vet at least once per year to ensure that all vaccines are up to date and to examine its overall health.

You can even use a pen flashlight or cat laser pointer, which is great fun for your kitten as she tries to catch the light., Your cat needs to be played with for a certain amount of time in order for your cat to expel enough energy. Try to play with her at least twice a day for 15 minutes or longer each time. This will also help you bond with your new kitten and make her feel safe and secure.



Never let your kitten play with string, yarn, or rubber bands. These objects can be swallowed, which can lead to severe or even deadly intestinal obstructions.

You can also try attaching double-stick tape to surfaces as well. The stickiness will irritate your kitten and deter her from being on that surface.
Although it is a popular method, using spray bottles of water as punishment only occurs when you are around. This can be less effective because your cat may associate the punishment with you, which can make the kitten grow fearful of you.

, For the first week after your cat gives birth, a bloody vaginal discharge is to be expected. This discharge will be heaviest for the first three days, and then begin to taper off. If the vaginal discharge continues for more than a week, changes color, or develops an odor, seek the advice of your vet.If your cat was spayed at the time of the c-section, there may be no discharge at all.

, Your cat's incision should be examined daily for signs of excessive swelling, redness, or discharge. Wash your hands before touching your cat, and avoid touching the incision itself., Depending on the type of material that was used, your cat's stitches or staples may or may not need to be removed. In general, any staples and any visible stitches will need to be removed 10-14 days after the procedure. If you cannot see the stitches, they are most likely absorbable, and will not need to be removed. Discuss these details with your vet., Young kittens should be nursing or sleeping almost all of the time. Although they will occasionally whimper, they should not cry much. If you notice the kittens crying often, or for long period of time, contact your vet immediately. Excessive whimpering could be a sign of urinary tract infection, inadequate milk, or other milk-related problems that could be fatal to baby kittens."

Spend time with a cat.,
Play.,
Brush their fur.,
Look for signs of affection.",How to Become a Cat Person2," In order to become a cat person, you need to let a cat's personality grow on you. This can be accomplished by spending time with a cat (or cats). Talk to your friends and family to see who has cats you can hang out with, or volunteer at a local shelter.Try to find a cat whose personality matches your own.
Give hanging out with each cat a few tries before you decide if you like them or not.
Understand that it may take a while for a new cat to warm up to you.

, When you have the chance to hang out with a cat, try to a make that time enjoyable for you both. Cats--especially young ones--are playful creatures. You can grow to appreciate felines when you see their athleticism and cuteness in action. Plus, when you play with cats, they grow to like you as well.You might try:


Dragging a ribbon across the floor.
Tossing jingly balls for cats to chase.
Dangling a feather or piece of yarn.

, Another great way to bond with a cat is to brush their fur. The action of brushing combines two important elements of bonding: physical contact and providing care. You can purchase a cat brush from any pet store. Cats can be brushed once or twice per day.Although most will, not all cats will enjoy being brushed.
If the cat winces, squirms, or runs away they may dislike being brushed.

, When a cat shows you signs of affection, it can influence your brain chemistry, and thus your relationship to them. Take notice of these signs.To show affection, cats may:


Brush against you.
Purr in your company.
Roll on the ground in front of your feet.
Bring you ""gifts,"" such as cat toys.
Rub their faces on you.

"
"
Give your cat quality food.,
Provide age-appropriate cat food.,
Give a long-haired cat hairball-preventing cat food.,
Feed your cat two or three times a day.,
Give unlimited access to drinking water.",How to Raise a Cat1," When raising a cat it is important to provide it with nutritious food. Canned and dry food are both fine -- though dry food will help keep your cat's teeth clean -- if the food includes mostly animal protein and not a lot of fillers.


If you are unsure of what to feed your cat, discuss food with your cat's veterinarian. They will likely have a suggestion for what to feed your cat for its specific nutritional needs.;
, When your cat is young, you should feed it kitten food, which gives it more fat and protein for its growing mind and body. As the cat ages, you should feed it food that gives it complete nutrition without giving it so much that it gets overweight. When your cat gets older, you may need to transition it onto senior food, which provides the type of nutrition that geriatric cats need.

, If you have long-haired cat, it is a good idea to give it hairball-preventing food, especially if it has a history of having hairballs. In most cases, this type of food helps to prevent hairballs by increasing the amount of fiber your cat is getting. Fiber increases the rate of digestion and moves food, and hair, through the digestive tract more effectively.Discuss which hairball-preventing food is best for your cat with your veterinarian. They should have suggestions for a food that will fulfill your cat's nutritional needs, in addition to being good at preventing hairballs.

, The amount of food you give it will depend on the size of your cat. Look at the food packaging and follow the directions there for portion sizing, which is usually based on your cat's size and age.Discuss portion size and feeding schedule with your veterinarian. They may have suggestions that take your cat's specific dietary needs into consideration.

, It is very important to provide your cat with clean water at all times, as dehydration can make your cat very sick. Put the water in a clean, small bowl and replace it daily, so that the water is appealing for the cat to drink.If you want to make your cat's water really appealing, consider getting it a cat drinking fountain. These are devices that recirculate a cat's water in a stream, which can draw the cat's attention to the water.

Approach the cat.,
Introduce yourself to the cat.,
Make sure the cat wants to be picked up.,
Place one hand under the cat's body, behind its front legs, if you are sure that the cat is accepting of being picked up.,
Place the other hand under the cat's hindquarters.,
Gently lift the cat.,
Hold the cat against your chest.,
Know when the cat no longer wants to be held.,
Gently place the cat down.,
Do not scruff the cat.,
Make sure a child has close supervision while picking up a cat.",How to Pick Up a Cat," If you want to pick up a cat, then you should first approach it in a way that lets it know you're coming. This can mean talking to it softly, letting it see you, or just making your presence known in some way.


If you pick up your cat from behind without letting it know you're coming, it's likely to get scared and to feel panicked and unsafe.
Some experts say it's best to approach your cat from the left or right side because coming at your cat head-on may seem like too much of a threat.Never attempt to pick up cats you find on the street without carefully assessing the cat and its behavior. It can be feral and potentially dangerous. It is best to only try to pick a cat up if you have experience with it.;
, It can take time for cats to warm up to you, even cats that you own. Once the cat knows you're approaching, you should be friendly and loving with the cat so it gets ready to be held by you. Most cats introduce themselves to other cats by nuzzling their faces, so you should do the same, focusing on gently petting the cat's cheeks, forehead, the area behind their ears, or even under their chins, if it is comfortable with you.


This gentle petting can help your cat feel safe and loved and ready to be picked up.
If your cat is feeling a little bit wound up, this can also help calm him or her down. It may take a bit of time to make your cat feel at ease.

, Most cats will be able to give you a definite sign that they don't want to be picked up. Though you can slowly calm down and earn the trust of domestic cats by petting their heads, you shouldn't try to pick up a cat who is either irritated or just not in the mood to be picked up. If the cat tries to run away from you or bites or scratches you, or just starts swatting at you, then it may be time to try to pick up the cat later.It is especially important to teach children who want to pick up a cat these warning signs. You want them to only pick up a cat who is feeling calm and relaxed and who trusts them. You don't want a child to end up getting scratched by a cat who doesn't want to be held.

, Gently move your hand under the cat's body, just below its front legs, so you have the support you need when you begin to pick up the cat. The cat may resist this or not like it right away, so you should move along and use that second hand soon afterwards.It doesn't really matter whether you use your dominant hand to support the cat below its front legs or under its hindquarters; it depends on whatever makes you feel more comfortable.
Some people actually tuck the front legs together and place the hand under the two legs instead of below them.

, Now place that second hand under the cat's back legs, giving plenty of support to its legs and bottom. You can almost think of this as cradling the cat with one of your hands. Once you've gotten your hands in position, you can get ready to pick the cat up., Now that you're holding the cat with both hands, just gently lift the cat up, towards your chest. Try to make contact with the rest of your body as early as you can when you lift it up. This can help the cat feel more secure early in the process. If the cat is too heavy to lift up from the ground, you may be better off picking it up from a table or an elevated platform., Once you've picked up the cat while supporting it with both hands, you can hold it against your chest, so most of its body is touching your body. The back or side of the cat's head can rest against your chest, too.


In general, the cat's posture should be fairly straight instead of having the cat sag against your chest, with its head and neck craned downward. This is uncomfortable for the cat and may cause it to struggle and scratch you.
You should always pick up a cat with its head above its body. Never pick up a cat upside down!
Of course, some cats like to be held differently, especially if it's your cat and it's more comfortable around you. Some are perfectly fine being cradled like babies while others even like placing their hind legs on your shoulders.

, Once the cat starts shifting around, moving, or even meowing or trying to escape your grasp, it's time to set the cat down. You don't want to hold the cat against its will, as this will make the cat increasingly uncomfortable and it will also feel threatened.


Some cats don't like to be held for all that long, so if you sense that the cat may be less than pleased in your arms, it's time to let it go.

, Don't just throw down the cat the second you feel the little guy is uncomfortable; this may lead the cat to lose its balance or to land awkwardly. Instead, lower the cat down until all four of its paws are on the ground before you comfortably release it.


Of course, some cats will just jump right out of your grasp, so you can be prepared for that, too.

, Though mother cats carry their kittens by the scruff, you should not try to scruff a cat, especially after it is three months old or so. At that point, the cat will grow too big, and scruffing it can really hurt the cat and cause muscle damage, as the cat will be too big to be adequately supported by the scruff. Though you or a vet may need to scruff the cat to get it to take medication or trim its nails they never hold the cat off the examination table by the scruff.

, Kids love to pick up cats, but if they want to do this, you should instruct them through every step of the process. Most importantly, make sure the child is big enough to comfortably pick the cat up. If the child is too small, then he or she may be better off holding the cat while sitting.


Once the child picks up the cat, make sure to keep an eye on them so you can tell the child when the cat wants to be let go. This will help to keep both the child and the cat from being injured.

Take medication.,
Designate cat-free zones at home.,
Groom the cat.",How to Become a Cat Person3," If you are experiencing symptoms of a cat allergy, it is best to speak to your doctor. Most likely, your doctor will recommend the use of medication to reduce and/or prevent your symptoms. By getting your allergies under control, you are better able to become a cat person. Your doctor might recommend:


Anti-histamines.
Decongestants.
Steroids.
Injections.

, If you are living with a cat at home, you can help control your allergies by designating cat-free zones. You need a place (or two) where you can relax and recuperate when your allergies are bothering you. It's also important for you to experience allergy relief in places where you work and sleep.Consider making the following spaces in your home cat-free:


Your bedroom.
Your home office.

, Cat allergies are a reactive response to cat dander. You can reduce the amount of dander in your home (and thus reduce your allergic reactions) by having the cat groomed.You can ask a friend or family member to bathe the cat weekly, using a dander-reducing shampoo.
However, most cats strongly dislike being bathed. So another option is to have the cat groomed by a professional.

Provide identification.,
Provide and teach the use of a litter box.,
Keep trying if litter box training is problematic.,
Clean the litter box regularly.,
Give your cat a cozy place to sleep.,
Provide a place to scratch.,
Keep your cat inside.,
Build your cat an enclosed patio.,
Brush your cat regularly.,
Remember to clip your cat's claws.",How to Raise a Cat2," Once you bring a cat home and name it, you should get it some identification. This can be in the form of a tag on its collar, but you can also get it microchipped at its veterinary office. Even if you plan on raising the cat to live indoors, having identification is important -- remember, if it gets out, it will have no experience finding its way home.Your cat's collar tag should include its name and your phone number. Keep this phone number up to date, so that someone who finds your cat can contact you easily.

, When raising a cat, you will need to teach it to use a litter box. For most cats, this is a relatively easy process. Once you bring a cat home, keep it contained in a small space with food, water, a bed, and its litter box. The cat may naturally head towards the litter box to go to the bathroom, as they are naturally clean animals that like to pick specific bathroom areas.As your cat adjusts to its new home and you let it roam the whole house, you should keep the litter box in an area that is easily accessible and close to your cat's daily activity. This will help ensure that the cat actually uses it instead of a handy corner.

, If the cat doesn't use the litter box automatically, move any feces or urine into the litter box and clean the areas where the cat went to the bathroom outside of the box. If the cat smells feces and urine in the litter box, it will know that is where it should go.

, To ensure that your cat uses its litter box, you should make sure to keep it clean and tidy. Remember to remove solids daily. You should also empty it completely, clean the box, and put totally new litter in weekly.If you do not clean your cat's litter box regularly, it is likely to find somewhere else to go to the bathroom.

, When raising a cat you should make sure to give it a cozy place all its own, where it can take a nap or just get some alone time. Typically, this is done by giving it a bed all its own and placing that bed in a quiet and warm corner. This can be difficult to achieve if you live in a hectic or crowded home, but your cat may even pick the spot itself and all you have to do is provide the cushioning.


Many cats love a spot that gets sun from the outside. The sunshine and the view to the outside will likely be very appealing to your cat. Even on a day that is cold outside or when your home is a little chilly, a sunny spot will suit a cat's needs very well., All cats need to scratch once in awhile in order to keep their claws healthy and agile. In order to allow them to do this without destroying your furniture, you should get them a scratching post or scratching pad. If your cat likes to scratch a lot, you may even need to buy or make one for every room.Once you give them this item to scratch, you will need to teach them to use it. To begin with, you can place the scratching post in front of a piece of furniture that the cat has been scratching. You can also show it how to use it by placing your cat's claws on the post. If all else fails, try making the scratching post or pad attractive to the cat by rubbing catnip on it.

, Try to raise a cat to stay indoors, especially if you live in a city. Living indoors greatly increases their lifespan due to lower risks for disease, injury or abuse. It also helps keep wildlife in your area , such as birds, safe and healthy. For entertainment for an indoor cat, provide boxes, cat toys, and sunny window perches for it to lounge in. You may also want to consider having at least two cats, so they can keep each other occupied when you are away.


Make sure that all doors are kept closed and that all windows and window screens are secure if you are trying to keep your cat indoors., If you really want your cat to experience the sights and smells of the outdoors, consider building it a ""catio,"" which is a cat patio. This is an enclosed outdoor area that is typically attached to your home, and which allows your cat to get some outdoor time without letting it roam freely.A catio allows your cat the stimulation of being outside but limits its ability to get lost or kill wildlife in your area.

, Depending on the breed, you may need to brush your kitty more often, but all breeds need to be brushed at least weekly. For example, Persian cats need brushing 3 to 4 times a week but American shorthair cats only need to be brushed once a week. Weekly brushing eliminates tangles and reduces spare hair that would rub off on furniture or floors, or form hairballs in your cat.


Cats do not need bathing unless they get into something really foul and cannot satisfactorily clean themselves off. The exception to this is Sphinx cats, which are bald and need bathing once a week to keep skin oils under control.

, When your cat is young, you should begin clipping its claws every week. This will get it used to the process and will make it less resistant to it when it becomes an adult. Trimming a cat's nails is particularly important if the cat does not regularly go outside, where it might wear down the nails with vigorous activity.


To trim the nails, use nail clippers made for cats, which come in a guillotine type or a scissors type, or human nail clippers. Put the clippers perpendicular to the claws. Trim only the tip of the nail. The quick of the nail, which is the back part of the nail with a blood vessel in it, should not be cut."
"
Have your cat desexed.,
Take your cat in for preventative veterinary exams.,
Keep up to date with preventative medication.",How to Raise a Cat3," Most cats should be spayed or neutered at an early age. The cat will be tamer and desexing decreases the risk of your cat developing certain cancers, such as uterine tumors in female cats. Most vets will not spay or neuter your kitty until they weigh about two pounds, so discuss the right time with your vet.In addition to the health benefits of getting your cat desexed, you will not have to deal with a female cat going into heat, and a male cat will be less likely to spray in your home and roam outside looking for a mate.
The only cats that should not be fixed are those that are intentionally being used for breeding. These should be purebred cats that are being bred by experienced and ethical breeders.

, In order to raise a cat properly, you need to provide it with regular veterinary care. When a cat is young, it typically only needs to have an annual exam, in which the veterinarian checks its overall health and updates any vaccines or medications that it needs. Once your cat gets old, it will likely need veterinary checkups more often, usually every six months.Veterinary checkups can seem like a waste of money if your cat is generally healthy, but it can actually save you money in the long run. Finding a health problem early on and getting early treatment for a serious illness can really reduce your costs, along with your cat's pain and suffering.

, When bringing your cat in for a checkup, discuss flea medications and vaccinations with your veterinarian. For flea medications, they will most likely recommend a regular flea repellent treatment, such as Frontline and Trifexis, that you will apply at home. It is important to keep up to date with this medication so that your cat does not experience a flea infestation.


Get the vaccinations and vaccination boosters that your veterinarian suggests. Your veterinarian will make suggestions based on your cat's risk of exposure and the health history of your cat. The veterinarian may suggest vaccinations for panleukopenia, herpesvirus, calicivirus, rabies, feline leukemia, chlamydiosis, infectious peritonitis, immunodeficiency, bordetella, and giardiasis."
"
Show your cat love and affection.,
Socialize your cat.,
Provide your cat with mind-stimulating toys.,
Interact with your cat daily.",How to Raise a Cat4," When you are raising a cat it is important to show them love and affection every day. You can do this by holding it in your lap and petting it for a little while every day. You can do this by playing with it and giving it uninterrupted attention for at least a little while every day. Whatever you do, make sure that your cat knows it is loved and that it is an important member of your family.


Many cats only want attention once in awhile, and they will usually ask for it when they want it. If your cat is like this, make sure to give it some petting and attention when the cat asks for it. These requests may not always come when you want them to, but just try to remember that your cat deserves a bit of uninterrupted attention every day.

, In order to raise a happy and well adjusted cat, you should begin socializing it when it is very young. Introduce your cat to a wide variety of people beginning when it is a small kitten, so that it knows that this is a normal part of life. Exposing it to a wide variety of people, and keeping those interactions positive, will make it more likely that the cat is friendly and interested in new people and animals when it is an adult, instead of being scared or aggressive towards new people.Socialization can even include exposing your cat to a wide variety of noises and situations. For instance, if you expose a small kitten to the sound and activity of a vacuum cleaner early on in its life, it is less likely to be fearful of it when it is an adult.

, All cats need some mental stimulation every day. This is especially true when cats are kittens and their minds are developing. This can be provided, in part, by giving it stimulating toys to play with while it is alone. These toys could include motorized cat toys that it can chase around, but it can also include simpler toys, such as toy mice or balls with bells in them.To find out what type of toys your cat likes, you may need to bring home a variety. Once you give all the toys to the cat, pay attention to your cat as it plays and see which toys it prefers.
Just like humans, cats can get bored with toys that they have played with for a long time. Provide new and exciting toys on a regular basis, so that your cat continues to get lots of mind-stimulating play time.

, In addition to giving your cat toys for it to play with on its own, you should spend quality time playing with your cat every day. When raising a cat, it is important to spend quality interactive time with it in order to develop its mind and personality. Use a feather on a string or a laser pointer to get the cat to run around and leap into the air. Throw little toys for the cat to chase and play other games that the cat enjoys. This interaction will likely be more stimulating to the cat than playing on its own.If your cat is really intelligent, you can even try to train it to do things, such as tricks you would normally teach a dog.

They'll likely want to come over and give you a good sniff, as well. They shouldn't want to cower or hide from you.Play with the kittens. Use a string or a lure toy with a feather, and entice the kittens to play. Most kittens can't resist playing with a toy, so they should be interested. You want a kitten who will be playful and engage with you.;
, Another test to see if kittens are right for you is to try picking them up. They should wiggle a bit. That's natural. However, they shouldn't try to bite you or throw a hissing fit.While it's important for you to be around the kitten, it's also important for other family members to visit, too. Some kittens won't be as comfortable around kids, for instance.

, A safe bet is picking two kittens from the same litter. They will already be bonded as litter mates, and of course, they are the same age. Two kittens from the same litter are more likely to get along.If for whatever reason, you can't adopt two siblings, the next best thing is adopting two kittens who've already bonded. The shelter or rescue should be able to point you to kittens who get along. It's best if they are about the same age.Make sure you tell them you're interested in adopting two kittens. Most shelters and rescues will be more than enthusiastic about having you adopt two at once., Often, the staff at a shelter or rescue will have some idea about the background of the cats and kittens in their care. Ask questions about the kittens to get an idea of whether or not they may be a good fit in your home.For instance, you could ask questions like ""Where did these kittens come from? Were they introduced to humans by seven weeks? Have they ever been around kids?""

, Most shelters and rescues will require that you fill out an adoption form. When you do, you'll need to fill in basic biographical information, but you'll also need to answer some questions about your history with pets.They'll likely ask you questions about where you live, your family size, your other pets, and your veterinarian, as well as what experience you have owning pets.

, Once you've been approved for adoption, all that's left is to pay the fee to adopt your kittens. Shelters and rescues have fees to help cover costs for things like vaccinations, spaying/neutering, and food. If the kittens are hold enough, they'll likely already be spayed or neutered when you get them. Sometimes, however, they'll give you a discount when you're adopting two pets., A runny nose, as well as sneezing and coughing, indicates the kittens could be sick.Similarly, the kittens' eyes shouldn't have discharge. They should look clear.Discharge anywhere on the face could indicate an upper respiratory infection., Another indication of unhealthiness is redness in the gums. You might also notice inflammation or whiteness. The gums should be a healthy pink, while the teeth should be bright white., Some kittens may have parasites, such as ear mites. If your kittens do, they may scratch their ears a lot (or shake their heads), or they may have dark brown bits inside their ears.Look for healthy pink insides; redness or inflammation could indicate an issue., Take a moment to feel up and down the kittens' bodies. You shouldn't notice any lumps. Also, the kitten's belly should be round, and you shouldn't be able to feel the kitten's ribs. However, the belly shouldn't be swollen. Check if it's warm to the touch. If it is warm and swollen, that could mean the kittens have worms.While you're checking the kittens' bodies, look at the fur as well. Look for bald patches, which could indicate ringworm. In addition, check for small reddish particles close to the tail and ears, which could indicate fleas., The back end of the kitten should be fairly clean. For instance, you shouldn't notice any feces in the fur, which may mean the kitten has had diarrhea.Pay attention to anything that looks like grains of rice, as they could be tapeworms., Kittens should be fairly rambunctious and playful. When they're not napping, they should be playing. If they have low energy, that's not a great sign.In addition, they should have decent coordination (for kittens).When the kittens are trying to move or do something like eat, look for head tremors. This type of tremor is called an ""intention tremor,"" meaning it happens when they try to do something. This type of tremor is usually due to a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia. In some cats, it may not worsen, but in other cats, it may prevent them from eating and walking properly.
Also, when eating, the kitten should be enthusiastic.

, While you can look for obvious signs of sickness, a vet is better able to evaluate your kittens' health. In addition, you may need to keep the kittens separate from other animals in your household for a period if they are potentially contagious.

Don't forget your kitten will need vaccinations. They should start at about 2 months, but you can wait as long as 3 or 4 months., Get one litter box for each cat plus an extra, for a total of three litter boxes. Pick ones with low sides so your kittens can get in it. You'll also need a food bowl, a water bowl, beds, and collars or harnesses for your kittens. You'll also need kitten food to give the kittens, of course., At first, you should contain your kittens to a small area. A small room works, though you need to make sure to pull up or secure any cords or curtains/blinds strings so the kittens can't get them, as they can be hazardous.Separate the litter box and food/water bowls. They shouldn't be on the same side of the room.

, While the kittens are going to stay in a separate space for a bit, it's still a good idea to make your home kitten proof. Look for anything a kitten could get into, including strings, toxic plants, chemicals, cords, potpourri, and small toys., You'll need a carrier to bring the kittens home. It can help to spray it with a pheromone spray, which will calm the kittens. Also, place some treats and a blanket in the crate to help them feel more comfortable.You can find pheromone spray at most pet stores.

, When you get home, set the carrier in their room and open it up. Leave them alone for a while so they can come out and explore on their own. When you do venture in, do so quietly, and sit on the floor so they can approach you., Once the kittens seem comfortable in their tiny space and with the people in your family, you can let them out. Make sure the kittens are eating, drinking, and going to the bathroom regularly before giving them the full house. Also, keep the food and litter box in the same place for now., Kittens learn from watching each other. When one kitten figures something out, the other kitten will soon learn to do it. Letting them be together will help them figure out things quicker, such as grooming and using the litter box.They'll also learn cat-only behaviors from each other, such as how to talk to another cat and how to say hello to another cat., Kittens do well in pairs because it gives each kitten a companion to play with. Kittens naturally want to wrestle and play bite, and if a kitten doesn't have an animal companion, it'll bite on you instead. With two together, they each have someone to wrestle with. Plus, they can wear each other out."
"
Make a list of all the essentials.,
Make your house safe and fun.,
Ensure there are no potentially poisonous plants within reach.",How to Prepare for Kittens1," Begin your preparations for your new kitten by drawing up a list of all the essentials you need to have ready for the arrival. You can organise this list into toys, food, and litter tray supplies. A new kitten will want to play a lot so it's important that you provide plenty of toys for her. You don't have to buy expensive cat toys. Something as simple as a shoelace can be great fun for a kitten to play with.


Before you buy food, you should speak to the breeder or the place you are adopting the kitten from. It's best to give her the same food to make her more at home and avoid a potential upset stomach.
If you decide to change the food, do it gradually over about a week. Mix the two types of food together and progressively alter the ratio.Ensure you are providing food that is meant for kittens. Kittens use a lot of energy, so they need protein-rich kitten kibble until they are one year old.Get a litter tray that she can easily access, and place it somewhere quiet and easy to find.;
, When you get your kitten home you need to keep in mind that she may be frightened and overwhelmed. Start out by putting everything she needs in one room (litter box, toys, food, hiding place, scratch posts) and keep her confined there for a few days while she adjusts. One she seems confident, leave the door to the room open so she can explore the rest of the house.


Try not to overwhelm the kitten. Make sure you have provided her with a hiding place where she can retreat if she gets scared. If you have children, they should sit on the ground and allow the kitten to approach them.
If you are bringing her home from a shop, breeder, or rescue centre, ask if there is a blanket which she has been sleeping on. If so, you can ask to take this home so she has something familiar to sleep on., Part of making your house and garden safe for your new kitten, is checking that do you not have plants that can be poisonous, within reach of your kitten.You should also make sure that there are no plants treated with pesticides, or slug pellets lying around.Common plants that can be poisonous when ingested by an animal include the following:


Lillies, and Lily of the Valley. Cats are particularly sensitive to lily poisoning.

Don't just abandon the cat.",How to Plan and Prepare for Your New Cat," Cats are notoriously curious, and they will play with anything they can find. Look around your rooms to see what could pose a potential strangling hazard, such as the cords on blinds.Try cutting the cords at the bottom or undoing the knot so they aren't looped anymore. Some companies are making strangle-free blinds now, as it also poses a hazard to children.
Long drapes and tassels can become strangulation hazards, as can vertical blinds, if your cat catches its neck between slats.;
, Dangling cords, knickknacks, rubber bands, paper clips, and other small items can all be hazardous to cats and kittens. Consider moving cords out of reach or covering them in plastic tubing.Make sure to put things like rubber bands and paper clips into drawers or jars where your cat can't get them.
Knickknacks are harder. You can put them on higher shelves, but cats are great jumpers. You may need to put some knickknacks behind glass.

, Many household chemicals are toxic to cats. Think cleaners, pesticides, and car fluids, to name a few. Place all chemicals in cabinets where kitty won't be tempted to lick or drink them.Some chemicals, including some car fluids, taste sweet, which is why kitty may be tempted to lick them.
Another option is to keep them in places where your cat's not allowed, such as the garage.

, Many common household plants are toxic to cats. You would think that your cat would know which plants not to eat, but cats are curious and will often nibble on any plant they find.Some common toxic plants include (but is certainly not limited to) aloe, lilies, baby's breath, irises, and ivy.Move these plants to high ground or hang them from the ceiling. Also, be careful of falling leaves, as even those can be toxic. You can also move them to a room the cat doesn't go in or outside.

, It's pretty hard to keep pets off furniture, if that's your goal, but one way to help is to give your cat its own special beds. Even if you don't expect your cat to stay off the furniture, giving your cat its own bed can make it feel more comfortable.If you're trying to get the cat to stay off furniture, you'll need a bed in every room. It doesn't need to be a fancy cat bed. Even a nice, flat pillow will work or folded up blanket.
Consider putting them in spots cats will like, such as on window sills or in high-up places.

, An ID tag is important because it helps people return your cat to you should it ever run away. The ID tag should have the cat's name on it, if you've decided already, as well as some contact information for you, such as a phone number. Most pet stores have machines for making tags.Choose a breakaway collar, which will come apart if your cat gets it snagged on something. Your cat will lose the ID, but it won't be strangled by the collar.
Another option is a harness. A harness has a loop that goes around the neck and one that goes around the cat under the first set of legs. The two loops are attached by at least one strap down the back, though having a strap on the chest is a good idea, too. Harnesses are good because it's less likely your cat will be strangled by them, plus they're harder to wiggle out of.
Consider microchipping. A microchip is a small (think a grain of rice) chip placed under your cat's skin. If your cat is taken to a shelter or vet's, your cat's microchip can be scanned to find out your contact information.

, You'll need a container each for food and water. Stainless steel, ceramic, and glass are easiest to clean. You'll also need a litter box and litter.Ask the shelter where you get your kitten or cat what kind of food your using, as it's good to at least start them on the same food.
Some cats don't like bowls that are too deep or narrow, especially if it constricts their whiskers. Consider a fairly small, shallow bowl, at least at first.
If you know what litter the cat has previously used, it can help to use the same kind of litter in its new box. Some cats can be finicky about litter and litter boxes, so you may need to try several different kinds before figuring out what your cat likes.

, Toys help keep your cat entertained. In addition, they can provide distraction from destroying other items in your home. Make sure you have toys on hand, such as jingly toys and even string toys or ones with feathers. In addition, you may want a scratching post for your cat to sharpen i's claws on, rather than your furniture.The best scratching posts are sturdy and somewhat tall. It should be at least long enough for the cat to stretch out full length and sharpen its claws because cats often stretch out for the process.

, You'll of course need a brush for your cat. Most cats require regular brushing, though how often depends on the type of cat you have. You'll also need clippers to trim the cat's nails. A pair of pet claw trimmers works best for this purpose, which you can find at a pet store., You want to be ready to bring your pet home, and that means you need something to carry it in. The best option is a pet carrier. The sturdy, hard-sided plastic kind hold up longer, but the soft-sided kind will work.Make sure that it has good ventilation.
A hard-sided kind will also keep your cat safer in the car. The best place to put the carrier is behind the driver's or passenger's seat on the floor, if it will fit.

, If you've never had a cat before, you may want to get a book on owning cats so you understand the basics. If you don't want to buy one, consider checking one out form your local library., Sometimes, things happen, and your cat will get sick. When you do, it's a good idea to already have a vet, so you have a place to take it. Ask your friends with pets if they have any recommendations for vets. It's also a good idea to meet with the vet to see if you feel comfortable with him or her.In addition, you'll want to get your cat vaccinated if its not already, so having one in place is a good idea when you bring your cat home.
Don't forget, you'll also want to get your cat spayed or neutered if it's not already.

, This room will not always be the cat's room, but confining it to one place for a day or longer can make the cat feel safer. Then, once the cat ventures out, it can consider that its home base to return to, which will also make it feel more secure.If you let the cat roam free, it can seem like too much at first. Giving it one room gives it a chance to thoroughly explore that space before moving on to another.

, This home base will need a place for your cat to use the restroom. Make sure to include a litter box with litter inside it. When you first bring your cat in, open the crate near the litter box so it knows where it is., Of course, the cat will need to eat and drink, so it needs ot be in the same room with the litter box. However, try to separate the two, as most cats don't like to eat in the same place they go to the bathroom.Try putting the litter box and food on opposite sides of the room.
In addition to being preferable for you cat, it forces it to explore the whole room.

, Toys are always a good way to keep a cat entertained, especially if it's not ready to play with you quite yet. Jingly balls, scrunchy balls, and mice are all good toys for cats to play with, though you may want to keep any string-type toys for use when you can supervise., Many cats feel the need to hide away when they first get to a new place. Hiding gives them time to adjust, and it makes them feel safer. Therefore, make sure the room you choose has appropriate hiding places.For example, a cat tunnel or a cardboard box makes a good hiding place.
Underneath beds (as long as it's free from debris and dirt) is a good place, as is the closet.

, You've placed some beds around your house, but don't forget to add one to your cat's room, too. It will want a place to curl up, though it will probably make its own place even if you don't provide one.A blanket or towel in a cardboard box is great for the first few days. It provides a bed, and it gives the cat a place to hide away if it wants.

, Another purpose of giving your new cat its own space is to slowly introduce the cat to your other pets, if you have them. In that vein, it's a good idea to keep them out of the new cat's room for the first day or two. They can get to know each other's scents through the door, giving them time to start adjusting., The cat room is the place where you will get to know your cat. After the cat has had a few hours in the room, go inside and sit down. Talk soothingly the whole time, and don't make any sudden movements. You may need to do this several times over several days before the cat approaches.Let the cat come to you. Don't try to drag it out for cuddles.
If the cat approaches, let it smell you. You can also try to gently pet it, but it may run away.
Remember that each person in the house will need to spend time getting to know the cat.
You can also try playing with the cat to help it get to know you by waving a string toy around so it wants to come play.

Go to the pet store/neighbor's house, or wherever there is a litter of kittens that need adoption.,
Ask the owner how they have been treated, and if they have any medical conditions.,

Enjoy your cat.

",How to Select Just the Right Cat,";
, If the cat is old enough, ask to see documents confirming that it's had its shots and tested negative for FIV and other such viruses. Depending on the cat's age, you should also ask whether or not it's been spayed or neutered, and if not and you're adopting from a shelter or rescue, whether or not they will do so before placing the animal. Most good reputable organizations will not adopt out a ""whole"" animal that still might reproduce and create more unwanted pets.
, You should get an idea of which ones are mellow, and which ones are friendly. Enter the area where they are kept and sit down. Again, the friendly, curious ones will probably come up to you, and the shy, mellow ones will hang back. A tail between the legs is a sign that a cat or kitten is afraid - if so, don't push things. Try playing with them with a simple toy, and see which ones are energetic and playful, and which ones look like their future will consist of long naps in the sun. While hyperactivity may be cute in a kitten, consider what kind of cat you will want 10 years in the future.

, If they are, pick the one that seemed to like you the most, check its gender, and pay for it (or maybe you don't need to pay for the kittens). Kittens are usually best adopted out after 12 weeks of age, although there's no upper limit on how old a cat can be when you bring it home (shelters are often full of adult cats, and they're usually already litter-trained, too!).

, Cats sometimes come into shelters with another cat with whom they have already bonded, or form a bond while in the shelter. If separated they may suffer emotionally and have difficulty forming future bonds with other pets. If you are looking to adopt two cats, an already bonded pair is a good choice, as they will comfort each other through the stress of relocation.

, Pick out a name that fits your little bundle of furry joy.

, While you're waiting, you can make sure to purchase everything you'll need for it.

, You can order a tag online. Collars are available at any pet store in your area.
, If it already knows how to use one, make sure the first thing it finds is where the litter box is. Also, if your house is large, consider allowing the kitten to only explore one room at first, followed by another, and another until it knows its way around the entire house.

Determine important information about the mother.,
Find out about the kitten's medical status.,
Find a vet.",How to Prepare for Kittens2," Before you take your kitten, you should determine her medical and family background. There are some important questions to ask the breeder, rescue centre, or pet store before you buy a kitten. You should start by asking who bred the kitten, as well as inquiring about the health of the rest of the litter and the mother.


Specifically, you should find out if the mother has had her vaccinations and been wormed. If she hasn't, it is more likely that her kittens will have health problems.
Ask how many litters the mother has had. If it is a lot, this may indicate irresponsible breeding and may suggest that the breeders are not taking good care of her.
Ask if there are potential hereditary health problems that you should be aware of., As well as asking about the mother's medical condition, you should determine the medical status of the kitten before you take her home. Ask if the kitten has been wormed and has had her vaccinations. This should happen with veterinary supervision at an early stage, with the first vaccinations typically administered when she is eight or nine weeks old. Ensure you have the documentation from the vet to prove this.


Check if she has been microchipped. This is very important, and you can arrange for a vet to do this if the breeder hasn't done it yet.
Finally, you should ask some questions about the kitten's first weeks. Where has she been kept? Has she had much contact with people or other animals?
This information will help you understand your kitten. She will need plenty of contact with different people to become comfortable around humans., Before you bring her home it's sensible to find your local vet and give them a call to book her in for a check-up. All pets should be registered with a vet to help ensure they are taken good care of, and get all the necessary injections and veterinary care. When you take her in, be sure to bring documentation from the breeder and have any necessary vaccinations, or worming treatments carried out as soon as possible.


Your vet will also be able to give you guidance about nutrition and care.
You should also consider getting pet insurance before your kitten gets home.
Pet bills can be expensive and if you need to get vaccinations, it could be more economic to ensure you have insurance in place first.

Take your pregnant cat to the vet.,
Prepare a safe quiet place for the birth.,
Ensure you have the right supplies.,
Monitor the mother closely.",How to Prepare for Kittens3," As soon as you know, or suspect, that your cat might be pregnant, you should take her to the vets to get her checked over. The vet will examiner her, check on how her pregnancy is advancing, and give you guidance about how to care for her during the pregnancy. If your cat has any pre-existing health condition, or is overweight, it is especially important to take her to the vet.


You will need to increase the amount of food you provide for her as the pregnancy progresses.
Your vet can advise you on how to go about this in detail, but switching to kitten food in the third trimester is generally advised.
The vet will be able to give you an estimate of the number of kittens your cat is expecting.
It is possible that the vet will determine that the pregnancy could endanger your cat, and may decide that spaying her is the safest thing to do., It's essential that you provide a safe, warm and quiet area for her to give birth. You should have this birthing nest set up and ready to go at least a week before she is due. Introduce her to the nest early and make sure she knows about it. If she doesn't have a regular bed or box she likes to sleep in, just get a good sized cardboard box and put some warm blankets in it to make it comfortable.


Make sure you only use blankets you don't mind getting soiled. Don't use blankets that have a strong smell.Place a litter tray near to be box, but not right next to it. Keep the box a couple of feet away.
Ensure there is fresh water and food next to the box, but keep the bowls outside of the box., Once you have prepared the nest and the mother, you need to prepare yourself. Gather together all the supplies you might need if there are any problems with the birth. This way you can act quickly and provide the best possible care. Make sure you have plenty of clean and dry towels, which you might need to clean off the kittens. Get some cat-milk powder, and a kitten bottle, in case there is a problem with nursing.


Have a cat box ready to go in case you need to take her to vets in a hurry.
Keep the phone number of your vet handy. If there is a problem call up your vet for advice on how to proceed., Once labour begins you should monitor the mother closely. Stay nearby, but don't get too close. Don't invade her personal space, but being in the same room will let her know you are around and can help reassure her. You should be aware of certain warning signs that could indicate a problem with the birth. Knowing these will help you react quickly, so you can contact your vet is there are complications. There could be a problem if:


Half an hour after abdominal contractions have started, no kittens have been born.
Half an hour has gone by since the birth of a kitten, the contractions are continuing, but there is no indication of another kitten on the way.
A kitten has become stuck halfway during birth. In this case you may be able to apply some gentle pressure to the kitten, but if it doesn't move easily and immediately, contact a vet straight away.
There is a green or dark discharge from the mother before giving birth. If there is a discharge twelve hours after giving birth, contact your vet.
A kitten has not suckled for three hours."

Determine the cat's gender.,
Look at the cat's markings.,
Pick a name that everyone in the family will like.,
Pick a name that suits the cat's personality.,
Consider a historical, mythological, fictional or famous name.,
Make a list of possible names.,
Reinforce your choice.",How to Name Your Cat," You don't want to name your cat Princess and later discover it's a boy. Determining the gender of a newborn cat can be challenging, regardless of where you acquired the kitten. The best way to do so is by judging the relative distance between the anus and the urinary tract opening.;
, If there is a black splotch surrounding their eye, consider a name like Pirate. If your cat is completely black except for her white paws, consider the traditional but cute name, ""Boots"".

, If this will be a family cat, make sure to consider the kid's choices too. If the children want to name the kitten after himself/herself, you might not want to take him/her up on his suggestion. But if your sister or brother thinks of ""Peanuts"", for example, that's not a bad name. Have everyone make a list of three names they think are good options, then share the lists and come up with a name everyone will like.

, If the cat is always hiding, maybe he could be ""Bashful"". Or if your kitten has a weird habit of crying during thunderstorms, but only when lightning crashes, you could call him/her ""Lightning"".

, There are many interesting and unique names available in these categories.

, Once you've found one that you like best, stick to it to avoid confusion.

, Pet and spend time with the cat while saying its name over and over.

Ask them if they want a cat.,
Discuss if an older or younger cat is preferred.,
Inform them of the responsibility.,
Consider giving them cat supplies instead.",How to Responsibly Give a Cat As a Gift1," While you may want to keep the cat a surprise, it is best to actually ask the recipient first if they want a cat. Some people may be allergic to cats, or they may not be allowed to own a cat in their home. Others simply may not want a cat.You can say “So I know you have a birthday coming up, and I was wondering: do you want a cat as a gift?”
You might want to follow this up with another question, such as, “If you had a cat, what type of cat would you want?”
Even if they have been discussing getting a cat, you should still check to make sure that they are fine with you adopting one for them. Some people want to choose the cat themselves or they may be waiting for the right time to adopt.;
, The age of the cat is important to consider. Younger cats and kittens may be more energetic and playful, but they will require more time and attention. Older cats may be more mellow, but they might also be more independent.If the recipient works away from home for long periods of time, an older cat might be better. Kittens require extensive attention and supervision.
Senior citizens may do better with older cats as they generally require less supervision and care.
Kittens are great for enthusiastic pet owners who will love playing with them. The recipient should be able to give them the time that they need to socialize and exercise.

, Cats are a long-term commitment. They can live for up to twenty years, and their care can cost between $500 and $1000 a year.To make sure that the recipient is able to care for the cat, carefully discuss the cat’s care with them.


Cats need to be fed once or twice a day. Their water bowl must always be filled with fresh water, and they need regular grooming. They need a litter box with fresh litter, a scratching post, toys, and veterinary attention when they are sick.Cat care can take between thirty and sixty minutes a day.Cats can sometimes scratch up furniture or shed around the house. Make sure the recipient is prepared to deal with these issues.

, If the person is already considering adopting a cat, you may want to think about giving them some supplies to help them start out. This will let the person have time to find the right cat for their lifestyle, but it will still help out with the cost of owning a cat.Some things you might buy a new cat owner include:


A scratching post
A variety of cat toys
A week's supply of cat food
Water bowls with the cat’s name on it
A cat bed

Check your cat's coat for how thick it is.,
Feel the texture of your cat's fur.,
Notice your cat's body type.",How to Know Your Cat's Age1," Depending on what age your cat is, its coat may be more or less thick. Cats shouldn't go bald or lose their hair, but by determining just how full their coat is you can narrow down their age.The coat of an older cat may be more thin than that of a younger one.
Seasonal variations can occur. Summer coats are thinner than winter coats.
If your cat is losing fur, visit with your veterinarian.;
, There are some subtle differences in the texture of your cat's coat at different times in its life. By looking for these differences, you may be able to get a good sense of how old your cat is.


Young cats will have smooth and full coats of hair.Older cats will likely have coarser hair.
Some patches of gray hair may appear in older cats.

, As your cat ages, levels of activity will change. These changes to how active your cat is can lead to changes in its body shape. Judging the shape of your cat's body may give you a clue as to how old it is.Young cats tend towards being lean and muscular, due to their high levels of activity.
Middle age cats may be more filled out and round.
Older cats will likely have pronounced shoulder bones and loose skin.

Place the kitten in the litter box every couple of hours until it uses it.",How to Make a Kitten Feel at Home," Set your home up to make it kitten friendly and kitten proof before you even bring the cat into your home. Do a walk through your home looking for potential hazards for your kitten keeping these things in mind:Bathrooms can be hazardous places for adventuresome kittens. Keep cleaning supplies locked up and toilet lids down. Dental floss, rubber bands, hair ties and any string like material needs to be stashed away from curious kittens—they can ingest these and cause life threatening intestinal problems.
Kitchen cleaning supplies need to be kept out of reach of kittens. Plastic six pack beverage holders and plastic bags need to be discarded properly as kittens can get tangled and injured in these things.
Keep sewing supplies locked away including needles, pins and thread/yarn. Kittens can and will play with these hazardous things which can kill them if ingested.
Keep houseplants away from kittens, as some of them can be toxic. If you aren’t sure if your plant is or isn’t look on-line.
Kids toys made of soft material (foam, rubber) are kitty magnets—they can chew and ingest small bits leading to serious stomach issues.
Human medication should always be kept safely out of reach.
Electric cords are fun for kittens to chew on; not so fun on their health with the chance for electrocution if it is bit through to the wires.
Windows make fun spots for the kitten to look out. Make sure you have sturdy screens or keep the windows closed tight. Blind or curtain strings and ties can strangle a kitten if it gets caught up on them. Shorten them or remove them.
Put any toxic items, such bleach, rat or mice bait, lye, etc., locked away where a kitten cannot get into them and bit at the packaging.
Kittens love to crawl into tiny spots—look around and see if there are any dangerous spots (crawl spaces, spaces around pipes running into or out of house, sump pump holes) and block them if possible.;
, Ask the previous owner if you can take a blanket or stuffed toy that the kitten and mother have used so that the kitten will have something to cuddle in or with that would have it’s mother scent on it.


You can also use Feliway a product with pheromones--chemicals that cat’s produce to communicate with and calm other cats. This comes in various forms such as a spray, wipes, collar or a diffuser.

, Grab a small cardboard box cut the top off, and stick a warm, cozy blanket in there. Alternately, buy a small cat basket with a nice cozy pad.

, The kitchen or living room are usually good rooms. Your kitten will need a safe spot to retreat in case the hustle and bustle of the house gets to be too much.


Before you get the kitten, think where you are going to put its bed. Do not make it sleep on your bed for the first month because it isn't quite used to you yet and it will be uncomfortable, or it might fall off.

, The litter box should have very short sides (around 2-3 inches). Your kitten will need this short litter box until it is about 3-4 months old or when it is tall enough to graduate to a full sized litter box.Place a layer of litter, whatever brand you choose, in the bottom of the box. You may want to use a rug, newspaper, or a bed protector pad under the box to catch any litter that sticks to the kitten’s paws.

, Cats and kittens don’t like to eat near their bathroom any more than a human does. Make sure the food you are feeding her is a kitten food, not an adult cat food as they are rapidly growing and need more calorie and nutrient dense food than adult cats.The litter box should be placed near the basket for now. As the kitten gets used to the home, it can be gradually moved to a more preferred location for you but for now a tiny kitten needs easy access to her box.

, Small fur toy mice and feather wands are favorites of most cats. Catnip will not be needed for a young kitten as they don’t develop a response to it until they are much older.

, Do not pull the kitten out of the cat carrier right away; leave it in there with the door open and allow it to exit the carrier at its own pace. Make sure it sees its food and water bowl. This may motivate the kitten to leave its carrier and explore.


When the kitten does come out, gently pick it up and place it in the litter box to give it an opportunity to go to the bathroom. If the kitten doesn’t go, at least it will know there is a litter box for it use.

, If you have other pets in the house, keep the kitten in its own room (along with litter box, bed, food and water) for a week before introducing him to the other pets. If you have small children, instruct them to be very gentle when they pick up, hold, or play with the kitten to avoid injury to either the kitten or kid.

, Just let it take its time and it will get used to you and the house soon. Keep the kitten in one room (unless you are there to watch carefully) and other pets away from the kitten for a week before introducing the cat to the other pets.


After a while, try playing with the kitten but don't force it to do anything it doesn't want to do. It should come out soon enough, and don't panic if it comes out of the pet carrier and hides under something. Let the kitten explore the room. It will have a lot of sniffing to do.

, Kittens are pretty smart and will take to using the litter box in no time. That is, as long as they can get into it, it’s cleaned daily (scooped), and it’s in a quiet spot."

Talk to their parents first.,
Assess their age.,
Choose an adult cat.,
Teach the child how to handle cats.,
Take on the commitment yourself.",How to Responsibly Give a Cat As a Gift2," If you are giving the cat to a child who is not your own, it is absolutely crucial that you talk to their parents first. The parents will be assuming most of the responsibility for the care and cost of the cat.You can say, “I know Jenny has been wanting a cat, and I was thinking of giving her a kitten for her birthday. Do you think that’s a good idea?”

, Age and maturity are important factors to consider before giving a child a cat or any pet as a present. The child should be old enough to understand how to properly approach and handle a cat.


Young children under the age of six cannot be expected to care for the cat themselves. You should carefully teach them how to pet the cat as well as how to leave the cat alone when the cat doesn’t want to play.
Children under the age of 12 may or may not be able to help out with caring for the cat. In general, you should encourage the child to help feed and play with the cat, but the adult should still be handling most of the care responsibilities.Teenagers can be expected to help care for the cat. They may be better equipped for a kitten than younger children. That said, if the teenager does not care for the cat, you must step in.

, Kittens are playful and adorable, but they can be easily injured by children who do not know how to handle them. For children, it is better to adopt an adult cat. Aim for a cat around two or three years of age, especially for children under the age of six., Before you give the cat as a present, you may want to introduce your child to a friend’s cat or a cat at the shelter. Show them how to properly handle cats. Have them hold out their hands for the cat to sniff before they try to pet the cat.


The child should be sitting when you first bring the cat to them. Let the cat sniff them. If the cat is relaxed, you can place the cat on the child’s lap.
Teach the child that when the cat’s tail is wagging, it may mean that the cat is irritated.Older children should learn how to properly lift the cat from the ground. Show them how to scoop under the cat with one hand and support their back legs with the other.

, If the child ends up neglecting their cat care duties, you will have to care for the cat yourself. Make sure that the cat is properly fed and socialized.Never neglect the cat as a way to teach the child responsibility. This only ends up harming the cat. Understand when you adopt a cat for a child, you are assuming the responsibility for the cat yourself.
No matter how well the child takes care of the cat, the adult will be responsible for all bills related to food, toys, medical care, and bedding.

Wait until after the holidays.,
Give a gift certificate.,
Go with them to pick out the cat.,
Avoid wrapping the cat.",How to Responsibly Give a Cat As a Gift3," The holidays can be a hectic time in a household, and it may be the wrong environment to introduce a new cat. Instead, try to wait until after the holidays when both you and the recipient can go visit animal shelters together.If you want to give them the cat as a present, you can give them a card that says, “Happy Holidaysǃ Since you have been wanting a cat for so long, I’m going to pay for the adoption fees.”
You might also give them a printed or handmade “coupon” that says, “Redeemable for one adopted cat from the shelter as paid for by me.”

, Some animal shelters offer gift certificates that the recipient can use to adopt their own cat. This will let the recipient decide if they want to adopt or not. They will also be able to pick out their own cat.If they don’t end up using the certificate, consider it a donation made in their name to the animal shelter. It is still a nice gift.

, Choosing a pet can be a very personal decision. While it is less of a surprise, it is still a nice gesture to go to the shelter with your friend to let them pick the cat that they want. You can offer to pay for the cat’s adoption fees as the gift.Letting the recipient pick out the cat themselves will help make sure that the cat is a good fit for their lifestyle and personality. This will reduce the chance that the cat will be returned to the shelter.

, If the other person or child has decided that they want to be given a cat, you should skip wrapping the cat. Even if you poke holes in a box, it may cause distress to the cat. Furthermore, if the cat eats the box or wrapping paper, they will have to go to the vet. Instead, try keeping the cat secured in another room until it is time to give the gift.


You can have the recipient sit on the couch with their eyes closed while you bring the cat out. You can keep the cat in the carrier or try to place the cat on their lap.
Don’t stick the cat in a closet or unventilated garage. Keep them in a bathroom or bedroom for a short period of time before the unveiling."

Watch your cat's mood.,
Monitor your cat's litter-box usage.,
Notice your cat's sleep patterns.",How to Know Your Cat's Age2," Older cats are more likely to have decreased vision and hearing as well as suffer from pain caused by arthritis. These conditions can have an effect on your cat's mood. If you notice your cat displaying these behaviors, it can be an indication that it is either ill, in the later stages of its life, or both:Your older cat may act overly aggressive when you interact with it.
Fear and anxiety can increase in older cats as well.

, If your cat has any problems using the litter-box, it may indicate a few different issues. Specifically, older cats may have trouble using the litter box due to health issues or decreased ability to handle stress.Some health issues that can cause trouble in older cats when using the litter-box are decreased vision, inflammatory bowl disease, and kidney or liver diseases.
Stress can cause an older cat to not use its litter-box. Try to make its environment as calm as you can.

, In most cats, as their age increases, so to will the amount of sleep it requires. You should also keep track of when it sleeps, looking for any changes to its schedule as it ages.Older cats may stay up all night and sleep during the day. Older cats may also howl at night.
As cats age, their activity levels drop and they will spend more time sleeping. Younger cats will be more active, playing during the day, while older cats will want to rest.

Look for any clouding.,
Examine the iris.,
Monitor the eyes for discharge or tears.",How to Know Your Cat's Age3," As your cat ages, its eyes may turn from being bright and clear to cloudy and dull. By examining the degree of cloudiness or clearness in your cat's eyes, you can get a better understanding of how old your cat is.Clear and bright eyes will indicate that your cat is likely young.
Older cats may have cloudy eyes due to age itself or the development of cataracts.

, The iris is the colorful part of the eye that surrounds the pupil. By examining the iris, you can learn the approximate age of your cat. Look for any signs of jaggedness or roughness in the iris as you investigate.Younger cats will have clean and smooth irises.
As cats age, their irises will become thinner and strands will start to appear in the iris, along with pigment patches.

, A sign of both age and health, the tear ducts in your cat's eyes can be a great place to check up on your cat. At times, due to either aging, illness, or injury, its eyes may become overly runny. Runny eyes, as well as injury and illness, are more likely to be found in older cats, which can help you indicate your cat's age.Younger cats should not have noticeable tears or discharge.
Older cats may have apparent tearing or discharge from their eyes.
Runny eyes can also be a sign of illness or injury, so check with your veterinarian.

Count your cat's teeth.,
Look for yellowing of your cat's teeth.,
Check your cat's teeth for signs of wear and tear.",How to Know Your Cat's Age4," As your cat ages, it will go through different stages of dental development. When your cat is relaxed and comfortable, try identifying the types of teeth it has to get an idea of how old your cat is.


The first teeth to grow in a kitten are the incisors (around 2-4 weeks) and canines (around 3-4 weeks), followed by the premolars (around 4-6 weeks).
A cat younger than around four months will not yet have its molars.
From the ages of around six months up to one year, your cat will have all of its adult teeth. At this point the cat's teeth should be white and have no signs of wear.

, As your cat ages, its teeth will start to show signs of that aging. Yellowing of the teeth can indicate that you cat is an older adult. The degree of wear and yellowing will indicate just how old your cat is likely to be.You can expect to see slight yellowing in your cat's teeth at around two years of age.
At ages three to five years old, your cat will have increased yellowing in its teeth.
Between the ages of five to ten, yellowing will be easily visible.
When your cat is ten or older it will show clear signs of yellowing, likely on all teeth.

, Another indication of age that can be seen in your cat's teeth is how worn down they are. Carefully examine your cat's teeth to look for any areas that may be worn to help you determine how old your cat might be.


Worn down teeth will have lost their points, appearing more dull than in a younger cat.
Some teeth may have the points either worn or broken off.
Generally your cat will begin to show signs of tooth wear when it is five years old.
If your cat is between five and ten years old, teeth will show clear signs of wear.
At ages of ten years and beyond, heavy wearing down of the teeth will be apparent. Some teeth may be missing at these ages.
The older a cat is, the more likely it is have to have dental tartar and gum recession. This is a vague tool for aging because how quickly the teeth become dirty depends on the cat's diet.

Groom your cats with the same brush.,
Place one cat’s scent objects in another cat’s area.,
Rub your cats’ faces with your own to become part of the group.,
Avoid forcing two groups within your home to interact.",How to Encourage Group Scent in Multi‐Cat Households1," Owner-facilitated allogrooming, or grooming multiple cats with the same brush, can transfer scent particles between your cats. Brush each cat daily, and don’t clean or remove hair from the brush until after you’ve groomed each cat. When you brush your cat, give it calming verbal praise, and don't hold it down or force it to be brushed.Grooming with one brush could make a cat feel like the scents of the other cats are being forced on it, especially when it's not already familiar with the other cats.
If your cats seem stressed, resist being brushed, or aren't already familiar with each other, avoid using the same brush to groom them all.;
, Some cat behaviorists advise against the brushing method, especially if a group scent isn’t already established. If it gives you trouble, or if your cats aren't familiar with each other, rub a sock on one cat’s face, then place it near the bedding or food of another cat.When your cats start to ignore or act calmly around each other's scent objects, pet them, offer lots of verbal praise, and give them small treats. Using rewards will help create positive scent associations.

, Cats have scent glands on their mouth and head, and they rub faces in order to exchange scent particles. Get down on the same level as your cats to rub their faces and transfer scents between you and each cat.Like grooming, transferring scents between you and the group will help encourage a group scent and establish your place within the group.
Be sure to spend equal amounts of time with each cat to avoid showing favoritism.

, Sometimes, two or more sub-groups of cats can form within one home. You can encourage them to coexist by providing each group with plenty of their own food, water, and other resources. Avoid trying to establish a common scent between the groups or forcing them to interact with each other.To identify distinct social groups, look for which cats sleep and groom together. Take note if some cats stay in certain places and avoid spots that other cats frequent.In addition to providing plenty of resources, prevent competition by dividing your attention equally between the social groups.

",How to Encourage Your Cat to Go to Sleep," A cat's natural instincts is to hunt, catch, kill, and eat their prey. This is followed by a period of rest. Recreating this scenario by playing with your cat can regulate their energy levels to meet yours. Use interactive toys like wand toys, laser pointers, or hiding toys to hunt to tire your cat out. Be sure to create a play environment that gives your cat room to run, climb, and jump.


You should play with your cat at least 15 minutes every day and twice a day if possible.;
, Bored cats can be restless, exhibit inappropriate behaviours, and become aggressive. Exercise or play will help solve some unwanted behaviours such as not allowing you to sleep at night by being aggressive, meowing throughout the night, or causing a ruckus around the house. You want to keep your cat busy and active during the day, so that they don't accumulate pent up energy. There are several ways to do this:


Play hard then rest, and play hard again. Cats are built for short spurts of energy and a good play session consists of several highs and lows. Play into this by tiring out your cat for a few minutes, letting it rest, and then restarting play again and repeat. The time it takes for your cat to tire itself out will decrease the longer you play.
Act as prey. Playing is more than just waving a toy in your cat's face. This can be more annoying than fun for your cat. Mimic a prey's movements by moving the toy away from your cat, darting behind objects to hide, or jumping away from your cat.
Kittens are much more active than adult cats. It may take an hour or longer to tire them out.

, Some cat owners might be working all day or don't have enough time to play with their cats. A good way to incorporate play and encourage activity throughout the day is to provide your cat with things to do and see at home without you. You can try:


Hiding toys or treats around the house. This teaches your cat to hunt and is a good form of play when you're not around.
Turn on Cat T.V. This might mean keeping your television on with the nature channel for your cat to watch. Or putting bird feeders by windows for your cat to bird-watch.

, Another way to keep your cat busy and also encourage good behaviour, is to train you cat. Cats usually repeat an action if it produces a positive consequence or a reward at the end. This is different from training an animal what not to do, which relies on giving an animal negative consequences for negative behaviours. Cats don't do well with negative consequences or punishments which can encourage more aggressive or unwanted behaviours.Try:



Clicker training. Using a small plastic device with a metal strip that makes a loud clicking noise when pressed, you can condition your cat to associate the sound with a positive reward. Every time your cat does something you want, be sure to ""click"" immediately upon performing the action, and then giving it a treat or their favourite food. There are many ways to clicker train. One way is to start clicker training by giving your cat a treat right at the moment you click. In the end, your cat will understand that a ""click"" means a ""treat"".

Leash training. If your cat is an indoor cat, consider taking your cat outside for a walk or just to explore. This is a safer way for indoor kitties to explore the wild. Start by purchasing a harness for cats or a small harness for dogs, and a leash. Never use collared leashes as this can restrict a cat's airway or hurt their neck. Collared leashes also provide you with less control over your cat, especially if they scare easily and bolt off. Put the harness on your cat indoors first to let it get used to the feel of it. This may take a few days or weeks until your cat can walk properly with a harness on. You can train it to follow you indoors with clicker training or just follow it around with their leash on. Eventually, you can introduce it to the outside world.With any training, it is important to be patient and to understand your cat's personality. Some cats do very well with training, some cats may take weeks to months before they can be trained, and some have personalities that don't do well with training. For example, a fearful cat would not do well with leash training and wearing a harness or going outside.

, If you are leaving food out for your cat to eat and graze on, it might be time to consider scheduling feeding times instead. When your cat has access to food whenever they want, they will be in a constant state of digestion and that can make it difficult for you to predict your cat's energy levels and have it match yours.


Having scheduled meal times is very beneficial to your cat's health. It can manage weight and obesity issues and inform you of any health problems that may arise. A change in eating habits could go unnoticed when you're free feeding and that could mean missing symptoms of illnesses.
Kittens eat much more and more frequently than adult cats. It's generally recommended you feed your kitten whenever they're hungry. In these cases, free-feeding is often recommended.

, It is important you do this process slowly and consistently. Going cold turkey could upset your cat and cause health or behavioural problems. You will notice a difference in your cat's energy and behaviour within a few weeks of serving scheduled meal times. There are several ways to transition your cat from free feeding to scheduled meal times:


Put away food for short periods of time. You can start by putting your cat's food bowl away when you leave for work or when you're out on an errand. Then put it back down when you return. Put the food away for longer periods of time as the days go by until they match the feeding schedule that's right for you and your cat.
Decrease the amount of free-food available everyday until there is no more. At the same time, serve the remaining amount to your cat as meals.
Feed wet food meals. Wet food tends to be eaten right away and is easier fed as a meal. As well, wet food provides moisture and has a higher protein content than some dry foods. Consult your veterinarian or pet diet specialist to find the best type of food for your cat.
If you have a busy schedule, consider purchasing an automatic feeder. You can schedule this device to serve meals to your cat when you're not there. There are automatic feeders that serve dry food and wet food.

, It is recommended that you feed your cat 3 times a day and schedule meals no longer than 6-8 hours between each one.The goal is to feed small measured portions of food that is eaten within 5 to 10 minutes. After each meal, your cat will typically groom itself, then rest. Try to schedule your cat's last meal so that their rest period coincides with yours. This will take some observation and a few days or weeks to establish a new feeding schedule.


Always consult with your veterinarian and read the feeding guidelines provided by your cat's food to figure out how much and what to feed your cat. Generally, you want to feed your cat a high protein diet with little to no grains. Typically, an adult cat should eat 30 calories of food per pound while kittens will eat much more.
Cats are designed to eat small portions throughout the day. Think of a cat in the wild who would spend most of its time catching small rodents. By feeding smaller portions more frequently, you are replicating a cat's natural cycle to hunt, catch, kill, and eat its prey.
If your cat tends to wake you up early for food, avoid feeding it right when you get up. Do it after you've showered or made your coffee to break this habit and schedule. Instead of equating breakfast with you getting up, your cat will understand that breakfast comes after other morning activities.

, Cats are known for their love of routine. By having a routine that ends with you sleeping, your cat will eventually be able to understand the signs of bedtime. Be sure to do the same activities in the same order every night; brush your teeth, change your clothes, make the bed, and turn off the lights.


Even if your cat isn't watching you, sounds of your bedtime routine will travel throughout the home.

, Set aside certain fun activities that your cat enjoys that only happen before bedtime. You can:


Groom your cat.
Cuddle in bed.
Brush your cat's teeth.
Feed special treats.
Lead your cat to their sleeping area.

, The first few days or weeks may be difficult for both you and your cat, especially if you have a restless or aggressive cat. Your cat might come up to you for pets or whine at you for hours. And then you may be tempted to get up and tend to your cat. By doing this, you are giving it attention that encourages unwanted behaviour from you cat, even if you're giving it positive attention. By ignoring your cat night after night, you are telling your cat that no matter what they do, nothing will happen. Their unwanted behaviour should eventually stop.


Avoid getting up to get a drink of water or to use the washroom. Plan ahead as much as possible until your cat establishes the routine of going to sleep.
Consider leaving your cat outside of the bedroom. In some cases, your cat may be too difficult to ignore while they are in the room. Do not give in and open the door for it or talk to it from inside the room.

, Establishing a bedtime routine with your cat may take a few weeks and you may need to make a few sacrifices. With any behavioural training, time and patience is always the key.


Even though you are trying to change your cat, you will also have to change. Sometimes pet training is more about compromise than about the success of learning a new behaviour. Remember, your cat is also a living thing with feelings, thoughts, preferences, and a unique personality.

Schedule regular playtime with your cat.,
Allow your kitten to continue playing when you’re done.,
Encourage your older and overweight cat to move around.,
Make your cat search for his food.,
Provide exercise incentives with catnip.,
Train your cat to walk on a leash.,
Consider getting your cat a playmate.,
Take your cat to a pet physical therapist.",How to Exercise a Cat1," Try to schedule 10 to 15 minutes of playtime with your cat on a daily basis. If it’s the same time every day, your cat will come to expect it and may come to you looking to play., Kittens are usually very frisky and hyper and will likely play on their own for hours. If your kitten plays at a time that doesn’t work for you (like the middle of the night when you’re trying to sleep), alter her play schedule by initiating play at a time that works for you.If your kitten keeps you up at night, try playing with her an hour or so before your bedtime. When you are ready to go to bed, your kitten should be tired enough to also want to calm down.

, Older cats, or those that are overweight, will probably not want to play very often or for very long. Since it’s in their best interest to exercise, encourage your older or overweight cat to move around every day.Exercise doesn’t have to be elaborate. Simply encouraging your older or overweight cat to walk around the house, or go up and down the stairs, is helpful.
If you find a toy or a type of exercise that your older or overweight cat really enjoys, remember it and repeat that activity over and over.
If you are trying to get an overweight cat to be more active, you might want to check with your veterinarian first to ensure you don’t do anything that may injure your cat., A great way to get an overweight cat to exercise is to hide his food in small portions around the house. In order to make him work to find her food every day, don’t hide the food in the same places all the time.Hiding spots can be on top of a cat tree, under a bed, on different levels of the house, on a windowsill, etc.

, Catnip is a herb that some cats find irresistible. If your cat is attracted to catnip, sniffing and eating the catnip can cause your cat to become more active and playful. If your cat isn’t interested in playing, provide her with some catnip to get her going., Cats do not naturally take to a leash like a dog will, but if your cat is willing to try, it could be a fun exercise option for both you and your cat.Start by putting a harness on your cat and leading him inside the house. Let him wear the harness for a little while and then take it off. Give your cat treats to reinforce the proper behaviour.
Slowly progress until your cat can stay outside on a leash for a decent period of time without being scared. Constantly reinforce good behaviour with treats.
If your cat gets scared or stressed at any point in the process, stop. If he continues to get scared or stressed after trying the same step several times, it’s possible your cat may never walk on a leash.
Once your cat can stay outside on a leash without being scared, take him for a short walk. Increase the length of the walk as needed.

, Individual kittens will find a way to play by themselves for hours, but adult cats may get bored on their own. If you’re away from home for long periods of time, you might want to consider getting your only cat a playmate.It’s usually easier to introduce kittens to each other than to introduce an adult cat to another adult cat, or a kitten to an adult cat. Be sure to introduce new cats to your household slowly to avoid fighting and aggression.

, Physical or rehabilitation therapists exist for pets and can be a great way to learn the best options for your specific cat. Plus a therapist will have exercise equipment (like an underwater treadmill) that you won’t be able to get at home."

Learn the medical reasons why cats demonstrate undesirable behavior.,

Understand that your can may not truly be misbehaving.,
Familiarize yourself with how cats learn.,
Learn what disciplinary actions will not work.,
Bond with your cat in fun and rewarding ways.,
Make the bad behavior undesirable or impossible.,
Make the good behavior extremely rewarding.",How to Discipline Your Cat or Kitten," As much you might want to think that your cat is doing something bad simply out of spite, there may be a medical or behavioral reason why she’s doing what you don’t want her to do. For example, your cat may be going outside of the litter box because of a urinary problem (urinary tract infection, kidney disease) that keeps her from making it to the litter box in time. Your veterinarian will be able to determine if a medical problem is the root cause of the undesirable behavior.Pica is a medical issue that involves eating or chewing on inedible objects, like plastic or cardboard. If your cat is chewing on or eating unusual things, it may be a sign of dental or gastrointestinal disease.Dementia could be causing your cat to cry at night.Medical issues should be ruled out before behavioral issues are considered.;
, If your veterinarian has been able to rule out medical causes of bad behavior, then it is time to start looking more closely at your cat’s behavior. One behavioral cause of bad behavior in cats is stress. Cats do not adjust well to change (new house, new pet, new baby), so changes in their environment can easily stress them out, causing them to scratch furniture, spray urine, etc.Your cat may be acting out if she’s bored.If your cat does not have enough toys to play with or doesn’t get the attention she wants from you, she may find other things to do out of boredom, like tearing up toilet paper. Keep in mind that she probably does not realize that the behavior is wrong; she’s simply doing something to keep her busy.
Your cat may misbehave if she hasn’t been properly trained.Although cats are typically very smart, they still need to be trained to do the right thing. If she has not been trained, she will not know what’s right and what’s wrong and will essentially do as she pleases.

, Keep in mind that behaviors you may consider acting out — such as scratching furniture — are simply a normal part of cat behavior. Instead of punishment, you might think about ways to provide the cat with a more appropriate outlet for that behavior, such as providing multiple scratch posts.

Make sure you are providing your cat with an interesting, enriching environment. Puzzle feeders, scratch posts, toys, climbing towers, and engaging in active play every day are all ways your cat can redirect the behavior.

, How cats learn is a simple concept: they repeat experiences that are good and avoid the experiences that are bad.It is very important to remember that cats do not learn by punishment. Instead of teaching her that what she is doing is wrong, punishment will leave your cat feeling confused and fearful. She will probably want to avoid you, which will weaken your bond with her., As just mentioned, punishment will not get your cat to stop the bad behavior. Yelling and hitting your cat are forms of punishment that you should never use to discipline her.In addition, using a spray water bottle is generally frowned upon as a way to discipline cats, although many cat owners use it.


Although you may think that spraying water on your cat will deter her from the bad behavior, she is actually learning to perform that behavior when you are not around. Use of the spray bottle can also make her fearful and wary of you.Rubbing your cat’s nose in her urine if she goes outside of her litterbox is an ineffective disciplinary method. It actually reminds her of a good spot to go to the bathroom.Scruffing should not be used as punishment. It can be a method to disrupt bad behavior, but is not an effective method to punish your cat., It may not seem like bonding with your cat will help stop her bad behavior, but the extra attention and playtime may divert your cat’s energy away from misbehaving. One of the goals of increasing your bonding time is to decrease the negative reprimands and punishments that you may be giving her.The more that she enjoys your company and trusts you, the less likely she will misbehave because of stress or boredom.


In addition to playing with her more, you can also try giving her massages., Since cats learn by avoiding an experience that has a negative result, you want to attach a negative association to whichever bad behavior she is doing. For example, if she is scratching your sofa, you would discipline her by making the sofa difficult to scratch. Putting double-sided tape or aluminum foil on the sofa are helpful deterrents.Making aspects of her environment undesirable when you are not around is called ‘environmental punishment.’If your cat likes to jump on the countertops or table, try balancing a cookie sheet or baking sheet on the edge of those surfaces. When she jumps up, the baking or cookie sheet will fall to the floor and make a loud noise. She won’t like the loud noise, and landing on an uneven surface will throw off her balance. Eventually, she will learn not to jump up where she’s not supposed to.If your cat keeps on eating your plants or urinating in the soil, make the plant undesirable by spraying bitter apple or bitter orange on the plant leaves. You can also cover the dirt with aluminum foil or gravel.Commercially available deterrent devices can also make bad behavior undesirable. Examples of these devices include upside-down mousetraps that spring into the air when touched and motion-activated devices that spray a blast of compressed air. These devices are available at your local pet store and are useful to keep your cat from going into areas where she is not allowed., The more positive reinforcement your give your cat for doing the right thing, the more likely she is to repeat the good behavior.For example, when you see her using her scratching post instead of scratching your furniture, reward her with extra playtime, verbal praise or edible treats. Make sure to reward her while she is doing the good behavior, rather than afterwards, or she may not understand what she is being rewarded for.

You'll need to spend time with your cat. Make sure you'll be able to keep her stimulated and play with her every day.If you have other pets already (especially cats), consider how they'll interact with another cat.;
, In addition to attention, your cat will need clean water, food, and shelter. Decide whether or not you'll keep your cat strictly indoors. If so, create a space for the cat to rest, eat, and toilet. Make sure your cat always has access to fresh clean water and feed her a high-quality cat food.


Consider the cost of buying food, litter supplies, any medications, and possible veterinary care. Make sure you're willing to spend money on maintaining the cat., If you have children or small kids, think about how they'll do around the cat. You should choose a cat that's proven to be good around small children, if you're concerned. You'll also need to teach your small kids how to treat the cat. If the cat is small or shy, you don't want the kids to frighten or injure her.For example, you'll need to teach the kids how to play nicely with the cat. This way, they won't unintentionally harm the cat.

, Since most shelters and humane societies end up with a variety of cats, you might want to go with a particular breed in mind. If you're set on a certain breed, you can also contact a breeder or cat fancier to ask if they're retiring any of their breeding or show cats. Keep in mind that purebred cats may have a high chance of having inheritable diseases.Purebreds are prone to eye problems, skin problems and metabolic problems like diabetes and hyperthyroidism., If you're looking for an adult cat, you probably want a cat who's not overly energetic. Think about if you're looking for an older cat who's not terribly active and sleeps most of the day, or if you'd like one who's still active and playful.


Study the personalities of the cats that are available for you to buy or adopt. Really spend some time paying attention to how well they interact with each other, their energy levels (how much they sleep), and if they are good with people.

, The cat's ears should be healthy and free of dirt. Dirty ears can indicate an infection or ear mites. The cat's ears should not smell bad. Look for obvious signs of ear infection which include:Redness
Discharge
Ear Scratching
Head Shaking
Rubbing ears on hard surfaces

, The teeth should be clear from any tartar or calculus (brown residue that sticks to the teeth around the gum line). If the cat is over five years old, you may see a small amount of tartar on the big canine teeth and the teeth may be stained yellow. Other dental problems include sores in the mouth and drooling.Don't forget to check the gums, especially where they meet the teeth. The gums shouldn't be red or swollen.

, The cat's nose should not have any mucus or discharge and she shouldn't be sneezing or coughing. If the cat's nose is wet from licking, it's fine. It's also alright if the nose is dry, which could mean that she was sitting in the sun or just in a warm area.The cat shouldn't be wheezing or having difficulty breathing., The eyes should be bright and have no discharge from them or around them. She should be able to completely open them and be able to focus normally.


Test the cat's tracking vision by dragging a string or feather toy across the floor. Make sure the cat can follow it with her eyes., Part the hair and look at the skin. It should be clear and smooth. If you see redness, itchiness, or signs of fleas, the cat probably hasn't been properly cared for and you may want to choose a different seller.


An adult cat's fur will seem glossier than a kitten's. Make sure there are no bald spots or signs of scratching.

, Body condition refers to the cat's overall shape, especially her belly size. Most veterinarians use a 9 point scale to grade your cat's condition. The cat should score around a 5. This means you should be able to see her waist and ribs, but her belly shouldn't protrude. She should be a healthy weight.An extended belly can mean the cat has an untreated worm infestation or a serious condition like heart or liver disease.
A score of 1 would be severely underweight while a 9 would be very overweight.

, Many sellers or shelters will spay or neuter cats before adoption. If not, you'll probably want to get this done within a month of bringing the cat home. You should also make sure the cat is litter box trained and that her stools are firm.


Loose stools or stool around her bottom might mean the cat has diarrhea. Don't forget to ask to see the litter box so you can check for this.
Watch to see if the cat licks her genital area often (especially if a female cat). This might indicate a urinary tract infection.

, Start your search at the local humane or animal rescue society. See what cats they currently have available. Shelters and humane societies provide good health care to all animals in their care. The animals usually get a full veterinary examination, vaccinations, and are spayed or neutered.Shelters and humane societies will not knowingly adopt out a sick cat. They'll often take back a cat within a few days of adoption if it gets sick.

, Regardless of where you get your cat from, you should make sure the cat has been checked for feline leukemia and feline infectious peritonitis. Do not take a cat that tests positive for these into your home without consulting with your veterinarian.You should also ask to see the veterinary records for the cat to make sure all vaccinations are up to date.

, If you think you've found a cat you'd like to bring home, spend at least a few hours with her. This will give you a chance to play with her and see her true temperament.Adult cats may develop bad behaviors and you need to make sure the cat is friendly with you. You should also feel comfortable around her.


Spending time with the cat will give you an opportunity to see her vices. For example, she may bite or growl at you.

, If you do decide that the cat is healthy and friendly enough to take with you, bring the cat (and her health records) to your veterinarian within three days of taking her home with you. The veterinarian will want to meet her and do a thorough examination.


During this exam, ask the veterinarian to have the cat's vaccinations updated and to have her stool checked for worms and parasites.

, Remember, it's okay to take your time when choosing a pet. If you don't see a cat you'd like to adopt, give it some time and return later. Or, if you're unsure what kind of cat you'd like, spend more time playing around cats till you discover what you're looking for.


Only adopt a cat when you're certain you will care for her and provide her a permanent home.

Try to schedule vet appointments for all your cats at once.,
Keep a cat that’s been hospitalized in a separate room.,
Use bedding and toys to reestablish the separated cat’s scent.,
Try using a pheromone diffuser.",How to Encourage Group Scent in Multi‐Cat Households2," Vet offices are full of strange smells, like antiseptics, medications, and other animals. You can prevent isolating one cat and disrupting the group scent by bringing your cats to the vet for routine check-ups and vaccinations at the same time.If one cat gets sick or if you own too many cats to transport them together, you can still take steps to gradually reintroduce a cat back into the group.

, A cat that has been to the vet, been hospitalized overnight, or otherwise spent time away from home will smell different, and other cats might react aggressively. When you bring the cat back home, keep it a separate room with a door that closes. That way, it’ll groom itself and gradually pick up the group scent again.Monitor your other cats during the reintroduction process. If they seem agitated or stressed, keep the cat you’re reintroducing to the group separated until the others start behaving normally.

, While keeping it in a separate room, provide the cat that's been away with the bedding of another cat in its social group. Pet it and rub faces so it picks up your scent. Saliva also carries scent particles, so give it toys that other cats in its social group have played with recently., Synthetic pheromone diffusers, such as Feliway, create a calming, familiar scent throughout your cats’ environment. Using one in your home when you reintroduce a cat that’s been away will help maintain the group scent and calm your cats during the reintroduction process.You can use a pheromone diffuser even if you don’t have to reintroduce a cat to the group, as they help prevent aggression between cats in a multi-cat household."

Leave footwear, shopping bags, and other objects by the door.,
Wash your cats’ beddings on a rotating schedule.,
Avoid strong-smelling cleaning products and litters.,
Provide your cats with plenty of resources.",How to Encourage Group Scent in Multi‐Cat Households3," Objects like shoes and shopping bags bring strange smells into your home. These new scents can potentially disrupt your cats’ group scent, especially if you’re just beginning to encourage a common scent among newly introduced cats.Rub furniture or other objects that you can’t just leave at the door with socks or other scent items so they smell like your cats. If possible, rub them before you bring them into your home.  

, Try to avoid cleaning all of your cats’ beds and other washable items at the same time. Instead, wash one bed at a time so other bedding will preserve the group scent.After washing a bed, try rubbing the cat that uses it most with a towel, then rub the bed with the towel to transfer the cat’s scent.

, Most people want to neutralize strong cat odors in their homes. However, completely eliminating a common scent with cleaning products can disorient your cats, making them uncomfortable with each other and their surroundings. Try to use fragrance-free products instead of scented litter and strong-smelling cleaning products like ammonia., If there’s any competition for resources, your cats won’t want to groom each other or engage in other social behaviors that establish a group scent. Key resources include food and water bowls, litter boxes, beds, scratching posts, and high perches. If possible, provide one of these resources for each cat you own, plus one extra.For example, if you have four cats, try to provide five of each resource.
Place each resource throughout your home. If your cats stay in two or more distinct social groups, make sure each group’s territory has plenty of each resource in equal proportions.

Stimulate your cat’s natural hunting instinct.,
Shine a laser pointer around.,
Give your cat a box or two.,
Provide paper or bags for play.,
Reuse stuff from around the house as cat toys.,
Set up a cat tree.,
Install a ""catio"" (cat patio).,
Give your cat an exercise wheel.",How to Exercise a Cat2," Cats are hunters. Even domestic cats retain the instinct to hunt and chase small things that move. Therefore, toys that stimulate hunting behaviour will usually be very enjoyable to your cat.Toys like remote-controlled mice, anything on a string, feathers, or ribbons are very popular toys that most cats will want to “hunt.""

, The little red dot is a cat’s ultimate nemesis. Almost every cat will become enamoured with a little red dot. Laser pointers are fairly inexpensive to buy and can be used for hours of exercise.Do not shine the laser light into your cat’s eyes, or another person’s eyes for that matter.
Cats will jump up a wall or onto a shelf to attack “the dot,” so be careful where you shine the laser pointer.
You can even buy laser pointers that are built into a platform that moves the dot around on its own. All you have to do is turn it on and watch your cat go crazy!

, “If I fits, I sits.” Cats love boxes. Even big cats in zoos love boxes. Cats are often known to play in a box that an expensive cat toy came in, rather than with the expensive cat toy. Putting out a couple of empty boxes can keep your cat occupied for hours, and create a new sleeping spot.Some cats also love to shred boxes until there’s nothing left. There’s nothing wrong with this, other than it’ll leave a big mess.
Combine several boxes to make a maze or a castle for your cat to play in.
Fitted cardboard pieces that are used to pack items into a box are also great toys for your cat. Only use cardboard pieces, not styrofoam pieces.

, Packing paper or tissue paper are also great toys for cats. Start by crinkling the paper up so it makes noise when your cat jumps on it. Paper bags are another great toy. Cats love to explore the inside of paper bags and some will even hide their other toys inside.Do not use plastic bags as toys for your cat.

, There are a lot of items around your house you can reuse and turn into a toy. Most of these items would just be put in the garbage or recycling, so giving them to your cat will extend the life of the item before it ends up in landfill.The plastic rings from the spout of a milk jug are always a big hit with cats.
Paper towel or toilet paper rolls fascinate some cats.
Tie tabs from baked goods or electronics packaging can be fun, although you might want to supervise your cat when you give her a tie tab.

, Cats love being up high where they can observe and survey their kingdoms. Making or buying your cat an awesome cat tree will help him get lots of exercise climbing up and jumping down. Place the cat tree in front of a window so your cat can also have a place to watch the birds, people, and anything else that might go by.Most cat trees also double as a scratching post.
You can also buy, or make, cat perches that can be attached directly to your walls. If you place them at strategic locations around the house, your cat can jump from one to another to get from one room to another.

, In general, cats shouldn’t be allowed to roam outside. Cats are natural hunters and can end up killing a lot of songbirds and rodents. Plus, there are a lot of dangers outside that you don’t want to expose your cat to (e.g. cars, pesticides, other cats, dogs, humans, etc.). Instead of letting your cat outside on her own, build her a catio.A catio is essentially a small deck outside that’s surrounded by protective fencing or wire. The catio allows your cat to go outside, get some exercise and fresh air, without being exposed to the dangers of the outdoors.
You can even build a small catio on a balcony if that’s all you have access to.
An ideal catio is one that your cat can come and go from on her own (through a window or a door), but you can also build a separate cat enclosure in your backyard.

, A recent development in cat exercise is the cat exercise wheel. These exercise wheels are very similar to the ones you’d find in a hamster cage, but obviously much larger.The downside of these wheels is that they are expensive. But if you can afford one (or are creative enough to build one) they’re a great way to allow your cat to run without ever leaving the house.

Recognize signs of reduced grooming.,
Bring your cat to the vet.,
Look for related symptoms of pain or illness.,
Take your cat’s weight into account.,
Consider your cat’s age.,
Look for signs of chronic stress.",How to Determine Why Your Cat Does Not Groom Itself1," Signs that your cat isn’t grooming itself properly include an unkempt or messy appearance, matting, and lots of loose, dead hair in the coat.In addition, instead of looking smooth and shiny, the coat might appear harsh and greasy. Its feet might be stained from the litter box, and it might consistently have food in its muzzle., Scheduling a vet visit should be one of the first steps you take when determining why your cat has stopped grooming. Pain and illness are the most common reasons a cat stops grooming itself.Common pain-related conditions associated with reduced grooming include dental disease and bone or joint disorders.

, A range of symptoms or behavioral changes might accompany reduced grooming. Report any related symptoms you observe to your cat’s vet. Examples include:Increased sleeping or sleeping in just one position
Decreased appetite
Increased aggression, especially when touched or moved
Change in litter box habits
Abnormal body positions that seem to favor a painful area
Tooth decay or foul breath

, An overweight cat can have trouble reaching all of its body parts. Weight could be the issue if your cat grooms some places normally but ignores hard to reach spots. If you’re not sure if your cat is overweight, ask its vet if its weight might be restricting its mobility.If your cat is thin but ignores hard to reach spots, it might have another mobility issue, like a bone or joint disorder.

, Sudden unwillingness or inability to groom is especially concerning in younger adult cats, as it’s more often associated with a serious health problem. Reduced grooming is more common in senior cats. They often develop arthritis or other degenerative joint issues that make self-grooming difficult.Kittens can also have grooming issues if they were separated from their mother before learning to self-groom. You’ll have to groom it yourself, but in time it will likely begin cleaning itself. Start grooming it as soon as possible to teach it to enjoy the grooming process., Stress in cats is more often associated with over-grooming. However, chronic stress, or stress that develops over a long period of time, can lead to reduced grooming in some cats.Look for other signs of chronic stress, including:Hiding, withdrawal, or lack of interest in play
Defensive aggression
Heightened startle response
Urinating or defecating outside of the litter box

Care for the cat after the vet visit.",How to Control Stray Cats," Make every effort to make sure the cat doesn't have an owner. Outdoor cats establish their own territories that likely include other people's properties, so just because you see them often doesn't mean they don't already have a home. Ask your neighbors if the cat is theirs or if they know whose cat it is.;
, Before you take an action with a cat you think is stray, check to make sure whether or not they have a collar. If there is a collar, contact the owner to discuss whatever is bothering you about the cat.

, If a cat is causing you problems, post signs in your neighborhood to give warning to the potential owner that you may take action. This allows the owner time to remedy the situation. Include a picture of the cat on the flier and your contact information., There are many online resources to help reunite lost pets with their owners. Consider making a profile for the cat you are concerned about and see if someone claims it. The Center for Lost Pets is a great choice for this and recommended by the Humane Society., Once you trap the cat (see below), you can take it to a veterinarian to see if the cat has a microchip implant. Most household pet cats receive microchip implants at their vet appointments. A vet can scan the cat to see if there is a microchip which will direct you to its owner., Realize that most cats taken to animal shelters are not adopted and are therefore euthanized, so see if you'd like to keep any of the strays. A limited number of cats can be useful for catching gophers, rats, and mice, even if they won't make suitable pets.


Be sure to have such cats tested for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV, aka feline AIDS) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), vaccinated, and altered. You don't want your ""limited number"" to become a mob.
If any of the cats test positive for FIV or FeLV, for the good of all the cats in the neighborhood, you must have a veterinarian humanely put them down, unless you are able and willing to adopt such cats and keep them inside only.If you own uninfected cats, this is not a viable option, since no cure exists for either disease. (Note: humans cannot catch either of these feline-specific diseases.)

, Stray cats will continue to frequent locations where food is easily accessible or provided for them directly. Over time, more and more cats will begin to show up for the food you are putting out. This means that you’ll have a large group of stray cats hanging around who will often fight each other for the food, spread diseases among themselves, and breed right in your backyard.

, To minimize the likelihood of a stray cat remaining on or near your property, take every precaution you can to make your property unappealing to stray or feral cats. The more proactive you are about cleaning up your property, the less likely it will be that stray cats to hang out there.One thing this means is decluttering – removing brush and debris, old cars or other machinery, or anything else that may be cluttering up your property and providing nice hiding places for stray cats.
You should also seal up any outside holes in your home or that allow access into any outdoor buildings. Replace broken windows and seal any damaged surface holes.

, Keep your house pets indoors when possible. But if you must let them outside, make sure they always have collars on to differentiate them from the stray cats in your neighborhood. You don’t want people trapping your cat because they think it is a stray cat too.

, Rent or purchase a humane cat trap at your local hardware or pet store; most can be bought for around fifty dollars. Animal shelters may also have them to loan or rent. Such metal traps have doors that spring closed when cats step on the metal trigger inside, while providing the least possible distress and injury.Make sure the container doesn't have any sharp edges that could injure the cat.
You can put down a small towel or piece of cloth inside the trap to make the trap more comfortable. But remember that animals have great senses of smell, so using the same towel over and over will actually repel the cats.

, Keep one door shut if there are doors on either end, so larger cats must enter the trap completely. Place wet cat food, chicken, tuna, or liver behind the trigger pad so the cat has to walk over the trigger pad to get to the food.Position the trap under a roof so cats do not remain in heat or rain once caged. Never leave a trap unattended.

If the cat will be in the trap for longer than 12 hours provide a plastic container of water so they don't get thirsty. Use tie wraps to secure this in place so they don't knock it over trying to escape once trapped.

This should only happen if you have to wait to take the animal to the vet clinic, or when you are caring for the cat after it has been spayed or neutered. Otherwise, try to get the cat in and out of the trap as quickly as possible.



, Monitor the trap closely to see if you have caught a stray cat. You don’t want a cat stuck in there for too long. The point of trapping the cat is to give it a better life and a better chance of survival in the most humane way possible.


Don’t ever leave the trap unattended. Anything could happen while you’re away. Once you set the trap up, back away, but always stay within sight of the trap.Place a blanket over the cage. This helps calm cats and reduces trauma.
Wear heavy gloves when handling traps to avoid serious infections if you scratch yourself on the metal cage, or if you are scratched by a cat during transport. A cat can bite through surprisingly heavy material if panicked.
Place traps on plastic bags or tarps to contain cat waste, especially if transporting in a car.

, Clean and spray the traps down before using again when it is empty. You can use any kind of disinfectant spray and a rag.

, Take the stray cat to the vet as soon as possible if it has been caught, leaving the blanket on the trap. If transporting in a truck, secure the trap with bungee cords so it doesn't slide around or tip over.


The vet can check for a microchip too.

, Most communities have a variety of options to meet this need.Set up the appointment before you trap the cat so you don’t have to keep it trapped longer than necessary.


Try asking your local veterinarian if they know of any low cost spay/neuter options. Sometimes vets themselves offer clinics for this purpose. If not, they should be able to direct you to a local rescue group, shelter, humane society, or other organization that offers this type of service.
Make sure the cat gets an eartip to identify it as spayed., Have it spayed or neutered, ear tipped, and given a rabies shot. Feral cats may react differently than house cats, so it is okay to leave a feral stray cat in its trap/cage for a day or two after the surgery."

Help your overweight cat lose weight.,
Treat any underlying conditions.,
Ask the vet about pain medication.,
Reduce your cat’s stress.",How to Determine Why Your Cat Does Not Groom Itself2," If your cat is overweight, help it slim down by changing its diet and giving it more exercise.Change its diet gradually, such as by reducing its daily calories by no more than 20 per day. Play with it more often, and incorporate chase games using toys such as feather wands and laser pointers.Consult the vet about any dietary changes and additional exercise. Losing too much weight too quickly can be harmful, and you should make sure your cat is healthy enough for more activity.
If you free feed your cat, switch to scheduled feeding times to prevent overeating.

, Reduced grooming could be associated with any number of illnesses, from dental disease to cancer. Ask the vet about treatment options for any diagnosed medical issues.Depending on the issue’s severity, you’ll most likely need to take over grooming responsibilities during treatment or for the duration of your cat’s life., If your cat suffers from a painful condition such as arthritis, ask the vet about pain relieving or anti-inflammatory medications. Medications are available in pill, liquid, or injectable forms, so consult the vet about the best option for you and your cat.While medication can alleviate pain on a temporary basis, it might not restore your cat’s mobility. You’ll most likely have to take over grooming responsibilities.

, If you and the vet believe your cat’s reduced self-grooming is due to stress, take steps to enrich its environment. Ensure it has time to itself, especially if you have more than one cat. Consider keeping your outdoor cat inside, especially if there are a lot of cats in your neighborhood.Try to give your cat a consistent schedule. If possible, feed and play with it at the same times each day, and go to work and come home at the same times.
If you don’t already, clean the litter box daily.
Heights can help reduce stress in cats, so consider getting a cat tree.

Wipe away discharges daily.,
Wipe down your cat’s coat daily.,
Brush your cat’s coat gently and as needed.,
Bathe your cat occasionally.",How to Determine Why Your Cat Does Not Groom Itself3," Moisten cotton balls with warm water. Use them to gently remove discharges from locations such as your cat’s eyes, ears, and anus. Be sure to use a new cotton ball for each body part., Gently wipe your cat’s coat daily with a washcloth dampened in warm water to remove dead hair and skin cells. As you do so, examine its skin for parasites, skin irritation, lumps, and bumps.Report any of these issues to your cat’s vet.

, Use a soft bristled brush and be gentle, especially if your cat is older. You only need to brush a shorthaired cat sparingly to prevent matting on its lower spine and rear. Since they’re more prone to matting, brush your longhaired cat once or twice a week.Try trimming the fur around the legs and rear of your longhaired cat to prevent matting and soiling.

, Even cats that don’t groom themselves properly only need occasional baths, such as when you notice a bad odor.Brush your cat’s fur out before bathing it, wet it (using a hand sprayer is the easiest way), rub shampoo in the direction of its fur, then rinse thoroughly. Towel dry and, if your cat tolerates it, use a blow dryer on a low or cool setting.Only use shampoo marked for cats.

Ignore your cat while dining.,
Do not feed your cat scraps.,
Give your cat more attention.,
Set rules for your entire household.",How to Eat Without a Cat Begging1," While dining, do not speak to your cat or play with it. Interaction will shift the cat’s attention to you and what you’re doing. When it sees that you’re eating, it might begin begging for food. To prevent this, do not even look at your cat while dining. Most importantly, when your cat starts begging, do not pay it any attention., If your cat gets a taste for your leftovers or table scraps – even if you wait to feed your cat scraps after you’re done eating – it will be more likely to beg while you dine. To eat without a cat begging, don’t share table scraps with your cat., Your cat might be begging while you eat not because it is hungry, but because it wants to play or interact with you. In order to eat without a cat begging, try rolling a ball to your cat, sitting with it on your lap and petting it gently, or dangling a string toy in front of it during the 15-20 minutes prior to your meal. This way, your cat will have had its fill of human contact and seek satisfaction elsewhere., Consistency is key to the long-term success when attempting to change your cat’s begging behavior. If you have housemates or live with your family, get them on board with your new behavioral strategies. Explain your expectations and urge them to adopt the same approach you have regarding your cat's begging."
"
Feed your cat at the same you eat.,
Only feed your cat using a cat dish.,
Feed your cat enough food.,
Watch your cats as they eat.",How to Eat Without a Cat Begging2," If your cat sees you eating, it might get hungry and beg for food from you. In order to eat without a cat begging, give it food of its own and eat when your cat does. This will distract your cat and discourage it from begging as you dine.Additionally, develop a regular feeding schedule. Feeding your cat at the same time each day will, over time, ensure that your cat will get hungry at predictable times.
Space your cat’s meals out over a reasonable period of time. Provide at least three meals each day, with about five or six hours between meals., Your cat should have its own water bowl and food dish. It should never be fed from regular plates and tableware. Doing so could lead your cat to believe that when you are dining, you’re eating the cat’s food (or food the cat will like). This will make it hard to eat without a cat begging., It is possible that your cat is begging because you are not feeding it enough. Talk to your vet to find out how many calories your cat needs each day. Then, check the nutrition label on your cat’s food to find out how many calories you’re actually providing. You may be able to eat without a cat begging by meeting its caloric needs.Caloric needs vary according to breed, weight, and age. Your vet will be able to determine what your cat’s caloric needs are.

, If you have more than one cat, it is possible that one cat is eating the other’s food. The cat whose food is being eaten might then beg for food as you eat because it is still hungry. If one of your cats begs while you eat, monitor your feline friends the next time you feed them. If you see one cat taking the other’s food, start feeding your cats in separate areas of the house so that the cat whose food is being pilfered can get enough to eat."
"
Confine your cat while you eat.,
Keep your cat off the table.,
Use training to prevent your cat from begging.",How to Eat Without a Cat Begging3," If you do not dine in front of your cat, you can eat without it begging. Place your cat in another room and close the door. Alternately, place it in its crate. Then, sit at your dining table and enjoy your meal. When finished, end your cat’s confinement., If your cat sits on the dining table – whether you’re dining or not – it will begin to think that it is acceptable to be there. During mealtimes, a cat on the table might be emboldened and start begging for food or even snatch food right off your plate. Prevent this situation by shooing your cat off the table, or physically picking it up and removing it.If you have other people living in your home, you can ask them to help you ensure your cat does not sit on the table.

, Place your cat in a location away from your dining table. Give your cat a treat with one hand and click a clicker (a pet training device) with the other. Repeat four or five times in several different sessions throughout the day. After a week or so, continue to situate your cat in the same place away from your dining area and continue to click the clicker each time you do so, but reduce the frequency with which you administer treats.Never give your cat treats less than half the time you use the clicker.
Eventually, you will be able to click the clicker just before you dine, causing your cat to leave the dining area.

Purchase ladybugs.,
Release your ladybugs.,
Make sure there is a supply of food.,
Attract ladybugs.,
Avoid pesticides.",How to Take Care of Ladybugs1," If you have a garden or a greenhouse, you should consider adding more ladybugs to the environment. Ladybugs are very useful for controlling aphids. Aphids are tiny insects that can destroy vegetable and flower gardens.Ladybugs tend to hibernate during winter months. If you live in a climate that has regular temperatures above 65-70 degrees, you can purchase ladybugs at any time. If you live in an area with cold winters, wait until late spring to buy your ladybugs.
You can purchase ladybugs at most nurseries or garden centers.
Many online retailers also ship ladybugs. You probably want to order 100-200 in your first shipment.;
, Once you have obtained a good supply of ladybugs, you need to select a time to release them. Plan to set them free in the early evening. This is the optimal time for releasing ladybugs, as it gives them the whole night to find food and water and start to feel at home.Between purchasing and releasing the ladybugs, place them in a sealed bag in your refrigerator. This will help them calm down after being transported.
Ladybugs really like moisture. If your garden is especially dry, sprinkle some water around before releasing your ladybugs.

, When introducing ladybugs to your garden or greenhouse, you want to make sure they have plenty to eat. If they don't have a good food source, the ladybugs will find somewhere else to live. Ladybugs need a good source of pollen and nectar, especially if they are going to reproduce.Provide your ladybugs with plenty of flowering plants and legumes. Peas, daffodils, and beans are great choices.
Try planting clover and alfalfa for your ladybugs to eat.

, If you do not wish to purchase ladybugs, there are ways that you can naturally draw them to your garden or greenhouse. Aphids are the preferred food of a ladybug. In fact, a single ladybug might consume up to 5,000 aphids in its lifetime. Aphids are a common problem for most gardeners. It can be tempting to spray chemicals to get rid of them. But consider allowing the aphids to remain on a few of your plants. The aphids will attract ladybugs.
If you have a greenhouse, make sure that the ladybugs cannot get out once they are in. Routinely check your screens or glass for holes.
You can plant fennel, dill, and cilantro to attract ladybugs.

, One of the best ways to protect your ladybug population is to avoid spraying insecticides. Ladybugs are especially sensitive to chemicals. Additionally, if their food population (other insects) are destroyed by sprays, the ladybugs are not likely to lay eggs in your garden.Consider safer alternatives, such as soap sprays or botanical pesticides.
You can easily make your own soap spray by combining 1 cup of vegetable oil and 2 teaspoons of a liquid soap. After mixing the two, add 1 quart of water. Use this to spray your plants instead of chemicals.

Identify attention seeking behaviors.,
Rule out any medical causes.,
Determine if the behavior is age-related.,
Observe when your cat displays undesirable behavior.",How to Deal with Attention Seeking Behavior in Cats1," A cat can start displaying attention seeking behaviors at any age. Attention seeking can indicate loneliness, boredom, or can be accidentally encouraged when pet owners respond to undesirable behavior. Specific behaviors might include:Excessive meowing
Constantly walking around or circling your legs
Jumping
Stealing things or knocking objects off tables
Biting, clawing, or other aggressive acts;
, Excessive meowing, aggression, and other attention seeking behaviors might indicate an underlying medical condition. Your cat might be signaling pain or discomfort from an issue like dental disease, arthritis, or central nervous system conditions. Schedule a vet visit if you’re concerned about your cat’s sudden unusual behavior., Attention seeking behavior can also develop or become more noticeable in older cats. Lots of meowing or crying, aggression, and constantly demanding to be petted can indicate cognitive disfunction or age-related anxiety in senior cats.Discuss your senior cat’s behavior with its vet. Have them rule out or treat an underlying physical condition.
Ask the vet about treating age-related behavior issues with anti-anxiety medication, cat pheromones, and by making your home more comfortable for your senior cat.

, If you can rule out underlying causes, keep track of when and how your cat exhibits unwanted behavior. Look for patterns that might indicate if the behavior is due to loneliness, boredom, or accidental reinforcement.For example, if your cat whines and meows excessively at night, it might mean your cat is lonely. Keep in mind some breeds, like Siamese, tend to be more vocal than others.
Aggression, chewing, and eating non-food items can indicate boredom.
It’s easy to accidentally reinforce behaviors like persistent rubbing and demanding to be pet. If you consistently respond to these behaviors, your cat might end up constantly craving human contact.

Try a direct approach.,
Wait for the cat to come to you.,
Protect your skin.,
Grab the cat gently.",How to Catch a Cat1," You might be able to catch your cat simply by beckoning it or calling to it. If it comes near, try picking it up. However, never try to touch an animal that seems fearful or upset, since a scared cat can quickly become violent.If yours reacts negatively when you try to pick it up, leave it alone and try later. Signs that a cat is scared or upset include:Tail held straight up and stiff
Ears folded back
Paw raised, with or without exposed claws
”Striking” with its paw
Low meowing or growling
Hissing or spitting
Hair raised on end
Arched back;
, You might also be able to catch your cat when it least expects it. Avoid staring the cat in the eye or trying to reach for it when you first see it, since these gestures can be perceived as threatening.Instead, sit somewhere quietly and calmly, and wait for your cat to jump in your lap. Then, gently grab it.

, Handling a cat when it does not want to be picked up or is scared can lead to some scratching or biting. If you are trying to catch a cat in a hurry (such as one that has suddenly run outside) just grab any towel or blanket to wrap around the cat once you find it. This will help to calm the feline, and also protect you from harm. If you have time to put on gloves and long sleeves, these can also help protect you., Once you find your cat, grasp it firmly in your hands (but without squeezing it) and pick it up. If you have a blanket or towel, throw it over the cat to slow it down, then grab the cat within the blanket and clutch it securely to your chest.


Grabbing a cat too forcefully or holding it awkwardly will make the situation much worse when you are trying to catch it. If at all possible, place one hand behind its front legs and your other hand under its hindquarters, lifting gently.Never pick your cat up by its neck or by its legs alone.

If keeping the ladybug for more than 24 hours, use a hermit crab house.,
Provide food.,
Give them water.,
Feed the ladybug twice a day.,
Be gentle when holding a ladybug.,
Consider releasing the ladybug back into the wild after 24 hours.",How to Take Care of a Ladybug," Look in an area where ladybugs shelter. This may be under the leaves of plants where aphids are hanging about (try roses and other flowers or fruit trees in blossom). They also like to hide in crevices and cracks on houses, such as around window frames.


Ladybugs love aphids; it's their main source of food.;
, Look around the area and catch the ladybug with a small net or catch it with your finger or hand, but be careful not to let it fly away. Cover it gently with your other hand and be careful not to squeeze it. Place the ladybug gently in the jar and it's ready to be looked after.

, The container should allow room for flying about and settling down to sleep. Add some twigs, leaves and petals for interest––any leaf or floral material needs to be changed daily to prevent rotting. Give the ladybug something to hide in too, such as a hollow twig or a small toy with holes in it.


A bug habitat could be used too.
Glass jars are not recommended as they can heat up too much and burn the ladybug, especially if in direct sunlight.

, They won't be able to get out of it but they'll enjoy it. Place fresh leaves inside daily. You'll need to feed the ladybugs daily.

, Feed the ladybug with small amounts of honey or sugar. Use a small bottle cap or similar to contain the food.


You can also feed your ladybug raisins or lettuce.
Add a piece of bark from a tree. Bark from trees tend to have bug larvae. Your ladybug will spend most of its time on and under the bark.

, Do not use bottle caps for giving them water. Using it will increase the chances that your ladybugs will drown on it. Use wet paper towels or cotton balls instead., Don't give it too much, just a little.

, Here is how:


Lower your finger and leave it near the ladybug. It has to touch the ground it's sitting on.
Wait for it to walk or fly on it.
Now you are holding a ladybug but be careful!

, After you've had time to observe its habits, then let it get back to the job it has to do, which is keeping the pests down in your garden.

Tire your kitten out with play time.,
Implement a cool down period at the end of play time.,
Select special toys to use during play time.,
Feed your cat right after play time.,
Get your kitten to work for her food.,
Make a startling sound to make your kitten pause.,
Stop playing with your kitten if she gets too rough.,
Adopt kittens in pairs.",How to Calm Down a Kitten1," Take the time to play with your kitten every day, multiple times a day if possible. Schedule some play time a couple of hours before you plan to go to bed and use that play time to tire, or tucker out your kitten.If you finish playing with your kitten and find that she’s still in the mood to play, direct her attention to a toy instead. Allow her to continue to prepare for sleep herself with a toy. Some toys to consider are: furry mice, cat balls with or without bells, feathers hanging on a string from a door knob, etc.
Using a toy that is attached to a string at the end of a pole (like a fishing rod) is a great way to get your kitten to have a really active play session without requiring you to run around as well. You can stay in one place and use the pole to make your kitten run and jump all around you. Your hands are safe from harm too!;
, Near the end of play time with your kitten, use slower and gentler movements to encourage your kitten to slow down. Don’t suddenly stop playing with your kitten in the middle of a really active play session.Stopping suddenly when your kitten is still really playful isn’t going to stop her from playing, it may cause your kitten to start chasing after you, or attacking you, because you’re still moving around.
If you’re playing with a specific toy during the play session, allow your kitten to catch that toy at the end of play time.

, Play time with your kitten should be considered a special time of the day. Select certain toys that you only want to use during play time. When it’s not play time, put those special toys away. After a few play periods your kitten will learn which toys are specifically for play time, and when she sees them being taken out, she’ll get excited!Your kitten should always have some toys available to her to play with at all times of the day. However, you might want to hide toys that make a lot of noise (e.g. those made with hard plastic, or those that have bells or sounds) before you go to bed at night.

, A cat’s natural behaviour is to eat, then clean herself, then go to sleep. You’ve already tired your kitten out with play time, so feed her right afterwards. Your kitten will likely complete her natural cycle by going to clean herself up and then having a nap., Instead of leaving food out for your kitten all the time, have your kitten work for her food. There are many commercial products you can buy specifically for hiding food. Your kitten then has to work to find and remove the food from the toy in order to eat it.You can also make food puzzles for your kitten with cardboard boxes or other items. Look for specific ideas on the internet.
Making your kitten work to get to her food will also help to tire her out. This is especially helpful at the end of the day when you’re near bedtime.

, If your kitten is really hyper, or playfully attacking you, and you need to encourage her to stop, consider making a sudden noise that will startle your kitten. The purpose of the noise isn’t to scare your kitten, but rather to make her pause long enough to reassess the situation., If your kitten starts to play too rough, either during play time or on her own, stop giving your kitten attention. Do not encourage the behaviour by continuing to give your kitten attention. Instead, by ignoring your kitten, you’re sending a signal that this behaviour is inappropriate and you will not pay attention to such behaviour., The best playmate for a kitten is another kitten. Kittens adopted together, especially if they’re from the same litter, can grow up to have a close relationship with each other. As kittens they’ll play with each other and tire each other out. They’ll also teach each other when certain behaviours are inappropriate."

Capture the ladybugs.,
Provide a safe space.,
Feed the ladybugs.,
Set your ladybugs free.",How to Take Care of Ladybugs2," Many kids enjoy keeping ladybugs as pets. They are cute and easy to care for. Your first step in having new pets is to capture the ladybugs.Get a clean jar and poke small holes in the lid. You can use a hammer and nail to make the holes. Or, you can use any clear container that has a lid.
Place a cotton ball soaked in water in the bottom of your jar. You want your ladybug to have something to drink when you capture her.
Walk slowly around your yard or garden, looking at leafs and twigs. When you find a ladybug, take the whole leaf or twig (including the ladybug) and place it in your jar. You can also use a paper cup to scoop the ladybugs into your jar.

, Once your have captured your ladybugs, you need to provide them with a good home. You can get a 2-3 gallon plastic cage for your new pets. Put mesh netting between the lid and the cage, as ladybugs can escape through very small cracks in the lid.Place hay, grass, twigs, and leaves in the cage to help make the ladybugs comfortable.
Everyday, mist the enclosure with non-chlorinated water. Ladybugs like moisture.
Don't place the cage in a place where it is too cold or too hot. About 70 degrees is the right temperature for ladybugs.

, Ladybugs can live for over a month on their body's reserves. However, you can also feed your ladybugs. A good choice is to offer them moistened raisins.Try other non-acidic fruits, such as tiny pieces of apples. Since ladybugs don't regularly need food, it is up to you how often you feed them.
You can add fresh fruit to the cage every few days. Make sure to remove any rotting fruit, as that is not appealing to ladybugs.
You can also add some plants to your ladybug cage. Some ladybugs enjoy eating marigolds or cosmos. Other enjoy nibbling on fresh leaves., You may want to eventually set your ladybugs free. Choose a good home for them, such as your garden. Make sure to wait until the weather is warm to release your ladybugs.Try to set them free in a new home that has lots of flowering plants and aphids. If you don't have your own garden, you could take them to a nearby park.
Early June is a good time to release your ladybugs. The weather is favorable, and this is when ladybugs tend to breed.
If possible, avoid touching the ladybugs when you set them free. Instead, you can use a paper cup to scoop them out of their cage and gently shake them onto a plant.

Understand ladybugs.,
Teach kids how to care for ladybugs.,
Use ladybugs for a school project.",How to Take Care of Ladybugs3," If you are going to provide a home for ladybugs, it is useful to learn more about them. This is true whether you are keeping them in your garden or in your home. Ladybugs are one of the most useful insects. In addition to eating aphids, they will eat larvae, mites, and other leaf hoppers.There are many species of ladybugs in North America. They can be white, red, pink, orange, or black. They typically have spots.
During colder months, adult ladybugs may hibernate in the crevices of a tree, or somewhere else protected from the elements.

, Ladybugs can be a useful teaching tool. Since they require relatively little care, you can use them to teach young kids how to care for their first pets.By keeping a few ladybugs during the winter, you can teach your kids responsibility by teaching them to feed and water the ladybugs.
When you release them in the spring, you can teach your kids about nature. Let your kids help you come up with good ideas for where to release the ladybugs.
You can also teach your kids to carefully handle ladybugs. Very gently hold the bug between the thumb and forefinger. If too much pressure is applied, the bug will be crushed., If you are a teacher, you can consider using ladybugs for a science lesson. A ladybug has a life cycle of about 6 weeks from egg to adult. The students can watch them grow and develop.You can also have your students breed ladybugs and study their traits. For example, they could try to figure out whether the number of dots on a ladybugs back is hereditary.

Ignore undesirable behavior.,
Avoid physically punishing unwanted behavior.,
Reward your cat when it’s calm and relaxed.,
Work with everyone in your home to manage your cat’s behavior.",How to Deal with Attention Seeking Behavior in Cats2," The first and most important step to correct attention seeking is to ignore your cat when it displays undesirable behavior. Don’t give your cat any attention at all when it meows excessively, demands to be pet, or acts aggressively. Leave the area or, if the cat needs to be removed from a location, do so quickly and without extended interaction.When you first start ignoring undesirable behavior, note that it might get worse for a brief period of time., Your cat will interpret punishment as attention, so it can actually reinforce unwanted behavior. If you’re trying to correct unwanted behavior by ignoring it, punishment will interfere with your attempts to manage your cat’s behavior. Further, an aggressive cats might interpret even a slight tap on the nose as a challenge and become more aggressive., Offer treats, verbal praise, petting, and other forms of attention whenever your cat is calm and relaxed. Reinforcing acceptable behavior while ignoring unwanted behavior will teach your cat which actions will result in positive attention.Reward your cat when it’s calm and relaxed, but don’t disturb it while it’s sleeping or sneak up on it.

, Make sure everyone in your home understands how to ignore unwanted behavior and reward acceptable behavior. Consistency and constantly monitoring your interaction with your cat are key to managing its behavior.Look for ways other members of your household might be reinforcing attention seeking behavior, like by offering too many treats or caving in when your cat demands to be pet."
"
Get your cat on a consistent daily schedule.,
Spend more time playing with your cat.,
Try incorporating treasure hunts and puzzle toys at meal time.,
Get a cat tree.,
Keep your cat indoors if it kills wildlife.",How to Deal with Attention Seeking Behavior in Cats3," A set schedule can help lower stress, anxiety, and attention seeking in cats. Feed and play with your cat at consistent times, and clean the litter box daily. If possible, leave for work and come home around the same times each day.If you free feed your cat, consider feeding your cat at scheduled meal times.

, If you believe your cat is seeking attention because it’s bored, you should spend more time playing with it. Play chase using interactive toys, like feather wands, to engage your cat’s hunting instincts.Try playing with your cat for 15 to 20 minutes before each meal to simulate hunting.

, Energetic cats benefit from a little challenge at meal time. Offer physical and mental stimulation by hiding treats or food around the house and placing food in puzzle toys.Monitor your cat during treasure hunts or when it plays with a food dispensing puzzle. Feed it if it can’t find or get to food and seems frustrated.

, A cat tree will enrich your cat’s environment by expanding its vertical space, offering mental stimulation, and giving it more exercise. Cats evolved to love heights, since tall perches allow them to survey their territory. Giving your cat a good view over its turf will keep it busy and lower its stress., Sometimes outdoor cats seek attention by bringing home fresh kills. To prevent this behavior altogether, consider keeping your cat inside.You can also discourage wildlife from entering your property by getting rid of bird feeders and keeping all trash receptacles tightly lidded.

Get a container to catch your cat in.,
Prepare to trap your cat.,
Encourage your cat to enter the carrier.,
Gather bait.,
Entice the cat with bait.,
Try other distractions if food does not entice the cat.",How to Catch a Cat2," A regular pet carrier (available at pet supply stores) is just fine. Look for one that is big enough for your cat to turn around in, but small enough to feel cozy.You can line the bottom of the carrier with a towel, blanket, or even an old t-shirt to make it more comfortable for your cat.

, If you are try to catch your cat indoors, corralling it into a room can make it easier to get it in its carrier. Make sure beforehand that all doors and windows are shut, and that there are no easy places for the cat to run to or hide in.


If you are trying to catch a cat outdoors, you can try to get the cat into a mostly enclosed area first, and keep any exits blocked. For example, if there is a hole in a fence, cover it with a board first so that the cat cannot escape through it.

, Set the carrier near your cat, leaving its door open. See if the cat will enter the carrier on its own, or if you call its name first.Once the cat is fully inside, close the carrier door quickly but gently.

, If the cat will not enter the carrier on its own, you may have to motivate it with food.Your cat’s favorite treats will do fine, or try a smelly, wet food such as tuna, sardines, canned cat food, and moist pieces of chicken.You can also try catnip or valerian, if your cat is attracted to these herbs.

, Once you have the carrier and bait ready, try the following technique:


Set the carrier near some treats with its door open.
Wait for your cat to eat some.
Place food nearer and nearer the carrier, if the cat will move closer to it.
Place food inside the carrier and wait for the cat to step in and begin eating it.
Once the cat is fully inside, close the door quickly but gently.
Don’t try to force the cat into the carrier—it may run away, and you will have to start the whole process of catching it all over again.
Once your cat is in its carrier, you can put a blanket or towel over it to help calm it.

, A laser pointer or other toy can also be used to coax your cat into the carrier.Simply make the cat chase the laser pointer into the opened carrier, then quickly shut it."
"
Leave food out for the cat.,
Use a humane trap to catch a feral or stray cat.,
Gather bait.,
Set your trap.,
Try to distract the cat into the trap if bait does not work.,
Take the cat to a safe place.,
Take the cat to the vet as soon as possible.",How to Catch a Cat3," Several days before attempting to catch a cat, leave a dish of food in the area where you have seen it.Dry food will work, but smelly, wet food such as tuna and canned cat food might be especially attractive to the cat. Keep replenishing the food supply, and the cat will be more trusting and likely to visit the area.

, Humane live traps, which will contain the cat without harming it, are available from animal supply stores and online retailers. You might also be able to borrow one from a local animal shelter.Look for a lightweight but sturdy one with two doors—a trap door and a release door.This will allow you to leave one door open to lure the cat in, and another to let it out safely.


A live trap trap should include detailed instructions on how to set it and to release the animal. Make sure that you understand exactly how to work the trap before you attempt to use it to catch a cat.
You can line the bottom of the trap with a towel or old t-shirt to make it more comfortable for the cat.

, A cat will be drawn to food and enter the trap. Smelly, wet food such as tuna, sardines, canned cat foot, and moist pieces of chicken will be most attractive to cats.Catnip and valerian are also irresistible to many cats.

, Position your trap in the “set” position and place it in an area where you have seen the cat.Place your bait in the trap and wait nearby for the cat to appear.


If you are trying to trap a cat in a public place, leave a sign on or near the trap so that others will know what is going on.
Never leave a trap unattended for more than 20-30 minutes, in case another animal accidentally is trapped.
If the cat is not trapped, try again another day with fresh bait.

, Get a laser pointer, and sit far enough away from the trap that the cat will not notice you. Wait for the cat to move near the trap, and try to make the cat chase the laser pointer into the trap., As soon as the cat is trapped, move it to an indoor location.Covering the trap with a blanket or towel can help calm the animal.Wearing gloves and long sleeves can help protect you from the cat’s claws., Most animal advocacy groups recommend the policy of TNR (trap, neuter, and release) for feral and stray cats.This is considered a humane way of controlling stray cat populations. You can ask your vet or an animal shelter to spay or neuter your cat, and then release it back outdoors once it has recovered. You can even continue to feed the stray.

Fill up a plastic spray bottle with water.,
Aim the plastic nozzle at the cats.,
Pull the plastic handle.With the spray bottle’s nozzle leveled at the cats, open fire.,
Use a garden hose on the fighting cats.,
Squirt your cats with a squirt gun.As an alternative to using a hose, you could also use a squirt gun for cats that are fighting outside.",How to Break Up a Cat Fight1," A standard sized spray bottle (16 fluid ounces) works fine. Ensure the water and the bottle are clean. Do not use bottles that had bleach or other chemicals in them.;
, You can aim the bottle at one or both cats. If your cat is familiar with the spray bottle and what it does, the very sight of it is likely to send it running and end the conflict.

, Spray two to three times rapidly from a safe distance away. The cats will likely saunter off to groom themselves. If your cats continue fighting, squirt another two to three times. Continue as many times as necessary to end the fighting.


Do not get too close or attempt to manually separate two fighting cats. You will get scratched or bitten., If you’re outside and the weather is warm, you could turn the garden hose on your cats. If your hose has a nozzle and handle on it, use it in the same way you would the water bottle inside. Aim the nozzle at the cats from a distance of three or four meters, squeeze the handle a few times, and enjoy the peace and quiet again. Collect your cat and bring it inside.


If your hose doesn’t have a spray nozzle on it, place your thumb partially over the hole where the water comes out. This builds up a bit of pressure behind the hole and will cause the water that does come out to travel a greater distance. Use this technique to spray water on the fighting cats just as you would if you had a spray handle on your hose.

, Fill the squirt gun with water, aim it at the fighting cats, and fire a three to four second stream at the cats. If they do not stop fighting, spray another three to four second burst. Continue until the conflict ends.


Do not use water to break up a cat fight outside during winter. Cats can easily develop hypothermia and die.
You could substitute a small, less powerful squirt gun for a spray bottle, as well.

Provide your kitten with a tall cat tree or cat condo.,
Give your kitten a place to hide.,
Keep your home quiet.,
Try herbal remedies to keep your kitten calm.,
Use feline pheromones to reduce your kitten’s anxiety.",How to Calm Down a Kitten2," Cats, in general, like to be up high where they can see everything going on. This is one of the reasons cats like to climb on top of tall shelves or the fridge. Providing your kitten with a tall cat tree or cat condo will give her a spot she can go to that makes her feel comfortable.Having a spot like this when something scary is happening can be especially helpful. For example, your kitten may prefer to sit in the cat tree when you are running the vacuum or watching a loud movie.

, While you don’t want to have furniture that has a hiding spot where your kitten can get stuck, it is a good idea to provide your kitten with a safe spot to hide when she’s feeling nervous or scared. A cat tree with a cubby, or a cat tent, are great options.Since you are probably already aware that cats love boxes, providing one or more boxes for your kitten to hide in will also work.
It is also a good idea to have more than one of these hiding spots for your kitten. You might want to put one in each of the main rooms your kittens hangs out in.

, A nervous kitten is likely to be scared of everything. The best thing you can do for a nervous kitten is to remove as many of the scary items as possible. This includes keeping the house (or room) as quiet as possible and slowly introducing sounds over time.Scary sounds might include the TV, radio, vacuum, washing machine, dishwasher, fans, etc.
If your kitten is in her own room, try playing calming sounds or a radio at a low volume in that room to acclimatize your kitten to noises.

, There are several herbal remedies made specifically for cats that can help them keep calm and reduce anxiety. Depending on the type of remedy, you may be able to put it in your kitten’s water, or in her ears.Some cats are also calmed by the scent of lavender or honeysuckle.
Using either the essential oils of lavender or honeysuckle, or a spray made from the essential oils, may help keep your kitten calm.
Do not put the spray or essential oil directly onto your kitten. Instead spray it on their bedding, toys, etc.

, Feline pheromones keep cats calm and reduce their anxiety. Man-made versions of these pheromones are available in spray and plug-in formats that can be placed in your home to help keep cats and kittens calm. These pheromones are similar to the ones cats release when they rub their chins and faces against something when they’re happy."

Prepare your home for a new kitten.,
Isolate your kitten when you first bring her home.,
Do not allow your kitten in the bedroom at night.",How to Calm Down a Kitten3," When you bring a new kitten into your home you should take the time to kitten-proof your home. Kittens are hyper and don’t yet understand what they can and cannot do. Preparing your home for an inevitable disaster will protect your belongings and help teach your kitten good behaviour.Remove breakable or delicate items from tables or lower-level shelves.
Tie up the strings attached to blinds and curtains.
Remove or change curtains that a kitten may be tempted to climb.
Rearrange furniture such that there are no spaces where a small kitten could get stuck behind or underneath things.

, When introducing your kitten to her new home, it is best to start by placing her in a small space, and then allowing her into more of the house as time goes on. A bedroom or a bathroom is a good place to start.As you introduce your kitten to new areas of your home, supervise her actions until she’s comfortable.

, If your kitten wakes up in the middle of the night and then tries to wake you up, the most important thing you need to remember is NOT to react. If your kitten wants to play, or wants something to eat, do not give in to her demands. Giving into your kittens demands will teach her it’s okay to wake you up to get what she wants.If night time disturbances are a problem, you may need to close your bedroom door and not allow your kitten inside your bedroom at night.

Visit the vet.,
Monitor your cat's dental health.,
Check for cognitive problems.,
Identify the cause of elimination problems.",How to Deal with Irritability in Older Cats1," For an accurate picture of your older cat's health, visit your vet for a thorough checkup. Tell them about any irregularities in your cat's health or behaviour beyond its irritability (e.g. lethargy, loss of appetite). Some medical conditions common to older cats that may cause irritability include:Degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis)
Inflammatory bowel disease
Constipation
Dental disease;
, Take the time to inspect and clean your cat's teeth at least once a week to maintain their oral health. Tooth pain can cause irritable behaviour in cats and make it difficult for them to eat, further compromising their health. Call your veterinarian for a dental exam immediately if you notice any of the following signs:Bad breath
Mouth sores
Swollen or bleeding gums
Redness of the gums
Drooling

, Aging cats often experience cognitive issues similar to humans, such as dementia, confusion, and loss of memory. If you identify these issues early enough, your veterinarian may be able to prescribe medication to slow down the decline in cognitive function. Signs to look for and tell your veterinarian about include:Disorientation
Irregular sleep patterns (sleeping all day and staying up all night)
Agitation or anxiety
Decreased activity
House soiling

, Your older cat might demonstrate irregular behaviour in terms of eliminating (e.g. not using its litter box, ""marking its territory"" with urine). Consult with your vet to determine if these behaviours are signs of a medical condition, or the result of your irritable, aging cat acting out. With age, a lapse in control of eliminating functions could be due to:Hyperthyroidism
Kidney failure
Diabetes
Mobility issues (i.e. difficulty accessing the litter box)
Confusion or memory loss

Yell loudly.You could say things like “Hey!,
Bang pans together.Get two sturdy pans and knock them together several times in the general area where your cats are fighting.,
Shake a can of pennies.If you have a tin can with a resealable lid, you can fill it with pennies to distract the fighting cats from each other and end their fight.,
Sound an air horn.An air horn is a hand-held can of pressurized air that passes through a horn, creating a loud sound.",How to Break Up a Cat Fight2," What are you doing?” in a loud, irritated way. You should also clap your hands together rapidly several times. Alternately, if you have a kerchief handy, wave it around your head to gain the attention of the fighting cats while you tell at them. All of these things will distract them from each other and end the fight.

, They will both likely be startled by the sound and scamper off in different directions. If you have only one pan handy, strike it with a metal object like a large metal ladle or pair of tongs repeatedly to achieve the same effect.

, Small coffee tins are great for this, as are cans of sriracha peas and small tins of cookies or toffee. Fill the can with a handful of pennies, dimes, or other small coins and give it a few vigorous shakes for about five seconds from a distance of three to four meters.

, Point the horn away from you and press the button on top of the can. Hold it for just a second or two. Your cats will run off when they hear the sound.


Air horns can be extremely loud, so use it from at least three to four meters away from the fighting cats.

Throw a blanket over the cats.,
Toss small, soft pillows near the cats.You can include a few exclamatory remarks like, “Hey!,
Throw a toy near the cats.If one cat sees its favorite toy, it may be inclined to leave the conflict and instead play with the toy.",How to Break Up a Cat Fight3," The sudden disorientation the accompanies being covered by a blanket will get the cats to stop fighting and focus on escaping from under the blanket. You could also use a large jacket or a towel to achieve the same effect., Break it up!” along with your pillow-throwing for added effect. With a barrage of pillows raining down on them, both cats will be eager to exit the area.


You should aim for the area around them, but if they don’t heed your presence right away, don’t hesitate to throw pillows at them with moderate force. Take care not to hit either cat in the face.

, If you suspect the other cat will pursue the cat that left the fight, give both cats their favorite toys.


You could also try tossing two cat treats in opposite directions. Rustle the bag and make a big show of removing the treats for your cats. This will ensure they see the treats being tossed.

Poke holes in an empty plastic box.,
Add grass and leaves.,
Add some decoration.,
Add ladybirds.,
Add some food.,
Give them water.,
Release your ladybirds.",How to Design a Habitat for a Ladybird1," Choose a box that is a least 6 inches on each side, with a lid that seals.


You can find large plastic food storage containers at a thrift store or dollar store.
Using an icepick or a slender screwdriver, poke 6 – 10 breathing holes in the lid. Make the holes big enough to let air in, but too small for the ladybugs to escape.
This step can be very dangerous. Ask an adult to help with this one.;
, Add some fresh leaves and grass from your garden, so your ladybirds will have something to crawl around on.

, If you want to make your ladybird habitat pretty, you can add some decoration. Give your ladybugs small pebbles to explore, or tiny shells to hide under.

, Search your yard or garden until you find a ladybug – you'll probably find one on a plant leaf or on a branch. Using a large leaf, gently brush the ladybird off its perch and into the box. Put the lid on the box, and look for the next one.


You don't need too many ladybirds – three to six should be plenty.
It is best to look for ladybirds in a bright, fruit-and-vegetable-filled garden. If it has plants and flowers, it's more than likely you'll find some.
Ladybugs are more common in middle and late spring as well as early summer.
If you can't find any ladybirds, you can order them online from a gardening supply store.

, Place a few moistened raisins or banana slices in the box, so your ladybirds have something to eat. If you are going to keep them for more than one day, remember to add new food every day.Never feed ladybirds citrus fruits like oranges or lemons, or any type of acidic fruit.
Ladybirds can be kept for several days, but if you try to keep them permanently they will die of malnutrition. You should release them back into your garden within the week.

, Place a wet paper towel in the box, so your ladybirds will have access to water. You can also keep their foliage moist by misting it with water from a spray bottle, or add water droplets to the leaves with a clean eye-dropper., The little beetles will die if kept in a cage, so you'll want to return them to your garden after you've watched them for awhile. The ideal time to release ladybugs is early evening, which gives them all night to find shelter, food, and water.If you have a ladybird habitat in your garden, release your ladybugs near it.

Keep the house at a comfortable temperature.,
Make its litter box easily accessible.,
Keep your cat hydrated.,
Make sure your cat is entertained.,
Use a synthetic pheromone spray.,
Give your cat catnip.",How to Deal with Irritability in Older Cats2," Aging cats tend to be more sensitive to the cold, so be mindful about keeping the house at a warm temperature, even when you are out. The cold can cause or worsen joint paint in senior cats, causing pain, stiffness, and irritability. If you can't raise the temperature enough to keep your cat happy, create warm spots for your cat to retreat to, such as:A heated cat bed
Furniture moved into sunny spots of the house
A fuzzy blanket to curl up in

, Using the litter box is a need that your older cat can't avoid, but it can be a difficult ordeal if the box is located in uncomfortable, out-of-the way spot (e.g. in the garage or basement). Move a litter box to a warm, easily accessible spot in the house so that your senior cat can avoid obstacles like stairs and cold floors, which may cause it pain.To avoid confusion, start by introducing a second litter box to the new location while leaving the first in its original place.

, Older cats are prone to dehydration, so keep your cat hydrated by making sure it drinks plenty of water, and by using a humidifier in the house to prevent dryness. Dehydration can cause dry mouth, lethargy, depression, and skin ailments, all of which can contribute to irritability. Leave several water bowls around the house so that your cat can have easy access to water, particularly if it has mobility problems.To keep a fresh, constant source of water for your cat, purchase a pet water-dispensing fountain online or at your local pet store.

, Boredom may contribute to your older cat's irritability, particularly if it has energy or mobility issues reducing its activity level. With your veterinarian's approval, engage in play with your cat (e.g. hunting and chasing games with toys) and give it treat-filled puzzle toys to play with on its own. If your cat enjoys sitting on a windowsill or other difficult-to-access perch in your home, place a chair or step ladder close by to help them climb up and add a soft cushion to the spot for their comfort., To improve your cat’s mood, use a synthetic version of the feline cheek pheromone, available in spray form. The spray, like the actual pheromone, has a calming and pleasing affect on cats and can help them relax. Synthetic pheromone sprays can be purchased through a veterinary clinic or online., For a boost in both mood and energy, give your cat catnip to elicit a temporary “high."" Purchase dried, loose catnip from a pet store to put into refillable toys (approximately 1 tsp, or 0.5 oz.) or make a catnip spray to use around your cat’s play area, or on its cat bed. For the best quality, look for organically grown brands."

Look for signs of aggression.,
Discover why your cat is fighting.,
Keep your cat indoors.,
Pay equal attention to all your cats.Cats, like people, can become jealous of each other.,
Create positive associations between two cats that don’t get along.When two cats make a habit out of conflict, you need to break this negative behavior pattern by replacing it with a positive one.,
Give each cat its own space.Multiple cats in one household should not eat out of a single common food bowl.,
Do not invest in a grown cat of the same gender as the one you already have.If your adult cat has lived on its own for all or most of its life, it is used to being the dominant cat of the house.",How to Break Up a Cat Fight4," Before the fight starts, you’ll typically see your cat and/or another cat hissing menacingly, each with its hair bristling along its back and its ears pinned down. At this point, move to take your cat out of the situation before a tussle begins.If the cats seem determined to fight, confine one or both cats to separate rooms.

, Has one cat recently reached sexual maturity? Is your cat in a new home where it needs to establish its territory and tussle with other cats to do so? Think about recent changes in your cat’s lifestyle or biology to figure out why it might be fighting.


Once you’ve figured out why cats are fighting, you can take steps to prevent it. For instance, if a cat has recently reached sexual maturity, it’s probably experiencing a tidal wave of hormonal changes. Spaying and neutering your cats can reduce or eliminate this cause of cat fights., The cat that stays inside is the cat that never engages in a cat fight with other cats (unless the other cat also lives in your home). Keep your windows and doors closed. Stay mindful when opening the door. If necessary, have a family member close the cat in a certain room before you or another family member leaves the house. Then, let the cat out to resume its normal activities around the house. This will ensure your cat never gets the chance to escape outside and fight another cat.


If your cat fight is between two of your cats, confine them to separate rooms until they’ve calmed down., If you’re fawning over a new cat or kitten, your existing cat might resent that. Certain breeds (such as Siamese) are more susceptible to jealousy than others. Spend time praising and playing with all your cats to lay their fears of being replaced to rest.

, When the two cats are present in the same room, give each some tasty treats. Feed them their treats at the same time out of separate bowls placed reasonably far apart so that they don’t feel threatened. Be sure to give each the same amount of treats and attention, or they will only become more jealous of one another.

, Provide each cat with its own food and water bowls, and provide adequate space between each bowl. Similarly, provide multiple cat scratch posts, cat houses/perches, and litter boxes if you have multiple cats.


The general rule is that however many cats you own, you should have that many litterboxes, plus one.For example, if you have two cats, you should have three litter boxes.

, Introducing a kitten -- especially a kitten of the opposite gender as your current cat -- will minimize the possibility that the cats will engage in conflict. Cats of the same gender will see the other as competition for potential mates, and their likelihood of conflict will increase.You could decrease conflict among cats of the same gender by spaying or neutering your cats.

Create the outer framework.,
Collect assorted tubes.,
Trim the tubes.,
Hang your ladybird hotel.",How to Design a Habitat for a Ladybird2," You can use a large empty coffee can, a wooden box, or an open-faced birdhouse. A birdhouse with an overhang to keep rain out is ideal. If you're using a can or box, create an overhang by nailing a piece of plywood to the top, extending out several inches from the front of the box., Your finished ladybird hotel will look like a large box, with stacks of circular holes filling the front (the circles are the openings of the tubes.) Collect hollow tubes, like bamboo shoots or thin cardboard tubing. You can create more tubes by rolling leaves or paper. Ideally, you want a selection of different types of tubes in different widths (diameter.), Measure the inner floor of the box or birdhouse from back to front. Then cut all the tubes to the same length, just long enough to fit inside the box or birdhouse. Stack the tubes lengthwise from front to back, so that the holes face forward. Pack them snugly, but don't crush them – they need to remain hollow.
Fill any gaps around large tubes with smaller tubes.
Glue the tubes in place as you lay them down, or secure them with string or wire.

, Hang the box (or can) of tubes in a bush or tree, or secured against a wall. Be sure the location is shaded, and will not get too hot. Tilt the box slightly forward, so any rain that gets in can drain out. Ladybirds will be attracted to the narrow tubes in the box, because it gives them a safe place to find shelter and hibernate.Hang the box close to plants that ladybugs like (such as rosebushes), so the little beetles will be attracted to their hotel.
If you like, you can add a few moist raisins in some of the holes to attract more ladybugs.
Other bugs may move in to your ladybird hotel, and that's fine. Some gardeners create elaborate “bug hotels” to attract all sorts of different bugs to their garden.

Purchase bamboo tubing.,
Cut your bamboo to size.,
Drill hanging holes.,
Thread twine or chain through the holes.,
Stock your feeder with raisins.,
Hang your ladybird feeder.,
Grow plants that attract ladybirds.",How to Design a Habitat for a Ladybird3," Look for raw bamboo at gardening supply stores or the outdoor section of hardware stores. You can also find them online or in Walmart's home and garden center. Look for stalks at least a foot in length, and ½ to 2 inches in diameter.

, Using a small hand saw, to shorten your bamboo stalks to about 10 – 12 inches in length. Cut the ends at an angle, so that the “top” side of the tube is longer than the “bottom” side of the tube on both ends. This will create a small “canopy” over the entrance to the tube to help keep rain out.Be careful not to split the bamboo when you cut it.
Use sandpaper to smooth any rough edges.

, Using a small power drill, create a hole near the opening at each end. Drill both holes on the “top,” or longer side of the tube.Be sure the holes are large enough to feed the chain or twine through.

, You can use sturdy twine or slender chain to hang your ladybird feeder. Thread the twine into one hole from the outside, push it through the tube, and pull it out through the hole at the other end. Pull the twine until the overhanging ends are about the same length, and tie the ends together. If you are using chain, connect the ends with a twisty tie., Place a handful of raisins in the feeder tube before hanging it. The raisins will attract ladybirds, and give them something to eat when pest insects are scarce.Replenish your feeder with raisins from time to time, to keep your ladybirds around when they aren't eating aphids.

, Hang the feeder close to the plants in your garden that seem to attract the most pests. Rose bushes, in particular, are known to attract aphids (a favorite of ladybugs.), Ladybirds will help keep your plants healthy by feeding on scales, mites, mealybugs, leaf hoppers, and aphids. To attract more ladybugs to your garden, plant things that will attract them.Flowers that attract ladybirds include: geraniums (scented), coreopsis, and cosmos.
Herbs that attract ladybugs include: angelica, cilantro, caraway, fennel, and dill.

",How to Build a Ladybug House," A shoebox or thick card-stock is a good weight.;
,, One side should be free of a cover; this will form the entrance.

, In case you didn't know, ladybugs are attracted to: light blue, pink and yellow. Here is one possible look you could try:


Paint or cover the box in light blue.

Paint or glue on pink and yellow flowers.

The inside doesn't have to be painted, unless you really want it to be.


,, Ladybugs are really attracted to water. They spend their entire lifespan searching for it. So, it's a good idea to also make a tiny pool that will accompany the ladybug house, alongside it. Out of tin foil, create a pool that is about 5 inches (12.4cm) long and very, very shallow, like half the size of a ladybug. If you have a small Styrofoam plate, all the better!

,


Fill it with tap water (optional) .

Add rocks, leaves, and/or dirt, but not too many or it will weigh down the house.

Also add a lightly damp paper towel (don't put to much, it can harm it), folded up into the interior.

Throw in some tiny crumbs of cheese,pieces of no citrus fruit, and/or meat for good measure.


, Place the tiny pool right next to it. Spray the whole ladybug hotel with a sweet, fruity perfume (optional) , give it an hour or two, and you should see some ladybugs taking up residence!

Choose a container.,
Provide ventilation.,
Add substrate.",How to Care for Superworms1," A plastic container can work well for superworms. You can also pick up an aquarium at a local pet store. The container should be large enough that its top will be at least three inches away from the substrate.You can easily use plastic container you have lying around the house for superworms. For example, you can use a plastic container used to store old clothing.
Make sure the container has smooth sides. This will prevent superworms from crawling out.;
, Superworms need some ventilation to thrive. It's a good idea to go for a container with a mesh lid. If your container does not have a mesh lid, you can poke very small holes near the lid to allow ventilation.Make sure the holes are small enough that superworms cannot crawl out.

, Substrate refers to the material that lines the bottom of an aquarium or cage. Bran, wheat bran, or uncooked oatmeal are all suitable substrate for superworms. They provide some moisture without harming the worms.Substrate should be at least four inches thick so the worms have room to burrow.
Make sure any substrate you add is dry. Too much moisture can kill superworms.

Wait for a rainy fall day.,
Watch your step.,
Look on the ground.",How to Find Worms1," You can find worms at any time, but it will be easiest when it's just rained. The water drives the worms out of the ground into the open air. They'll head for dry land: sidewalks, roads, driveways, and patios.Look for worms on a humid day before it rains, or during a rain-shower. Try hunting on a cool and moist autumn day or evening.


If you are trying to sample worms for a study, fall is the best time to start looking. Most worms are sexually mature by the time fall rolls around, which makes it easier to tell them apart.
If it isn't a rainy season, consider watering the ground where you suspect there are worms. Make sure that the earth is thoroughly saturated. Then, wait a few hours and wait for the worms to come out – ideally, in the evening.;
, Walk delicately, and try to be patient. Worms can feel the vibration of your footsteps through the soil, and the concussive effect may drive them further underground. If there are a lot of worms out, make sure that you don't accidentally crush them under your feet!

, Check garden soil, fields, pastures, lawns, parks – anywhere with loose soil. Look under rocks, logs, and other objects that create shelter in the soil. Don't be afraid to dig deeper if you suspect that there are worms about.


Check your footprints. The pressure from your footstep will often bring curious worms to the surface."

Add starch to the bottom of your container.,
Pour some water on top of the starch.,
Sprinkle yeast over the starch.,
Add a spoonful of microworms.,
Cover your culture.,
Stir your culture weekly.,
Keep at least two cultures going at a time.,
Recognize when a culture has gone bad.,
Place your culture on a mild heat source for 10-20 minutes.,
Scoop up a portion of worms and add them to your tank.,
Dip the worms into your aquarium.",How to Culture Microworms," Because these worms don't lay eggs, you will need a few live adult microworms to start your culture. Remember that not all nematode species are a good food source, and some may even make your fish sick.


If your local fish store sells live food, check for microworms there.
Try getting in touch with other local hobbyists through aquarist clubs. A member there may cultivate microworms and may be willing to either give or sell you a starter.
For a few dollars, you can also order microworms online. They are sold everywhere from large general auction sites to small hobbyist forums.
If the species is listed, check to make sure that it belongs to the Panagrellus genus. Panagrellus redivivus is the most commonly found microworm.
Remember that microworms are tiny white worms that are barely visible to the naked eye. A started culture of a large group of worms should like a gray or light brown clump. If your starter looks significantly different from this, you may have another type of worm that has been misidentified.;
, Almost any container can be used, as long as it's deep enough for you to fit your index finger inside. Clear containers with resealable lids are the most convenient. Some popular options include yoghurt tubs, mason jars, and resealable plastic food containers. Any type of human food-grade starch is usable. Common sources of starch include oatmeal, wheat flour, bread, cornmeal, mashed potatoes, and cereal.


If you're using a sealable container, be sure to poke small slits in the lid with a knife. Air exchange is necessary for a microworm colony to thrive.
If your container doesn't have its own lid, cover the top up with tin foil.

, Microworms don't actually eat the starch. Instead, they eat microscopic yeast that feed on carbohydrates.You can find conveniently packaged dry yeast in the baking section of most supermarkets. Some stores also sell fresh compressed yeast that must be refrigerated.If you bake bread or brew beer at home, you can also use the same yeast to culture microworms.

, You don't need to cook or otherwise prepare your starch before placing it in the container. Use enough so that it covers the bottom of the container and is roughly half an inch (1.6 centimeters) thick. Spread your starch out so that it is roughly even.

, Add enough water to thoroughly soak the starch but not so much that a water line rises above it. You can also stir the two together to get a creamy consistency. This is not necessary but may make your culture grow faster.

, If you purchased dry yeast, sprinkle some all across the starch in your container. If you're using compressed yeast, shave off some thin pieces from the cake and lay them flat on top of the starch. The exact amount of yeast you'll use isn't exact and will vary based on how wide your container is. You want to distribute yeast all across the starch.

, Take a teaspoon and scoop up some microworms and add them to the container. Microworms can move easily across the starch, so you don't need to spread them out. The more worms you start with, the faster your culture will grow. However, even only two worms can reproduce quickly enough for a usable starter in a few weeks.


Consider refrigerating your starter culture. In case you experience a catastrophic crash in all of your cultures, make sure to keep your starter to begin them anew. When kept in cold temperatures, microworms slow their metabolisms down. At refrigerator temperature, a starter can stay alive for over six months. Your starter culture likely came in a resealable bag. If so, simply seal it back up and place in the refrigerator. If not, transfer your starter into a resealable bag or a sealable plastic storage container., Wait about one week. You will know your worms are ready to harvest when you start seeing worms moving up the sides of the container.


Microworms reproduce well at room temperature. In a warmer environment, the culture will grow more quickly but won't last as long. Don't worry if you have a cold snap; microworms can survive in temperatures down to 32 °F (0 °C)., Microworms don't burrow like earthworms do. To keep their food source available, mix your culture by stirring once a week. This will bring fresh nutrients and yeast to the surface., Microworm cultures don't last forever, and it's good to have a backup in case your worm colony crashes unexpectedly. To make sure you always have enough microworms on hand for your fry, start at least one more culture., Microworm cultures only last about two weeks to a month. Sometimes, because of contamination, they may go bad even more quickly. Bad cultures won't stay alive long and should be thrown out. Know the signs of a microworm culture going bad:


It undergoes significant visual changes. If the color of your culture media changes significantly, play it safe and toss it out. Older cultures will also darken as waste accumulates. Keep in mind that it's normal for the consistency to become soupier and more like a liquid as the yeast break down their food source.
Contaminants are growing in the culture. If you see a significant amount of mold or maggots, it's best to start fresh. If there's mold in only a tiny section, try scooping it out first. Keep in mind that maggots aren't dangerous to fry and actually make a good live food for adult fish. You can still harvest microworms from a culture with maggots, but keep in mind the culture itself may not last long.
It takes on a foul odor. While some may find the smell of a healthy culture unpleasant, it has a relatively mild yeasty odor. If your culture begins to smell foul, then it's likely to have been contaminated with bacteria. These bacteria can potentially harm your fish and may kill the microworms themselves., On top of your aquarium is the perfect spot. The heat will cause the worms to crawl further up along the side of the container, making them easier to harvest. This step isn't required, but it will let you harvest more microworms.Remove the container lid.

, Wipe the side of your container where the worms are crawling with your finger, a rubber spatula, or a spoon. By focusing on the sides, you will avoid scooping out the culture media. While a little yeast and starch is harmless, too much can foul your aquarium water.


The worms won't live more than 24 hours in water, so try not to overfeed.Be sure to replace the lid on your container as soon as possible.

, Watch the microworms drop to the bottom. Nematodes don’t swim, so the fish will eat most of them at the bottom of the tank. If you're counting on the current to keep them from sinking, double-check that it's strong enough.


Worms that fall between pieces of gravel will be impossible for most fish to get to. It's best to use either a different substrate or keep a bare bottom tank when regularly feeding microworms."

Maintain the right temperature.,
Provide fruits and vegetables as food.,
Keep water out of the habitat.",How to Care for Superworms2," Never refrigerate superworms like you world with meal worms. This will kill them. The temperature should be roughly between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 21 and 27 degrees Celsius), which is generally within room temperature. It's usually safe to store superworms in an area of your home where temperature is consistent.Superworms can tolerate temperatures slightly higher or lower than room temperature on occasion. It may stunt their growth, however. If you have a room that is consistently a little hot or a little cold, do not keep superworms here.

, Superworms feed on fruits and vegetables. You can feed them leftover produce from your kitchen. As superworms should not be exposed to water, opt for produce that can provide moisture such as potatoes, apple slices, and fresh greens., Unlike other insects, you should not mist a superworm container or place water in it. Superworms should never be exposed directly to water as this can cause health problems. Keep water out of a superworm's container as much as possible."

Prepare a breeding container for beetles.,
Transfer beetles into the breeding container when they emerge.",How to Care for Superworms3," You may want to allow some of your superworms to grow into beetles. The beetles can then breed, providing you with more superworms. If you have reptiles that feed on superworms, this can save you money. To start, separate larvae into chambers.Chambers should be tiny containers. Film canisters or vials work well.
Make sure to punch small holes in the lid of your containers for ventilation.
Use wheat bran or oatmeal as substrate. You should also add a small slice of carrot for moisture.

, The second life stage for superworms is the pupae stage. It takes about 10 days in a chamber for a superworm to pupate. In the pupae stage, superworms will curl up into a round ball. Once they reach this stage, remove them from the chambers. Put each pupae in an individual container, slightly larger than their original chambers, stocked with fruits, vegetables, and substrate., While you wait for the pupae to turn into beetles, make a breeder container. You will transfer beetles to this container so they can breed.Use any type of plastic container with smooth sides, such as a Rubbermaid container.
Add an inch of substrate such as wheat bran.
Place part of an egg crate in one corner. Beetles will gather here to breed.
Use a ventilated lid on the container.

, Check your pupae daily until you see beetles have emerged. Once your pupae has turned into a beetle, place it in the breeding chamber. Add each new beetle to the chamber. They will continue to breed until they die. You can remove superworms as you see them and feed them to your reptiles."

Keep worms alive.",How to Find Worms2," Use your fingers or a pair of long tweezers. If you use your fingers, pinch the worm carefully between your thumb and index finger. Use gloves, if you must, but understand that this will make it a bit harder to get a good grip on the worms.

, If a worm is halfway out of its hole, it isn't worth using force. Worms can tense their muscles powerfully at a moment's notice, effectively holding their bodies inside the hole. If you pull too hard, the worm will rip in half before it comes out of the hole.


If you're determined, try digging around the worm so that you can pull it out in one piece. Try digging the chunk of hard soil out of the ground, then crumbling it apart until the worm has no place left to hide.

, Fill a cup, bucket, or other open container with a handful of loose, moist soil. Drop each worm into the soil as soon as you pick it up. You don't need a ton of soil – just enough to keep the worms cool and moist.

, The best way to maintain a worm collection is to keep them in a patch of cool, moist soil. Consider building a soil-filled ""worm box"" or ""bait box"" to keep the worms in one place. Try keeping worms in your refrigerator: packed in moist soil within a small, sealed container.Keep worms alive even if you plan to use them as bait.They'll make better bait if you put them on the line fresh. If they're alive, they'll wriggle in the water and attract fish more effectively."

, While you can feed your silkworms fresh mulberry leaves, you will need to dry and grind your leaves if you want to make chow. Make sure the leaves are completely dry before proceeding with the recipe.You can dry out your leaves in an oven or with a dehydrator.
Check that the leaves are completely dry. Any residual moisture can cause mold or bacteria to grow in the chow.
The dried leaves should be brittle and flaky to the touch.

, Once the leaves are completely dry, you'll need to grind them down into a fine powder. This powder will become the main ingredient in your powdered silkworm chow.Break the brittle leaves into small pieces.Feed the pieces of dried leaves into a coffee grinder, herb grinder, or food processor.
If there are any chunky pieces after grinding, scoop them into a fine mesh strainer and press the chunks through the mesh with the back side of a spoon.

, Once you've ground the mulberry leaves into a fine powder, you can combine them with the soy flour and corn meal. This will give you a powdered silkworm chow similar to what you would buy in stores or through an online retailer.

, Once the bedding has hardened, break it into clumps and use it cover the base of the container with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the bedding. This is the material the wax worms will live in (a substrate), as well as the food they will eat.


The bedding should still feel sticky, but if it is too soft to break into clumps, it needs more drying time., Small balls of crumpled wax paper give the waxworms a place to spin cocoons. This will make them easy to transfer to a second container later.


You can use pieces of egg cartons instead.

, If you plan to breed large numbers of waxworms, their breathing can cause water droplets to condense on the sides. Strips of newspaper help to absorb this and prevent the bedding from becoming too damp for the larvae to use.Leave some of the sides clear so you can see what's happening inside.

, You can buy waxworms online or from a vivarium. The healthiest larvae are a cream color with no dark discolorations.Transfer these to the container, keeping out dark larvae and dead larvae.


A large jar or tank can hold at least 50 waxworms, but the exact number isn't too important for a home project. For an efficient breeding setup, use about 75–100 waxworms for each 100 grams (3.5 oz by weight) of bedding., Block all openings with a double layer of cheesecloth or very fine (20 mesh / 0.85mm) wire screen so air can pass through.Hold it in place with a rubber band or hot glue.


If you are using a tank that comes with a mesh lid, tape the edges of the lid to make sure it stays in place., Put the container in a room with decent air flow, so moisture can evaporate before it condenses on the container walls.The waxworms aren't affected much by humidity, but they may have trouble moving and feeding if the substrate gets damp and mushy., Waxworms breed much faster in temperatures between 28 and 32ºC (82 to 90ºF).If you can't keep a room close to this temperature, warm the container with a heat mat or heat lamp from a pet store.


You can breed waxworms at room temperature, but this can add months to each breeding cycle. You may prefer this if you are breeding them for your own use and don't need large quantities.
Do not let the temperature reach 40ºC (104ºF). At this temperature, many of the adult moths will die before they finish laying eggs., Waxworms thrive in dark environments. Put the container in a paper bag, or wrap a tube of dark paper around the jar.

, Open the container occasionally and search through the substrate for black, shriveled larvae. Throw these away before they rot to discourage disease.

, The larvae should tunnel through the substrate, eat it, and grow bigger, molting their skins several times along the way. The larvae usually pupate once they are six or seven weeks old, if kept at a warm temperature.They will either spin cocoons, or (at lower temperatures) enclose themselves in a hard, dark shell.A greater waxworm larvae usually reaches about 20mm (¾ inch) before it molts.The lesser waxworm species is almost as long, but has a narrow body.If you have a dense population, you may need to add more of the edible bedding before they pupate. Greater waxworm larvae can eat very quickly, so check on them daily., Hopefully, your larvae spun cocoons onto the wax paper balls, so all you need to do is pick those up. If not, move the cocoons carefully with tweezers or your fingers. Just as before, add bedding, and seal it with a ventilated lid.


Cocoons usually take at least two days to spin, sometimes more. Don't move them until the outside feels fairly hard., Fold strips of wax paper accordion-style.Drop these into the new container. Once the worms hatch into wax moths, they will lay their eggs on the wax paper.You can use pieces of plastic straws instead., At warm temperatures, an adult moth could emerge from the cocoon in as few as ten days after spinning. Don't be surprised if it takes a couple weeks (or up to 40 days for lesser waxworms).At room temperature, you may have to wait as long as 60 days.The larvae goes through dramatic changes to become a pupa in the first 4–7 days. The rest of the time is spent becoming a moth., Within a few hours of leaving the cocoons, the females will fan their wings at the males, then mate with them.After that, the female will look for a nook to lay her eggs — hopefully on the objects you dropped in.


The moths do not eat, but will still live for at least a few days after emerging. The females will die after about 7 days (lesser wax moths) or 12 days (greater), while the males will last about 13 days (lesser) or 21 days (greater)., In ideal conditions, the eggs can hatch in just 3 days (greater waxworms) or 7 days (lesser waxworms). At lower temperatures, this can take up to 30 days.You can leave them in the same container as the moths, or move them to a fresh one set up the same way. (Leaving them in the same container as the dead moths is usually fine, but the moths can get smelly, and may increase risk of disease.)


Don't let the moths escape into the wild, or they may lay more eggs and devastate local beehives. Before opening the container, cool it down a little to slow the moths. Open it in a closed closet so you can catch any moths that fly out during the transfer.
Newly hatched waxworms can climb up glass and chew or squeeze through almost anything. During this stage of the waxworm life cycle, place the container in a shallow pan of water to prevent escape."

Purchase suitable bins.,
Prepare your mealworm substrate.,
Buy mealworms.,
Set up a stable growing environment.,
Assemble the first bin.,
Wait for the mealworms to reproduce.,
Move the beetles after the eggs hatch.,
Feed the mealworms to your pets.,
Sift the substrate and keep the process going.",How to Breed Mealworms," You'll need shallow bins with smooth walls made of either glass or plastic, so that the worms and beetles aren't able to climb out. 10 gallon (37.9 L) fish aquariums work very well, as do plastic storage containers. The containers need tops with tiny vents or airholes (wire mesh works, as does poking holes in the lid) that allow for airflow without letting the mealworms escape. Darkling beetles can't fly, but a lid is a safety precaution that i would have.


Getting at least two (three, if you want to start a very large colony) is essential because you'll need to separate the beetles from the larvae a few weeks into the process. If you fail to separate them, they will eat one another.Do not use wooden containers, as mealworms are able to eat through these.;
, Mealworms feed on grains and cereals, and that's what you'll need to use as substrate. You can buy mealworm substrate from a feeder supply store, or you can make your own mixture from bran flakes, corn flakes, and other cereals. The substrate should be ground to a fine powder to make it easier to pick out the worms and beetles when you need to move them.


Depending on the needs of the pet you are feeding, you can add bone meal, cricket chow or other ingredients to change the nutritional profile of the mealworms., The number of mealworms you buy for your starter stock depends on how many animals you aim to feed. If you need to use the meal worms to start feeding the animals right away, aim for 5,000 or so to begin with.It takes a few months for the mealworms to reproduce, so this population will get depleted at first.


If you don't mind waiting a few months for new mealworms, you can start with as few as 150 mealworms.

, Mealworms reproduce best when they're kept at a steady temperature of 70 to 75 °F (21 to 24 °C). Choose a place in your home where you can keep the temperature consistent. The area should be clean and free of chemicals that could contaminate the colony.


A heated garage or basement would be the optimal place to keep your mealworms.
You can buy a heater to use near the containers to keep the temperature steady for your mealworms.
If you keep the mealworms too chilly, they won't reproduce.

, Line the first bin with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of substrate. Place your starter stock in the bin. Slice up an apple, a carrot, or a potato and place the slices on top of the substrate, to provide moisture for the mealworms. Put the lid on top of the bin. The mealworms will begin eating the substrate and reproducing. The mealworms may pull the food under the substrate to eat it, which is completely normal.

, The mealworms, which are the larvae of the darkling beetle, will need 10 or more weeks to go through their life cycle and reproduce to make new mealworms. They will change from larvae to pupae, then from pupae to mature beetles. The beetles will copulate and lay eggs in the substrate, which hatch 1 to 4 weeks later.While you wait for this process to take place, check the bin every day and take care of the mealworms in the following ways:


Change out the cut vegetables if they appear to get moldy.
Keep the temperature stable at 70 to 75 °F (21 to 24 °C).
Remove dead mealworms or beetles and discard them.

, Once the new larvae hatch from their eggs, you'll need to move all the pupae and beetles to the second container. If you keep them all in the same container, the beetles will feed on the larvae. When you move them to the second container, they'll lay eggs and continue the reproduction process. To move the beetles and pupae, do the following:


Prepare the second container by lining it with 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of substrate.
Pick out the beetles and pupae by hand and place them in the new container. Use gloves if you want to. The beetles won't bite and rarely fly.
Put a few slices of carrots or potatoes in the second container, then cover.

, Once the new larvae are big enough (before they become pupae) you may feed them to your pets. Remember that any mealworms left in the bin will mature and become pupae, then beetles. Continue moving pupae and beetles to the second container as they mature.


You can store mealworms in the refrigerator to make them keep longer if you want to set some aside for feeding your pets.

, Once the life cycle has completed in the first bin, the substrate will be depleted. Pick out all remaining mealworms and place them in a clean bin while you disinfect the first one. After cleaning and drying it thoroughly, add a few inches of new substrate, then replace the worms in the bin to begin the process again.

Assemble your equipment.,
Dig for worms.,
Carefully dig around worms that resist.,
Continue digging until you’ve collected your worms.",How to Gather Earthworms1," You will need: a shovel or spade and a container filled with moist soil and leaves.


An ideal time to look for earthworms is when you are already digging up soil, such as during gardening, fence building, or digging a foundation. If you go deeper than just the surface, you will find different types of earthworms, including nightcrawlers.
Dress for gardening. You’ll be digging through soil for worms, so you’re likely going to get dirty. You may want to wear old clothes, knee pads, gardening gloves, gardening boots or shoes.;
, Select a patch of ground in your backyard, garden, or forest and begin digging a small hole. As you lift the soil out, sift through it for worms and collect any that you find. An excellent place to dig for worms is near a stream or water source.


You can also try digging in a community garden or forest floor, but you should avoid digging up earth in privately owned golf courses, fields, and public parks.
Be as quiet as possible so your vibrations don’t spook the worms.
Be sure to look under rocks, logs, and other items lying on the ground.

, Worms are equipped with setae, which are bristles that help them move through the earth. This may make it difficult to pull worms directly out of the ground. Dig around a worm that is trying to burrow back into the ground, being careful not to cut the worm. Once you’ve loosened the soil, it will be easy to pluck the worm out and put it in your storage container.

, When you’ve exhausted a patch of ground, replace the soil and begin digging a new hole a couple feet away. Repeat the digging and searching process, and replace the soil when you are finished.

Mix the powder with water.,
Heat up the mixture in the microwave.,
Leave the chow in the refrigerator to harden.,
Cut the hardened chow into small pieces and serve.",How to Make Silkworm Chow2," The first step in preparing powdered silkworm chow is to add water. You'll want to make sure that you use the right ratios of water and powder to achieve an ideal consistency.Some experts recommend a ratio of one part silkworm chow to two parts water.
One pound (453.6 grams) of prepared chow should be sufficient to raise 20 to 25 silkworms through a complete life cycle.You can scale your mix preparations up or down as needed.
Use hot water to facilitate a better mix.
Mix the powder and water for approximately three to five minutes to ensure that they are thoroughly blended together.

, Heating the mixture will help form a more solid chow patty.It can also help kill any bacteria or mold that may have formed in the chow mix.


Cover the container with plastic wrap. This will help seal in moisture and heat the mixture more efficiently.
Microwave the mixture for three to eight minutes, depending on the strength of your microwave.

, The heated chow patty should be left in the refrigerator until it hardens to a cream cheese-like consistency. Make sure the mixture is not too watery, as watery chow could potentially drown your silkworms.The exact duration of time it takes to harden will vary, depending on your refrigerator and the consistency of your chow.

, Once the chow has hardened, it can be cut and served to your silkworms.You can also use a cheese grater to shave the hardened chow and distribute it more evenly."

Secure a steady mulberry source.,
Use appropriately-sized leaves.,
Distribute the mulberry leaves to your silkworms.",How to Make Silkworm Chow3," If you're opting to use real mulberry leaves, you'll need a steady source to ensure that they're fresh. Some experts advise that the mulberry leaves should be fresh and moist to ensure a healthy batch of silkworms.Make sure the leaves are free of pesticides, as these toxins could kill your silkworms., Using fresh mulberry leaves is easier than making your own chow, but you can't just toss some leaves into your silkworm habitat. The leaves you serve should be sized appropriately for the silkworms you're raising.Young silkworms can only eat young leaves. Older leaves are too tough for young silkworms to eat.
Newly hatched silkworms should only be fed tiny new growth mulberry leaves measuring approximately 0.5 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) long.Older silkworms can safely eat larger, older leaves.

, Your silkworms will readily eat the leaves you give them. Over time, though, they may stop eating for extended periods. This is normal; silkworms molt three or four times during their growing period, and they typically stop eating or moving just before a molt."

Place a large piece of wet cardboard on your lawn.,
Assemble your tools.,
Prepare your worm container.,
Wait for the sun to set.,
Use your flashlight to look for worms.,
Look under the cardboard.",How to Gather Earthworms2," Do this the night before your worm hunting. This will attract worms., Earthworms spend their days burrowed underground in the soil, they surface at night in order to feed on organic matter.Therefore, you can collect earthworms at night without having to dig like you would in the day. You won’t need any fancy tools for earthworm hunting, but you should take:A flashlight with a dull or red light in it. Earthworms can’t see, but they can sense light, and will shy away from a bright flashlight.
A shovel or small spade to move soil around or turn it over.

, You can use a container made of Styrofoam, metal, plastic, glass, or cardboard. Fill it three-quarters of the way with moist soil, and cover the soil with dead, wet leaves. The leaves will help keep the soil moist and provide the worms with food.A butter tub, coffee can, jar, ice cream tub, or old bucket will do. Make sure your container is empty and clean before storing worms in it.
Worms need oxygen, so poke holes in the lid that are large enough to let air pass through, but not so large that the worms can stretch and wriggle their way out.

, When it does, go to your front yard, backyard, or garden. You can also try a forest, field, or even a golf course. Walk softly, slowly, and quietly. Worms cannot hear, but they can sense vibrations.


You can also hunt for worms during the day if it has been raining. Worms need moisture to survive, so they often come above ground to migrate during rainstorms or when the ground. After the next storm, go outside and look for worms to collect on the lawn, sidewalk, and driveway., Gather those you find and store them in your container. You will have to work quickly, because if the worms sense you coming, the will wriggle back into the soil.


Earthworms are most active in the spring and fall, because they don’t like extreme cold or hot.However, they will also be active during summer nights.
Look for pellets or small piles of soil on the surface of the ground that are evidence of earthworm activity., Also turn over stones, logs, and leaves. Worms will be attracted to the moist soil underneath things in the ground, so turn over anything lying on the ground to find worms.Use your spade or shovel to turn over leaves and the top layer of soil if you’re having trouble finding worms.

Assemble your tools and equipment.,
Select your location.,
Drive the stake into the earth.,
Run the rooping iron over the stake.",How to Gather Earthworms3," Worm grunting, sometimes called worm charming, is the process of using vibrations to entice earthworms out of the ground. For this activity, you will need your worm container, a wooden stake that’s about two feet long with one pointed end and one flat end, and a one-inch thick metal file (known as a rooping iron).Alternatively, you can use a handsaw if you don’t have a rooping iron, but you will likely also need a hammer to drive the stake into the ground.

, A shady field or wooded area with damp soil is the best location for worm charming. Somewhere near a running stream or small body of water is even better.

, Use the rooping iron or hammer to drive the stake about halfway into the ground.

, To create vibrations that will drive the worms from the ground, you need to recreate the vibrations that burrowing moles make as they dig through the ground looking for worms to feed on.Run the file (or the blade of the handsaw) over the flat top of the stake at a medium pace.


As the earthworms sense the vibrations, they will make their way to the surface to escape the predator they think is near. Be ready to gather the worms as they surface and collect them in your container.

Get a container.,
Create layers for the wormery.,
Collect worms.,
Put the container away.,
See what the worms are up to.",How to Build a Wormery1," Various types of containers will work, as long as there is proper ventilation. If you want a container you can observe well, use a large, clean glass jar or other clear container. Poke some holes into the lid, or cover the top of the jar with a fine mesh fabric secured with a rubber band.Your container should be ready before you get the worms, because worms shouldn’t be exposed to the light for long. You’ll want their moist, dark home ready for them when you collect them.;
, Put one centimeter of sand in the bottom of your container. Add a thick layer of damp soil, and another centimeter of sand on top of that. Then fill the jar with moist soil up to five centimeters from the top of the container. In a separate container, prepare the top layer you will put on top of the worms once you have them.The topmost layer can include pieces of overripe fruit (such as grapes), vegetable peels and leaves (from trees and/or tea).

, You can search for or buy earthworms or tiger worms (redworms). Places you can catch worms are compost piles, gardens, or under rocks or leaf piles. Check the grass, sidewalk or driveway after a lot of rain. If you can’t find worms yourself, you can buy them at a local tackle shop.Keep your hands moist when handling worms.
Place the worms right onto the topmost (food) layer in the container.

, Store the container in a cool, dark place such as a cupboard.Put thought into where you keep your wormery. Worms like a place without vibrations.Wrap the container with black paper and secure it with string or a rubber band. Put on the ventilated lid.


For example, don’t keep your wormery near a furnace, speaker, refrigerator or dishwasher.
If you’re keeping the container outside, choose a garage or shed, and wrap the container in bubble wrap as insulation, without covering the ventilated lid.

, If you used a clear container for observation, such as a jar, after a couple of weeks you can examine how the worms have taken to their new environment. They have likely made patterns in the soil and processed the food you gave them."

Purchase cat bath wipes.,
Choose a time when your cat is relaxed.,
Pet your cat before introducing the wipes.,
Massage your cat with the wipes.,
Clean your cat’s face and ears.,
Wipe its paws.,
Use cat bath wipes sparingly.",How to Bathe a Cat Without Water1," Cat bath wipes deodorize your cat’s coat while removing allergens and distributing essential oils. Wipes can be purchased online or at most pet stores. Opt for a veterinarian-recommended brand of wipes that has natural ingredients (e.g. aloe, lavender) and is alcohol-free., Choose a time to clean your cat with cat bath wipes when it is relaxed. After playing or eating your cat is likely to be content and calm, making the grooming experience easier. If you cat seems agitated or distressed when you start to give it a waterless bath, stop and try again at another time to prevent negative associations., To get your cat comfortable with the cleaning experience, start petting it before touching it with a cat bath wipe. Have the wipes next to you and try to phase seamlessly into rubbing your cat with them, keeping the rhythm and frequency of petting the same. For instance, pet your cat with your left hand while picking up a wipe with the right hand, then switch and continue petting your cat with the wipe., Make your cat’s waterless bath feel more like a massage by petting it while you use the wipes. Wipe your cat in long strokes to distribute its skin’s natural oils throughout its coat. Focus extra attention on spots your cat likes to be pet (e.g. behind its ears) to make the experience enjoyable., Using a fresh wipe, gently clean your cat’s ears, eyes, and face. Gently brace your cat’s head with one hand (gently placed behind it) and softly dab away any debris or dirt. Reward your cat with treats, praise, and petting to create a positive association., When using cat bath wipes on your pet, make sure to wipe its front and back paws as well. Your cat’s feet may pick up litter, dust, and residue from household chemicals on a daily basis. Even if you are not giving your cat a full cleaning with cat bath wipes, wipe down its paws every few days to ensure that they are clean., Do not use cat bath wipes more than once a day, as they can dry out your cat’s skin. In general, your cat should be able to keep itself clean by self-grooming and washing itself. Opt for a waterless bath in special circumstances such as:an injury or infection that requires your cat to wear a lamp shade collar
your cat being too obsess to wash itself effectively
your cat’s fur getting too dirty to effectively clean on its own
your cat being too ill to groom itself
your aging cat being too sore or stiff to wash itself properly

However, if your cat has fleas, if he's an outdoor kitty who has stepped in something vile, or if he just looks and feels dirty, then it may be time to give that kitty a bath. If your kitty is very young, then you should wipe him off with a wet or damp washcloth instead of giving him a full-on bath.


Talk to your vet about when is a good time to give your little kitty a full-on bath. According to the Animal Compassion Network, you should wait until your kitty is at least 8 weeks old before giving him a full-on bath.One benefit to bathing your kitty when he's young is that this will make him used to bathing if he routinely gets dirty. Just remember that cats spend about 30% of their time grooming and that they really shouldn't be bathed more than once or twice a year unless they get really dirty.;
, Even the most mild-mannered kittens will protest a bit when you bathe them, especially if it's for the first time. To protect yourself from getting scratched by your favorite furry creature, you should make sure to trim his nails a bit so he's less likely to hurt you when you're bathing him. Though a kitten's scratches may not be as ferocious as those of a full-grown kitty, you could still get hurt. It's better to do this to keep yourself safe, even if your kitty protests a bit.You shouldn't trim your kitten's nails right before you bathe him, however. Do it the day before or at least a few hours before. A lot of cats get a bit feisty and riled up after their nails are trimmed, and you want your little critter to be in a calm frame of mind before you begin the bath.
If you haven't trimmed your kitten's nails yet, you're better off leaving quite a bit of time between nail trimming and bathing — even a full day. Nail trimming can be a new and scary experience for a young kitty, and you don't want to make it worse by adding a bath into the mix.

, Before you soak your little kitten, you should brush his fur, getting his coat, his legs, his belly, and even the top of his head. This is important because you'll be making sure that his fur is free of tangles and knots. If you put a kitty with uncombed fur into the bath, then you will be making those knots and tangles worse and will be creating a problem that could be avoided. Don't overlook this important step.Some kitties actually love having their fur brushed and look at this as a very relaxing process. However, others get a little panicked or agitated when their fur is brushed. If this process does not relax your cat, then give him an hour or two at least to calm down before the bath begins. Giving your kitty a little treat after brushing him can make the process feel more positive.

, Don't bathe your kitty in a little tank top that exposes your arms and chest. Instead, put on a long-sleeved shirt with decent thickness, so your kitty is less likely to scratch you. Some extremists say you should even protect your hands, but this is only if you know that your cat loves to bite and scratch. It's better to be safe than sorry, and wearing a long-sleeved shirt can keep you from having scratches up and down your arms.


You should also try to pick a thick cotton material for your clothes so your kitty doesn't get his nails caught on your clothes. Pick something that is hard to claw through.

, Kittens need a special baby shampoo, and cats with fleas need one formulated to kill fleas, flea eggs, etc. Cats without fleas can use general cat shampoo. Go to a pet store, your veterinarian, or shop at an online retailer. If you are in doubt, ask a sales associate for information on the best shampoo. Don't just bathe your kitten with soap or with general shampoo, or you can really hurt your kitty or irritate his skin.Don't use dog shampoo if you have it on hand, either. It needs to be tailor made to suit your kitty's needs.

, When you are ready to bathe the cat, get a cup for pouring water and a towel to dry the cat with. Get the shampoo ready. If you have an extra person to help you, that's great, too! Having all of your supplies ready in advance can help you bathe your kitten when the moment comes. You don't want to finally get your kitty in the bath to find that you've left the shampoo or towel in the other room.


It's also a good idea to close the door of your bathroom to keep your kitty from running off.

, If your kitten is new to baths and new to the world, you can try to make the bath a less scary place for your kitty. You can take some of his favorite toys and place them in the sink or basin you're using, or even associate the area where you're bathing him with fun and joy, so he doesn't think of it as a scary place. You can even play with him in the sink or basin without bathing him there at first, so he gets comfortable in that environment.


When the time comes to bathe your kitten, you can even throw in a few of his favorite toys, or a few bath toys, to make him comfortable. You can even get him used to playing with the bath toys in a dry environment first.

, This is a very important point. Don't bathe your kitty one minute after you've played for half an hour and gotten him all riled up, or after he's gotten agitated after spotting a bug in the room. Avoid bathing him just before his usual mealtime, or he's likely to be agitated and anxious, wanting food instead of a bath. Instead, pick a time when he's usually calm, resting, or just relaxed and not in need of anything.Though he'll naturally get excited pretty fast, it's better to start off with a calm kitty so you make it easier for yourself and your little creature to get through the bath.
You can also schedule a play session that tires your kitty out and then wait half an hour for him to get tired and to rest before bath time.

, The most common places to bathe your kitty are either in the sink or in a basin. Smaller enclosures make it easier to bathe your kitty and to maintain control of him. An entire bathtub will make it much harder to bathe your kitty. Though some people like to fill the basin and then ""dip"" their kitty into the water, this can actually cause your little one to panic, so you should only try this as a last resort. More commonly, you should place your kitty in the basin and then slowly pour lukewarm water over him.You can also consider putting a rubber bath mat at the bottom of the sink or basin to help keep your kitty from slipping.
Some people like to fill the basin with just an inch or two of lukewarm water to get kitty's paws used to the water before the bath begins. You can even do this as a training run in preparation for later bathing, if you like. If your cat is really afraid of water, then you may have to ease the little guy into the process.

, The cat will most likely cling to everything in an attempt to avoid the bathtub. Just take him down gently, one paw, then the other. Put him back in the sink. You might try gently holding the front shoulder section in front of his chest downward and using the other hand to shampoo the back of the cat while you keep his lower part down. Keep the panic or worry out of your voice and your kitty is likely to feel more calm and reassured. If you start freaking out, he'll sense that you're worried and will be more likely to mimic your reactions.


Pet your kitty while keeping a firm grip on his back or shoulders. If he's more calm sticking partly out of the basin with his front paws, then you can keep him in this position instead of placing his entire body in the basin.

, While the cat is in the kitchen sink or basin, start using the cup to pour lukewarm water on the cat until it is completely wet. Pour it gently over your kitty, even petting and stroking his fur while you do it so he feels calm. If you have a helper, then one person can help maintain control of the kitty by holding onto his shoulders while the other person pours the water. Pour no more than half to a full cup of water over your kitty at a time, and try to avoid his face at this point.Alternatively, you can fill the sink partway and dip the kitten in the water. If you choose this approach, then you can first place your kitty into just a little bit of the lukewarm water until his paws are wet, compliment him, and then dip him in more water. If you do this, though, try to fill the basin or sink when your kitty is in the other room, because some kitties are scared by the sound of running water.

, Use a small amount of shampoo, rub it together, and start on the cat's back. Work through the tail, hind legs, front legs, and neck. Be sure to get the tummy as well. If your kitty is really not liking this process, you can shampoo a little bit of kitty at a time, wash him off, and repeat. You don't want to cover your kitty with soap and then find it impossible to rinse him off before he runs off. You can use your hands or even a washcloth to help clean your kitty.


You should gently massage the shampoo into your kitty's fur and body. Treat it like it's the hair of a baby and avoid stroking his fur too hard. Be kind and gentle and your kitty is more likely to relax.
Your kitty may really not like the shampoo. Just keep reassuring him or her and try to keep kitty calm by staying calm yourself.
Try to keep the soap out of your kitty's eyes. You don't want to hurt the little critter in the process of bathing him.

, Once you've cleaned your kitty with the shampoo, you should begin to rinse him off. You can gently pour water onto your kitty from a pitcher, using your hands to wash his fur, until the water runs clear. If your kitty is in a sink, you can drain it so the soapy water disappears. Keep pouring a bit of water at a time over your kitty's body until he is shampoo free. For extra help, you can also use a wet washcloth and run it over your kitty's body.


Some kitties love and are fascinated by faucets. If your cat is not scared off by faucet water and you're bathing him in a sink, you can use a gentle stream of this water to help rinse off your kitty.

, There's no real need to wash your kitty's face with shampoo. Just a bit of water on his face will help keep him clean and fresh. You can use a wet washcloth to dab his face to make it easier. Take care not to get water in your kitty's eyes or nose and to be gentle with his face. Some kitties don't like to have their faces touched, especially when there's water involved, so you should be as gentle as possible.


Whatever you do, do not place your kitty's face underwater. Doing so is guaranteed to make him panic.

, At first, it can help to blot your kitty dry with a towel before you wrap him in a towel. This will help get off some of the dampness and will keep him from feeling like you're trapping him in a wet enclosure. Just gently blotting his face, body, and fur can make your kitty feel a bit more relaxed before you place him in a towel.


Some people even use hair dryers on the lowest setting to help dry their kittens. You have to do what works best for your cat. Some are fascinated by the dryer and some are are terrified of it. If your kitty is okay with the hairdryer, then place it on the lowest heat setting and gently dry his fur just as you would with your hair, only taking a bit more care not to scare your kitty or harm him.

, Once you manage this, you should quickly dry the cat to get most of the dampness off. Be aware that small animals can lose a great deal of body temperature through damp fur so dry the kitten as much as possible, before providing a heat source for him/her to dry in front of. The towel may make the kitty feel a little claustrophobic and he may panic a little, but it's important to dry him off as much as you can. Your kitty will likely also shake the water off himself, like a dog.If you have a long-haired kitty, then you should brush his fur after the bath to get rid of any tangles that maybe have been caused by the bath.

, Afterwards, offer treats, cuddles, hugs, and kisses. Your poor baby has just experienced one of the worst things it can. Most cats hate water! (However, two exceptions are the Turkish Van, and Bengal breeds.) Even if your kitty will get used to the baths, the initial experience is likely to have been a bit upsetting, and you should acknowledge that.


Also, if you give your kitty treats after the bath, then he will associate baths with good things instead of bad, and he'll be more likely to want a bath in the future.

Rinse thoroughly from head to tail.,
Wrap the cat in a big, dry towel.,
Remember that cats are usually self-cleaning.,
Keep the cat brushed.,
Use a damp washcloth to spot clean when necessary.",How to Bathe an Angry Cat With Minimal Damage," When trying to bathe an upset cat, it’s important you have everything ready before beginning. The angry cat will likely be looking for any opportunity to escape the bath, so leaving him alone to go grab a supply you forgot will probably result in a wet, soapy cat running around freely. Before taking your cat to the bath, get your cat shampoo, towels, and a washcloth ready. Have these things handy beside the tub.Consider placing a rubber bath mat on the floor of the sink or tub you will be bathing the cat in. This can help the cat feel sturdier and keep the cat from slipping and sliding around.
Use only shampoo made specifically for cats. Shampoo designed for humans is far too drying, and won’t be good for the cat. You can buy cat shampoo at your local pet supply store, or even from your vet’s office.
Use a towel that is big and soft. You want it to be big enough to wrap the cat in after its bath. You could even toss the towel in the dryer for a few minutes to warm it up before you start the bath.
Consider wearing a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from scratches.
Get a brush and your cat's nail clippers to groom the cat before the bath.;
, Prior to attempting to bathe the cat, make sure its nails are freshly trimmed. This will help prevent unwanted scratches when you do bathe the cat. Also before bathing, give the cat a thorough brushing. This will help remove any tangles in its fur, as well as any excess dirt or debris. You can also use a brushing session as a way to soothe and calm the cat before attempting to bathe it.If your cat doesn’t tolerate having its nails trimmed, consider having your veterinarian or a professional groomer do this for you.

, It’s best to try and bathe your cat when its at its most calm. If you startle the cat by grabbing at it or chasing it, you might find it’s even harder to get through the bath itself. A soothing brushing session, lots of petting and speaking softly to the cat will help get the cat feeling more relaxed before you take it for its bath.You can also try to tire the cat out before the bath by playing with it for a while.

, When it comes to bathing a difficult cat, it’s always an easier experience when you have an extra set of hands to help you along the way. Ask a friend or family member to lend some help with bathing the cat. It helps if the person you ask is comfortable handling cats—especially angry ones.It may also help if the cat is familiar with the other person, so that they aren’t stressed out by the presence of a stranger.

, In a sink or bathtub, fill the bottom with a few inches of lukewarm water. You don’t want the water to be cold, but you don’t want it to be too hot, either. Lukewarm water will be the most comfortable for the cat, and won’t be too shocking or startling for it when you place the cat in the water., When placing the cat in the tub, hold the cat gently by the scruff on the back of its neck. Ask the friend helping you to gently hold the cat’s back end. If the cat is especially angry, it will be especially important to keep it as still as you possibly can. However, you want to be as gentle as possible so you don’t injure or scare the cat.


Keep the door shut. Wherever you’re bathing the cat, try to keep the cat contained in that space, in the event that the cat does break loose from your grip and jump out of the tub., After you use a spray nozzle or cup to wet down the cat’s fur, apply the shampoo. While your friend helps you hold the cat in place, gently apply shampoo and massage it into its fur. If your cat has very thick or long fur, you can dilute the shampoo to keep the cat’s fur from getting too sudsy. Try using one part shampoo with five parts water, then apply that diluted version to your cat’s fur.Avoid getting water or shampoo on your cat’s face, or in its ears. When wetting the cat down, spray or pour water away from its face. Use the damp washcloth you have handy, instead, to gently wipe the cat’s face clean.

, Again, take care to keep soap and water away from your cat’s face when rinsing out the shampoo. Using your hand, gently push water and shampoo out of the cat’s fur in the direction of hair growth as you rinse. This will help ensure you get all the suds out, and will also help eliminate excess water from the cat’s fur as you rinse.It’s important you make sure to rinse out all the soap. Leftover residue from soap can irritate your cat’s skin, causing the cat to feel itchy and scratch at himself. It can also be a bit sticky, and make more dirt end up clinging to the cat’s fur even after it’s dry.

, Once you’ve thoroughly rinsed out all the shampoo, try to gently remove excess water by running your hand down the cat’s fur in the direction of hair growth. Use your hand like a squeegee to help get rid of extra water. Then, have your friend help you wrap up the cat in the towel you have ready. Wrap him tightly, but not too tight. Make sure he can breathe well, but that he can’t escape. Keep the cat wrapped up to allow its fur to dry as much as possible.While the cat dries, try to keep it in a room that is warm, without any cold drafts or breezes from fans or open windows.
If you want to try and use a blow dryer on the cat, make sure you keep it on its lowest heat setting. You won’t want to accidentally burn the cat’s sensitive skin., For the most part, cats are very good at keeping themselves clean. You should really only need to bathe them if they get especially dirty, or if they have a condition that requires you to bathe them more often. Your vet will advise you if your cat needs to be bathed often., Brushing your cat regularly is a good way to keep it clean without giving it a bath. Brushing removes knots, mats, and debris from your cat’s fur. It also can improve the health of your cat’s skin overall, by helping to stimulate blood circulation, and getting rid of dead or loose fur and excess grease and oil.Use a brush designed for cats, and be gentle. If you find a mat or knot that cannot easily be brushed out, carefully trim them out.
Regular brushing to remove dead or excess hair can also help keep your cat from coughing up hairballs from self-grooming.
When brushing, monitor your cat’s skin and hair for signs of excess shedding, fleas, ticks, or skin infections. If you notice any of these things, or anything abnormal, talk to your vet.

, Instead of immediately putting your cat in the bathtub if you notice some dirt on its fur, simply use a dampened washcloth to wipe it away. Not only will this prevent the drama that can sometimes come from trying to bathe a cat that doesn’t want to be bathed, it can also help prevent excess skin drying from bathing your cat too often.

Keep the mealworms in a glass, metal, plastic or wax coated container.,
Line the bottom of the container.,
Keep the container in a warm place.,
Use moist foods to provide the worms with water.,
Change the food/bedding every few weeks.,
Use fruits and vegetables that are less likely to get soggy.,
Keep different life stages in separate containers.,
Feed each stage the same.,
Keep the temperature of the container above 62 degrees (F).",How to Care for Mealworms," You want to be sure they can’t get a grip on the sides of the container you keep them in, as they could likely climb out. Containers with smooth, slippery sides and surfaces are best for keeping the mealworms inside.Avoid containers made of things like cardboard, or any containers lined in fabric. These surfaces will be easy for the worms to latch onto and climb up, which could allow them to get out.
As long as the container is at least 8 centimeters deep and has slippery sides, you can probably get away without putting a lid on it. But, if you want a lid, just make sure you poke small airholes in the top. Try using cheesecloth as an alternative, as this will also help keep other insects out of the container.;
, The material you use to line the container with will also act as the mealworms’ food, so you will likely have to add more to make up for what the worms eat. Things like oatmeal, grain cereal like Cheerios, cornmeal, or dog food that has been ground down to crumbs are good options for lining the bottom of the mealworms’ container.You can try a mixture of these different items, as well. Use a food processor to grind up larger pieces to make the substrate more consistent in texture and size. You can layer the lining to be about 4 centimeters deep in the container.

, Room temperature is adequate, but about 80 degrees (F) will be more ideal if you plan to breed and increase your number of mealworms. If you live someplace where the temperature and climate are on the more mild side, you could try keeping the mealworms out in a garage., Slices or pieces of fruits and vegetables like potatoes and apples work well for this purpose. Potatoes are an especially good option as they take a bit longer to mold and dry out.Don’t put any water in the container. Mealworms will crawl into a water dish and end up drowning. Use the fruit and vegetables as a source of moisture and water.
Switch out dried or molded pieces of fruit and vegetables for fresh ones as needed.

, You will need to add more food to the container as the worms consume it, but you don’t need to actually change all of the bedding until a few weeks have passed. Keep an eye on it to make sure no mold is growing, and that there is no foul odor.You can use a sifter to gently separate the worms from the bedding when you need to change it, or even when you need to remove the worms for any other reason.

, If you notice the moist food you provided is making the bedding too wet or damp, change it out for something else. If your container has a lid and you notice the lid is collecting condensation, your container has a bit too much moisture. Try to let a little more air in., If you plan to keep your mealworms and let them develop into pupae and eventually beetles, make sure to take the pupae out of the container. The beetles and the worms will both eat these if they are left in the container.If you don’t plan to keep the mealworms into the next stages of life, keep in mind that they usually remain at the larval (worm) phase for 8-10 weeks. If you purchase the worms and they are already fully grown, you may have less time than that., Beetles and larvae eat the same thing, so keep refreshing and adding to the food bedding you have already been maintaining, even after the transition between stages. Once the larvae become pupae, they will not eat during this stage.If you notice pupae in your container, transfer them into another container that is lined with a paper towel rather than the bedding. This will give the pupae something to hold onto while they transition into their next life stage, which will take anywhere from 6-24 days., Temperatures lower than this can have a negative effect on the reproduction cycle. If you are trying to progress the life cycle and encourage full grown beetles to lay eggs and start the cycle over, make sure they have a warm environment in which to do so.On the other hand, if you have a large amount of larvae and want to use them as food for pets, you can refrigerate the larvae in a container with holes in the lid and they will last longer. But, temperatures lower than 40 degrees (F) may cause the worms to die.

Prepare a container.,
Prepare the layers for a wormery.,
Gather worms.,
Put the container in an appropriate environment.,
Check the acidity if necessary.",How to Build a Wormery2," For a large wormery, you can use a plastic bin or garbage can with drainage holes drilled in, covered by recycled wood from old pallets. You can use many different types of containers to house worms and even layers of containers separated by wire mesh, as long as the top of your wormery has holes for ventilation. Large wormeries should also have preparations made for drainage.Another option for a large wormery is to use three old tires, weld mesh, and plywood or hardwood. Create a flat base with bricks or paving slabs, topped with a thick layer of newspaper. Cut the wire mesh into three circles with wire cutters, so that each circle fits over a tire rim. You can secure it to the tire with garden ties. Cover the top with a board weighed down with bricks.Keep stones or gravel in a layer at the bottom of the container. Put a sheet of cardboard over the gravel and a layer of shredded newspaper over that to prevent the worms from falling through. Add drainage holes in the bottom of your container.Check the drainage holes occasionally to make sure they are clear., Fill the bottom of the container with eight to ten centimeters of gravel or coarse sand. On top of that, put a circle of polythene or wood with drainage holes. Add seven to eight centimeters of damp material like compost manure or leaf litter. Add worms to the bedding. Put a layer of moist newspaper on the top or side. Add kitchen waste to the top layer.


Prepare a moist, degradable blanket for the top layer of old newspapers. Worms also like moist, torn cardboard.If your wormery has stacked containers, stuff each layer with shredded paper. Put about five centimeters of compost in the bottom layer, along with the worms. Add kitchen waste to the top layer to attract the worms up from below.

, You can look for or purchase earthworms or tiger worms (redworms) for your wormery. Places you can find worms include compost heaps, gardens, or underneath rocks or leaf litter. Try checking the grass or driveway after a heavy rain. If you can’t find worms, you can buy them at a fishing tackle shop.Keep your hands wet when handling the worms. They breathe through their skin and need to remain moist.
There are various tricks for catching worms. You can dig in the ground, or pour a water and soap solution on the grass.

, Store the container in a cool, dark place such as a shed or garage during cold months. In warmer months, the container can stay in the shed or garage, or be moved to an area with partial shade. Your worms will be the most active if you keep them in an environment between 64 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 25 degrees Celsius). Their activity will lessen noticeably if their environment is below 10ºC (50ºF) or above 30ºC (86ºF).If your wormery isn’t staying warm enough in the shed or garage in cold months, you have a couple of options. You can bury your wormery in the ground or snow to protect it from harsh temperatures. Or, you can surround the container with insulating material like polystyrene, thick carpeting, or a clear plastic tarp.Add a thick layer of hay, straw, grass or dry leaves to the top layer of your wormery during cold weather.

, Composting worms like the pH level of their environment to be between 6.5 and 7.0. You can check soil acidity with a soil test from a garden store if your worm aren’t producing as expected.Add coffee grounds or a small amount of peat moss to increase the acidity.To decrease acidity, add egg shells and/or turn the bedding weekly."
"
Keep their climate ideal.,
Feed the worms.,
Watch out for fruit flies.,
Remove worm castings.",How to Build a Wormery3," Keep the worms’ environment moist, not wet or dry. Don’t allow it to get cold or too hot. The temperature of your wormery should stay between 55 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 to 25 degrees Celsius).If the wormery is too wet and starts to smell, take everything out and thoroughly mix it with brown material before returning it to the container.
If the wormery stays too dry, remove the contents, mix them with some water and green material, and return it to the container.

, Feed the worms by adding kitchen waste to the top, such as uncooked fruit, coffee grounds, tea leaves and vegetable peelings.Although worms can process just about anything that’s decomposable, there are certain items that aren’t advisable to add. Worms can die from overfeeding, so make sure that you only add waste when the previous waste has been composted. However you should check the container regularly, since they’ll die from not enough food as well. As a rule of thumb, try checking every day or every other day.Use a variety of food for your worms rather than the same thing over and over. The pieces you add should be small. If you give them garden waste, do so sparingly (a few annual weeds here and there).
Don’t give your worms meat, fish, dairy products, seeds, citrus peel, garlic and onions. Also avoid fatty foods like peanut butter or mayonnaise.

, Since the wormery needs to be ventilated, the openings give fruit flies a way to get in. Feed your worms by digging a small trench in the wormery and adding the scraps. Then cover the scraps with an inch or so of bedding. This will prevent fruit flies as well as odors., About every three months, move the top bedding to the side and add fresh bedding. Wait about two weeks, and the worms will have moved over into the new bedding. You can then scoop out their castings with the old bedding.You can work worm castings and their old bedding into your garden as fertilizer.

Choose a waterless cat shampoo.,
Apply the shampoo.,
Remove excess foam.",How to Bathe a Cat Without Water2," There are a variety of waterless pet shampoos on the market for cats that can’t stand water. Opt for an all-natural, non-toxic foam shampoo that will not dry out your cat’s skin. Look for a veterinarian recommended brand, or ask your veterinarian for advice about choosing the right product., Choose a time when your cat is relaxed to apply the shampoo. Read the instructions to see how much product to use, then distribute foam evenly throughout your cat’s coat. Massage your cat as you apply the shampoo to keep it calm and content., After distributing the foam evenly through your cat’s coat, remove any excess foam with your fingers and wash your hands. Brush the remaining shampoo through your cat’s coat with a pin brush. No rinsing is necessary. "

Buy the right tools.,
Brush your cat often.,
Getting rid of mats.,
Keep your cat's ears clean.",How to Bathe a Cat Without Water3," Invest in quality grooming tools for your cat to help to keep its coat clean and healthy. Purchase a pin brush for either a short-haired or long-haired cat, and buy a de-matter and thinning shears to remove knots or tangles from a long-haired cat. A grooming glove may also be a good choice to remove loose hair if your cat does not like ordinary brushing., Brushing your cat can achieve many of the same benefits that waterless bathing provides, such as redistributing essential oils through the cat's coat. For short-haired cats, brush once week with a pin brush for basic maintenance, and for long haired cats, brush daily with a wide-tooth brush. Be very gentle while brushing around your cat's chest and belly., To untangle mats in your cat's fur, use a de-matter or thinning shears (both available at pet stores or online) instead of scissors. The long prongs of the de-matter can tease knots out, while the thinning shears can cut out tangles without leaving obvious holes in your cat's coat. Be gentle and cautious when removing tangles to avoid harming your cat during the process., Clean your cat's ears regularly to help contribute to its overall hygiene. Buy an ear cleaning liquid from your veterinarian, or ask your veterinarian what cleaning liquid they recommend to buy from a pet store. Use a cotton ball to apply the ear cleaning liquid to your cat's ear canals, and let it dry and evaporate on its own.Always use ear cleaning liquid to clean your cat's ears instead of water, which can build up in your cat's ear canals.

Check your cat's nails on a regular basis.",How to Trim Your Cat's Nails," Most cats are naturally a little skittish about having their paws handled, so begin by helping your cat get accustomed to it.Wait for a time when your cat is relaxed and lounging.
Begin gently petting its paws while simultaneously petting the cat in its favorite spots (the back of the neck, under the chin, where its back meets its tail, etc.).
Do this for each paw you plan to trim.
The cat might pull its paws away, or even get up and walk away. Let it go; don't force it to do anything, but continue to gently pet its paws when you have the opportunity.
Whenever you handle your cat’s paws, reward it with treats and praise to help build positive associations.;
, Once your cat is comfortable enough to allow you to rest your hand on its paws without pulling away, start to gently hold its paws in your open hand.


Place your hand over the cat’s paw, then flip your hand around so the bottom of the cat's paw is on the palm of your hand.
Keep rewarding the cat with petting and treats; give the cat a new, special treat that will only be associated with cutting its claws.

, After your cat grows accustomed to you holding its paws, start holding the paws and massaging them with your fingers.Gently massage your fingers over the tops and bottoms of each paw you plan to trim.
Reward your cat with more treats and praise.

, Eventually, you should be able to gently squeeze the paws (applying most of the pressure on the pads) to push individual claws out without upsetting your cat.When your cat’s claws are extended, you’ll see the thick part of the nail, and, towards the cat’s toe, a pinkish area inside the nail, called the quick.
The quick is the living part of the nail and contains blood vessels and nerves, so cutting a cat’s nail to the quick is quite painful for the cat. Never cut a cat's nail close to or with flush with the toe; your aim is to clip off only the sharp point.Look carefully at where and how large each quick is--through a clear nail it will look like a small pink triangle. Each of your cat’s nails will be similar, so even if the cat has dark nails, look to find one clear nail as a reference point for the others.

,


If you're going to be trimming the cat's nails by yourself, the cat will need to sit on its rear on your lap, facing away from you, while you hold its paw with one hand (and, eventually, the clippers with the other).
Practice having your cat sit this way and hold each of its paws. Gently press on each nail to extend it. Again, reward the cat with treats and praise.If you have someone to help, they can hold the cat facing you, or they can cradle it, while you hold the paw with one hand (and, eventually, clip with the other).
Practice having your assistant hold your cat while you hold each of its paws and gently press each claw until your cat seems comfortable. Reward it with treats and praise.

, You can't trim your cat’s nails whenever you feel like it. You should pick a time when your cat is feeling nice and relaxed, such as when it's just coming out of a nap, getting ready to nap, or calmly resting on its favorite surface during the day.Another good time for nail trimming is after your cat has eaten and is feeling sleepy and content.
Don't try to trim your cat's nails right after play time, when it’s hungry, when it's restless and running around, or in an otherwise aggressive mood. The cat will be far from receptive to you trimming its nails.
You may see that your cat has a broken or splitting nail and will want to cut it instantly, but don’t. Make a note of it and wait for your cat to get relaxed before trying to cut it, or you could make it worse.

, Before sitting down to cut your cat’s nails, be sure you have the right equipment to do so. To trim your cat's nails, you’ll need a pair of nail clippers designed to clip cat claws and a styptic pencil.There are several different styles of nail clippers, all of which largely do the same job. The most important thing is that the clippers are sharp, so they snip straight through the claw. Not only will using dull clippers make the job longer and harder, you may end up squeezing the quick, which can be painful for the cat. There are two primary styles of clipper: scissor and guillotine clippers.
Scissor clippers cut a cat’s nails using a scissor motion and usually come in small and large sizes. The small “nippers” tend to be better for those new to clipping nails or if you just need to snip the tips. Larger scissor clippers are suited to cutting older, tougher nails.
Guillotine clippers use a sliding blade that cuts the nail when you squeeze the handles together. The claw fits into a slot and the blade slides across to clip the nail. These are strong clippers that are good for cutting long, thick nails (but not overgrown nails--large clippers are better suited to that).
If the clippers are sharp the cat won't feel the quick clip. Clippers don't stay sharp forever, so discard them (or send them for sharpening) if you suspect the blades have gone dull. Signs of this include having to apply a lot of pressure to cut the nail or the nail being “chewed” by the clippers rather than making a clean cut.
Also have a styptic pencil on hand in case you cut the cat’s quick (which is less likely with a cat than a dog, as the cat's quick is much shorter). Styptic pencils are readily available from pharmacies (typically in the shaving section). They cauterize blood vessels when touched to the nail and help prevent bleeding. If you cut the quick, you can hold the styptic pencil to the claw for 1 - 2 minutes and the bleeding should stop.

,
Gently squeeze the top and bottom of your cat’s paw, on the joint just behind the claw to extend the claw., Be sure you know where the quick is before you attempt to cut the nail--the quick will look like a small, pinkish triangle inside the nail.


You should first cut just the tip of the nails, and as you get more comfortable, you can cut closer to the quick, but never cut all the way to the quick or you can hurt your cat and make its nails bleed.

, Hold the cat as described earlier and cut the nails one by one. Position the trimmers halfway between the end of the quick and the claw.


Try to orient the clippers so that when the nail is cut, the blade cuts from bottom to top. This will help prevent splitting.
Try to avoid getting frustrated. Your cat may protest, meow, and try to scratch you, but don't yell at your cat or rush through the process, or you may end up hurting it and scaring it away having its nails trimmed again.
You may only be able to trim one or two nails at a time at first.

, It’s been a good sport about letting you cut its nails and should be rewarded for enduring it.


Make the treat special: vacuum-packed salmon, or chicken. Some cats also like sour cream or butter.
Using a special treat ensures that your cat begins to associate this treat with getting its nails trimmed. So though your cat may not love the nail-trimming part, it'll want the treat afterwards, so it'll be less resistant in the future.

, Each cat's nails grow at a different rate, but it's a good rule of thumb to trim your cat's nails somewhere between every two weeks and every month so that its nails don't get too long, split, or break.


Though your cat will be sharpening its claws and keeping them in good shape on its own, keep an eye on their nails nonetheless. Your cat could be walking around with a broken nail, and you can help it out by trimming it into shape.
Older cats need special attention because their nails are thicker and can sometimes press around into the pads, cutting into them. Check your older cat's nails every week and clip the tip off if necessary. This is much easier than letting the nails get overgrown, which can cause them to impact into the pads. If this happens, the cat will need to see a veterinarian because antibiotics may be necessary., Don't get a stranger or relative stranger to help you trim your cat's nails or your cat will be even more scared.


Though it sounds good and fine to get your cat used to having its nails trimmed, the reality is, many cats will still protest every single time, and you may have to get some extra help to do it.

, You can both try standing on opposite sides of a raised surface, like a counter.


Both of you should talk calmly and reassuringly to the cat.
Have your helper pet the cat and try to keep it in place by holding on to its body without hurting it or scaring it too much.
If your cat enjoys being brushed, the other person can brush the cat to distract it from the fact that it's getting its nails trimmed. Have your helper brush the cat’s head, under its neck, or in other places where it enjoys being brushed.

, While holding the paw, push down on the pad to extend the claws.


If your cat is being rowdy, wait for it to settle down so that you can isolate the paw.

, Your helper will continue to distract the cat while you trim its claws.


Just follow the directions in the previous section to make sure you give your cat a smooth, painless nail trim.
When you're done, reward your cat with a nice treat.

, Every cat's nails will grow at a different rate, but it's good practice to trim your cat's nails somewhere between every two weeks and every month so that its nails don't get too long, split, or break.


Though your cat will likely sharpen its claws and keep them in good shape on its own, keep an eye on its nails nonetheless. Your cat could be walking around with a broken nail, and you can help it out by trimming it into shape.
Older cats need special attention because their nails are thicker and can sometimes press around into the pads and cut into them. Check your older cat's nails every week, and clip the tip off if necessary. This is much easier than letting the nails get overgrown, which can cause them to impact into the pads. If this happens then the cat will need to see a veterinarian because antibiotics may be necessary."

Examine their feet.,
Rinse their feet.,
Wipe their feet gently.,
Get in between their toes.,
Avoid using chemicals not intended for cats.",How to Clean Your Cat's Feet1," Before cleaning your cat’s feet, you should take a quick look at them. This will provide you with information about the general health of your cat’s feet. When examining their feet:


Look for redness or sores. This could indicate allergies or infections.
See if there is any green or black pus. This could indicate a virus or infection.
If your cat has infection between their pads, your veterinarian may recommend an antifungal soak using such medicines as captan, chlorhexidine, or povidone iodine.;
, By rinsing their feet, you'll remove dirt and grime and make it easier for you to wipe down and clean your cat's feet. You’ll also aid in their self-cleaning process by removing debris before they lick their own feet.


Pour warm water (99 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) into a medium size bowl or similar container.
Quickly dip your cat's feet (one at a time) into the water.
Skip this step if your cat doesn't want their feet dipped., After dipping, you should gently wipe your cat's feet in order to remove any excess dirt that remained after dipping. Wiping their feet down is important, as you'll be able to get dirt that wasn't removed when you rinsed their feet.


Wet a clean microfiber cloth in warm water (99 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius).
Dab or wipe their feet thoroughly.
If their feet are particularly dirty, use a little bit more water.
If your cat resists your attempts to clean their feet, let them go. Don’t get yourself hurt or hurt your cat holding them down.
If for some reason you need to use a shampoo or similar product, make sure it is formulated for cats. In addition, follow manufacturer directions regarding proper dilution., In order to clean your cat's feet properly, you need to make sure that you clean between their toes. This is important, as dirt and grime may accumulate in hard-to-reach areas of your cat's foot.


Gently separate their toes.
Use your cloth or rag to wipe away dirt.
Rinse your rag after you've cleaned a crevice between toes., Since cats regularly lick their own feet to clean them, you should avoid using soaps or other chemicals not intended for cats. By using these products, you’ll potentially introduce chemicals that your cat will wind up licking and digesting. Stay away from:


Artificial dyes
Parabens
Sodium laurel sulphate
Petrochemicals
Human cleaning products
Cleaning products formulated for other animals"

It also has surfaces to either side on which to put your supplies. Place a dry towel over the drain.


Fill the sink with 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) of warm water. The temperature should feel pleasantly warm when you dip your elbow in.;
, Getting all your supplies together will make giving your cat a bath much easier, particularly if you have a fussy cat who doesn't enjoy bath time. The supplies you will need include:


A plastic jug to pour water.
A hose attachment for the faucets.
Cat shampoo.
Nail clippers.
Several dry towels.
Hairdryer (optional).
Brush.
Cotton balls.

, It is a good idea to cut your cat’s claws before your commence bath time. Not only might you forget to do this later, but if she does panic during the bath you are less likely to get scratched. Use cat claw nail clippers, which can be purchased at your local pet store. To extend your cat’s nails:


Place your cat on your knee, or on a work surface at a comfortable working height. Lift a paw. To extend a retracted claw, simply press gently on the last joint of the toe – this has the effect of extending the nail.

, It is easiest to trim clear nails because you can see the living part of the quick (nail) through the translucent keratin. Clip away the sharp hook only; doing this will leave the chunky, triangular part of the nail still attached to the toe. Do not attempt to trim back as far as the toe or you will cut into the sensitive tissue of the quick that contains nerves and blood vessels. Trim each nail in turn.Most cats have five toes on each front paw and four toes on each back foot.

, If she starts to panic, grasping her scruff may help to reassure her since doing this has a naturally subduing effect on cats. Stay calm and speak softly at all times because you cat will take her cues from you and if you are stressed, she’ll be stressed too., Allow her to settle and become used to the feel of warm water against her legs and belly. You may need to gently restrain her by holding her shoulders, to stop her jumping straight out of the tub.

, Once she relaxes, use your hand to drizzle water over her back and shoulders. As she starts to accept this, you can pick up the jug and use this as a scoop to thoroughly wet her coat. Don’t forget to soak her neck and brisket areas.


Take care not to get water in her ears or eyes. In theory, putting cotton wool in her ears should work to stop water from entering her ear canals, but cats are likely to shake the cotton straight out so doing this is likely to be a waste of time.

, With an indoor cat it is not always necessary to use a shampoo since her coat is unlikely to be heavily soiled. Simply rinsing her with water should do the trick. However, for show cats or those who roam, use a shampoo specifically designed for cats.


Ideally, choose a shampoo that is not perfumed (because cat skin is very sensitive) and does not contain insecticides (which are potentially irritant.)

, Pour a small amount of shampoo into your palm. Dip the fingers of the opposite hand into the shampoo in order to apply small volumes evenly all over your cat. Once you have applied all the shampoo, use your fingertips to massage it into the wet coat and raise a lather.


Once again, don’t forget to work around your cat’s neck, throat and brisket areas, but avoiding getting shampoo into her ears or eyes.

, Scoop up water from the sink with the jug you have been using. Hold the jug close to your cat and pour a steady stream over her skin and fur. Repeat this multiple times until your cat’s coat appears lather free., Move the cat to one side of the sink. Remove the plug to let the soiled water drain away. Pick up the shower attachment and turn on the faucets to a low to moderate flow of water. The water’s temperature should be pleasantly warm. Run the water over your cat’s fur until the water coming out of her fur is clear.

, Using both hands, lift your cat from the sink and place her on a towel so that she doesn’t drip everywhere. Cover her with another towel, making sure not to cover her head. Gently rub the towel against her wet fur to remove excess moisture.


If the towel gets too wet and isn’t really drying her anymore, use a new towel to continue the drying process.

, If you decide to use a hair dryer, set it to the lowest air speed and on the first heat seating. If the air is blasted too fast, your cat is more likely to flee, and high heat settings can inadvertently burn your cat’s delicate skin. Hold the dryer at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) away, and dry small sections of fur at a time.


For added volume in show cats, brush both with, and against, the direction of the lie of the coat in order to ‘fluff’ it up. Continue in this way until the coat is dried to your satisfaction.
Keep in mind that hair dryers can have an effect on your cat’s coat. The plus side is that you can add volume to the coat, but the minus is that it sometimes makes for more fluff and less gloss.

, Place your cat on a clean, dry surface. Pour some cooled, boiled (boiling sterilizes the water) water onto a cotton pad and wipe her face. Start with the eyes and wipe outwards, removing any dried discharges or sleep from the corners of her eyes and nose. Use a clean piece of cotton for each eye, to avoid transfer of any bacteria.


Using more dry cotton pads, wipe out any moisture that might have accidentally splashed into your cat’s ears.

, Go over your cat’s fur with a wide toothed comb. Follow the direction of your cat’s fur to make it smooth and shiny. Finish with a final groom with a bristle brush, again following the lie of the coat. Doing this will help to add that final gloss that will wow the judges at any cat show.

Give your cat a dry bath.",How to Bathe a Cat," Your cat may become excited when covered in water, so to decrease the damage they may cause, trim their nails before you give them a bath. Try to do this a few hours or even a day or two before the bath so they have time to calm down bathing.Take care to cut at a point which will not cause pain or bleeding.


Giving your kitty treats as a reward for getting their nails trimmed will always make them feel better and calmer.;
, Do not skip this step. Brushing the cat will help remove any knots and tangles in the fur, which will be much more difficult and painful to remove once your cat is wet. If your kitty likes getting brushed, then you can use the brush to make the kitty feel more at home in the tub.Sometimes you can even brush your cat as a way to distract them enough to allow their nails to be trimmed. This is a great way of killing two birds with one stone, but you'll need another person to help you.

, You can get kitty shampoo from your vet or local pet store. Check the instructions to see if it's right for your cat, and dilute it with water if necessary. Using regular human shampoo can not only dry out your cat's skin but can be toxic for your cat. Don't use dog shampoo in a pinch, either. You're better off using water rather than a product that can harm your cat.You may want a washcloth for massaging the shampoo onto your cat's body, but your hands may actually be better for this.

, The first thing you should do is tire your kitty out, so they are at their most mellow before they enter the water. This will make them less likely to bite, scratch, or to try to get away. Pick a time when your kitty is at their calmest — often after they have been fed. If they still act hyper, play with them as much as you can until their are worn out. Here are some other ways to get your kitty adjusted to the bath before you start bathing them:Put some cat toys in the empty tub. Place your cat in it and play for a few minutes. Then stop and add a little water before playing again. By doing so, you'll get your cat used to the tub and water. Bath time will soon be associated with something pleasant and non-threatening.
You could also have a special toy just for bath time, such as a mouse on a string or something that floats. Only allow your cat to play with this toy in the tub and it will inspire him to look forward to bathing, instead of fearing it.

, This will keep your cat from escaping and, if you have more than one cat, will keep the others out. A yowling cat can frighten your bathing cat, making it likely to scratch or panic. Keeping the door closed will also prevent your cat from running out and tearing things up out of fear.


If your cat has never been in the bathroom before, you might want to get him used to the area. Also, if the bathroom has a toilet, keep the toilet seat down at all times. Your cat might jump into the toilet in a complete panic!
Likewise, if you have a litter box in the same room as you are bathing the cat, remove it. If your cat escapes from the bath, it may make a beeline to the litter box and make a huge mess.

, Lay down a rubber mat or towel in the tub so your kitty doesn't slip and has more comfortable footing. You'll need to place some towels on the floor because it'll get wet.Also, have at least two towels on hand for drying kitty when the time comes.


You can also place a small cooling rack or oven rack in the tub to give the cat something to hold on to. This reduces the chance of you being scratched and makes the cat feel more secure.

, Fill the tub with a few inches of warm, not hot, water before bringing your cat into the bathroom, since some cats can be unnerved by running water. Fill two large cups or, ideally, plant watering pots, which allow you to direct the flow of water as you rinse the cat. This is so you don't need to run more water during the bath, which might frighten your cat.Do not use the overhead shower head or faucet to bathe your kitty. This will make the water pour down too hard and can overwhelm your cat. The bath should be as gentle and soothing as possible and shouldn't feel like a water attack.
You won't have time to run out for anything while your cat is in the bath, so you'll need to have everything ready. Be prepared and calm.

, This will keep you safe from any possible scratches, minor or major. A jumper, sweater, or long-sleeved shirt should be worn so that your cat has no bare skin to scratch. You can wear long-sleeved gloves, but these are bulky and can get in the way. Be careful and gentle when you rub his head and belly, since these are sensitive areas.


It is also a good idea to wear clothing that isn't new and that you don't mind getting wet.

, Talk to your cat in a calm, quiet voice while washing. Sometimes cats will try to get out of the tub. If they prefer to have only two of their feet in the water, face them toward the back of the tub and let them stand on two feet. You may have to hold the loose skin, or scruff, of the cat gently while you are bathing to keep the kitty in the tub. If you're really having difficulty doing this, you can consider getting a cat harness, as long as it doesn't hurt the kitty.


It's easier to bathe your cat if there are two people involved, especially if your cat is rather strong and can kick and wriggle its way out of your hands. One person can restrain by the scruff and the other bathes the cat. You should plan to be done as quickly as possible without rushing. Be sure your cat can breathe comfortably while restrained.

, At no point is it recommended to fight with your cat. A scared 10 pound cat can do a lot of damage to a human (or two). You may need to start with just getting the feet and legs wet and then stop. Try more another day and work your way up to a full bath.


If you're nervous or excited about the process, your kitty will know and respond by being nervous too.

, Use a little bit of shampoo and water to wash your cat's neck, body, legs, belly, and tail. Start at the neck and work toward their tail, in the direction of the growth of their fur. Wash the cat in a massaging motion, so they feel soothed, not scared. Act like you're just petting and grooming your cat and that this trip to the bathtub is nothing special.

, To minimize the risk of creating an ear infection, put a cotton ball—a small wad of soft material used to stop up a wound or an opening—in each ear. Don't forget to take them out at the end of the bath. The cotton may also reduce the noise and make your job easier.


If you are giving your cat a flea bath, wet the area around its neck first. Fleas will try to escape to the dry areas of the cat, which can mean a mass exodus of fleas to the head and face while you are bathing. A wet neck will keep them off the head, and in contact with the water and flea shampoo.

, Rinse your kitty thoroughly using the water in the tub. Then, drain the tub and rinse two more times with water from the bucket or warm water from the tap. It is essential that you remove all the soap from the coat. Keep rinsing until the water is completely clear and shows no sign of bubbles or soap.


Diluting your shampoo before you get started will help prevent using too much soap or detergent that will need extra rinsing later.
If your cat has a long, thick coat, this process will take even longer.

, There's no need to take the risk of upsetting and hurting your cat by getting shampoo or soap in their eyes. Take a wet washcloth and gently run it along your kitty's face, brushing the fur away from their eyes and nose, until their face, head, and ears are nice and clean.You may want to consider leaving this for another time and call it quits after getting the bath done unsuccessfully.
Don't ever force your cat's face under water. This is guaranteed to make them panic.

, These sounds include: hissing, growling, breathing hard, sneezing, crying, and meowing. Pay attention to your cat throughout bath time. If your cat is too frightened by anything you are doing, stop. There is no reason to continue if one or both of you will get hurt or the cat is extraordinarily stressed.


Be easy on your cat for his first bath. Don't do anything that will greatly upset them and make him dread the next bath. It's better to take things slowly so you can try again next time.

, It removes the outer dirt and cleans well. You can find treated cloths at pet stores that need no water to groom the cat. They even have a pleasant scent.

, Take a towel and gently press as much water as you can from the fur. Then, wrap your cat in the towel and rub gently. When the towel gets too wet to be effective, switch to another dry towel. Don't stop until only the towel(s) are only wet.When you blot the water from your kitty, do it in a gentle motion, as if you're massaging them. Also consider warming the towels in the dryer first, as many cats find this comforting.
Again, work with your cat. If they won't allow you to keep drying with the towels, respect that and stop.

, Short-haired cats can finish drying themselves in the bathroom as long as they're away from drafts. They will appreciate a heat source (space heater or warm air vent) and a dry towel to sit on. With long-haired cats, you will have to use a comb and more towels. Long hairs mat more easily when wet, so you might want to comb the coat until it is completely dry.


If your cat is not scared of a hair dryer, you can use a dryer set on warm, not hot, to finish drying your cat from a distance. Avoid using a hot blow dryer on any cat as it may burn them and cause more trauma.
You can also gently brush your kitty's fur to get rid of any knots or tangles. This can be especially helpful for a long-haired cat.

, This is a must. If you want your cat to ever want to take a bath again, you must give them a positive association with the process. Give their favorite wet food, catnip, or other treats. You can even give him an even more indulgent treat that you save for exceptionally rare occasions. If they associate bathing with receiving delicious treats, your cat will be clamoring for another go in the bathtub in no time at all.You should also praise your kitty by petting them, telling them what a good kitty they are, and giving lots of attention when the bath is over. They are likely to feel vulnerable and scared if not loved, so your affection will make a big difference.

, Make separate bathing stations using two buckets. Fill the buckets half-full with warm water. Dip the cat in a bucket and, using a washcloth, make sure the cat is entirely wet. Then, massage a small amount of cat shampoo throughout their fur. Put the cat in the other bucket to rinse until soap is gone.


You may need a second rinse bucket with clean water to make sure that all the soap is gone from your kitty’s coat.
This technique can be done outside if the weather is warm and sunny. Two people will be needed, since your cat will most likely try to escape. This technique is not recommended for indoor-only cats who are not used to being outside.

, Make sure the cat has good traction, such as a small towel or rubber mat in the tub, and that the shower has a closing door, not a curtain, to prevent the cat from escaping. Make sure you have a long hose to wet your cat completely, then lather him up, hose him down to rinse, and then proceed with drying. Use a gentle stream of water and keep the pressure low.


Note that some cats seem to love being in the shower and may not mind this approach, but many cats find the sound of running water frightening. This technique may result in someone getting injured, including the cat.
You can buy a hose adapter for your bathroom sink and a hose long enough to reach over the shower door and back down to the shower floor. Or get a hand-held spray shower and a Y-adapter to connect to your regular shower head.

, Some kitties feel more secure in an enclosed space and can also be easier to control. If you have a small or scared cat, try bathing him in the sink or in a smaller tub within your bathtub. Simply place a large plastic container in the bottom of your bathtub. You can still fill the small tub or sink with a few inches of water, shampoo the kitty, and proceed as usual. Please be sure that the sink that you use does not have a garbage disposal, for even if it is turned off, paws can easily slip through the drain and be hurt by the blades, below.


This can work with a larger kitty who likes small spaces, too.
Put a terrycloth towel in the bottom of your tub, so your cat can feel secure by sinking their claws into something that remains steady. You can also apply light to medium pressure to your cat's back and use a calming tone to relieve anxiety.

, If your cat is very oily, consider using cornstarch instead of water to bathe him. Dust your cat with cornstarch and gently pet the cat to thoroughly rub the cornstarch into its fur. Let the cornstarch sit for about twenty minutes and then brush it out.This technique is far less traumatic than using water, but should not be used to wash off anything poisonous that your cat has gotten onto his fur.

Pay attention to how much your cat sleeps.,
Check your cat's temperature for fever.,
Monitor any change in your cat's litter box habits.,
Pay attention to your cat’s appetite.,
Check to see if your cat is dehydrated.,
Pay attention to your cat’s weight and body silhouette.,
Examine your cat’s coat.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Sick1," Sick cats will sleep more. If your cat doesn't have other signs of illness, such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or obvious swellings, then keep him/her under observation. If symptoms develop, get him/her checked by a vet.


If your cat isn't showing other symptoms, monitor him/her for 24 hours (of course, it's fine to get her checked by a vet before this if you are worried). If he/she enters a second day of excessive tiredness then it's time to take him/her to the vet clinic.;
, Use a rectal thermometer to check your cat's temperature. However, if she gets distressed it is best to stop and leave this to your veterinarian. 99.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit is a normal temperature range, while anything over 102.5 is regarded as raised, and over 103 is feverish.Take your cat to the vet if it has a fever.A feverish cat usually sleeps heavily, may refuse food, and often has a dull coat that sticks out at odd angles. Its nose and ears may be dry and warm when you touch them with fingers at normal body temperature. While touching the ears is an inaccurate way of checking temperature, if the cat's ears feel cool then it is unlikely he/she has a fever.

, Pay attention to: how often your cat uses the tray, if it has difficulty, if blood or mucus is in the urine, or if the feces are hard and nugget-like.If the cat has had diarrhea, but continues to strain or has constipation (signaled by the hard dry feces) take it to the the vet. Repeated straining and not passing urine, or the presence of blood, should trigger an urgent call to the vet.Male cats are prone to urinary problems where they have difficulty passing water. The signs include visiting the tray frequently, and perhaps even squatting outside the tray. The cat may squat for several minutes or keep getting up and moving to a new spot then squatting again. If possible, check to see if he/she produced any urine (is the patch wet or dry?) and if he/she did, check for blood., If you have noticed that your cat has not been eating much, or has been eating more than normal, there may be something wrong. If your cat shows no interest in food for a full day, there could be a range of issues--from eating the neighbors’ food, to feeling nauseous, to kidney problems. On the other hand, if you cat is suddenly ravenous, it could signal a health issue.


If your cat refuses food for more than 24 hours, get him/her checked by a vet so that the underlying problem can be corrected before he/she develops complications., Be alert for changes in your cat's drinking behavior. How much your cat drinks depends on whether he/she eats wet food (in which case it is unusual to see him/her drinking) or dry food (it is normal to see him/her drinking). Many conditions cause increased thirst, such as some types of infections, kidney disease, overactive thyroids, and diabetes. If your cat is thirsty, have him/her checked out by a vet.You can also physically check. Carefully and gently, grasp his/her skin between his/her shoulder blades. Pull the skin up and away from his/her body (again, very gently) and then let go. If your cat’s skin does not snap immediately back into place, he/she is more than likely dehydrated and should be taken to the vet.

, Any change in weight is significant and should merit a trip to the vet. Sudden or even gradual weight loss could signal illness. If in doubt, weigh your cat once a week at home and if the cat keeps losing weight seek veterinary advice.In the early stages of conditions such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism, the cat may seem otherwise well, but lose weight. Seek medical advice if the cat keeps losing weight.
Some illnesses, such as cancer in the belly or heart disease, mean the cat's overall weight stays the same but he/she loses body condition. This means you can feel his/her ribs and backbone more easily as there is less fat cover, but his/her belly might look rounded or swollen. If in doubt, get him/her checked by a veterinarian., A sick cat usually doesn't have the energy to groom himself.Typically, a coat that was once glossy and well-kept becomes dull, matted, and tangled. While stress can account for shedding or changes in grooming habits, your cat may actually be sick. Consult with a vet.Changes in grooming habits may also be a result of arthritis. Grooming may be painful if your cat is stiff and sore. Once again, it's a sign that a trip to the vet is necessary.

Inspect their nails.,
Clean their claws.,
Trim your cat’s nails.,
Avoid the quick.",How to Clean Your Cat's Feet2," When inspecting your cat’s nails, look for any signs of damage, infection, or other problems. Nail health is important to overall hygiene, as an infection of the nail can quickly spread to other parts of your cat’s body.


Look to see if the nails are intact.
Observe to see if their claws are jagged, have been torn, or are missing pieces.
See if there is any fungus present – you may spot green, black, or yellow growth around the claws or pads., After inspecting their nails, you may need to systemically clean them. This is especially true if you notice fungus, other growth, or any sort of damage to their nails.


Dip their feet in warm water.
Gently dislodge all dirt, fungus, or other debris on the claws.
If your cat has claw fungus, you should consult your vet. Your vet will likely advise you to continue to wash their feet in warm water. In addition, they may prescribe a topical antifungal or another cleaning agent.

, Trimming your cat’s claws is a key part of maintaining proper hygiene for indoor cats. This is important, as many indoor cats don’t have the ability to wear their claws down as they would outside. Thus, their claws may grow long and may accumulate bacteria. However, when trimming your cat’s claws, make sure to use a proper cat claw trimmer.


Position your trimmer perpendicular to the claw and along the transparent part of it.
Make sure to avoid blood vessels.
Quickly cut the transparent part of the claw.
If you’re afraid you’ll hurt your cat, trim just the tip of the claw. After you trim the tip, you can move up higher and take more of the nail off.
If your cat does not respond well to nail trimming, you may need to have your vet do it.
Clip one or two claws at a time. Trying to get a whole foot or even all your cat’s feet might be too much to expect., A cat’s quick is the portion of its claw where there is tissue and blood vessels. If you cut their quick, you’ll cause them pain and may expose them to the dangers of infection. Thus, you need to be very careful not to cut their quick.


Always cut less nail than you need.
If you cut the quick, consider using a silver nitrate applicator to stop blood loss. You’ll take the applicator and apply it to the area that is bleeding.
Regardless of whether you use silver nitrate or not, the wound should stop bleeding in 5 minutes or so."

Remove foreign objects.,
Care for their foot pads.,
Consult your vet.",How to Clean Your Cat's Feet3," Your cat may at some point step on an object that could become lodged in their foot. When this happens, you should remove the object and clean the foot properly.


Use antibacterial soap and warm water to clean the area.
Take tweezers and pull the object out.
Apply an antiseptic like betadine to the wound.
Cover your cat’s foot in a bootie or sock for a day or so., While a cat’s foot pads don’t require regular cleaning or attention, they may need to be cleaned if they are scraped or injured. This is important, as an injured foot pad may lead to serious infection or other problems. If you identify an injured foot pad:


Dip the affected foot into warm clean water two to three times a day.
Consider protecting the foot with a sock or cat bootie.
Talk to your veterinarian. In some circumstances, your cat may need topical antibiotic or a course of oral antibiotics., There might come an instance when your cat’s feet exhibit symptoms or problems you’re not familiar with. In this case, you should talk to your veterinarian. Your veterinarian is trained to identify a wide variety of cat foot problems.


Schedule a meeting with your vet. Make sure to tell the receptionist the details of your cat’s foot problem. For instance, if you notice black or green pus built up between your cat's toes, tell them.
If your cat has had foot problems before, let the vet know about them. While they may have your cat’s medical records, they may not have had time to read them thoroughly.
Inquire whether you should clean your cat’s feet before bringing them to the vet.

Look in your cat's mouth.",How to Know if Your Cat Is Sick2," If your cat vomits, especially several times a day, and seems under the weather, then this is significant. If the cat either refuses water or vomits after drinking water, then he/she should be seen by a vet.Many cats are happy vomiters, meaning they throw up from time to time (once or twice a week) as a means of cleansing their system. This is nothing to worry about in a cat that's active, responsive, behaving normally and eating well., A cat should produce formed, sausage-like feces. Diarrhea is liquid feces that have no shape, and is definitely abnormal. If the cat is otherwise well, it is acceptable to wait 24 hours to see if the cat has merely eaten something that has upset his/her tummy. However, if he/she is vomiting, off his/her food, listless, or lethargic, or has blood or mucus (a jelly like substance) in her stools, then she should be seen by a vet., Lethargy, or lack of energy, can indicate fever, breathing difficulties, or the cat being in pain. This is subtly different from the cat sleeping more, because the cat is awake, but doesn't have the energy to interact or participate in daily activities. If the cat is lethargic and breathing quicker, he/she should see a vet.Take note of your cat’s personality. If your cat is unusually tired and loses interest in exercise and regular daily activities, this could be a sign that your pet is undernourished or ill.

, If your cat is breathing very quickly and shallowly or with his/her mouth open, and has not been exerting him/herself, you should take your cat to the vet. You should also try to gauge how labored the cat's breathing appears. If you notice his/her stomach muscles heaving, in order to breathe, see the vet.Sometimes purring can confuse the respiratory rate (it makes the rate appear faster), so try to count her breaths when he/she is not purring or asleep. The normal respiratory rate in the cat is about 20 - 30 breaths a minute, and should be at the lower end when relaxed.

, All of these may be symptoms of a neurological disorder or ear infection. If present, your cat should be brought to the vet immediately. Your cat is an agile creature who is nimble on his/her feet. If this changes and he/she becomes clumsy, or holds his/her head on one side, then the chances are something is wrong. These changes could signal a stroke, high blood pressure, or even a brain tumor, so a trip to the vet is advisable., Most lumps or abscesses are benign, but if there is oozing or tenderness it will need to be checked. Also, pay attention to bad smells that can come from infected scratches. Again, get your cat checked. If left untreated, the infection can cause blood poisoning., Examine the eyes (as well as the nose) for any excessive discharge. If your cat constantly appears to be crying, she may be allergic to something or have a sinus infection. If discharge is present with excessive drinking/urination, lethargy, and a lackluster coat have your cat checked by a veterinarian for possible kidney failure.


Also check pupil dilation. Some illnesses cause cats’ eyes to dilate and remain that way. You should take your cat to the vet immediately if you notice that your cat’s pupils remain very dilated.

, Specifically, look for any discoloration in the gums. If you notice that your cat’s gums, particularly those with black gums, have become very pale, then your cat might be sick. You should also smell your cat's breath. If there is an odd smell that is not caused by something you are feeding your cat, then there may be a problem."

Check your cat for fleas.,
Listen for dry coughing and vomiting that may signify hairballs.,
Look for hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid.,
Watch for symptoms of feline diabetes.,
Watch for symptoms of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD).",How to Know if Your Cat Is Sick3," Watch for excessive scratching, which may be indicative of fleas. If you see your cat scratching himself often, you will need to perform a spot check. Get a fine toothed comb and run it through your cat’s fur. Look for little, fast-moving brown specks (which are fleas) particularly around your cat’s neck and tail.You can also check for fleas by grooming the cat over a sheet of blank white paper. You may see fleas in the comb's teeth or flea dirt on the paper. Flea dirt is black and comma shaped. If placed on damp cotton wool it dissolves into bloody streaks.
Many commercial products are available to kill fleas and remove them from your home. Ask your vet for specific recommendations.

, Hairballs can also cause bad breath or low appetite. Serious hairball problems may become Trichobezoars (hard lumps of matted hair and undigested foul-smelling food) and extreme cases may require surgery. Regularly groom your cat to reduce hairballs.Other effective home remedies include adding supplements to their diet such as: Slippery Elm Bark to lubricate the hairball passage or pumpkin pulp (canned) which adds bulk fiber to stools, easing the hairball out. These items can periodically be added to treats like fish or cooked chicken/livers as a preventative for hairballs.
You should consult with the veterinarian to be certain that a more serious problem is not the cause.

, Symptoms include increased appetite or thirst, unexplained weight loss (particularly muscle mass), nervousness or irritability, frequent vomiting, lethargy and weakness, diarrhea, or a messy coat. If two or more symptoms are present, your cat will need to see the veterinarian.Hyperthyroidism typically occurs in middle-aged to older cats and is rare in a young cat.


Increased appetite is a handy warning sign that your cat needs veterinary attention. The thyroid hormone that triggers appetite also raises the metabolic rate and puts organ function under strain., Signs of diabetes include vomiting, dehydration, weakness and loss of appetite, increased thirst and urination, weight loss, breathing abnormalities, and an unkempt coat. Feline diabetes affect cats of any age, but is most common in older, obese male/female cats. If your cat has any or several symptoms, take him/her to the vet where blood and urine sugar levels can be tested., Signs of FLUTD include inappropriate or difficult and frequent urination, appetite loss, listlessness, blood in the urine, or frequent licking of the genitals. This disease is a painful inflammation of the lower urinary tract that has the potential to quickly become fatal.


FLUTD has a number of causes, from decreased water intake and urine retention to viruses, bacteria, or diet. Some dry foods can cause crystals to build up in the urine which scuff and irritate the bladder lining. If left untreated, they can form bladder stones which are potentially serious if they cause a blockage.

Begin bathing your cat when she is a kitten.,
Brush your cat’s coat well before a bath.,
Prepare your bathing area so the bath is quick and painless.,
Place a towel at the bottom of the tub or sink.,
Ask someone to help you restrain your cat during the bath.,
Close the bathroom door.,
Hold your cat by the scruff of her neck.,
Work the shampoo into your cat’s coat.,
Rinse your cat’s coat until it is free of any soap.,
Dry your cat with a towel or a blow dryer.,
Consider a professional groomer if your cat will not tolerate baths.",How to Get Your Cat to Tolerate a Bath," Introduce your cat to the water when she is still a kitten so she can get accustomed to bathing.You should also let your cat get used to being in the sink or the tub a few weeks before you bathe her. Put her in the sink or tub with her favorite toys. Add some treats or catnip and let her sit in the space for five to ten minutes. This will help her associate the location with positive things and not be so spooked by the idea of a bath.
Once your cat gets used to sitting in the sink or tub, fill it with an inch of water and put some toys in the water. Play with your cat around the sink or tub and encourage her to sit on the edge and play with the toys in the water.;
, Do a thorough brush of your cat’s coat to remove dust, debris and loosen tangles, especially if you have a longhaired cat. A dry tangle is much easier to comb out than a wet tangle and will prevent your cat from getting irritated during the bath. Brushing your cat’s coat will also remove any matted fur, which can trap soapy residue on your cat’s skin and cause itchy, flaky patches.You should also cut your cat’s nails before bathing her so you won’t get scratched and your cat won’t get her nails caught on your clothing or a towel during the bath.
You can also put cotton in your cat’s ears to prevent any water from seeping in, and apply eye ointment in each eye so these areas are not irritated by the soap. If your cat won’t let you come near her ears with cotton, skip the cotton in the ears and be sure to dry her ears well with a cotton ball after the bath.

, The best way to get your cat to tolerate the bath is to bathe her quickly and efficiently. Gather the necessary supplies for your cat’s bath ahead of time at the sink or tub. You will need:


A pair of rubber gloves
Cat shampoo: Do not use human shampoo as human skin is a different pH to cat skin and it will dry the cat's coat out. If in doubt which cat shampoo to use, oatmeal is always a good choice as it is mildly moisturizing.
A large pitcher with a spray nozzle that has a gentle setting for rinsing
A large towel
Cotton balls
A small cloth
Avoid using a spray nozzle that is noisy as this will distract and irritate your cat. Use a spray nozzle on the gentle setting, attached to the tub or the sink. If you use a blow dryer instead of a towel to dry your cat at the end of the bath, make sure it has a low heat setting so it doesn’t burn your cat’s skin. Most cats enjoy a rub down with a towel over the loud roar of the blow dryer.

, To avoid getting scratches on your arms or hands, give your cat a towel to sink her claws into instead. Make sure the towel is secure so it won’t slip when your cat digs her claws into it during the bath.


You can also place a window screen at a 45 degree angle inside the tub or sink to give your cat something to hold onto.

, If possible, enlist the help of your partner or a friend to assist you during the bath. Ask the person to gentle hold on to your cat by her scruff as you start to bathe her, using very little force so she is not uncomfortable or in pain.

, Keep your cat from escaping from her bath by closing the door of the room with the sink or the tub. Fill the sink with two to three inches of lukewarm water. Never use hot water, as cats can overheat easily.Put on the rubber gloves to protect your hands and to keep the bath sanitary.

, Speak gently to your cat in an assuring tone as you place her in the tub or sink. Hold her by the scruff of her neck so she stays still, or have an assistant do this. If your cat has front claws, hold her with her back to you so you cannot get scratched.Stroke your cat with one hand as you wet her neck and head with the water. Keep the water out of her eyes to avoid irritating them. Wet her back, legs, and hind end until she is sufficiently wet.

, Make sure you clean her back, neck, chest, belly, tail, legs, and paws. Lather her coat well so you remove all the dirt and debris.Most cats dislike getting water splashed in their face. Use a damp washcloth to clean your cat’s face and head to avoid any scratching or complaining from your cat.
At this point, you can use cotton balls to clean inside your cat’s ears if she will let you do so.

, You may need to rinse her several times to ensure all the soap is removed. Leftover soap will irritate your cat’s skin, so rinse until you don’t see any more suds or soap on her coat., Most cats enjoy a good rub down with a towel after a bath. Use the towel to dry your cat from head to tail. Try to absorb as much water as possible with the towel, as your cat will likely try to shake off any excess water and this could lead to puddles of water in your bathroom or kitchen.If you prefer to use a hair dryer to dry your cat, never use the hot setting as this can burn your cat’s sensitive skin. Set the dryer to the warm setting and the low noise level.
Reward your cat for a successful bath time with a treat, as this will remind her that bath time can be a positive experience.

, If your cat shows a strong dislike towards bath time, despite your attempts to make her comfortable, you may want to consider bringing her to a professional groomer. The groomer can then bathe your cat for you, saving you from cat scratches and stares from an angry cat.

Examine your cat’s skin.,
Monitor your cat’s itching.,
Check to see if your cat has a fever.,
Consult your vet.",How to Diagnose and Treat Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats1," A bacterial skin infection can occur on any part of the cat’s body, including its face and nose. Thoroughly check your cat’s whole body by running your hands over its fur as if you are petting it. Feel and examine the skin for itchy, red skin lesions, pustules (pimples), hair loss, open draining sores, and epidermal collarettes, i.e., a circular lesion with a circular rim containing scales or peeling edges.Skin folds can develop bacterial skin infections as well. If your cat has skin folds, make sure to look under the skin folds for lesions, pustules, and sores.
Bites and scratches from other animals can also cause skin infections and abscesses. Monitor these closely.;
, Try to determine if your cat began itching before or after the infection developed. If your cat began itching before the infection developed, then the cause of the infection is most likely environmental. If your cat began itching the affected area after it developed, then the cause of the infection is most likely due to internal factors., Cats who have deep pyoderma, a severe skin infection, may have open draining sores and a fever. Signs of a fever in cats are a loss of appetite, as well as depressed, lethargic, quiet, and withdrawn behavior. A cat with a fever may or may not feel warm to the touch.Other symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, pale gums, and weakness.

, Because it is difficult to differentiate between a bacterial and fungal infection, you will need to take your cat to the vet once a problem is identified. Your vet will also be able to test whether the infection is caused by environmental factors or internal factors. The vet is not able to prescribe medication until they have performed an examination. The tests may include:A microscopic examination of the pustules and/or discharge.
Antibiotic sensitivity and culture tests to pinpoint the bacteria causing the infection. This can include skin scrapings and fungal cultures to rule out fungal infections and microscopic parasites.
Food trials and allergy testing to exclude food allergies as the cause.
The use of a flea comb to examine the skin and hair for lice and fleas.
Blood tests to identify any internal causes.

Check your cat’s coat often.,
Make grooming a good experience.,
Brush a short-haired cat once per week.,
Brush a long-haired cat more often.,
Feel and look for irregularities.,
Don’t over-bathe.,
Use good sense and timing.,
Draw the bath.,
Wet and lather.,
Rinse and dry.,
Look closely.,
Comb your cat with a fine-toothed comb.,

Use spot treatment medication.,
Prevent future infestations.",How to Care for Your Cat's Coat," A cat’s fur coat is a gauge of his overall health and should have a natural gloss and “spring.” However, dirt, oils, and other things can cause its condition to deteriorate.


Give your cat a once-over one or two times a week. You shouldn’t find any bald patches, bumps, wounds, or signs of flea infestation.Take note of any signs of an unhealthy coat. These include dryness, greasiness, dandruff, thinning hair, or a dull appearance.Long-haired cats need extra attention because their coats tend to mat. Look for tangles when checking them.;
, Since your cat needs occasional care, make sure that he is used to and enjoys being handled. Start slowly, be patient, and ensure that the experience is pleasant.Only do grooming when your cat is in a good mood and relaxed. Try after exercise or feeding for the best results.
Make sure that you are at ease, too! Try not to handle your kitty when you are stressed or in a bad mood, or he will associate grooming with aggression or fear.
Keep your first sessions to 10 to 15 minutes until you get into a routine. Pet your cat all over so that he gets used to the attention – pet his head, ears, tail, feet, and belly.
Be patient. Try again later if he is difficult and give him a treat after successful sessions.

, Short-haired varieties like Bengals, American Shorthairs, and Abyssinians have less hair and don’t need as much attention. You can brush their coat once every week or perhaps even less.First, take a metal comb and work through your cat’s fur from head to tail. This will dislodge dirt and other debris.
Brush along the lie of a short-haired cat’s fur. In other words, go with the grain of the fur rather than against it. Brush all part of the cat’s body, focusing on one area at a time to loosen any tangles.
Cats tend to be sensitive on the belly and chest. Be gentle when brushing there.
Use a bristle or rubber brush next to remove loose or dead hair.

, Long-haired breeds like Persians, Himalayans, and Balinese will need to be brushed more often than shorthairs. This is because their coats are more likely to mat and because they are more likely to get fur balls.Long-haired breeds need to be brushed every day or every other day, loosening tangles and removing dead hair. The more loose hair you remove, the fewer fur balls your cat will develop.Start by brushing the cat’s belly and legs. Tangles tend to form in these areas especially, so be sure to untangle any knots there.
Next, brush the whole cat’s body against lie of the fur with a bristle or rubber brush. Push the hair upward toward his head and, when you are finished, back down.
To get the tail, make a part down the middle and brush the fur out on either side.
Shake some talcum powder over difficult tangles and try to loosen them with your hands. Or, consider using a mat-splitter.Severe mats should be removed by a professional groomer or your vet., During each grooming session, keep your eyes open and run your hands along the cat’s body to feel for things that shouldn’t be there. This is both for good grooming and for health.


Feel for hidden tangles, but also for bumps or signs of ticks or fleas. Specks of blood can be a giveaway.
Lift the cat’s tail and check its behind. You can cut away any fur that is matted with feces with scissors.
Look particularly for tan, rice-sized objects near the anus. These are tapeworm segments and indicate that your cat has a tapeworm infection., Cats self-clean and are usually more than able to take care of themselves. Your cat may need some extra cleaning if she’s gotten into something dirty or smelly, but you should usually limit her baths.Bathing can dry out your cat’s skin. Frequent baths can also change the oil gland levels, which may worsen her coat condition.
When you do give a bath, go easy on your pet by using mild, cat-safe shampoo.

, Cats famously do not like water. That said, pick a time as with brushing when your cat is in an easy, relaxed mood. Often the best time is after some play or after a brush-down.


Some groomers recommend trimming a cat’s claws before you bathe her, which can save you some pain if she does not take to the water.You may also want to wear rubber gloves.
Lay down a rubber mat in the sink or rub. This will help the cat keep her footing and prevent slipping.

, You can use a plastic tub for the bath or a sink, depending on your cat’s size. Fill the basin with 2 to 3 inches of water. Then, carefully lift your cat and set her in the tub.Make sure that the water is not too hot. It should be lukewarm and not uncomfortable to the touch.
Don’t over-fill the basin with water. The cat should be standing (not swimming!) in the water.

, Begin to wet the animal all over its body. You can use a spray hose if your sink has one. Otherwise, you might also try a spray bottle or even scoop water over the cat with a plastic pitcher.Apply some shampoo to the cat’s coat and start to work up a lather. Massage the shampoo into her fur from head to her tail, avoiding the eyes and face.
To ensure a mild solution, mix one part cat shampoo with five parts water.Many cats do not like being splashed with water in the face. To avoid a tense situation, use a wet washcloth to clear your pet’s head.

, Once you’ve got a good lather, it’s time to rinse. Flush out the shampoo with plain water, again lukewarm, from a spray nozzle or pitcher. Be sure to get all of the solution as leftover shampoo can irritate the skin and attract dirt.Wrap the cat in a large towel to dry and put her in a draft-free place.
Long-haired cats will probably need a combing or brushing after a bath, to prevent tangles.
Be sure to give your cat a treat after a bath to reinforce the experience. Reduce her anxiety and fear as much as possible.

, Note any signs of movement on your cat’s fur or any changes in behavior, like frequent scratching. These and other factors can signal that he has a case of fleas.Flea bites feel itchy. A cat with fleas may scratch or bite at its coat frantically in an effort to get relief.
Your cat might also groom more than usual, show hair loss, act agitated or restless, or have red lesions or bumps (bites marks).
Fleas also leave feces, which will look like black pepper corns in your cat’s coat.

, Find a metal, fine-toothed comb and slowly work your way through the cat’s coat. The combing will weed out fleas and relieve the cat’s itching somewhat.The comb treatment will remove many of the fleas and their eggs. Dip the comb into a bowl of soapy water as you go, to get rid of them.
Repeat the treatment in the following days until the animal is no longer infested.

, Another option is to give your cat a bath and to flush the fleas out of the coat. Proceed like you are giving the animal a normal bath, but use a shampoo that repels fleas.Fill a basin with a couple of inches of cool, soothing water and place the cat in it.
Apply a shampoo, ideally one that is known to repel fleas like cedar, eucalyptus, lavender, or citrus.
Some people also think that apple cider vinegar is effective in getting rid of fleas.Comb the cat with a flea comb after the bath and repeat the process daily until the fleas are gone.

, Spot-on flea meds are pesticides and should get rid of a pesky flea infestation. Since cats clean themselves by licking, they are safer than sprays or dusts that have to be applied to the whole body.Talk to your vet about spot-on products. She will be able to advise you and maybe provide a brand like Frontline, Advantage, and Stronghold/Resolution.
Ask for instructions about how to use the product – where to put it, how often to apply it, and how much to use.

, You cat is normal, healthy, and happy. Why worry about fleas or other parasites? Well, even a healthy cat can become a host. There are steps you can take to protect him from a future infestation, however.


Give him periodic flea baths. There are medically treated shampoos that either kill or repel fleas on contact. You’ll have to re-bathe him about every two weeks.Get your cat dewormed, as well. Fleas are natural carriers of tapeworms. Your cat can easily swallow a flea infected with a tapeworm larva and end up with a bad case of worms.Clean your house and carpet, especially if you are dealing with case of fleas. Vacuum the floors, carpets, and furniture every day and wash sheets, fabrics, and covers that the pet touches at least once a week, in hot water."

See to your cat's ultimate comfort.",How to Care for a Cat with Feline Leukemia," Take your cat to a veterinary clinic so that your cat's blood can be drawn and tested. The test for FeLV is very sensitive and accurate; however, it is often necessary to retest the cat after four weeks to see if they are still positive, or have fought off the infection and are now immune.


They will often also test for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).
The FELV (and FIV in cats 6 months of age or older) tests are routinely performed by animal shelters prior to adoptions, so the results of this testing should be included with the cats veterinary records when adopted.
If you found your cat or kitten, or obtained them from a private party, then viral testing should be part of your immediate health care plan. This is especially important if you plan to bring them to a home where cats already live.;
, Cats who have recently come in contact with the virus may show signs of the initial viral infection, with non-specific signs such as low energy, fever, or a decreased appetite.


After the initial ‘viremia’ (virus multiplying in the bloodstream), some cats’ immune systems will actually fight off and clear the virus completely, others will progress into a persistently infected or ‘latent’ infection stage. At this stage, cats are often asymptomatic and can remain asymptomatic for many years., While the disease can be managed, and may even go into remission, flare-ups are always possible. FeLV can lead to cancers, ongoing susceptibility to infection, immune system suppression, and severe anemia.It can also contribute to breeding abnormalities and arthritis abnormalities with red blood cells., He or she can live for several years without the disease causing major problems if given appropriate care.In some cases, the cat may even become leukemia-negative, meaning that they will live a long and happy life., There is no treatment or ‘cure’ for this virus.Vaccination against FELV will greatly increase your cats chances of clearing the infection if exposed instead of becoming persistently infected, which is most likely if your cat is unvaccinated. Cats can start a leukemia vaccine series as early as 8 weeks of age.Boosters are given every 1-3 years depending on the amount of exposure risk, and the type of vaccination used.

, Do not treat him/her for all these things at once, or else the cat will just feel even worse. Wait a week or two before treating him/her for a second condition.

, If your cat is frightened or agitated by anything in your house, get rid of the cause. Ask your family and friends to be quiet and to avoid being loud when inside the house.


Keep your cat's environment warm enough. He/she may need more warmth than a non-infected cat. Snug blankets and sleeping areas are essential.

, Higher-quality food will improve your cat's condition and is an assurance that your cat is getting the required nutrients that cheaper food lacks. Do not feed any home or commercially prepared raw diets as cats with FELV have a compromised immune system and could become ill from harmful bacteria this way.Don’t feed solely fish, as this is lacking in many essential nutrients.

, Keep all of your cat's litter boxes, food bowls, water bowls, etc. very clean. This means daily cleaning, without fail. If you're not around to do it, someone else must be tasked with this chore.

, The FELV virus does not survive for long outside of the infected cat, but may be passed by hands, clothes or other objects.Practice good personal hygiene and wash your hands if touching different cats, especially if you pet or handle a known FELV positive cat.


The FELV virus does not infect people.

, FeLV is spread through blood, saliva, and excrement. Outdoor cats are at higher risk of contracting this disease, due to the increased likelihood of coming into contact with infected cats.Cats pass the virus on to one another through mutual grooming, nose-to-nose contact and bites.Sharing the same food and water bowls can also pass on the infection., This will help to prevent passing on the infection to any newborn cats or cats sought through mating.


Make sure that the clinic you take your cat to for this operation knows that your cat has FeLV. They'll take extra care of your cat and provide the appropriate sterilization of the operating room and instruments.

, If they're free of the infection, have them vaccinated. Be aware that vaccination doesn't necessarily mean that they can be with your sick cat just yet; wait a while before doing that so the vaccine takes effect; ask your vet for exact details.


The vaccine is effective if given prior to the cat getting the disease.All household cats should get a booster every one to three years, as advised after risk assessment by a veterinarian.

, If you have a kitten in the same house as your sick cat, then give the kitten the first vaccine when it is eight to nine weeks old. Give the second one three to four weeks later.

, They might not like being separated from their friends, but it's best for all of them until your cat is feeling better. And unfortunately, even with vaccination (it's not 100 percent effective), persistent contact with the infected cat may well lead to another uninfected cat getting the disease;it is better to avoid this possibility.


Bites and scratches are common routes of transmission, but even friendly interactions, such as touching faces, sharing food or water dishes and grooming one another can result in infection.Avoid getting another cat. The less cats you have, the less chances the infection has to spread.

, The longer a cat lives and is infected with FELV, the more likely they are to develop certain types of ocular problems, oral infections, blood diseases, and cancer.Infected cats should have a physical examination and blood counts twice yearly. A more comprehensive blood, urine, and fecal examination should be performed once yearly.Your vet will ensure that the cat receives the required regular vaccinations, including rabies if that is relevant to your location.
The 6-monthly checkups are vital, even if you see no signs of sickness in your cat., If you're worried and upset, your cat will pick up on this.Keep calm, provide a comfortable and darkened carrier for your cat and travel during light traffic periods so that you're not stuck inside the car for longer than is required to get there and back. Reassure your cat while at the vet's and be in his/her sight at all times the vet allows. Set aside fears––the vet is on your side and will do the best by your cat.

, Any sign of illness should garner prompt attention as the outcome is likely to be better the earlier problems are detected and addressed.


Ask your vet for an up-to-date list of things to watch for in terms of disease progression. When you notice anything that might be on this list, contact your vet to discuss any needed changes in care arrangements for your cat.
Be aware that you need to spot secondary infections quickly, as your cat's immunocompromised system will mean he/she will likely be more affected than a non-FeLV infected cat and the earlier treatment is given, the greater the chance your cat has of getting over it sooner., Play with your cat, give him/her attention (when he/she wants it), and make sure that your cat is always comfortable and happy.

Decide if you want a kitten or a full-grown cat.Kittens are adorably tempting, but be honest with yourself about whether you'll be able to match that energy level.,
Consider medical concerns that may come with a specific cat.,
Consider the amount of time you have for a cat.,
Calculate whether you can afford a cat.,
Consider adopting a cat from an animal shelter.,

Make sure your cat gets enough play time.",How to Take Care of a Cat," Shelters are full of loving adult cats who have a much harder time getting adopted. An adult cat will be calmer and quieter than a kitten, but may also have behavioral issues from its previous life. Adult cats may also have medical conditions you'll have to address sooner than you would with a kitten. Also, kittens often scratch very painfully; Decide if you want that.;
, If you have your eye on one cat in particular, ask about its medical history to see if it requires any long-term care. Would you be able to afford this cat's medical needs?


Even if the cat is healthy, consider its breed. Purebred cats from different breeds can have their own genetic problems to overcome. For example, flat-faced cats like Manx and Scottish folds often develop breathing problems.Purebred cats are more likely to have genetic medical problems than non-pedigreed cats., While a cat doesn't need daily walking like a dog, don't be fooled into thinking that cats aren't a time commitment. They're still active pets that need a lot of play, and affectionate companions who demand attention. You'll also spend time cleaning the litter box and giving the cat structured meals.


The average lifespan of an indoor cat is 13-17 years, so be aware that you're making a long-term commitment to a new family member., The one-time purchase fee for a cat can range from $45 for a shelter adoption to several hundred dollars for a purebred cat. Beyond that, though, you'll have to pay for food, litter, toys, and regular medical expenses. The ASPCA estimates that in the first year of owning a cat, you will likely spend about $1,035 on it.(That amount goes down after you've bought the major equipment and had your initial medical procedures.)

, The cost is minimal considering what you get: a fully vaccinated, health examined, and spayed or neutered cat.Any “free” cat is ultimately going to cost you those things down the line, if you're a responsible cat owner.

, But, there are still steps you need to take to make sure you're offering the litter box as the best place to use the bathroom.


Place the box in a quiet spot where the cat won’t be bothered by people, dogs, or loud noises.
Keep the litter box clean — scoop the litter daily, and clean the box weekly. You should also replace or refresh the litter at least once a week.Provide enough litter boxes for more than one cat. If you have 2 cats, you need 3 litter boxes in different areas of the home. One cat might try to intimidate a less dominate cat away from using a single box.

, Don't frighten or startle your cat when it's using the box, or it may form a bad association with the box and start avoiding it. Buy a large box, even if you have to spend a little money on it. Cats are more comfortable in a larger (in area, not height) box.Don’t switch brands of litter on your cat, because cats don’t like sudden change. Switching from a clay litter to a scoopable clumping type of litter or vice versa might upset the cat so much it stops using the box.
Don’t use heavily scented litters that might deter a cat from litter box use.

, Keep in mind that kittens and older cats with arthritis or other health problems may have problems getting in and out of a box that's too tall. Use low-height boxes in an easily accessible area for kittens and cats with special needs, or buy an adjustable litter box.

, Scratching is a normal part of cat behavior, and there's no way you can train it out of them. If your cat still has its claws, he'll need one or two scratching posts to keep him from scratching up furniture, wood work, and so on. By providing a post, you allow the cat to indulge in normal, healthy behavior.Your cat may have been declawed, in which case his front and/or back claws have been surgically removed. A declawed cat won't be able to scratch, so you don't need a scratching post.

, Cats are curious, and will jump on counters or other places you'd like them to stay clear of. Scat mats, a perfectly timed mist of water from a spray bottle, or even a stern “no” can correct this behavior. With time and patience, you can teach your cat to stay away from your protected areas.


You can also use a rattle can (an empty soda can filled with a few pebbles and the opening taped over). Toss it gently on the ground to scare a cat away from forbidden surfaces. DO NOT throw the can at the cat, for that may harm your cat.

, These products, which fill the air with calming synthetic pheromones, come as sprays or diffusers that plug into electrical outlets.They can help resolve litter box or scratching issues, and have also been proven to calm stressed or anxious cats.

, Cat food comes in a vast array of types: dry food, semi-moist, and canned are the common types. Dry food is easily and efficiently stored, but cats go wild for the taste of semi-moist and canned foods. The latter types can add more fluid to the cat’s diet than dry foods. In general, food type comes down to owner preference.


Occasionally, a cat with a medical condition might need one type over another. Consult your veterinarian for recommendations.

, Like other animals, cats have some specific nutritional needs. They are ""obligate carnivores,"" which means they need animal proteins to avoid severe health consequences.Ask your vet for suggestions about a good quality food. Cheaper products may not provide enough nutrition to keep your cat happy and healthy.


Look for cat foods that list large amounts of animal meat like beef, chicken, turkey, or fish.Also look for important amino acids like taurine and arginine and fatty acids like arachidonic and linoleic acid.Avoid feeding your cat human foods unless you have cleared the food with your veterinarian. Some human foods can make a cat severely sick or are even toxic to cats (e.g., chocolate).

, They prefer to eat frequent, small meals throughout the day.Ask your vet for recommendations on what and how to feed your cat if you have any reservations.

, Follow your veterinarian's recommendations closely and make sure your cat gets plenty of exercise, as obesity is one of the biggest health issues facing cats today. Obese cats are more likely to develop diabetes when they approach middle age. Extra weight also contributes to arthritis, heart disease, and other health problems in cats., You may think that because cats seem to groom themselves, you don't need to brush them. But you do need to brush long-hair cats several times a week and short-hair cats weekly. This will help reduce shedding in your home and also help the cat avoid the dreaded hairballs.


For cats that tend to shed (long-haired ones especially), use a comb that has fine strands of metal. This gets deep into the undercoat and eliminates shedding.

, Be on the lookout for any fleas or other parasites, and for any unusual redness, lumps, bumps, or other skin problems. If you see anything suspicious, let your veterinarian know and ask for advice on how you should take care of it.

, Unlike human children, cats can't let us know when they're not feeling well. They rely on their humans to take them to a veterinarian for regular medical examinations to keep them healthy. It is important that a cat sees a vet at least once a year, for a physical check-up: teeth, ears, eyes, heart, booster vaccinations, and deflea/deworm treatments. All cat owners should consider getting their pet vaccinated against the following: feline infectious enteritis (FIE), cat ‘flu and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). All can kill cats if they become infected and so it is important to protect your pet. You may also find that a cattery will not accept your pet, should you need their services, without proof of these and potentially other vaccinations. Your vet can advise exactly what vaccinations are required for your pet. If you are at all concerned about your cat’s health or behaviour you should see your vet as soon as possible.


Older cats might need to see a veterinarian twice yearly for optimal health.

, Just like human babies, kittens need to see the vet more often than adult cats. Starting at around 8 weeks of age, they'll need 2-3 visits to have their vaccination series and worm treatments. At minimum, this includes the feline distemper vaccine and a rabies vaccine. Your vet will discuss the benefits of optional vaccinations as well. Ask about the risks of diseases like feline leukemia and make an informed decision about which vaccinations you want.


The vet will also check the kitten for fleas and ear mites, and treat them if needed.
Make sure the kitten gets its worm treatment. Most kittens have roundworms that can stunt growth and potentially be transmitted to humans.

, Spaying a female cat or neutering a male cat has many positive benefits. It will cut down on unwanted behaviors like roaming and the tendency to spray urine. Physically, it protects against unwanted pregnancies and diseases like pyometra.The most important thing, though, is that it cuts down on the number of unwanted kittens in the world!


Ask your vet for a recommendation on when to get kittens spayed or neutered. In general, vets recommend a range from 2-6 months.

, Cats can and do suffer from dental disease. To brush your cat's teeth, you need a soft-bristled toothbrush and veterinary toothpaste. Never use human toothpaste — too much fluoride can upset your cat's stomach, and with the high fluoride concentration in human toothpaste, too much could be toxic. Start by offering him/her a taste of the veterinary toothpaste. The next time, let him/her taste the toothpaste, and then run your finger along the gums of the upper teeth. Repeat the process with the toothbrush. Get the bristles of the brush along the gum line of the upper back teeth and angle slightly up, so the bristles get under the gum line. Work from back to front, making small circles along the gum lines. It should take you less than 30 seconds to brush your pet's teeth.


Do not try to brush the entire mouth at first. If he/she only lets you brush the outside of her upper teeth, it's better than nothing. You're still addressing the most important area of dental disease prevention.

, Even with the best tooth brushing, some cats may still need an occasional professional cleaning. While brushing reduces the plaque and buildup on the visible surfaces of the teeth it cannot get to the buildup just under the gum line. A professional cleaning also gives the vet a chance to fully examine her mouth under sedation. Some signs of dental disease include:Bad breath
Loose teeth
Discolored teeth or teeth covered in tartar
Sensitivity or pain in the mouth
Bleeding
Drooling a lot or dropping food while trying to eat
Loss of appetite or weight loss

, Your cat needs interaction with you daily to keep him/her both emotionally happy and physically fit. Use cat toys, talking, and grooming as chances to spend time together. Laser pointers, balls, play mice, and feather toys are also good ways to engage your cat in play.

Take care of your cat as you always have.",How to Take Care of a Blind Cat," If you suspect that your cat has gone blind or is losing her sight, schedule an appointment with your cat’s veterinarian right away. Some types of blindness are reversible if they are treated right away. For example, if your cat is suffering from blindness caused by hypertension, a daily medication may restore her sight and prevent further health problems as well.Make sure that your cat gets regular check-ups with a veterinarian even if she seems healthy. Early diagnosis and treatment of a problem can prevent your cat from going blind.;
, Sometimes a cat will go blind over a period of days, weeks, or months. After the cat has become mostly or totally blind, you may begin to notice some strange behavior. Observe your cat to determine if she might be blind. Some of the behaviors that blind cats display include:Seeming confused about her surroundings
Bumping into furniture and other objects
Missing jumps or landings that she used to manage with ease
Seeming reluctant to move around or venture outdoors
Rubbing or squinting her eyes

, If your cat’s behavior has you suspicious that she might have gone blind, inspect her eyes to see if they look different than usual. Even if your cat is not showing signs of blindness, you should inspect your cat’s eyes regularly to check for early symptoms of blindness. Some common symptoms of blindness in cats include:Eyes don’t respond to light, pupils are dilated
Eyes look cloudy, inflamed, or discolored

, Since your cat may have a hard time navigating the house at first, you should do your best to provide a home that is as free from obstacles as possible. Keeping the floor clear will help your cat to navigate the house without bumping into things.Some suggestions for how to minimize obstacles in your home include:


Leaving your furniture where it is
Keeping your home clean and clutter-free
Teaching children to pick up their toys after they are finished playing with them

, Since your cat no longer has her sense of sight to determine whether or not something or someone is a threat, she may be more frightened by loud noises than she was before losing her sight. Help your cat to feel calm and safe by avoiding making loud noises and asking others to do the same.If you accidentally make a loud noise, make sure to comfort your cat by petting her and speaking softly to her. Some other suggestions for maintaining a calm environment include:


Getting up slowly from a chair instead of jumping up suddenly
Walking upstairs to speak to someone instead of yelling up to them
Avoiding slamming cupboards and doors

, Since your cat can no longer see you when she enters a room, you might want to develop a habit of humming or chatting to yourself to let her know where you are. Your cat may also feel safer and more relaxed if you hum and chat when you are around her. This will also help prevent startling your cat when you want to pet her. By announcing your presence, she will be less likely to be surprised by the feeling of your hand on her back., If your cat used to go outside before she went blind, stay with your cat as much as you can when she ventures outside. By being present as your cat rediscovers the outdoors, you can rescue her from any mishaps while still allowing her to enjoy being outside.


Try keeping your cat in an enclosed garden when she wants to go outside. This will help minimize the chances that she will get injured or lost.Consider getting a cat harness and leash to prevent your cat from wandering off into danger.
If you are unable to monitor your cat while she is outside, do not let her go out.

, If your cat has been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions. If your cat’s blindness is related to a medical condition, it will not improve until she is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.


Be aware that some forms of blindness are not reversible even with medical interventions. Your cat may remain blind for the rest of her life, but she can still have a happy life., Your cat is still normal. Even though she has gone blind, she will still want to do everything that a cat likes to do, like playing. While buying toys, look for cat toys that are made specifically for blind cats. Also, shift from sight-based games to sound-based ones, such as ""follow-the-noise."" Anything that crinkles, crackles, resounds or can be tapped can serve as a new source of entertainment.


Try buying toys that squeak like a mouse or chirp like a bird. Your cat might like to play follow the noise with those types of toys.

, Groom your cat regularly, feed your cat nutritious food, provide occasional treats, and take your cat to a vet for regular check-ups. Pay special attention to your cat's nose and ears, as these senses now make life easier for your cat.


Keep your cat’s food and water in the same place they have always been kept.
Consider adding a second litter box to make it easier for your cat to get to the bathroom in time. It may take her longer to find the box now that she is blind."

Clip the hair around the affected area.,
Administer oral antibiotics.,
Use medicated shampoos.,
Consider possible causes.,
Monitor your cat’s recovery.",How to Diagnose and Treat Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats2," This is necessary in order to maintain the cleanliness of the infected area and to treat it. Use grooming scissors to trim the hair to about half of an inch around the area. Make sure to clean the scissors with soap and water before and after using them.Many vet offices are happy to clip the cat's hair prior to a visit.

, First wrap your cat in a towel. While sitting on the floor, place your cat between your knees. Gently, but firmly, place one hand on top of your cat's head. Your thumb should be on one side of its jaw and your fingers on the other side. Then, place the syringe at the corner of your cat's mouth behind the canine tooth. Slowly administer the medication in small intervals so your cat has time to swallow.Depending on the severity of the infection, your doctor may prescribe topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, or both.
It is important that you finish the whole prescription unless your vet instructs otherwise.
Common oral antibiotics are Clavulanic acid-amoxicillin (Clavamox), Cefovecin (Convenia), Clindamycin, and cephalexin.

, Mix one part of medicated shampoo to five parts of water. Then, in a bathtub or basin, carefully wet your cat with warm water using a cup or hose. Make sure not to get water in its eyes, ears, or nose. Lightly massage the shampoo into your cat's hair in the direction of its hair growth. Finish by thoroughly rinsing your cat with a cup.Medicated shampoos, like Clinical Care, and shampoos that contain benzoyl peroxide are a great way to treat and clean infected areas on cats that have mild infections.
These products may also help prevent future bacterial skin infections.

, Bacterial skin infections can be caused by the environment, for example, allergens, chemical toxins, fleas, parasites, and mites. They can also be caused by internal problems such as food intolerance or allergies, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, hormone imbalances, cancer, and gland diseases. If the problem continues or recurs, try to identify possible causes in the environment or in the cat's diet. If additional symptoms appear, consult a vet to see if there is an underlying health problems.


Allergies to pollen, mold, pine needles or other substances are huge contributors to skin conditions. Try to remove these from the environment to see if your cat's condition improves.

, If your cat’s symptoms worsen, if it develops new symptoms, or if you do not see an improvement within a week, then contact your vet. Call the vet and describe your cat’s symptoms and recovery process. Your vet will most likely ask you to come in for an additional appointment.The vet may run more examinations, cultures, and blood tests.

Be sure to put the cat in the travel cage you will use on your trip to get the cat used to the noise and motion of the car and the smell of the cage.


Give your cat treats while it is in the car. This will give it better feelings about being there.
Look upon these as trial runs to work out any kinks before you have to take a long trip far from home.;
, If your cat is prone to motion sickness, which your trial runs should determine, ask your vet to prescribe medication. Anti-nausea medication such as chlorpromazine can be used to help control motion sickness.The signs of a cat with motion sickness (while in the car of course) include: crying or vocalizing that doesn’t quit after a few minutes into the car ride, excessive drooling, immobility, or acting afraid to move, or excess activity or pacing, vomiting, or urinating or defecating.Ginger has also been used to treat nausea in humans and it is safe to use in cats; this can be found in liquid form or chews from on-line or brick and mortar pet stores or in the occasional veterinary clinic.

, Give a few drops in his water each day and a drop in the mouth before setting off each day if he is visibly distressed. You can test its effectiveness by giving an oral dose and then taking a short car ride 30 minutes later. This should be your preferred treatment, as sedatives only slow a cat whereas the flower essence will help them remain calm and confident.

, Try training with trial drives and non-medicated options first before resorting to medications. Your veterinarian can help you sort out which one will work best for your cat. Some options include over the counter antihistamines (Benadryl) and prescription medication, such as alprazolam (Xanax) to relieve anxiety.Discuss dosages with your veterinarian and follow their advice carefully for the best result.

, Observe the cat's behavior, and if there are any negative results, you still have time to call your vet and adjust dosages or try a different medicine. Just like people, different drugs have different effects on cats. Chances are, if your pet reacts with irritability or something else adverse, your vet will know an alternate treatment to try.


Most sedatives won't knock the cat out cold and should only take the edge off. If the drug is too sedating or not sedating enough, you should let your vet know before you leave. The cat should remain alert to its surroundings, even when on the sedative.
While on the medication trial, put the cat in the carrier and take it for a drive. This way, you'll know what behaviors to expect while you're traveling with a medicated cat. Make sure your vet gives you enough medication for the duration of your travel (to and from) and ask for an extra pill or two to try at home before you embark.

, The goal is to get your cat's smells, and the smells of home, onto the towel. In addition, the cat will already be comfortable with the towel and find comfort from it.

, Put the towel your cat has been sleeping on at the bottom of the cage, and put an additional towel under the cage if the cage floor needs extra padding. Add a favorite toy to keep your cat company as well.

, This mimics the pheromones that cats leave when they're comfortable and relaxed in their territory. It should soothe your cat on the ride.Be sure to test your cat's reaction to Feliway before spraying it in the carrier. A small minority of cats interpret the spray as another cat's markings and may have a negative or even aggressive reaction to it.

, If there is room in the cage you can put a small litter box, but this is not vitally necessary. The same is true of food and water.


Never make your cat stay in its carrier for longer than eight hours without providing it with food, water and a chance to use the litter box.

, You want the cat to voluntarily get comfortable going into it. Do not force your cat into the cage if it doesn’t go in at this stage.

, You may want to place a towel or blanket over the carrier when carrying it to the car to block its view of the “scary” outside.Remove it when you place the carrier in the car.


The carrier should be placed in a secure spot in the car, preferably strapped in place with a seat belt. If the seat belt won’t work, you can use bungee cords or small lengths of rope to secure the carrier in the car in case of sudden stops or an accident., Car rides are stressful for cats regardless if they like them or not. Having a harness and a leash on the cat whenever it is out of the carrier (even in the car) gives you something to grab in case the cat decides to bolt from an open window or door.

, Your cat won't want to go all day in its carrier. This is where the harness and leash come in. Snap the leash on and allow your cat to come out into the car for twenty or so minutes. Offering a chance in the litterbox isn't a bad idea, either, but don't be surprised if your cat turns its nose up at the idea.

, If you go out, put your cat in its carrier and the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on your door, in case the maid should come by. If you're going to be out for the day, put the cat in the bathroom with its things and shut the door (if possible). Then leave a note on the door stating your cat is currently in there and to please be careful not to let it out.

Your can get a soft-sided or hard-sided carrier but just make sure that it is big enough for your cat. In order to get the right size, just make sure the cat is able to stand up and turn around in its carrier.It is also important to make sure that the carrier you choose closes easily and can be latched securely.
If you get your cat from a pet store or an animal shelter you may be able to purchase a carrier when you get the cat.;
, It is important for you to put a collar and tags on your cat as soon as you get it. This will assure that if your cat gets lost anyone that finds it will be able to return it to you.Make sure the collar is the right size for your cat. It should be snug but not so tight that is restricts the cat's breathing or swallowing.
The information on your cat's tags should include your name, address, and a telephone number., In order to make your new cat feel at home, give it a soft and welcoming spot of its own. The cat bed you buy could be very simple or it could be relatively fancy, such as a heated cat bed that plugs into an outlet.Of course, you cannot guarantee that the cat will love the bed that you buy for it right away. In many cases, it will choose a pillow or an area on the carpet over the bed you chose for it. Don't be dismayed. You may just need to lure the cat towards the bed with a few toys, some cat nip, or by placing the bed in a warm and sunny spot., Even if you plan to allow your cat outside part of the time, you will still need to provide a litter box and litter for it. Find a place to put the litter box where the cat will have easy access to it.Just as with the cat's food, it's best to begin by using the same litter that the cat has already been using. This will reduce the risk of the cat choosing somewhere other than the litter box to go to the bathroom.
If your cat is reluctant to use its litter box it could be due to the type of box or the type of litter. Make sure that the cat can get in and out of the litter box easily. You can also try using a different type of litter.

, Your cat will need to have both a bowl for food and a bowl for water. These containers should be made of stainless steel, ceramic, or glass. These materials are the easiest to clean.There is no need to get special bowls made for pets. Instead, you can use bowls that you already own. However, know that pet bowls are usually heavier and weighted to the bottom, so that they are less easily tipped over.

, Giving your cat entertainment is an important part of caring for your cat. Give your new cat a variety of toys and scratching posts or pads so that its brain is stimulated throughout the day.


With a new cat it may take a few tries to find a type of toy that the cat likes. Bring home a variety of types of toys so that you can figure out what your new pet enjoys.
There is no need to spend a fortune on lots of fancy cat toys. Instead, in addition to traditional toys like cloth mice and bell balls, provide the cat with simple toys like ping-pong balls, cardboard boxes, and balled up pieces of paper. Your cat may just like the cheap toys best.It's a good idea to put a scratching post in every room the cat hangs out in so that it doesn't scratch your furniture instead., If possible, you should begin feeding your cat the same brand of food as it has been eating before coming home with you. This will help assure that it does not get an upset stomach from a sudden change to its diet. Ask the shelter, pet store, or person that had the cat before you about what the cat has been eating.This does not mean that you have to keep feeding the cat this food forever. It just will allow you to gradually switch the cat's diet over the course of a week or two.

, If you are unsure what brand and type of food to feed your new cat, talk to your veterinarian for suggestions. Your veterinarian should be able to give you some ideas that will fulfill the nutritional needs of your cat.


A good time to ask about food recommendations is when you bring your cat in for a checkup as soon as you get it.
Your veterinarian may suggest a specialty food for your cat's specific needs. This may include kitten food, senior food, or food for cats that need to lose weight., Once you pick a brand and type of cat food, compare prices at your local stores and online. The same exact product may be a very different price at different stores.Remember that if you order cat food online you may need to pay for shipping as well.
You can also reduce the cost of cat food by buying in larger quantities. You will get the food cheaper if you buy large packages than you would if you buy small packages.

, Most cats will need to be brushed regularly. You can buy a brush that is wire or you can get a wire and bristle combo. Additionally, you could get a comb that is metal toothed.A brush will be especially important if you are getting a long-haired cat. If this is the case, you may want to get a de-shedding brush for the cat to minimize the amount of fur that builds up in your home.

, Every cat needs its nails trimmed once in awhile, so you should buy some nail trimmers in preparation for bringing a new cat home. Cat nail trimmers come in two types: guillotine type and a scissor type. The guillotine type are generally easier to use than the scissor type.You can also use human nail clippers to trim your cat's nails in a pinch.
Trimming a cat's nails is good for the cat but it can also cut down on the damage they can do to your furniture when scratching.

, When you get a new cat there may be accidents in your home, such as the cat vomiting or going to the bathroom where it shouldn't. Be prepared for this by buying cleaning supplies that are specially made for cleaning up cat bodily fluids.


These products usually contain special enzymes that eat up the acids in cat urine.These products are available at your local pet supply store and at many general big box stores.

Avoid owning too many cats.,
Rescue responsibly.,
Spay or neuter your cat.,
Clean out the litter box at regular intervals.,
Avoid toxoplasmosis through good sanitation.,
Maintain strong social bonds.,
Keep hobbies outside of cats.,
Talk about a variety of subjects.,
Avoid the cat theme.,
Don’t dress your cats in clothing or costumes (optional).",How to Have Cats Without Being a Cat Lady," One of the simplest ways of avoiding looking like a cat lady is to simply not own that many cats. Limit yourself to one or two cats and make sure you can easily provide for the both of them.


Two cats is a great number to own. The cats will keep one another company when you are away from the house, dampening any guilt you may feel for leaving them alone.
Too many cats running around the house tends to increase the chance of behavioral problems in the cats, such as fighting, spraying, or otherwise damaging the environment.;
, Compassion for abandoned cats and other animals lead many to rescue an animal in need, or take one in from the street. Don’t let your compassion for such animals get the better off you. It’s easy to fall into a habit of taking in every abandoned animal you happen upon, and before you know it, you have far too many cats to support in a healthy manner.Join an animal rescue group organization. There are countless cat rescue groups throughout the US. These groups are dedicated to finding homes for cats in need, and often guarantee a “no kill” policy for cats who are kept until they are adopted. Look for your local organizations to see how you can help better the lives of cats without necessarily owning them.Many organizations also need volunteers to help socialize young abandoned kittens. This is a great opportunity to help cats in need without getting in over your head., Many cats (and dogs) find themselves without a home because pet owners fail to spay or neuter their pet. By doing your part and spaying or neutering your cat, you can ensure that more cats are not brought into this world that may not be able to find a home.


Getting your pet fixed also improves the long term health of your pet. Spaying or neutering reduces the urge for your cat to roam, show aggression, and otherwise get themselves into trouble.
Reducing harmful and aggressive behavior will also reduce the overall costs associated with raising your cat over the duration of your time together., Failure to clean the box regularly can cause your cat to start relieving itself outside of the box!Litter boxes should be scooped at least every other day. If you have more than one cat, then you will need to scoop more frequently in order to keep the litter box clean, and your cats happy.


The type of litter box you use is up to you, but choose a size that gives your cat plenty of room to move around in the box. The location of the litter box should not be placed too close to your cat’s food and water, as they dislike being able to smell the litter while eating.Use a fine, unscented litter. Scented litter is harsh on cat noses, and may drive them away from the litter box. Most cats enjoy the feel of a fine litter more than a thicker, chunkier litter. However, a variety of litter types are available to suit you and your cat’s needs, including natural and silica cat litter. Give them each a try to see what your cat likes best.A litter mat placed underneath the litter box can help remove litter from the paws of your cat before they track it all over the house.Ask a friend if your house smells of cat urine. It's easy to get used to the smell of your cats and not even notice if something is out of the ordinary when it comes to how your house smells.

, Failing to clean after your cats is a sure fire way to be seen as a “cat person,” but can also lead to several health risks. Toxoplasmosis is a parasite that is found in raw meat, as well as cat feces. For those who are pregnant or are immunocompromised, toxoplasmosis can lead to severe infection, resulting in headache, confusion, poor coordination and eye problems. This infection can be passed to a mother’s unborn child as well, endangering the life of the child.Wash your hands after changing cat litter to make sure no litter or feces remain on your hands. You wouldn't want a mouthful of litter!
Don’t allow your cat to walk on the dinner table. Cats can drag litter and remnants of their feces around on their paws, potentially spreading toxoplasmosis throughout the house. Clean the dinner table prior to meals if your cat is prone to perching there on occasion.
Toxoplasmosis activates after roughly 5 days, so regular vacuuming and household cleaning helps avoid infection risk from litter dragged throughout the house.
If you are pregnant or immunocompromised, avoid changing the cat litter if possible – have a friend take care of the task. If you have no other choice, wear disposable gloves and make sure to wash your hands afterwards.If you have a cat and plan on getting pregnant, or feel ill or not quite like yourself while owning one, consult your doctor and ask about toxoplasmosis.
Clean up any mess your cat leaves, such as hair balls or any hair that they shed. This helps indicate a demarcation between the owner of the house and its pets. You own the house, not your cat!

, Cat lovers carry the stereotype that their cats are the only love of their life. Keep a circle of friends to balance out your love for your cat. People provide a range of experiences and emotions that cannot necessarily be fulfilled by your pet.


Choose to be social over staying home with the kitty. The reason why having a cat is wonderful is that he doesn’t need to be walked or even taken to the bathroom. Cats are very content being on their own for long hours – capitalize on that fact and go out instead of staying home to cuddle up to your furry friend. He’ll understand if you ditch him for a hot date.
Close human friendship has been shown to improve longevity. Maintaining long term friends also helps reduce loneliness and stave off depression, as well as the chronic conditions associated with depression., Owning a pet is a fun and rewarding activity. However, make sure you pursue interests outside of your cat as well. Staying well rounded and participating in other activities outside of your cat will keep you in touch with others socially and let you meet new people.


Hobbies have a variety of health benefits as well, including warding off dementia and depression.
Create some time in your schedule for a new hobby. Restructure your work/life balance and, yes, give your cat a little alone time in order to create the time you need. The benefits will be worth it., If you only ever talk about your cats, most people are going to assume that you are a “cat person.” There’s no problem with mentioning your cats, particularly to fellow cat lovers, but avoid making them your constant topic of conversation. You may drive away potential new acquaintances this way.


Join a club or group specifically dedicated to the love of cats. This can help give you an outlet to discuss your feelings for your cat with others who share the same sentiment for theirs., Keep the cat theme to a minimum when accessorizing your house and clothes. A few photos of your cat at the office or at home is fine, but plastering cats all over the home will give visitors the wrong idea.


Cat clothing or handbags are cute! However, make sure to think about the rest of your clothing options when you go out shopping. Wearing something that is cat-themed every day will earn you a “cat lady” label from some people.
Keep your home cat-friendly without overwhelming the aesthetic of your house for the sake of your cat. Tall cat condos, a cat bed, a few scratch pads in discrete corners, and some nooks and crannies for your cat to hide in will keep your pet perfectly happy.Your cat should have activities to do while you're out, such as toys or scratch pads. It's also a good idea to have two cats, so that they can amuse each other and not feel lonely.

, Animals with little sweaters or costumes, though cute, may just indicate a skewed sense of priorities regarding your pet. Feel free to spruce up your pet for Halloween or other fun occasions, but regularly spending money on clothing for your cat is excessive.


The exception to this rule is when directed by your vet, such as providing a blanket coat or an Elizabethan collar to stop scratching or biting. These are medical aids, not fashion accessories.

Keep health records on hand.,
Have proper identification for your cat.,
Calm your cat with supplements or pheromones.,
Practice giving your cat sedatives.,
Leave the crate out.",How to Travel Long Distance With a Cat1," You should always travel with your cat's health records whenever crossing a border, whether it's a state or national border. Your veterinarian may be able to tell you what documents to travel with. For instance, you may need a health certificate and current, proper vaccination documentation. Give yourself as much time as you can, preferably several months, to prepare. This way you can find out airline regulations, get your cat vaccinated, and make any other important arrangements.When crossing state lines, you might only need a current Rabies vaccination with a tag and certificate. When crossing into other countries, the requirements vary depending on the country and region.;
, Regardless of how you're traveling, get a flat, customized collar that has your contact information sewn into the collar material. This way, you can avoid attaching dangling tags to your cat's collar which might get stuck in crate doors or crevices during travel. Or, you could ask your veterinarian to implant a microchip under your cat's skin. The microchip will contain all of your contact information in case your cat escapes and loses her collar.You can order a customized collar at your local pet store or on the internet.

, If you know your cat dislikes travel and becomes stressed or anxious, ask your vet to recommend calming products for travel. Your cat may respond well to simple herbal supplements or calming pheromones. These pheromones are artificial versions of the pheromones your cat naturally releases when she feels safe and secure in an environment.When your cat is in a stressful situation, she may rapidly lose vitamins and nutrients. Herbal supplements can help replenish these, calming your cat.

, If your cat doesn't respond to more natural calming methods, ask your veterinarian to prescribe a sedative. This will let your cat sleep during travel. No matter which sedative your vet recommends, you should do a few trial runs with your cat before your big trip.Trial runs will let you know how your cat responds to the sedative and whether you need to adjust the timing or dosage, before the trip.

, Since you'll most likely be transporting your cat in a crate, leave it out and open in your house. Do this for as long as possible before your trip. This way your cat can explore the crate itself and become accustomed to seeing it or being in it without any fear.The more comfortable your cat is with its crate, the more comfortable they will feel in it while they are traveling.

Get a halter that is specifically designed for cats.,
Snap a lightweight leash onto the halter.,
Take hold of the leash.,
Take your cat outside on the leash.,
Start taking your cat for short walks, praising him profusely.",How to Travel Train Your Cat1," Allow your cat to sniff it thoroughly, then place it on him. It should fit snugly, but not painfully tight. Let him wear it until he forgets that it's there. Do this daily for a week. Reward with treats and praise each time.;
, Supervise him while it's attached—he could get caught on something. Let him drag it around the house until he forgets about it. Do this daily for at least 2-3 days. Again, reward your cat with treats and praise each time.

, If he shows no reaction, tug it gently and call your cat. Do this a few times a day, for 5-10 minutes at a time, for a week. Reward with treats and praise each time.

, Continue the previous exercise, but outside, for a week; reward each time.

, Let him wander where he wants to. If he goes to the bathroom outside, praise him and give him treats.

Get a hard-shell crate.,
Avoid feeding your cat right before the trip.,
Bring along familiar items from home.,
Prevent your cat from getting out of the car.",How to Travel Long Distance With a Cat2," Choose a sturdy, hard-shell crate to transport your cat. This style crate will be much easier to safely secure with a seatbelt in the backseat. A secure crate will also move less during the trip, making it less stressful for your cat. This can also reduce the risk of injury or harm to your cat if an accident were to happen.Keeping your cat in a crate will also prevent your cat from escaping through a window or door when the car is stopped. It will also keep your cat out of areas in the car where she could get stuck, like under one of the vehicle's seats.
Before your big trip, try taking short rides around town with your cat to help get used to traveling in the crate., Don't feed your cat for 2 to 3 hours before starting your trip. This can prevent potential stomach upset for your cat during the car ride. You can offer a little water before the drive. While you're in the car, don't put any food or water in your cat's crate. If the water or food spills during transport, it can get very messy which can be uncomfortable for you and your cat.Each time you stop for a break during your trip, offer your cat a small amount of water.

, You can put your cat at ease during a long car trip by bringing along a few familiar items for your cat to ride with. For example, if she typically loves to be around you or a family member, bring along a shirt or sweater belonging to you or the other person. You can place it in the crate for your cat to snuggle during the ride. You can also bring her favorite toys.Don't forget to pad the bottom of the crate with a towel or blanket to make your cat more comfortable during the trip. A small litter box can be added to the crate so that your cat can use the restroom as needed during travel. You might want to put pet pads down on the bottom of the crate, so if your cat misses the litter box, you don't have a mess.
Your cat may enjoy privacy when using her litterbox, so keep the privacy flaps of the crate or carrier down., It's important to keep your cat inside the car when traveling, since you'll be passing through unfamiliar areas. If your cat escapes your car during the trip, it's unlikely that she'll be safely returned.You should also avoid opening any windows or doors if your cat is not restrained. Watch to make sure your cat doesn't get out when the car is moving or parked.


If you find your cat won't use the litter box in her crate, try putting her on a harness with a leash. Let her get out of the car in order to eliminate.
Never leave your cat alone in the car. If it's hot outside, your cat is likely to overheat, even with the windows cracked or open. If it's cold outside, your cat could become hypothermic while she waits for you to return.

Research airline regulations.,
Choose a direct flight and check your ticket information.,
Consider using a soft-shell carrier.,
Consider the environment of the cargo hold.",How to Travel Long Distance With a Cat3," When booking your flight, be sure to check on all the different aspects of flying with your cat. Ask if the airline allows your cat to travel in the cabin with you or if she'll have to fly below deck in the cargo hold. Some airlines don't allow animals to fly on their airplanes at all. You and your cat may have to take different flights depending on your situation.Flying in the cargo hold can be extremely dangerous for some breeds of cat. For example, it's not recommended for cats with brachycephalic facial structures, or ""smushed faces"", like Persians. Their narrow nasal passages make it difficult to breathe in that area of the airplane., Try to get a direct flight in order to reduce the length of travel, since transferring and connect flights can take longer. You'll probably also appreciate the faster route. Before takeoff, double check your cat's ticket information to your own. Make sure that every tag attached to your cat's carrier is clearly and correctly marked with both your flight and contact information.


You should also attach a 24-hour feeding schedule to your cat's carrier. This way, you cat can be taken care of if she's delayed in her travels., Check with the airline about whether you can carry your cat in a carrier and if it needs to be hard or soft shell. The airline may specify a specific type if your cat has to fly in the cargo hold. In some cases, your cat may be able to fly in the cabin with you. If so, a soft-shell carrier will be easier to stow under the seat for take-off and landing.A hard-shell carrier is preferred if your cat is traveling in the cargo hold area.

, If your cat will have to fly in the cargo hold, take her comfort into account. Think about the expected temperature of the area, season, and time of day you are flying. During the warm, summer months, flying early in the morning or overnight is best to beat the heat in the cargo hold. During cold, winter months, flying in the afternoon usually allows for a more comfortable trip.If the temperatures are going to be extreme, many airlines won't allow your cat to fly in the cargo hold. This is another reason why it's important to check with the airline before you fly.

Place your cat in the car without turning on the engine.,
Place your cat in the car and turn on the engine.,
Place your cat in a carrier in the car while the engine is running.,
Take your cat on short trips around the block.,
Expand your daily trips.",How to Travel Train Your Cat2," Get in the car with your cat and allow him to explore it thoroughly. Remember not to turn on the engine. Do this for at least two consecutive days — longer if he's uncomfortable.

, Let him get used to it. Repeat this step daily until he is fine with it.

, Repeat this step daily until he's fine with it. If your cat is used to carriers, this might not take any time at all. Be sure there's a towel or cloth in the carrier so he has something to grab a hold of with his claws. This will reassure him.

, Limit your trips to approximately 5 minutes or so. Don't do this more than twice a day. The first time or two, he might be scared and vocal — most cats dislike the vibration of a moving vehicle. Try to stick to smooth roads in the beginning. Repeat this step until he is quiet and not afraid to be in the moving car. This is the most important step! Give him lots of praise and treats after the ride, so that he looks forward to it.

, Do this until he is accustomed to being in the car for long periods of time. Take him to a park, put him on his leash and halter, and let him out of the car to sniff around and drink some water. If he goes to the bathroom at the park, reward him profusely. Repeat this step for a while and your cat will love going for rides with you!

Make sure you have enough time to care for a cat.,
Make sure you’re ready for a 15 to 20 year commitment.,
Consider your future family plans.,
Make sure everyone in your household is ready for a cat.,
Be prepared for messes and slight damage.,
Try fostering or cat-sitting before getting a cat.",How to Know if You're Ready to Get a Cat1," While cats are thought of as independent pets, they still need to spend time with their owners. Make sure you can spend at least a couple hours every day playing and bonding with your cat.Cats need about a half hour of exercise per day. Playing with a cat will give it exercise and help you bond with it.
Getting used to new surroundings takes time, so try to take some time off work during the first few days after bringing a new cat home.;
, Before getting a cat, take some time to evaluate your ability to take on a long-term commitment. Remember that cats often live up to 20 years.You can’t predict the future, but if you move at least once a year, travel a lot for work, plan on having a family, or anticipate other major lifestyle changes, you might consider getting a cat when things are more settled.

, Make sure caring for a cat fits into your family plans. If you’re dating someone and plan on getting married, make sure they’re not allergic to cats. Talk to your spouse about having children, and make sure you’re both prepared to balance the new responsibilities of building a family with caring for your cat., If you already have children, talk to them about caring for a cat and respecting its boundaries. If you expect them to take on care responsibilities, like litter box cleaning, explain to them how and when to do their chores. Remind them that cats can be independent and often like to have their space, so they shouldn’t force the cat to play with them.Spend time around friends’ or family members’ cats to teach your kids how to handle a cat and to ensure no one in your family is allergic.

, Make sure you have the patience to tolerate the things cats do that aren’t so cute. Be ready to deal with hairballs and vomit, cat hair on clothes and furniture, claw scratching, litter box cleaning, and occasional bathroom accidents.You can get a shorthaired cat to keep shedding to a minimum, but keep in mind there are messy aspects of pet ownership that you can’t avoid.

, Fostering or cat-sitting will you decide whether or not you're ready to get a cat of your own. Ask a friend or family member if you can watch their cat for a weekend, ideally at your house. You can also contact your local animal shelter or humane society and ask for information about their fostering program.

Gather supplies in your car.,
Pack a first aid kit in your car.,
Get your cat used to its cage.,
Practice using a leash before your trip.,
Medicate your cat before leaving, if necessary.,
Put your cat in its cage.,
Secure the cage in the car.,
Give your cat water regularly.,
Let your cat out of the car every two hours or so.,
Don't leave your cat alone in the car.,
Offer food on the cat's regular schedule.,
Let your cat blow off some steam at the end of the day.",How to Travel by Car With Cats," When traveling with your cat, you will need to bring along a variety of supplies. These supplies include items that you will use in the car and items you will use when you take breaks and when you get to your destination. Supplies you will need include:Cage
Cat bed or blanket
Cat food and bowl
Water and bowl
Leash
Cat toys
Litter box and litter
Medications;
, Include an anti-diarrheal and an anti-anxiety medication recommended by your veterinarian. Also put bandages, gauze and antiseptic cream in the kit.Write down or program your cell phone with your veterinarian's phone number, the phone number of a 24-hour animal hospital near your destination, and the phone number of a poison control hotline.

, In order to make traveling in a cage more comfortable, you should let your cat get used to it before hand. Place it in your home, with the door open, and let your cat explore it for a few days before you are planning to travel by car. As your cat becomes more comfortable with its cage, begin closing the door for a minute or two to get it used to the closed door.Consider putting a blanket or cat bed in the cage that already has your cat's scent on it. This will make the cat more comfortable with the space.

, Use a leash on your cat at home before taking a trip. Try to walk your cat around your home for awhile and then take it outside on the leash once it starts to get used to it. This practice will make it so the leash does not come as a total surprise to the cat when you are traveling.

You may just want to attach the leash to your cat's collar. However, you can get it a body harness if it fights the leash too much when it is attached to its collar.

, If your cat is not good in the car, for instance it drools, paces, meows uncontrollably, or gets upset, then you may need to medicate it to keep it calm. Some of these behaviors are caused by anxiety and some are caused by ailments, such as motion sickness. Consult with your veterinarian about prescription or over-the-counter medications that might help your cat during your travels.Follow the directions on the medication packaging for dosage and timing of dosing. In most cases, you will want to begin the medication before the trip begins so that the cat is calm from the beginning., Confine your cat to a cage or a pet carrying case so the cat doesn't get in your way while you're driving. It can be dangerous if a loose cat climbs into the driver's lap, gets underfoot, or becomes frightened or excited.Make sure the cage is large enough for your cat to turn around in, stand up fully, and stretch out.
Place something soft in the cage for the cat to lie on before putting the cat inside.

, Once you put the cage in your cat, secure it with one of the seat belts or by placing it in a spot where it cannot move. This will help to protect your cat from injury if you have to stop suddenly or you get into an accident., Fill your cat's water bowl at rest stops and offer it a chance to drink. Cats can become dehydrated easily, especially if they eat dry food, so it's important to give your cat frequent access to water.


It is typically not a good idea to give your cat water while the car is moving. It will likely spill and get all over the place.

, You and your cat should stretch your legs every couple hours during a trip in the car. If at all possible, let the cat investigate an area with loose dirt or sand to encourage it to defecate or urinate.


If there are no sandy spots available, or your cat is particular about litter, set up a small litter box and try to have your cat use it while you are stopped. Taking a few minutes to let your cat relax and go to the bathroom is better than having your cat have an accident in the car.

, It is dangerous to leave a pet in a car unattended. The temperature can increase rapidly in a closed up car, so you can endanger your cat's health by leaving it alone for a few minutes if it's too hot out.Never leave your cat in a car if the temperature is too hot. If the temperature is warm and you can't avoid leaving your cat briefly, park in the shade and leave the windows open enough to allow air circulation, but not so wide your cat can escape or get its head caught. A cat can get sick and die quickly if left in an overheated car.

, To prevent car-sickness, try to arrange your cat's main meal after you arrive at your destination. However, you should try to feed it at a time that is close to when it normally eats.


Cats' bowels are stimulated by food, so be sure to set up the litter box as soon as you arrive at your nightly destination.

, Take cat toys or a laser pointer on your trip to stimulate the cat with play at the end of the day's travel. It's important for your cat to move around and get vigorous exercise, especially if the feline is confined in a cage for most of the day.


This is especially important if you are going on a multi-day trip with your cat.

Enjoy having a cat!",How to Get a Cat for a Pet," It is important to understand the motivation behind wanting to get a cat in the first place in order to choose the best possible cat to bring home. Some common reasons include:


Wanting unconditional love and constant companionship
To fill a void created by the loss of another pet or companion
Wanting a friend for your child while also teaching them about responsibility
Wanting to take care of someone every day;
, Owning a pet is a big responsibility, and the decision to get a cat can mean signing up for these responsibilities for about 15 to 18 years. It is important to be aware that over the next decade plus, this cat will be in your life as a constant companion, but also as a constant obligation. Be sure you are willing to take care of a cat throughout your life and theirs before going any further in the process.

, In addition to the initial cost of the cat, which can be very high if you choose to go to a breeder, you also need to consider other ownership expenses. Keep in mind you will also need to pay for food, visits to the veterinarian, identification tags, microchipping, and other incidentals, which can really add up quickly. The ASPCA estimates that the first year alone will cost a cat owner about $1,035., You may really want to get a cat, and you may have the means to do so, but there are a few other requirements you should consider before deciding that a cat is the right choice at this point in your life:Do you have any other pets and will they react well to a new cat?
Are you allowed to have cats at your current residence?
Will your work and social life allow time to care for, and interact with, a new cat?
What would you do with your cat if you went on vacation?
Do you, or anyone else that would commonly interact with the cat, have allergies to cats, cat hair, dirt, or dander?
Do you have children who may need a cat with a particular type of temperament?

, While most shelter cats are mixed-breed, it is possible to find purebred cats at a shelter. Adopting a shelter cat also means it has been checked by a veterinarian and is often already spayed or neutered pre-adoption. This is one of the lowest costing options, and adopting a cat also gives them a second chance at life, which is a great cause., There are many organizations dedicated to rescuing cats and finding someone to adopt them. Some organizations take in any type of cat, while others are dedicated to rescuing specific breeds. Do some research online or contact your local animal shelter for suggestions, as they often work together. Many rescue groups don’t have an adopting fee and instead have a recommended “donation fee” that is relatively inexpensive., Be very wary of buying a cat from a pet store. Many of these kittens come from animal mills, which focus on breeding as many cats as possible rather than safely breeding a few quality litters. These cats are often born with congenital abnormalities and raised in confined, crowded conditions, which can cause behavioral issues. They will also cost a lot more money than getting a cat from a shelter or rescue group, often costing hundreds of dollars., If you have a particular breed in mind, do some thorough research to find an accredited breeder with a great reputation. Because purebred cats are also much more expensive (think hundreds, even thousands, of dollars), be sure to research median prices so you know whether or not you are paying an appropriate amount., It is important to first determine if the cat in question is in fact a stray cat; look for ""lost"" or ""missing"" fliers in your neighborhood, contact the local shelters, and take the cat to a veterinarian to check if it is microchipped. If it is a stray, it is very important to take the cat to a veterinarian to be checked for diseases and to be spayed/neutered immediately., Different breeds of cats have distinct characteristics, and it is important to do some research to determine the best breed to fit your lifestyle. While less than 10% of cats are considered “purebred” to one specific breed, an understanding of the breeding groups in general will be very helpful even if you are adopting a common house cat:Natural breeds: These cats have long, thick coats developed in cold climates; heavy, square bodies; and are the most sedentary group of the three purebred groupings. Common breeds within this group are American and British shorthairs, Persians, and Maine coon cats.
Semi-foreign or Hybrids: Considered an in-between group, these cats have slightly oval eyes; moderately wedge-shaped heads; and a leaner, more muscular body than the other breeds. They have a moderate energy level in comparison, except for the Abyssinian breed, which is high energy. Other common breeds within this group are the Russian blues and Ocicats.
The Orientals: These cats originated in warmer climates and so they have very little body fat, lighter coats, and very long legs, tails, ears, and bodies. This group is the most active and talkative of the three purebred groupings. Common breeds within this group are Siamese, Burmese, and Cornish rexes.

, It is important to consider the time you have available to train and play with your cat, as well as your expectations for its behavior. If you work full time or have young children, it might be best to adopt an older cat since kittens and adolescents are a lot of work to train and watch over.If this is your first cat, try to avoid cats that are very demanding (of your attention, of their space, etc.) as it may be too big a challenge for a beginner.

, After doing some research to determine the best breeds for your lifestyle, it is important to realize that this is just a “best guess.” Be sure to go and interact with your cat in person a few times before making a decision. Also, adoption counselors at shelters often have great advice to help you find a cat whose personality matches your own., It is very important that any cat you get feels safe and comfortable interacting with the other people and pets in your life already. When visiting the shelter or breeder, be sure to bring your kids, partner, or anyone else that will have regular contact with the cat along with you. If you have existing pets, talk to the breeder or the shelter counselors about the best way to introduce the pets to see if there are any potential issues., A breeder will have a better understanding of the cat’s history and tendencies, but an animal shelter or rescue group will only be able to hypothesize about a cat’s past illnesses and elaborate on its current state. While no shelter would want to release a sick cat for adoption, it is still important to educate yourself about common signs of illness in cats so you can ask questions and make observations:Changes in water intake (both drinking more and drinking less) can indicate that the cat has diabetes or kidney disease.
Unexpected weight loss or weight gain despite normal eating habits can indicate diabetes or hyperthyroidism.
Bad breath can mean tooth decay, dental disease, or a digestive disorder, while sweet or fruity-smelling breath can be a sign of diabetes.
Pay attention to the cat’s grooming habits. If a once well-groomed cat starts to appear unkempt, this is a sure sign of potential illness. Alternatively, over-grooming can indicate that the cat is very stressed out, anxious, in pain, or has allergies.

, Before bringing your cat home, pick out a local veterinarian and schedule a visit within the first couple of days of its arrival. Be sure to ask for any medical records from the shelter or breeder! Get your house in order and buy everything that the cat will need in your home. For a list, see ""Things You'll Need"" below.

, Because cats are very territorial, it can be extra stressful for a cat to come into a home full of new smells and dark spaces. To help ease the transition, create the ideal cat territory for your cat:Find a small space for the cat to call home for the first few days or weeks, ideally with enough room for the cat’s water, food, and litter box, as well as a space for you to sit and interact (slowly at first) with your new pet.
Fill a litter box with a few inches (about 6 cm) of litter and put it somewhere within the small space that will provide some privacy for the cat to use it undisturbed (for example, drape a cloth over the edge of a counter, like a curtain).
Keep the food and water bowls separate from the litter box area.
Provide the cat with something to scratch, like a post or a mat you can purchase at pet stores, and keep one in each room. If you need to, encourage the cat to scratch those (instead of your couch!) by putting some catnip on the scratching surfaces.

, Have the doors closed and let the cat smell and listen to the environment, making sure to do this with the cat in the carrier if there are other pets or young children in the area. Show your cat the special area you created for it and where the litter box, bed, and food are.

, Cats are very territorial animals so introductions should be made gradually. Keep your pets in separate rooms and first share their scents with each other by rubbing a towel on each and swapping them. Feed the pets on opposite sides of a closed door, and slowly begin opening the door at different times of day. Keep in mind it could take weeks or months till they feel comfortable with each other!, You should expect the cat to hide and not eat very much food for the first days or even weeks. If you have other pets, be aware that it will take a month or more for them to become acclimated to a new pet. Don’t force the cat to come to you, and understand that some cats hide and don’t come out at all when you are around for a while.Just give the cat time!

, Even if the cat is hiding from you, be sure to provide it with food twice a day and always have fresh water readily available. If the cat is shy and avoiding eating during this adjustment period, it is very important that they are still hydrating., Take your cat to the pre-scheduled vet visit to have them vaccinated and de-wormed, if necessary. Be sure to provide the vet with any records you received from the breeder or shelter. It is highly recommended that you also have a microchip implanted for identification if it needs surgery or gets lost.

Make sure your landlord allows cats.,
Remove hazards to keep a curious cat safe.,
Make sure windows, doors, and HVAC ducts are tight.,
Keep medications, cleaners, antifreeze, and other toxic chemicals secure.",How to Know if You're Ready to Get a Cat3," Cats do well in smaller spaces, so they’re great pets if you live in an apartment. However, you should check with your landlord before getting a cat and, if necessary, check or amend your lease to verify that your apartment is pet-friendly.You might be responsible for a one-time or recurring pet fee, so make sure to fit any applicable fees into your budget.

, Before you get a cat, you need to make sure you can cat-proof your home. Cover electrical outlets, make sure furniture won’t tip over, remove knick knacks that your climbing cat might knock over, and keep small choking hazards (like thumbtacks, rubber bands, and paperclips) inaccessible., Check all of your home’s windows and make sure their parts are in solid order. Make sure screens are secure for windows that you open, and that the window won’t slam shut and injure your cat. Make sure all of your HVAC ducts are sealed tightly so your cat won’t be able to hide or get lost in your duct system., Avoid leaving medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen out and take care not to drop any pills, as these drugs are deadly for cats. Store cleaning products and other chemicals in tightly closing cupboards, and consider using a baby guard so your cat can’t open the cupboard door.If you intend to let your cat out of the house, take special care to clean up antifreeze puddles under your car. Antifreeze is particularly harmful to cats.

To keep your friendly kitty friendly - interact with it daily.",How to Find a Friendly Kitty," There are friendly and grumpy cats of both ages however your perception will be influenced somewhat by your expectations. Some people will never find a kitten's playful antics to be 'friendly' when claws are involved. Also, a kitten's personality may change as it ages (especially post-puberty) whereas, with an adult cat, it's more a case of what you see is what you get.;
, Acquire as much information about the cats/kittens as possible - age, health, color, sex, temperament, history, etc

, Determine if you can reserve one, adopt one that day or must go through an application process., Ask to take them into a room with you that will allow you to interact with each animal individually.

, You should look for an inquisitive, out-going kitten who isn't scared of you. A kitten who plays with its siblings and isn't withdrawn.

, It is just that genetically, calico cats are almost always female. However, several vets have said that male gray cats tend to be the most laid back of all the cats.

, That should allow you to see closer to the real personality. Cats, like people, get nervous in new situations.

, Good owners/breeder should know their animals well and should have been interacting with them daily., Do not take a kitten from its mother before it is 8 weeks old. Kittens need that time for socialization with their mother and siblings.

, Talk to her/him when you come home and when you leave. Play daily. Talk to him/her when you feed them and anytime you walk by each other in the house. You wouldn't ignore another person so don't ignore kitty.

Think critically about why you want a cat, and ask yourself these questions:Why do you think a cat is the best option?
What is your experience with cats?
How long have you wanted a cat?
Why is now a good time to have a cat?
Will there be a better time to have a cat?;
, Many people thinking of getting a pet tend to romanticize what it will be like. It’s easy to imagine all the sweet and cuddly moments you hope to enjoy with a kitty, but you also need to be realistic and think about the drawbacks of owning a cat.If you are going to convince your man to get a cat, you need to make sure you are both prepared for the reality of owning one.
Animals can make a mess and cats are no different from other pets. At some point you will clean up cat poop, pee, and vomit.
Remember, you will have to clean out the litter box regularly.
It takes time and money to groom your cat and treat them for fleas and any illnesses that might develop.
Cats are great hunters. Are you going to be upset if your cat kills birds, mice, lizards, or bugs, and then brings it inside your house or apartment?
Cats have different personalities, and may not act the way you imagine they will.

, Like any pet, cats require time, money, and energy to care for. Your man is more likely to agree to having a cat if you can show that you will be able to support and care for it.If you and your significant other go out of town frequently or work long hours, how will you ensure a cat is taken care of? Develop a plan so you are prepared to discuss it with your significant other.
Make a spreadsheet and total up the potential expenses of owning a cat. Factor in the cost of food, toys, litter, supplies, medication, and vet visits. Don’t forget to account for potential emergencies that require more expensive medical procedures.
If you know a vet in your area, you can call and ask them about the price of regular visits and medications.

, Before you rush into a conversation with your significant other about getting a cat, think carefully about why they may be reluctant. While you will need to ask them directly how they feel about it, thinking about their potential concerns beforehand can make the conversation feel less confrontational.How does your man view cats, and how are cats viewed in his cultural background?
What does he know about cats?
Has he had other pets?
Is your man allergic to cats?
Would he prefer another kind of pet?

, Think about how the cat will fit in with the other members of your family.For example, how will a cat interact with other pets in your household?
Do you have children who might have trouble being gentle with a cat or are scared of animals?
Can your family make a long-term commitment to owning a cat. Cats typically live for 15 years or more.
Will your housing situation allow for a cat? Some apartments and rental homes do not permit cats.

, It’s also a good idea to think about where you might get a cat before you discuss it with your significant other. Consider the options below, and think about what may be right for you, your man, and your family:Adopt a cat from a shelter or rescue agency. These cats are looking for great homes and are often more affordable upfront since they have been given shots, spayed or neutered, and have had initial vet care. At the same time, they may also have special needs or health issues.
Buy a cat from a reputable breeder. If you have a specific type of cat in mind or want a purebred cat, then look for a responsible breeder online or in your area. Breeders will be able to talk with you about the cat’s personality, needs, and the potential benefits of a specific breed.
Pet stores often sell cats, but look for one that works with a local shelter or rescue organization so you know the cats are healthy, well-socialized, and not from a kitten mill.

, If you don’t broach the topic, you are going to have a hard time talking with your man about getting a cat.Be upfront about what you want and don’t try to manipulate your husband or boyfriend into getting a cat. Threatening to get a cat without their agreement or lying about the matter, may damage your relationship and make it more difficult for you to convince him why you should get a cat.
Since you’ve spent some time reflecting on why you want a cat and think it is a good fit, share your research and findings with your significant other. He will be impressed that you took the time to really consider the benefits, drawbacks, and reality of owning a cat.

, Now that you’ve explained how you feel about getting a cat, it’s essential for you to listen to your significant other’s feelings and concerns. His feelings are just as important as yours, and he might bring up some points that you had not considered.In order to persuade someone, you need to acknowledge and address their misgivings.
Don’t interrupt him while he is talking. This won’t encourage him to communicate, and the conversation could become unpleasant and confrontational.

, When you understand your significant other’s concerns or reluctance about getting a cat, you will be better equipped to address these concerns and come to a resolution on the subject together.For example, if your man has allergies, you could explore adopting a specific breed that produces fewer allergens than others. Here are a few of the breeds considered “hypoallergenic”: Siberian, Balinese, bengal, sphynx, Cornish rex, Devon rex, and siamese.If your significant other is worried about getting scratched, talk with him about trying to find a friendly cat or even working with a cat trainer to prevent problem behaviors., If your significant other hasn’t spent much time around cats or doesn’t care for them, you can educate them and discuss the great things about owning a cat. Here are a few things you can mention:Cats are cuddly.
Cats are independent.
Cats reduce anxiety and stress.
They bathe themselves.
They don’t require extensive potty training.
They can take care of the bug and rodent population around your home.
Cats spend much of their time sleeping.
Cats offer companionship.
Cats improve your health.
Cats teach you and your family responsibility.
Owning a cat can increase your bond with each other.
They can help people be less self absorbed.

, If your man hasn’t spent much time around cats or is concerned about having one, it can be a good idea to spend some time together around cats. He might just need a good introduction to a nice cat, and this experience may change his perspective on getting a cat.Visit friends who have a cat, or offer to “cat-sit.”
Go to an animal shelter and play with some of the cats there.
Contact a rescue group and offer to help out together so you can spend time around the cats and learn about how to care for them.

, To have a successful conversation about getting a cat, you and your significant other both need to be willing to compromise.For example, if he is open to the idea of getting a cat but would like to wait a little while, you could agree on a timetable.
If there’s another pet he would like, be willing to accommodate his desire in exchange for getting a cat.
Work together to pick a breed, sex, and name for your cat. You’ll both feel more invested if you make these decisions together.

, If your significant other does not want to have a cat, he might be open to it if you are willing to be the cat’s primary caregiver. If his main objection to having a cat is the responsibility of taking care of it, this might be a good compromise.If he agrees to this, his feelings for the cat might change once they bond.

, If your man is unwilling to compromise about having a cat in the home, you can still spend time with cats and help care for them. Consider volunteering at a shelter in your area.You’ll be helping cats that are in particular need of love, affection, and care.

, If your significant other doesn’t want to make a long-term commitment to a cat, there are other options available. Work with animal rescue groups or cat-rescue agencies to provide a temporary foster home for a cat in need.Sometimes the agency or rescue group will be able to provide food and medical care, so it is not as much of a burden on your finances.
Fostering a cat is usually a short-term commitment until the agency or rescue group locates a permanent home.

, If it doesn’t seem like owning a cat is a possibility at this time, you can still get your kitty fix and help out friends, family, and neighbors by being willing to take care of their cats when they are out of town or unavailable., Your partner might be opposed to getting a cat, but he may be open to adopting a different kind of pet. If you are looking for companionship, other animals can provide this too.Talk with your significant other about pets he might be willing to live with. Then, do some research online to learn about your options.
Make the decision together so you will both be on the same page and agree to take care of the pet.

Make sure the kitten is in a warm, safe environment.,
Gently lift the kitten’s tail.,
Check the shape of the lower opening.,
Check the distance between the openings.,
Check for testicles.",How to Determine the Sex of a Kitten1," Though it may not be obvious, young kittens are very vulnerable to the cold. Until they’re able to warm themselves on their own, they rely on the mother’s body heat for warmth. Separating a kitten from its mother can damage its health. To avoid adversely affecting the kitten or its health, follow these guidelines when handling the kitten and trying to determine its sex:


Handle the kittens in a warm, indoor area
Don't separate young kittens from their mother for more than 5-10 minutes
Don't lay kittens on ""heat-sucking"" surfaces like marble countertops and hardwood floors that will draw warmth out of their bodies;
, Checking the kitten’s genitals is the most direct way to determine its sex. A kitten may be (understandably) reluctant to let you lift its tail and expose its genitals. Always be gentle. Handling a kitten roughly or using forceful motions can cause pain and may cause the kitten to lash out in self-defense. Avoid holding the kitten by its tail, which is very fragile.


Calmly pet the kitten for a few minutes before laying it gently on a soft, clean towel and lifting its tail. Be willing to back off and return it to its mother if it shows resistance.
Position the kitten in a standing position with its head directed away from you.
Lift--don’t tug or pull--the tail.
If the kitten is reluctant to let you inspect beneath its tail, try getting a partner to help. The partner can gently hold the kitten in their arms while you gently lift the tail.
You can also try to get the kitten to voluntarily lift its tail by scratching where the back meets the tail.The kitten should have two openings. The top opening is the anus, while the bottom opening is the male or female genitalia., If you have more than one kitten, you might compare the two side-by-side. It can be easier to distinguish male from female by comparing them directly.


A female kitten’s genital opening will look like a small vertical slit. Together, the anus and genital openings on a female kitten will look like a lowercase “i.”
A male kitten’s genital opening will look like a tiny circular hole. Together, the anus and genital openings on a male kitten will look like a colon ( : )., Female kittens have a lesser ano-genital distance than do males, so you can use the distance to distinguish the sexes.


A female kitten’s genital opening is placed higher up and closer to the anus.
A male kitten’s genital opening is further below the anus.

, Testicles on young males are not always obvious but can still be detected. But don't ever forcibly manipulate the genitals. Penises can be especially delicate — attempting to forcefully extend a male cat's penis (which is normally withdrawn) can lead to lasting damage.


Look carefully at the space between the genital opening and the anus. If you see a small bulge or pouch, it’s likely the scrotum, and thus the kitten is male.
If you can’t visually detect a scrotum, you can feel for them in kittens that are at least a month or two old. To feel for testicles, gently pinch the area between the anus and genital opening. You may feel one or two small pea-sized lumps. Be aware that very young male kittens--younger than a month or two old--may have testicles that have retreated into the inguinal canal and cannot yet be felt.

Make some room!,
Have the amenities ready.,
Outlets.,
Don't get crazy with meal planning.,
Turn it down!,
Daytime playtime.",How to Coexist with a Cat," If your house is overly cluttered, you're likely to make your new cat feel uncomfortable or nervous. It's important that your cat be able to jump on furniture and high surfaces without getting lost in the mess. Your cat is a part of the family now, so do your best to give him/her a proper welcome.;
, The best way to introduce a new cat into your home is to have a litter box (assuming he/she will be an indoor cat) set up and ready for use before the cat is brought inside. This will let him/her know that there is a space that's automatically theirs. They will most likely investigate the box soon after entering the home. If they don't find it on their own, show them!

, Your new cat will need to be able to exercise and exert their energy in healthy ways. Purchase some scratching posts and toys from your local pet store as soon as possible, even if you adopt a more mature cat. Your cat will thank you, young or old. The posts will naturally file your cat's nails and the toys will help them exert their nerves while they adjust to their new home.

, When I first adopted my cat, all I wanted to do was feed her whatever I thought she would like. But too much variety can be a bad thing. If your cat starts throwing up, you might be changing her food too much or over-feeding him/her. Most cats will prefer canned food over dry food, but too much canned food weakens their teeth and can be too rich for their tummy. A healthy balance is key.

, Cats don't like loud noises, so if you're used to blasting music or you parent several screaming children, adopting a cat might not be right for you. If there's a lot of nervous energy in the house, your cat will pick up on it.

, If you let your cat sleep all day, you won't get much sleep during the night. You have to set aside some playtime during the day to play with your cat to thoroughly wear him/her out. Some cats will meow through the night, some will play loudly with their toys right when your eyes begin to close and some will even bang the lower cupboards in the bathroom or kitchen open and shut until they're sure your awake.

Clean the carrier with soap and water.,
Place the carrier near one of your cat’s favorite spots.,
Place food and toys in the carrier.,
Take your cat for a test drive.",How to Transport a Cat in a Carrier1," Do not use cleaning products to clean the carrier, since the scent of these products is off-putting for cats. Instead, use mild soap and hot water to clean the carrier. Take the carrier apart and clean it with a scrub brush. Then rinse it with water and leave it outside to dry in the sun.Cleaning the carrier will give it a neutral scent and may help it smell less like the vet’s office.;
, Leave the carrier’s door open so your cat can explore the carrier as it pleases. It is best to do this at least a week in advance so your cat has enough time to become comfortable with the carrier.For example, place the carrier near one of your cat’s sunning spots, like the window sill, or near your cat’s bed or favorite napping spot.

, This will help entice your cat to explore the carrier on its own. You can also place a piece of your cat’s bedding, like a blanket, in the carrier. If you don’t have a piece of bedding, put a piece of clothing that belongs to the cat’s favorite person in the carrier.Alternatively, rub a towel or cloth behind your cat’s ears and around its neck and face to pick up its scent. Place this inside the carrier.
The goal is to make the carrier comfortable enough for your cat to eat or sleep in.

, Once your cat starts going into the carrier on its own, start closing the door for a few seconds at a time. Once it is comfortable with the door being closed, begin driving short distances with your cat in the car.For example, begin by backing out and pulling up the driveway. When your cat is comfortable with this, then drive it around the block. This way, your cat may come to understand that the carrier and the car do not always mean a trip to the vet.

"
"
Look for sex-specific coat colors.,
Look for signs of a heat cycle (estrus).,
Check for strong-smelling urine.,
Evaluate the kitten’s build and facial features.",How to Determine the Sex of a Kitten2," The color of a kitten’s fur can give clues to its sex.


Certain colors, like calico (large patches of black, white, and orange) and tortoiseshell (marbled black, orange/brown, and sometimes white), are carried on the X chromosome and require two X chromosomes to appear. Thus, because females have two X chromosomes while male cats have only one, males cannot have these colors except in the case of a rare genetic disorder.
Orange tabby (striped) cats are more likely to be male.

, After about 6-10 months (and for some breeds as early as 4), most unspayed female kittens will begin to show signs of being “in heat” (scientifically referred to as being “in estrus”). A female cat may be in heat for between 2-19 days. The average cycle for a female cat that does not mate is about 8 days, but the cycle is often shorter for cats that do mate, as mating induces ovulation.A cat in heat will display certain telling behaviors, which, if they occur, may indicate the cat is female. These include:


Beginning to meow more loudly, harshly, and frequently. It will grow in intensity over time and may begin to sound like howling.
Showing a strong urge to go outdoors
Becoming extremely affectionate, even with inanimate objects
Showing “presenting” behavior, wherein a female cat rests on its front legs while hyper-extending the back and lifting its tail and rear end in the air.
Spraying urine

, When an unneutered male (tom) cat becomes sexually mature, he’ll often develop a habit of spraying strong-smelling urine.


A male cat may begin to spray outside the litter box, even if he’s normally well-trained.
The urine will have a strong, unmistakable smell that most find unpleasant.

, You likely won’t be able to distinguish noticeable differences in physical features until a cat is sexually mature. Once the cat is mature enough, though, there are particular features you can look for.


An unneutered male will tend to be lean and muscular, with thicker bones in the skull and jaw.
Unneutered males also commonly have what’s called a “stud tail.” A set of glands at the base of the tale secretes an excessive amount of an oily substance called sebum. This secretion can have telling effects on the area near the base of the tail, including greasy or matted hair; absent, thin, or patchy hair; blackheads; a rash or skin infection; and/or a foul smell.

Spray the carrier with pheromones.,
Place absorbent pads at the bottom.,
Position the carrier on its end.,
Pick your cat up under its front legs.,
Close and lock all doors.,
Remain calm.",How to Transport a Cat in a Carrier2," Pheromones or calming synthetic cat scents, like Feliway, are a great way to minimize any anxieties your cat may have about the carrier. Pheromone sprays produce a familiar smell that may help calm your cat. Spray the carrier 15 to 30 minutes before placing your cat inside of it., An absorbent pad (for cats or dogs) is a great way to keep your cat and car clean if it soils itself on the way to the vet. Also, place a familiar towel and other bedding in the carrier to make it comfortable and to help calm your cat.Alternatively, you can place newspaper and a towel at the bottom of the carrier if you don’t have absorbent pads on hand.

, Position the carrier so that the entrance is facing up towards the ceiling. This will help you lower your cat into the carrier. By lowering your cat into the carrier, you may be able to prevent it from panicking., Hold its hind legs with your other hand and arm, supporting its bottom. Then, begin to lower your cat into the carrier backwards, i.e., rear end first. This will help your cat feel like it is not being forced into the carrier.If your cat begins to panic at the sight of the carrier, then cover your cat’s body with a towel before picking it up. The towel will prevent your cat from using its arms and legs as a way to resist going into the carrier. It will also prevent scratching.

, Make sure all the carrier’s latches are secured. Once the carrier is secured, return it to its correct position. Then, place a light towel over the carrier. The towel offers a visual security that will help your cat feel safe and snug., If your cat begins to panic at any point during the process, remember to remain calm. Place the carrier close but out of sight. Then, calm your cat by petting it and talking to it in a soothing voice.Once your cat has relaxed, wrap it in a familiar towel and then place it quickly, but carefully, into the carrier.

Make sure the car is a comfortable temperature.,
Secure the carrier.,
Drive carefully.,
Minimize noise.",How to Transport a Cat in a Carrier3," Do not place your cat in a hot or cold car. Warm up the car (or cool it down) to a comfortable temperature before placing the carrier with your cat in the car.Never leave your cat in the car unattended for long periods of time.

, Secure the carrier by buckling it in, or by placing something heavy, like books, on top of it. Try to position the entrance of the carrier away from the direct flow of your car’s air vents.Alternatively, you can place the carrier on the floorboards of your car to secure it. This will also help reduce motion sickness.
Never place the carrier and your cat in the bed of a pickup truck.

, Drive the speed limit and try to avoid stopping and starting suddenly. Do not take sharp or fast turns, either. When approaching dips, holes, and bumps in the road, remember to slow down to avoid jolting the carrier and your cat., Either keep the stereo on a low volume or turn it off. Also, keep the windows rolled up to minimize the noise from drafts and other cars. If possible, try not to honk or yell while driving and do not slam the car door shut.Instead, talk to your cat in a soothing, quiet voice while driving, for example, “Every thing is ok Lola. We are almost there. You are being such a good girl.”

"
Decide if you want a rescue cat from an animal shelter or a purebred cat.,
Know that purebred animals are bred based on consumer demand.,
Check the neighborhood and newspapers.,
Know if the cat is long, medium or short-haired.,
Taking a cat that has been declawed, or declawing your cat, means that it can never be allowed outside.,
Know if the cat is male or female.,
Cats are super easy to house train.,
Pet the cat when it wants to be petted.,
Let the cat get used to your house.,
If you have another cat or cats, it is very important to bring the kitten in gradually.",How to Choose the Right Kitten for Your Home," Animals from rescue shelters are not free, they do charge an average of $70 - $110 dollars for the cat though some cost less. They also may require you to sign some sort of commitment paper. Taking a rescue animal is a wonderful idea, is cheaper than buying one from a breeder, but does come with risks. Animals are quarantined to determine if they come to the shelter with any illnesses, but sometimes you might take one home and it dies within days or weeks from an illness it had or caught from another animal in the shelter. There are no guarantees with rescue animals.;
, Certain cats are deemed more desirable as a marketable commodity and are are almost always bred specifically for sale. Make sure you find a reputable breeder and check out the cleanliness of the cattery to determine what environment the animal has lived in. Overcrowding and filth are definite warning flags, no matter how much they want for the animal. Some breeders charge more for animals that have not been spayed or neutered, in order to curb competition in the market.

, Some people with kittens are glad to give them away. This also gives you a chance to look at the parent of the kittens to see how large the cat will grow and about what it will look like. You might not get that benefit if you are getting an animal from a shelter. However, this kitten may have all kinds of parasites: fleas, worms, ear-mites.

, It will make a difference in how the cat looks, and how the cat sheds. The more the hair, the more the cat sheds. It might make shedding less of a problem if you pick a cat near the color of your carpet, couch, chairs, etc. A long-haired cat is much more prone to ""hairballs"" than a short-haired cat. Cats tend to clean themselves by brushing their fur with their tongue (which is textured to help in the process), and hair is ingested, builds up into a wad, and is regurgitated. This ""hairball"" looks like a wet hairy sausage. You can help by grooming the cat to help get rid of loose hair. The more you groom, the fewer the ""hairballs.""

, Cats need their claws in order to defend themselves in the wild as well as to catch food.

Please do your research when making the decision to declaw a cat/kitten. Declawing is in fact an amputation at the first joint on each ""finger"" of the cat. Declawing can cause many serious issues including litterbox aversion (pain in the paws when digging in the litter); arthritis, biting and scratching etc. Please consider training your kitten to a good solid scratch post instead of subjecting it to the mutilation of declawing.







, Both Male and Female cats will mark their territory by urinating in certain areas of the house. Spaying and neutering will block this behaviour, especially if done before the kitten reaches sexual maturity. If you get a cat from a rescue shelter, it will probably be neutered.

, Put a cat in a litter box once or twice, and it automatically knows where to go to the bathroom. Much, much, much easier to house train than a dog. This is because cats naturally use a specific spot, whereas that is not a dog's natural behavior.

, Leave it alone when it wants to be left alone. It is that easy. There is nothing better than having a cat jump in your lap and want to be cuddled! (However it usually takes about a year before a cat will trust you enough to sit in your lap for long periods of time.)

, When you first bring it home, it may hide, or run away from you (you should keep it indoors for about the first week, until it knows that you feed it.)

, Start by assigning just one room to the kitten, maybe a bathroom or bedroom. Keep the door closed, put a kitten-sized litter tray, food, and water in that room. The kitten will be fine in there. Give your other cat or cats much more attention, extra treats. They will absolutely know that kitten is in there, by the smell. They will smell and paw at the door, may hiss at it. This is fine. Cats who meet need to establish territory and boundaries. You don't want your cats to think the kitten is invading their territory, or you will have unhappy cats, who may start doing things to show their unhappiness! When you come out of the room where the kitten is, let your cats smell your hands, then pet them and give them a treat and attention. After two or three days of this, you can let your older cat into the room to check it out, under your supervision. When it sees the kitten, it will want to smell it, and may very well hiss at it. That's alright, pet your cat, say nice soothing things, tell your cat how important and primary they are. Don't make a fuss over the kitten when the cat can see, for the first few weeks. This is really important, that the cat feel still ""in charge"" in the home and primary to you. They will probably eventually relax and accept the kitten, but that's not for sure. Take it slow, this can become a beautiful relationship between them if you don't mess this up. Sometime, when the cat is asleep elsewhere, let the kitten out to explore the living room. For at least the first week, more if your cat acts upset, the kitten must stay in its room, particularly at night, especially if your cat claims your bed as its territory. With luck, your cat will start to accept the kitten as its younger sibling or its own kitten, they will play and wrestle and wash each other and become great friends. This is worth working for.

Learn her body language.,
Provide her with plenty of toys.,
Schedule regular playtime with your cat.,
Maintain a regular feeding schedule.,
Give your cat treats.,
Pet your cat.,
Have quiet interactions with your cat.,
Refrain from petting your cat on her belly.,
Do not force interactions with your cat.,
Do not yell at or physically punish your cat.",How to Get a Cat to Like You," As your cat gets more comfortable with you, she will demonstrate body language that shows she likes you. Understanding this body language will help you gauge how comfortable your cat is with you. For example, she may demonstrate head bunting, in which she will lower her head and rub the top her head against your head or other body part.This is a clear sign that your cat has affection for you.


Your cat has scent glands near her ears, so head bunting is a way for her to leave her scent on you.She may also rub her cheek against you to mark you with her scent.Marking you with her scent is one way of her communicating that she likes you.
To show you that she likes you, your cat may establish eye contact with you and softly blink. The eye contact demonstrates that she trusts you.Softly blinking back at her will show her that the trust is mutual.
Imitating some of your cat’s body language back to her, such as the head bunting and soft blinking, will deepen your bond with her and show her that you have affection for her.
Other examples of her affectionate body language include soft purring, kneading you with her front paws (“making biscuits”), sitting on your lap, and licking you.;
, Toys will keep your cat mentally and physically stimulated in your home. This type of environmental enrichment is a great way to get her to like you. Your cat may prefer certain toys to others, depending on her personality. For example, if she likes to chase things, she may enjoy toys that dangle from a pole.If you have an older and/or more sedate cat, she may prefer a toy that she does not have run or chase after, such as a catnip-filled toy that she can play with when laying down.Be sure to rotate the toys on a regular basis so that she does not become bored with her toy selection.If you do not want to spend a lot of money on toys, you can also turn common household items into toys for your cat. For example, empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls and paper bags with the handles removed can be fun for your cat to play with.Be mindful of toys that your cat should not play with—ribbons, strings, rubber bands—due to the potential of her swallowing them. Swallowing any of these toys could lead them to getting stuck in, and wrapped around, your cat's intestines. This would lead to serious medical problems requiring extensive veterinary care. These medical problems could be even fatal.
Also, be aware of toys that have smaller components, such as plastic eyes, that your cat could remove and potentially swallow.If you are unsure about which toys would work best for your cat, talk with your veterinarian or visit your local pet store for additional advice.

, Your cat is likely very independent and can probably entertain herself.However, she still needs to have regular interactions with you to bond with you and like you. Cats tend to be most active at dawn and dusk,so it would be good to schedule your playtime with her at these general times of day.


If your work schedule allows for it, schedule play sessions at dawn and dusk, with each session lasting 5 to 15 minutes. Keep in mind that older or overweight cats may not have the endurance for long play sessions.No matter what time of day you play with her, make sure that your playtime is at about the same time each day. This will give her something to look forward to, and will help you develop and maintain regular and positive bonding sessions with her., You may not realize it, but feeding your cat is an opportunity to bond with her. In addition, it is very important that your cat see you as her food source. For these reasons, it is preferable to feed your cat at specific times of day, rather than leaving food out for her all day.Ideally, the first ingredient of her food should be a protein, such as turkey or chicken.Because of the wide variety of cat food available at your grocery store and local pet store, consult with your veterinarian to determine which type of food would be best for your cat. Depending on your cat’s age and current health status, some foods may be better for her than others.
How often you feed your cat partially depends on her age. Kittens up to 6 months of age should be fed 3 times a day. Twice-daily feedings are good for cats who 6 months of age to 1 year old. Beyond 1 year of age, once-daily feedings should be sufficient.Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, can also influence how often you feed your cat.The amount to feed your cat will depend on several factors, such as her size, activity level, and age.Although there is no 'one size fits all' approach to how much to feed your cat, there are some general weight-based recommendations for dry food: 5 lbs (1/4 to 1/3 cup), 10 lbs (3/8 to 1/2 cup), and 15 lbs (1/2 to 3/4 cup).Consult with your veterinarian about the amount and type of food you should feed your cat at feeding time.

, Giving your cat the occasional treat can also be a good way to get your cat to like you. Treats should make up only a small part of your cat's diet (10 to 15% of her daily diet),since they provide little nutritional benefit. A helpful rule of thumb is to give your cat treats no more than 2 to 3 times per week.Cat treats are available at your local pet store and grocery store.
In general, do not treat your cat with human food. In fact, some human foods (e.g., grapes, onions, raisins) are toxic to your cat and should be avoided.Catnip is an excellent treat for cats.Treats are useful when rewarding her for good behavior.

, Petting is another great way to bond with your cat and get her to like you. Cats love to be petted near the areas of their scent glands: base of the chin, base of the ears, the cheeks behind the whiskers, and the base of the tail. Your cat actually derives enjoyment when she rubs these areas against you or your furniture to mark her territory. Similarly, she will love when you pet her in these areas.Keep in mind that your cat may not want to be petted all the time, or for long periods of time, even when she’s looking relaxed and content. If her body language tells you that she is overstimulated by petting (dilated pupils, fur twitches, tail wagging like a dog),or she tries to move away from you, give her some space to be alone. Let her dictate how much she is comfortable with you petting her.When you pet her, gently stroke your hand in the areas where she likes to be petted. You can even talk to her in a calm and soothing voice to make the experience more enjoyable for the both of you.
In addition to petting your cat, consider brushing and grooming her,if she will let you. Brushing and grooming are ways for you to learn the areas in which your cat likes, and does not like, to be touched.

, This is especially useful if you have a timid or anxious cat. Keeping your interactions quiet and calm will help her warm up to you and become more comfortable with you. Examples of quiet interactions include sitting quietly on the floor or reading a book on the couch when she is in the room with you., Knowing what your cat does not like will help you avoid doing the things that could jeopardize your bond with her. Unlike dogs, cats generally do not like belly rubs. In fact, if you try to rub her belly, she may instinctively react defensively by extending her claws and trying to bite you.In the wild, cats are aware that they can be predator and prey at the same time. The belly houses the most vital organs,so if you reach for her belly when she is unaware of your harmless intentions, her prey mentality might be triggered and she may do all she can to protect that area of her body.
When your cat is stretched out and showing her belly, she may feeling very relaxed and comfortable in her environment.However, she might be demonstrating defensive behavior.To be on the safe side, do not mistake the showing of her belly as your cat's invitation to rub her belly.Even though some cats may not mind their bellies being rubbed, it is best to avoid this area and pet your cat only in the areas where you know she enjoys being touched., As mentioned before, follow your cat’s lead when it comes to how much she wants to interact with you.Forcing her to play with you, or trying to pet her when she does not want be petted, will probably make your cat like you less. She may even become fearful of you because she does not trust that you will her respect her space.


Just as your cat can show you affectionate body language (e.g., purring, head bunting), she can also let you know when she's had enough and wants to be alone. For example, if she starts growling, hissing, or spitting, give her some space and alone time until she calms down.Your cat may also simply become physically tired from playing and will probably stop on her own.
Avoiding forced interactions is especially important if your cat is timid., Physically punishing your cat is not effective, since she will not be able to make a direct association between her behavior and your punishment. Instead, consider giving her a timeout, during which you simply leave the room without talking to her or interacting with her.Soon enough, she will realize that certain behaviors result in you not interacting with her (a negative result in her mind) and will discontinue those behaviors.Physically punishing your cat will likely make her fearful and wary of you.Rather than yelling at her, you can try giving her a firm ‘no’ in a stern voice when she demonstrates bad behavior."

Evaluate your lifestyle.,
Think about your flexibility.,
Consider the financial requirements for the animal’s healthcare.",How to Choose Between Purebred and Mixed Breed Cats1," Before buying or adopting a cat, it is important to think about your lifestyle, personality, and needs so you can select a cat that will fit in with you and your family. Consider how often you are away from home and what type of interaction you hope to have with your new pet.You may not be able to predict what qualities a mixed breed cat will have. Consider getting a mixed breed cat if your lifestyle is adaptable to the cat’s needs.
If you are gone for several hours each day or travel a lot for work, consider finding a breed that is independent.
If you wish to have an affectionate cat, consider researching breeds that are more likely to sit in your lap.;
, Your personality can help you decide if you would like a purebred or a mixed breed cat. If you want your cat to have particular, anticipated qualities, opt for a purebred cat. It is easier to predict the coat, color, pattern, and personality of certain breeds. If you are more flexible and are willing to watch your cat’s personality develop, consider getting a mixed breed whose traits are not predictable., Although it is impossible to determine what type of cat will be the healthiest throughout its lifespan, a mixed breed cat may be more likely than a purebred cat to have better health overall. This is because the mixed breed cat usually has a larger genetic background. A healthy cat may incur a yearly veterinary bill that ranges between $50 and $200 U.S. for routine care and check-ups.If you choose a purebred cat that is prone to developing diabetes, for example, that cost may increase due to more frequent visits to the veterinarian.


A diabetic cat may need to have a blood glucose test while visiting the clinic. That could increase your bill by $100 for each test.

Look for a sociable nature.,
Use treats.,
Put your cat’s bed next to you.,
Avoid forcing behavior.",How to Choose a Lap Cat," Some cats are finicky about their nap time. Some prefer to nap in a secluded area, while others enjoy napping with their owners. Choose a cat breed that is recognized for its propensity for an affectionate and docile nature. As they will probably make good lap cats.For example, Ragdoll cats and Ragamuffin cats are famously known to love being picked up and held by their owners. They make great lap cats.
Persians and Bombays are also very affectionate and loving toward their owners. This often translates to being a good lap cat.;
, Personality traits are often breed-specific. Spend some time researching behavior traits of various breeds – this will help you familiarize yourself with the qualities you find desirable. It will also help you choose a lap cat breed.

There are quite a few online sources that list various cat breeds and include pictures and personality traits of each breed. Try searching around on CatTime, the Cat Fanciers’ Association, or Animal Planet’s Cat Breed Directory.
For instance, Maine Coon cats are affectionate, but they typically prefer to be near their owners, rather than in their owners’ laps.

, These kinds of cats are typically a genetic mix between a domestic cat and a more wild feline counterpart – like the African serval or Asian leopard. Many exotic breeds of cats are more active, playful, and less likely to be cuddly nap buddies. An exotic cat will probably not make a very good lap cat.These breeds include Bengals, Savannah cats, Chausies, and Safari cats.

, If you want a good lap cat, you should avoid cats that are wild and have excessive amounts of energy. Look for a cat that enjoys playing calmly, but mostly seems to enjoy nap time with its owners.This also means you should look for a cat with a calm, approachable personality. If you choose a cat that seems skittish or scared, it is less likely that the cat will develop into a lap cat even over time.

, A good rule of thumb is that a cat who enjoys being picked up will typically make a good lap cat. If you meet a cat that you think might be the right one for you, try picking it up and see how it reacts.Of course, you should give the cat a little bit of time to get used to you first. Many cats are shy or nervous around new people.

, Older cats usually have lower energy levels than kittens and younger cats. This means that you are more likely to find a cat who is content to sit on your lap with you if you adopt an older cat.If you adopt an older cat, you’ll also be able to observe the cat’s personality right off the bat, whereas with kittens you have to wait for them to mature into their personality a bit.
You can usually find a variety of cats, including older ones, at your local animal shelter. Kittens and younger cats often get adopted first – so you should be able to find a large selection of older cats to choose from.

, Some cats prefer to be alone and spend most of their time lounging away from others. If you want a lap cat, you’ll need to choose a cat that enjoys the company of others. Sociable cats prefer to spend time with their owners during playtime and naptime, so a sociable cat will more likely enjoy napping on your lap.If your cat is not very sociable, it will probably want to spend its naptime in seclusion, away from you and other members of your household.

, If your cat seems hesitant to sit with you, try encouraging this behavior by rewarding your cat with tasty treats when it sits with you. This will help the cat learn to associate the positive experience (treats) with sitting in your lap, and the cat will be more likely to repeat the behavior.Be sure to use healthy treats that don’t cause your cat to gain an unhealthy amount of weight.
You should also eventually move away from giving treats every time and simply praising or petting your cat instead as a reward for sitting with you.

, If your cat likes to sleep on its own soft kitty bed, try moving the cat bed next to you on the couch when you’ll be sitting there for a prolonged period of time. This will encourage your cat to spend its naptime next to you and you can work on transitioning the cat out of the bed and onto your lap.Eventually, the cat will begin associating naptime with being next to you and it may start sleeping on your lap on its own over time.

, Cats do not respond well to forced actions. If you pick your cat up and restrain it on your lap with force, the cat will not like this. This kind of action will probably cause your cat to avoid getting in your lap at all, rather than encouraging it to do sit with you more.Instead of forcing your cat to do what you want, try using positive reinforcement with treats and praise to encourage the behavior you want.

You may also want to honor a deceased pet in naming your cat.Think about any traditions regarding your pet's names. Maybe all the pets in your family are named after TV characters. You can spend a few days observing your cat's behavior, and name him after a TV character with a similar personality.
You can pick a name that pairs well with an existing pet's name. If you, say, have a dog named Diego, why not name your kitten Frida?
You can also honor a lost pet with a new pet's name. If your first childhood pet was a cat named Cupcake, you could pick another bakery-themed name. You could name your cat something like Cookie, Pumpkin, or Muffin. You can also name the kitten after a lost pet of a different breed. For example, say you used to have a male horse who passed. You could name your kitten something like Colton.

Although each cat may not conform to the breed standards, responsibly bred cats typically won’t deviate far from their expected traits.If you would like a vocal cat, for example, opt for a Siamese or Siberian cat.
If having an affectionate cat is important to you, research breeds like the Persian, the Chartreux, or the Birman. These cats typically have affectionate personalities., In addition to having predictable personalities, purebred cats usually have a standard appearance. If you would like for your cat to have a certain look, consider researching the appearance of particular breeds to find a cat that is right for you. They usually have a specific coat length, pattern, and color.However, it is important to remember that not all purebred cats will conform to the expected appearance.If you prefer short-haired cats over long-haired cats, for example, a purebred Abyssinian or a Devon rex will most likely have short hair and may be a great option for you.Cats like the Egyptian mau and the ocicat typically have spotted fur.Consider getting one of these breeds if you wish to have a cat with an interesting coat.

, Buying a purebred cat can be costly, and the prices vary depending on the breed, its coat quality, and its color. A purebred cat from a reputable breeder can cost between $300 and $1,200.

Choose a shorter name.,
Opt for the right sounds.,
Refrain from choosing names that sound like commands.,
Pick a name that's appropriate to use in public.",How to Choose a Kitten Name2," It's easiest to give a cat a shorter name. This way, the cat will recognize the name easily. It will also be simpler for you to say when calling your cat. One to two syllables is ideal.If you love a name that's on the longer side, you could always use that name but use a shortened nickname when calling your cat.
For example, a cat named Harrison could be called Harry on occasion.

, Cats respond to particular sounds. You want your cat to be able to recognize its name. Therefore, choose sounds that are easily detectable to a cat's ears.Cats tend to respond well to the long ""ee"" sound. A name that ends in that sound may be a good option. For example, Molly, Daisy, Lucky, Charlie, etc.
Cats also respond to harder consonants. A name with ""K,"" ""D,"" or a ""T"" sound is easier for your cat to recognize. For example, try a name like Trudy, Tommy, Dusty, or Katie., If you intend to have your cat follow basic commands, do not choose a name that sounds like a command. This can be confusing for a growing kitten. For example, the name Sun may suit your cat's personality. However, it also sounds like ""come,"" so your cat may get confused coming when it's called.Kittens are rambunctious by nature, so be careful to avoid names that sound similar to words such as ""No,"" ""Down,"" and ""Off."" You'll likely need to use these words often. While a very fuzzy kitten may look like it should be named Puff, this sounds very similar to ""Off.""

, Make sure the name you choose doesn't have any negative connotations. You may need to use it in public, in places like the vet's office. You should also be careful not to pick a name that can be misheard. Be sure your name does not sound too similar to a curse word or negative word."

Remember your kitten will grow up.,
Think about potential changes to your kitten's appearance.,
Do not pick a name too similar to another pet's name.,
Keep potential nicknames in mind.",How to Choose a Kitten Name3," When selecting a name for a kitten, remember you will eventually have a full grown cat. Therefore, you want to pick a name that will age with the cat. A name like Baby may seem cute now, but your cat will not be a baby forever. Pick names that won't sound silly when your cat gets older., Some kittens change in appearance over time. This can sometimes be hard to predict. You can't, for example, know precisely how big a kitten will grow. Some kittens may change color over time as well. If you're picking a name based on your kitten's appearance, consider the likelihood of its appearance changing.You may want to avoid naming a kitten with a white coat based on its appearance. White coats are subject to change color with time.
You should also take size into consideration. Tiny may be the runt of its litter now, but could easily grow into a very large cat.
Also, think about the cat's voice. A very squeaky meow may inspire you to name your cat Mouse. However, cat's meows tend to deepen over time, especially in males.

, If you're drawn to similar types of names, this is particularly easy to do. It can get confusing if you have too many pets with similar names. This will make it difficult for your kitten to recognize its own name. If you have a dog named Addie, do not name your new kitten Maddie. If you love names that start with ""L,"" keep in mind that differentiating between Lucy and Lulu can be challenging for animals., If you name your cat something with an obvious nickname, chances are people will use it. Rather than exhausting yourself correcting people, opt for a name with nicknames you don't mind.For example, if you name your new kitten Maxine, people are bound to call it Max. If you name a kitten Rose, people will call it Rosie. If you dislike either of these nicknames, go with a different name.

Don’t choose a name before you get your cat, because it certainly is not a “one name fits all” situation. Some cats are very vocal and active, while others are quiet and lazy. Some want to be in your lap all day, while others may prefer its own space.Consider these traits while you are considering names.


The name Lord Paddington IV is an excellent name, but it may work best for a calm, reserved cat. The name Spazzy would be great for a hyperactive, silly cat.
Give your cat some time to acclimate to your home. It may seem timid and quiet at first, but really just be going through a period of adjustment.;
, While of course there is more to your precious cat than its physical appearance, it’s a great way to generate some unique potential names. If you can find one that describes its appearance while also fitting its personality, you’ve struck gold!


You may want to go with a dark, mysterious name like Midnight, Raven, or Shadow for a black cat, while an orange cat might make a perfect Ginger or Pumpkin. Longer haired, fluffy cats might make a great Fuzz or Puff.

, Learn a little bit about the history of its breed to come up with a unique (and informed!) name. For example, you could give your Persian cat a beautiful Persian name like Ali or Zahra.Because legend states that Birman cats are the “Sacred Cat of Burma,” you could brainstorm heavenly names like Goddess or Angel., A name that's cute or makes you laugh isn’t necessarily right for the creature you’ve just brought home. For example, a regal Siamese cat will not feel respected if you name them Poopsie, and in turn it will lose respect for you. A hairless cat will likely feel self-conscious and disrespected if you name it Fluffy. Consider your feline’s dignity when choosing its lifelong label.


Depression can occur in cats just as it does in humans. A depressed cat lose its appetite, avoids its owners, and becomes more sedentary. Don’t make your cat sad., Read it out loud. Which names flow off the tongue? Some names may seem more appealing on paper.Look at your cat while you read the potential names. Does your cat just look like one of the names? Get the opinions of family and friends. Sometimes you hear the ideal name and it just clicks. Other times, you will need to slowly eliminate your options one by one.


Remember, you’ll be saying this name a lot. Pick a name that you enjoy saying.
Contemplate the possible nicknames. You may love the name Benedict, but you'll likely start calling your kitty Ben or Benny for convenience. If you choose a long name for your cat, it helps when it’s easily shortened to a nickname.
On that note, keep in mind that cats do respond best to short names.Penelope is great, but Penny might be even better.

, This is a great way to find a name for your new cat. Think about your favorite movies, television shows, and books. Is there a superhero you've always idolized or a powerful heroine that you admire? What about that underrated minor character in your favorite novel? There is a wealth of special, meaningful names at your fingertips.

, For example, if you're getting a cat with your significant other think about where you had your first date, where you were married, or any other special memories you've made. If you honeymooned in Maui, why not name your cat Maui? If you're a flower lover, think about names like Daisy or Rose. You can honor your beloved mother by naming your cat after her birth month. Is your favorite song ""Sweet Caroline""? Perfect, that's a great name! Truly, your options are endless. Start brainstorming the things that are special to you, and run with it.Not only will you give your cat a name with love and originality, but you'll also have an interesting story to tell your guests when they ask you your cats name!

, Skim through the pages, read the meanings of names, and highlight the names that stick out to you. Once you've read through the book and highlighted your favorite names, put it away for awhile. Come back to it later with fresh eyes, and put a star next to your favorite highlighted names. These are the best of the best! Keep narrowing your list until you've only got two or three left. Give yourself some time to think about your top options, and whichever one you can't get out of your mind is the one you should choose.


Be original. When you’ve generated some options, think about how many people or animals you know with those names. Your cat’s name certainly doesn’t have to be revolutionary, but don’t you want to give it a name that’s as special as it is?

, It won’t give you an answer in English, but it might voice its approval through a purr, some body language, or through its sweet, feline eyes. Call to it in different names and see if any get a reaction. Cats are clever and strong-willed, and it should have some say in this important decision., Use it when you feed, pet, cuddle, and praise your cat. Help it learn its name by using it more than feels natural. Cats are very reward-motivated, so say its name while you give it treats.Cats are often very independent, so don’t feel discouraged if it doesn't always come when you call. It may just be playing hard-to-get.
Try to make sure that your cat has only positive associations with its name. Don’t yell its name when it's done something wrong, but sweetly say its name when it's done something right.

, If you have decided that its full name must be Sir William Fluffy-Butt but you know that you will often call it Willy, get it used to hearing Willy. If you alternate names every time you call it, it’ll likely be confused. If it's confused, it will probably start ignoring you all together. It’s not at all uncommon for a cat to give its human caretakers the cold shoulder, so help your odds by making sure it knows its name., This is the final, and most official, step in the naming process. It can wear its new jewelry with pride, and it is your cats official introduction to the world. Even better, this new identification can be used if your sweet feline family member gets lost. Its collar can help to bring it safely back home."

Consider whether or not the mother looks well.",How to Choose a Healthy Kitten," When you arrange to see the kitten, ask to see the mother and other kittens in the litter if you are looking at kittens in a private home, rather than at a rescue center. In addition to this, ask to see where the kitten was born and raised in order to get a sense of the living conditions the kitten has been kept in.


Take note if your kitten was raised in a run (an outdoor pen). Runs may lead to kittens that are poorly socialized, which means they may be shy or aggressive later on.;
, If the owner says it's not possible to see the mother, then say thanks but no thanks. In a domestic environment, or at a breeder's location, there should be no problem seeing the mother. If the vendor refuses, this may indicate that kitten farming has occurred.


Kitten farming is where kittens are bred at a different location—often in poor conditions—and then separated from their mothers at very early ages (usually before they are seven weeks old). This is a very immoral practice.

, If the kitten is located at a rescue center, ask to view the kitten in his living space (this will help to see if the kitten’s litter box is normal, which will be discussed in detail in Part 3).


You could also ask to visit the kitten when he is being fed in order to see what his appetite is like.

, If possible, visit the kitten when he is three to four weeks of age. If this is not possible for whatever reason, try to view the kitten at the earliest opportunity.


When a kitten is sociable and playful at a young age, it is unlikely that he will turn into an antisocial or aggressive cat later on.

, When you enter the room, watch to see what the kitten(s) are doing. A good sign of healthy kittens is to witness all of the kittens interacting with each other, even if this just means sleeping in a heap together. When the kitten is awake, ask yourself:


Is the kitten bold and does he confidently come to see you? This is a good measure of sociability and also eyesight and hearing.
Try dragging a toy in front of the kitten's eyeline. Does he follow it? Again, this is a good sign of healthy vision and an energetic personality.

, The ideal age for a kitten to go to a new home is around seven to nine weeks of age. Waiting until this age will allow the kitten to get adequate care from his mother. At the same time, try to get your kitten before he is 12 weeks old, as this is generally when the main age of socialization comes to an end.


The socialization period is the time between 2 to 12 weeks of age, when the kitten accepts what he sees and experiences as ""normal"".

, Kittens kept in isolation, such as pedigree cats bred and kept in outdoor runs, have a greater chance of being aggressive or stand-offish in later life. This is because those critical early weeks when they accept human company are spent in a concrete runs with little exposure to the sights, sounds, and smells of a domestic setting. Thus, a normal domestic situation is frightening or threatening to them and they do not readily accept human company.


This behavior, if it exists at 12 weeks, is often permanent for the rest of that cat's life.

, Kittens should be regularly handled, and subjected to household sights and sounds, from when they are about two weeks of age. Handling young kittens help them to adjust to family life. If a kitten has not been handled, he will have a harder time adjusting to life in his new home.


The peak period for socialization is 2 to 7 weeks, with a tailing off of learning between 7 and 12 weeks. A kitten kept in a run and rehomed at 7 weeks, stands some chance of adapting to a home, however it depends on the individual kitten and how adaptable their learning is.Thus, homing any kitten previously kept in a run may be a challenge.

, Good rescue centers have a socialization program in place that helps kittens get used to love and cuddles at an early age. Ask the rescue what their policy is, in order to reassure yourself.


From a behavioral point of view, try to get a kitten either from a domestic setting, or a good rescue center.

, Stroke him over the back and ribs. It is fine to feel individual ribs—which should feel similar to when you run a fingertip over the backs of your fingers—but he should not be skin and bones.


His ribs and backbone should not feel sharp or jagged. If this is the case, he is underweight. This could be because there is competition for food from his siblings, he is not very bold, or it could indicate he has parasites or a tummy upset

, Look for bright, dry eyes that are free from sticky discharges, and a clean, dry nose. Be wary of thick, sticky discharges from either his nose or his eyes, especially if the eyelids are glued together, or the nose is blocked with snot.This is a sign of an upper respiratory tract infection. Some infections are viral, such as the calici or herpes viruses that cause cat flu. These infections can remain with a cat for life.

, Look inside the ear. It should be a normal skin color, with no thick black waxy discharge. If a thick black waxy discharge is present this is a sign of either ear mites, otodectes, or a yeast infection.


While these conditions can be treated, it does mean the kitten's mother is likely to have an ear infection, and thus may not be in tip-top health.

, Use the fingertip of your right hand (if you are right handed) and press gently downwards on the tip of the kittens’ jaw in order to open the kittens mouth. Look at the roof of the mouth; check that there is a solid sheet of pink tissue, without a gap down the center.


If a gap is present, this means the kitten has a cleft palate. This condition usually requires surgery to repair the hole. This kitten is likely to suckle and have milk go down into his lungs, which causes a potentially life-threatening pneumonia.

, A kitten's gums should be a healthy pink color, much like our own. Pale gums or white gums are a sign of anemia. This can happen as a result of parasites, or a congenital problem with the kitten's bone marrow.

, Check that the kitten makes no noise as he breaths. Noisy breathing most commonly means that the kitten has a respiratory infection in his chest or nose. This condition requires veterinary attention.

, It a kitten has worms, one of the most common signs is that of the “potbelly”, a tightly swollen belly that hangs down off of the kitten’s body. These kittens are often very bony, but have a swollen belly. Parasites and worms can be treated with medications.


A normal tummy should be nicely rounded—but not tight—when full. The belly should look hollow when the kitten is due for a feeding.

, White ‘rice grain’-like objects around the anus are a sign of tapeworms. In a young kitten tapeworms are most commonly acquired from fleas, so it is a sign the kitten also has fleas.

, Check the litter tray for solid poop. Diarrhea is a sign of an upset tummy, and is not normal in a healthy kitten.

, A queen (mother cat) in good health is likely to have healthy kittens, whereas a mother cat that is sneezing, has a knotted coat, or is riddled with fleas, is unlikely to have healthy kittens.


The key questions to ask and things to look for in the mother include the following.

, Is the mother friendly? She may be wary about strangers looking at her babies, but does she seem otherwise relaxed? Look to see if she is nursing the kittens, rather than hissing and spitting when people enter the room.

, Keep an ear out for sneezing, and look to see if she has a runny nose or sticky eyes. A queen with a cold, or flu, will pass it on to her kittens. It is also a sign that she may not be vaccinated, since cat flu is part of the normal vaccination protocol.An unvaccinated mother has no immunity to pass on to her kittens and this makes them more vulnerable to infections, until they are vaccinated. Kittens can be vaccinated when they turn nine weeks old.

, Try to get a sneaky peek at the litter tray. Look for solid nuggets. If diarrhea is present this is a clue that either the mother or kittens have an upset tummy.


If the mother has an upset stomach it is more likely that they kittens will also have upset stomachs.

, Find out when the mother was last wormed. A queen that is wormed regularly is in better health than an unwormed cat, and thus more able to provide milk to her kittens. It is also a good sign that the owner is responsible and has the queen's welfare at heart, and is aware of the need for basic health care.


Likewise ask about flea control. A wise owner treats for fleas before and during pregnancy so that the kittens are born into a clean environment.

, Is the queen vaccinated and is she up-to-date with boosters? Again, a responsible owner will have the cat up-to-date with vaccinations. Not only does this protect the queen from diseases, but it also provides immunity to the kittens via the mother’s milk.


This immunity is important in the first weeks of the kittens’ lives before they get vaccinated.

, A nursing queen with a large litter will look scruffy and quite possibly on the thin side. She has her paws full because she is feeding, cleaning, and keeping a rowdy litter in order, and lacks time to clean herself. Also, when the kittens are three to four weeks old, the calories she expends producing milk, exceed the calories she can eat, and so it is normal for a good mother who is feeding her kittens to look thin.


However, is her coat clean, or is she riddled with fleas? If you don't see live fleas, brush the coat in the wrong direction with your fingertips and look for specks of black grit. This grit is likely to be flea dirt, which is a sign of a flea infestation.

Think about what kind of pet you actually want before you take the plunge, because some cats just won't be right for you.,
Look at the whole litter.,
Look for a playful and alert kitten, choose a kitten with clear eyes and a shiny coat.,
Play with the kitten.,
Look for the cat's reaction.,
Take your selected kitten home.",How to Choose a Kitten," If you wanted more of a sleek, graceful kitten that's more for show, then search more for this. But if you wanted an interactive, playful kitten search for them! Also choose if kitty is to be an indoor kitty (safer, but can be more boring for kitty - also enables chance of taking kitty for walks with you!), or an outdoor kitty (more dangerous for kitty; toxins, cars, roads, bad people, pound!, but can be more fun for kitty.), both are good choices, but be sure once settled on one, so as not to regret it in future!;
, This will enable you to determine the characteristics of each kitten.

, Ask about medical records and vaccinations.

, Make sure that he or she likes you.

, If the cat squirms, and tries to wriggle out of your grasp, let it go and carry on with your search - but be careful not to confuse this with the cat being scared of you, as earlier mentioned! But if the cat stays with you, and seemingly wants to play, then definitely put this cat on the consideration list. Do not go straight with this cat though, as there may be other cats even more suited to you!

, Be sure to schedule a checkup at your local vet clinic.

They may be carrying diseases or be susceptible to germs and bacteria that you've picked up. When you do pick up the kittens, pick them up carefully. Always check to make sure they feel warm, by seeing if the pads of their feet feel cold. Chances are, they'll start crying if they're cold.If you have other pets, make sure to keep them separate from the orphaned kittens for at least 2 weeks. Don't let them share litter boxes, food, or water bowls, since these could spread disease.;
, Neonatal kittens (under 2 weeks old) cannot regulate their body temperature and usually keep warm by snuggling up to the mother. Since they can't do this, get a heating pad designed for puppies or kittens. Place the kittens on the heating pad, making sure to avoid direct contact with the pad if there's no fleece cover on it. If there's no cover, wrap a towel around it.Kittens should never be directly exposed to the heating pad, since they may get localized burns or overheat.
You can also use a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel, but check it frequently to make sure it's still warm (around 100 degrees)., Place a box or cat carrier in a quiet, isolated part of your house. The room you put it in should be warm and draft-free, away from any other pets. Set a towel inside the box to make a cozy spot for the kittens to rest. You should also cover the box or carrier with a towel to keep it warm.Make sure not to cover air holes in the box or cat carrier to prevent suffocation., You don't need separate boxes or carriers for each kitten. Place them all in the same soft bedding spot. This will also help keep them warm and comforted. Ensure that there is enough room for the kittens to move around.


For instance, the kittens should be able to move to the edges of a heating pad if they're starting to overheat.

, Buy powdered cat milk replacer, like Cimicat, from the vet clinic, major pet stores, or the internet. This is the cat equivalent of infant formula, with the same composition milk from the kittens' mother. Do not feed cow's milk since the sugar, or lactose, will likely upset the kittens' stomachs.If you don't have milk replacement and the kittens are hungry, offer some boiled water that has been cooled. Use a dropper or syringe, until you can get to the vet clinic or pet store. The water keeps the kittens hydrated and won't cause upset stomachs., Sterilize the bottle and nipple in boiling water, then let them cool completely on a clean towel. Mix up the milk replacement formula using a little whisk to get the lumps out. You should warm the milk up to 95 - 100 degrees before feeding it to the kittens. As a final check, drip a few drops onto the underside of your wrist to make sure it's not too hot.Always make sure the kittens themselves are warm before feeding them. Never feed a kitten whose temperature is less than 95 degrees. This could cause aspiration pneumonia which makes it difficult to breathe and may even be fatal., Never hold a kitten and feed it like a human baby. Instead, keep the kitten's feet down and it's head straight, as though she's nursing from her mother. Hold her by the scruff of her neck and place the nipple into the side, then center of her mouth. The kitten will adjust it till it's comfortable for her.Let the kitten control the suction from the bottle. Don't squirt or force the milk into her mouth.Don't forget to burp the kittens after feeding. Burp the kittens like you would a human baby. Place a kitten on your chest, lap, or shoulder and gently rub and pat her back with 2 fingers until she burps.
If a kitten is having trouble latching on, hold the kitten's face and don't let her move her head. Try to feed her again and squirt just a few drops of milk out. She'll probably latch on., You'll be able to tell a kitten is hungry if she cries and wiggles around like she's hunting for a nipple. The kittens will feed every 2 - 3 hours around the clock during the first 2 weeks of life. It's best to use a kitten feeding bottle that has a specially designed kitten teat (made by Catac).Follow the guidelines on the package of milk replacer to determine how much to feed in each meal. A full kitten often falls asleep while suckling and has a rounded belly.In an emergency, use an eyedropper or a small syringe to drip milk into the kitten's mouth.
After 2 weeks, the feeds can be stretched out to to every 3 to 4 hours, with a gap of 6 hours overnight.

, Normally, the mother licks the kittens' genitals after each feed which causes them to pass feces and urine. Before and after each feed, you'll need to wipe the kitten's bottom with a cotton pad soaked in warm water. This stimulates the kitten to go to the toilet, which she cannot do without stimulation until she is a few weeks old.Place the kitten on a clean blanket and turn the kitten on its side. Use the moistened cotton pad to rub the genitals in one direction, not back and forth which could cause friction. You'll notice the kitten begin to urinate or defecate. Keep rubbing until the kitten stops or she may not completely eliminate.


The kittens' urine shouldn't smell and should be pale yellow in color. Feces should be yellowish brown. If you notice white or green feces, or dark urine that smells strongly, the kittens may be dehydrated or need medical attention., Once you've fed and helped the kittens eliminate, you'll need to clean them. Take a warm damp cloth and stroke the kittens' fur using short strokes. Be sure to towel dry the kittens until they're completely dry and place them back in their soft warm bedding.


If you notice dried feces are stuck on a kitten's fur, gently dip the kitten's bottom into a bowl of warm water. Then you can carefully wipe the loosened feces off with a cloth.

, Kittens should steadily gain weight throughout their first few months. Make sure to weigh each kitten at the same time every day and record their weights. Kittens usually double their weight one week after birth. They should keep gaining about half an ounce each day after the first week.If a kitten stops gaining weight, or is losing weight, there is something wrong and it may need to see a vet.


For example, kittens are usually born weighing around 3.0 - 3.7 ounces (90 - 110 grams). Around 2 weeks old, a kitten should weigh around 7 ounces. By 3 weeks old, the kitten should weigh about 10 ounces.

, It's a good idea to take the kittens to the vet as soon as possible to let the vet check for dehydration, worms, parasites, and assess their general health.Some veterinarians' offices may even offer a free visit if you tell them you're caring for rescued kittens. You should also know when to take young kittens to the vet for medical treatment. Take the kittens to the vet if you notice:


A high or low temperature (over 103 or under 99 degrees)
Lack of appetite (if a kitten hasn't eaten at all in a day, get emergency medical attention)
Vomiting (if it's constant, get emergency medical attention)
Weight loss
Coughing, sneezing, discharge from the eyes or nose
Diarrhea (if it's constant, get emergency medical attention)
Lack of energy
Bleeding of any kind (get emergency medical attention)
Difficulty breathing (get emergency medical attention)
Any trauma, like being hit by a car, dropped, limping, stepped on, unconscious (get emergency medical attention)

Make sure everyone in your home is ready to get a cat.,
Think about what kind of cat you want.,
Get the supplies you need.Before bringing a cat home, you’ll want to make sure you have everything it needs to adjust to its new home.,
Cat-proof your home.,
Plan to visit a veterinarian.,
Consider getting pet insurance.Pet insurance policies usually don’t cover routine shots (which owners should get anyway), but getting a policy can save you from worrying about being able to cover the costs if the cat ever becomes sick or injured.

,
Consider getting a cat from an animal shelter.Your local animal shelter probably has many excellent cats who are in need of a good home, and most animal societies will suggest this as the first place to start looking for a cat.,
Look for cats available from rescue groups.Much like animal shelters, cat rescue groups have many felines ready to find good homes.,
Research local pet stores.Some pet stores may sell kittens.,
Choose a reputable breeder if you want a purebred cat.If you are certain that you want a particular breed of cat, your best choice is a good breeder.,
Be wary of free kittens.It is often relatively easy to find offers of “free kittens” or “kittens free to a good home” online, on community bulletin boards, advertised in newspapers, etc.,
Inspect a kitten carefully before you buy it.Cats purchased from breeders should be in excellent health.,
Expect questions from an animal shelter or breeder.Before letting you take a cat home, good breeders or animal shelters will want to make sure that you are prepared to take care of it.",How to Buy a Cat," Everyone in your house might need to pitch in and help take care of the cat, so it’s a good idea to discuss your plan ahead of time.If you are trying to convince your parents or someone else to let you get a cat, let them know that you will be responsible for it, and that you have done your research on how to care for it.


Some cats can live fifteen-twenty years or more.Before getting a cat, make sure that you or your family is willing and able to commit to taking care of an animal for that long. For instance, if your parents let you get a cat as a kid, make sure you or someone will be able to take care of the cat if you move out later on.
Be prepared to spend time with your cat.Cats are relatively independent, and can stand to be alone for parts of the day. However, they still need lots of attention and play time, so make sure you and/or your family can commit.
Be prepared to cover the costs of having a cat. Aside from the upfront costs of buying a cat and the supplies it needs, you will need to supply food, treats, shelter, toys, and vet care throughout the cat’s life.;
, There are many different kinds of cats. Some people are interested in a particular breed, such as a Maine Coon, Abyssinian, Prussian Blue, Angora, or Siamese. Mixed breed cats, however, make wonderful pets as well. You should also consider whether you want to get a cat as a kitten or one that is older.If you are interested in a particular breed, research it before buying one. Each breed is unique in terms of looks and behavior. Many breeds have special needs and/or are prone to medical problems, so you will also want to be prepared for these concerns.
Mixed-breed cats may live healthier lives, and can make very friendly and loyal pets. They are also easier to find and far less expensive than pure-bred cats of a particular breed.
If you bring home a kitten, you will raise it and discover its behavior along the way. If you buy or adopt an older cat, you will have a better idea of its temperament from the start.

, Items you may need to take care of your cat include:


A litter box and litter
Food and water dishes
A supply of food and treats
A scratching post
Toys
A bed or other place for the cat to sleep
A brush to groom your cat
Nail clippers or caps
A collar and name tag

, Cats are curious creatures; to prevent yours from getting into something it shouldn’t, take steps to make your home safe before you buy the animal. For instance:Make sure there aren’t any electrical cords that your cat can easily reach and chew on.
Put cleaning products, poisons, and medications in a place your cat can’t reach.
Keep your cat away from any toxic houseplants.
Make sure your cat will have a quiet and safe place to rest.

, Once you have your cat, you will need to take it to a vet as soon as possible so that it can have its general health assessed, and receive any vaccines or other care it may need. If the cat is over four months old, it can also be neutered.You can find out about good vets in your area by asking animal shelters and other cat owners for recommendations, as well as researching them online.

,, Shelters usually have a large variety of cats to choose from, so they are a good option if you can’t decide beforehand which kind you want.


Animal shelters usually charge a small adoption fee as well as a fee to cover the cost of spaying/neutering and vaccinations.
You can also adopt an older cat from a shelter, if you want. That way you will already know something about its temperament—for example, if it is ready to live with children, how playful it is, if it is house trained, etc.
Many animal shelters allow you to preview available cats online ahead of time. Always see the cat in person before you decide to take it home, however.

, These groups place the cats in foster homes until permanent owners (such as you) can be found. You can look online to see if such a group is available in your area.


Cat rescue groups may charge a small adoption fee as well as a fee to cover the cost of spaying/neutering and vaccinations.

, Many, however, work with animal shelters to help rescued cats find new homes.


Some pet stores hold regular adoption fairs, connecting cats with potential owners. These are also opportunities to find out more about caring for cats, finding a good vet, etc.
In addition to the cost of the cat, pet stores may charge fees for spaying/neutering and vaccinations.
If you want to buy a purebred cat or kitten from a store, make sure that it is not from a “kitten mill” that practices irresponsible breeding. Make sure that you can find out who the cat’s breeder is and how the cat was cared for. Many pet stores may not sell purebred cats at all because cat associations prefer breeders to sell their felines directly.Pet stores focus on selling, so they may or may not not give you good information about caring for the the cat long-term.

, Do research on cat breeders in your area ahead of time. Your local animal association should have a list of reputable breeders.Be prepared to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a purebred cat.
Reputable breeders will be able to supply you with copies of pedigree papers and veterinarian records.These will show that the cat has been fully vaccinated and treated for worms and fleas.
Ask when the kitten was born, how old its mother is, and how many litters she has had.
Visit the place where the kitten was born, and make sure it is clean and safe, free from odors, and that there is room for the kittens to play and get exercise.
Breeders may ask you to spay/neuter the cat as a condition of ownership.Use good judgment: if any breeder does not want to share information with you, or if you see signs that the breeder is not taking good care of the cats, seek another one.

, These kittens may not have been to a vet, so even if one is initially “free,” you will still be paying for it if you want to take good care of the cat. If you take a free kitten home, have a vet inspect it as soon as possible to make sure it is good health, has any vaccinations it needs, and is ready to be spayed or neutered.

, Most cats offered for adoption at animal shelters or other locations are also in very good health. If you are willing to take care of an animal with a health problem, animal shelters will help you understand its needs. In all cases, you should see the cat before you agree to buy it and bring it home.


Gently feel the cat’s ribs. Healthy cats will have some fat covering them.
The kitten’s fur should be smooth and shiny, and its eyes and ears should be clean, with no signs of discharge.
Notice how the cat reacts to people; it should not hiss or back away from people. Good breeders will make sure that their kittens have good temperaments and are well-socialized. Animal shelters should be able to give you tips on a particular cat's behavior.

, Questions they might ask you include:


Do you have other animals? If so, how will they react to a new kitten?
How often will the kitten be left on its own, and for how long?
What kind of space will the animal have access to? How will it be protected from traffic, other animals, getting lost, etc.?
Who will be the kitten’s vet?
What are your plans if the kitten does not adjust to your home? (Good breeders, many pet stores, and some shelters will offer to take back a kitten within a certain time frame if things do not work out.)

Picking this breed does not guarantee that your cat and dog will get along, but it does increase the chances that this will occur. Some cat breeds that are known to get along with dogs include:Oriental
Burmese
Siamese
American ragdoll
American or British shorthair
Norwegian forest cat
Maine coon

, There are pros and cons for both getting a kitten and getting an older cat. In order to pick between the two, you should be aware of the pros and cons and make the choice of which age is best for you and your existing pets.A kitten will require more work on your part to take care of and raise. You will need to litter box train it and teach it the rules of the house. However, your existing pets may be more likely to accept, and even embrace, a kitten instead of an adult cat.
An adult cat will take less work to care for, as it is likely already litter trained and independent. However, it is less likely that the cat will be easily accepted into the fold by your other pets.

Take your existing pets' needs into consideration.,
Learn about a potential cat's history with other animals.,
Recognize that you will not be able to guarantee that your pets get along.,
Make sure you have the time, space, and means to support another pet.",How to Choose a Cat for a Multipet Household2," When bringing a new cat into your family, you should think about what type of cat might be best for your existing pets. While you may have your heart set on a certain age or sex of cat, it's more important to get one that is compatible with the pets you already have.For example, if you already have two female cats, you may want to get a male cat. It is more likely that a male cat will integrate into the family easily than another female cat would.
Also, if you have an older cat already, it may take to a young cat or kitten better than another older cat.

, If you are getting an adult cat you should learn as much as you can about it before bringing it home. Talk to the person giving you the cat or the staff at the rescue or store to get a little background on the cat. It is best to get a cat that has a history of living in multi-pet households, as it is more likely that they will adjust to your home.


If you are bringing a kitten into your home, then there will be little information available about its personality and behavior.

, The hardest part about choosing a new cat is that you will not be able to guarantee that it will ever bond with your other pets. Even if you pick a breed that typically gets along well with other animals, they may not get along. Even if the cat you pick has a history of living with other cats and dogs peacefully, every pet is different. There may be personality conflicts that you simply cannot predict.This means that you are always taking a little bit of a chance of conflict when bringing a new cat into your home.
That said, many cats can integrate nicely into already established multi-pet households. With time, patience, and realistic expectations, the odds are in your favor.

, When considering getting another pet, you should think about the added costs, in addition to thinking about how it will impact your existing pets. Not only will a new cat cost you more for care, for instance paying for its food and veterinary bills, but it will take up more space and it will require that you give more time and energy. Remember, if you take on too many pets, they could all suffer from your lack of time, space, or money.


Taking on a new pet is a huge responsibility, even if you already have other pets. Make sure you are ready for that responsibility before bringing a new cat home.

Keep the new cat isolated at first.,
Allow the old pets and the new cat to get used to each other.,
Make introductions.,
Go slow with preliminary meetings.",How to Choose a Cat for a Multipet Household3," No matter what cat you choose, when bringing a new cat into a multi-pet home you need to introduce it very gradually. Keep the new cat in a room that is completely closed off from the other animals before you introduce it to them face to face.Place food, water, a litter box, a place to hide away, and a new bed for the cat in the room before you bring it home.
Don't be surprised if the cat is scared and hides once it is placed in this room. Allow it to have some time to adjust to its new area.
Be sure to spend a lot of time in the room getting to know your new cat. This is a great time for you to begin bonding with your new pet.

, While keeping your new cat isolated, let your existing pets smell the cat from under a closed door and vice versa. Letting all of the pets get used to the smells of each other before they meet is a great first step towards integrating them together.The goal is to allow all of the pets, both the new cat and the old ones, to get used to each other gradually. There may be some interest in smelling each other, there may be growling, hissing, or clawing at the door, or they all may ignore each other's smells. All of these are perfectly reasonable reactions to the new situation.

, Allow the new cat and your existing pets to meet each other after they are used to the smell of each other. This introduction should be done at a time when your pets are content, occupied, or distracted, such as during feeding time.It is unlikely that the first face to face meeting between your new and old pets will be successful. Don't get discouraged if there is a lot of hissing and growling. Simply let the pets see each other face to face and then separate them again.

, After you have made an initial introduction, you should supervise interactions between your pets and keep the interactions brief. There is a greater chance of success if you remember to take every step slowly and allow the animals to get to know each other in a controlled and slow progression.Supervise interactions at first. Do not leave your new cat alone with your existing pets, as this could lead to a bad interaction and even injury.
Have realistic expectations. It is very unlikely that your new cat will instantly bond with your existing pets. Remember that new relationships take time and it's important to allow all the animals to get used to each other.

Store food in a dry and cool environment.,
Keep the food in the original bag.,
Place the bag in a sealed container.,
Do not store food on the ground.",How to Store Cat Food Properly1," Dry cat food should be stored in a cool and dry environment that does not exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). If the food is stored in a warm place, it could lead to the destruction of vitamins in the food and cause the food to go rancid.Do not store cat food in a garage because you can not control the environment. Depending on where you live the food may be exposed to heat and moisture in a garage.;
, Cat food will retain the flavor the best if it is stored in the original bag. This is because the bag has a fat barrier that helps to keep the flavor locked in. Plastic bags and containers have an odor that can impact the taste of the food.Always fold over the top of the bag once it has been opened to seal the food inside.
The original bag also contains important information about the food, including the expiration date, manufacturer and brand names, UPC code, and lot number. If the food is recalled you may need to consult this information., The best storage solution, is to place the original bag into a sealed container. For example, place your dry food bag into a metal or tin bin with a lid. This will keep the food fresh and will prevent infestations from occurring.If you decide to transfer the food to a metal container without retaining the bag, you should always keep the label and tape it to the outside of the container. This way you have all of the important product information.
Make sure you change the label every time you open a new bag of food.

, This will help to prevent infestations from insects or rodents that may be attracted to the smell of the food. Storing the food in a sealed cupboard will also prevent your cat or other pets in your home from accessing the bag of food."
"
Store unopened food in a dry and cool place.,
Discard wet food that has been unrefrigerated for four hours.,
Place opened food in the refrigerator.,
Refrigerate food in a sealed container.",How to Store Cat Food Properly2," Prior to opening, you should store canned cat food in a cool and dry place. A pantry is a perfect location for storing unopened canned cat food., Wet food should not be left in your cat’s bowl for more than four hours. If you feed your cat and it does not eat all of the wet food within four hours it should be discarded., Once you have opened wet cat food, you should store any unused food in the refrigerator. The temperature of the fridge should be approximately 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4-7.2 degrees Celsius). Opened cans can be kept in the fridge for 5-7 days. Any opened canned food that has not been consumed within seven days should be discarded., When storing opened canned food, you should transfer it into a glass container with a lid. This will help to keep the food fresh tasting. Alternatively, you can store the food in the original can, but place a plastic lid onto to the can to act as a seal.Some cats will not like eating cold food that has been refrigerated. As a result, you can heat the food slightly in the microwave before serving to your cat.

"
"
Examine the packaging.,
Check the expiration date.,
Purchase small packages of food.",How to Store Cat Food Properly3," When you are purchasing food for your cat, always choose a bag or can that does not have any visible damage. For example, avoided bags that have rips, tears or discoloration, and cans that have been dented. Damage to the bag could indicate that the food has been exposed and contaminated., Both dry and wet cat food will have an expiration date stamped on the original container. When purchasing cat food, you should always read the label to make sure that the food is not expired or soon to be expired. Make sure you refer back to this date before you feed your cat and discard any food that is past the expiry date.The expiration date is usually stamped on the bottom of canned foods and can be found on the bottom or side of bagged cat food.

, Once you open dry cat food, it should be consumed within four to six weeks. As a result, it is a good idea to buy your cat food in small bags. This will help to ensure that your cat is receiving fresh food.If you have multiple cats, you may want to consider a larger bag of cat food.

Talk with your vet.,
Purchase a prescription diet through your vet.,
Do not select a commercial diet.,
Talk with your vet about homemade diets.,
Introduce the new diet gradually.,
Feed only the limited ingredient diet.,
Feed the limited ingredient diet for at least eight weeks.,
Watch for improvement of symptoms.,
Decide whether to rechallenge.,
Rechallenge with one ingredient at a time.,
Watch for food allergy symptoms.,
Feed your cat a diet without the protein allergen.",How to Put Your Cat on a Limited Ingredient Diet," A limited ingredient diet has ingredients to which your cat is not allergic. For cats, this diet typically contains a novel protein, which is a protein your cat has not eaten before. Examples of potentially novel proteins are venison (deer) and kangaroo meat.When you talk with your vet, tell them the protein source in each food you have fed your cat. That way, your vet can recommend a diet with a novel protein for your cat.


Your vet will need to know all of the proteins your cat has eaten, not just the one in your cat’s current diet.
Novel proteins are not the same for all cats. For example, venison may be novel to one cat, but not to another cat.;
, Prescription limited ingredient diets are available through your vet. Most of these prescription diets are specially formulated to contain a novel protein. Some prescription diets, though, may contain a hydrolyzed non-novel protein instead. A hydrolyzed protein is broken down into parts that are too small for the immune system to detect.A hydrolyzed diet would be good if your cat has already eaten a variety of proteins.Prescription diets may also contain a novel carbohydrate source.However, because carbohydrates usually don’t cause food allergies in cats, a novel carbohydrate is not necessary.Prescription diets are more expensive than commercial diets. However, prescription diets are manufactured more carefully, meaning they are less likely to be contaminated with common protein sources., Commercial diets are those that you can purchase at a pet store without a prescription from your vet. Although commercial diets are less expensive than prescription diets, their ingredient labels are not as reliable—the company making the cat food may change the ingredients without actually changing the ingredient label.If the ingredients are changed, but the label stays the same, the commercial food could contain common protein sources that could worsen your cat’s food allergy.
Commercial cat food bags may be labeled with words like ‘natural’ or ‘organic.’ Do not be fooled by these terms—the food may still contain allergy-inducing proteins.If prescription diets are too expensive for you, your vet may be able to recommend a high-quality commercial limited ingredient diet.

, A homemade limited ingredient diet would allow you to know exactly what you are feeding to your cat.As with prescription or commercial diets, the homemade diet would contain a novel protein. Your vet would be able to recommend which protein to feed your cat. Purchase the protein source from your local grocery store.


Be aware that, if your cat is used to eating dry food, it may not want to eat pieces of real meat or fish.If your cat eats canned food, then switching to pieces of real meat or fish may not be a problem.
Making a homemade diet could be time consuming. If you do not have a lot of extra time, consider feeding your cat a prescription or high-quality commercial limited ingredient diet instead.
Because homemade diets may be missing important nutrients, they should not be fed for the long term.If you have a young cat, consult with your vet before feeding it a homemade limited ingredient diet. Your vet may recommend a prescription or commercial diet to ensure your cat gets all the nutrients it needs as it grows into an adult., Cats are very routine oriented. Suddenly changing your cat’s diet could be stressful to your cat. In addition, quickly changing the diet could upset your cat’s digestive system and make your cat sick. To ensure a smooth transition, take at least one week to switch your cat from its original food to the limited ingredient diet.To make the transition:Add a small amount of the new diet to the old diet.
Every few days, increase the amount of the new diet and lessen the amount of the old diet. Continue until your cat is eating only the new diet.
If your cat doesn’t seem to like the new diet, increase the amount of the new diet more slowly.

, This is very important! The only way to identify the allergy-inducing ingredient is to completely eliminate all allergy-inducing ingredients, then reintroduce them after the food allergy symptoms have improved. Once the transition period is complete, discontinue all treats, supplements, or flavored medications.Do not give your cat any table scraps.The flavored supplements or medications could contain the ingredient causing your cat’s food allergies.
Talk to your vet if you don’t know whether your cat’s supplements or medications are flavored. If your cat takes a flavored medication that it can’t do without (e.g., thyroid medication), ask your vet if there’s a non-flavored formulation of the medication.

, Your cat will need to be on the limited ingredient diet for at least eight weeks, but may need to be on it for up to about twelve weeks.Your vet will determine how long your cat should be on the diet. Eight weeks may seem like a long time, but it may take at least that long for your cat’s symptoms to improve.


If your cat’s symptoms are severe, the limited ingredient diet may not be enough to resolve them. If this is the case, your vet will prescribe a skin treatment (e.g., topical antibiotics) that you will use while your cat is on the diet., If your cat has a food allergy, its symptoms will start to improve as it eats the limited ingredient diet. You will see this improvement (less itching around head and neck) one to nine weeks after you start feeding the new diet.If there is some improvement, your vet may recommend feeding the diet for another few weeks to see how much the symptoms can improve. If symptoms don’t improve at all after about eight weeks, then a food allergy is unlikely.If the limited ingredient diet is not effective, you can discontinue feeding it to your cat. Your vet will test for other allergies to determine the cause of your cat’s itchiness.

, To rechallenge, you would feed your cat its old diet to see if the allergy symptoms come back. If they come back with the old diet, the rechallenge confirms the presence of a food allergy. Once the food allergy is confirmed, you would feed the limited ingredient diet again to make the symptoms go away.Since a rechallenge could cause a cat to become itchy all over again, some cat owners prefer to skip the rechallenge and keep their cat on the limited ingredient diet.
You may not want to make your cat itchy again. However, without the rechallenge, you would not know exactly which ingredient caused the allergy, making it difficult to figure out the ideal diet for your cat., To figure out which protein source caused the allergy, add back one ingredient at a time. Ingredients to add back include chicken, beef, and fish. Add one ingredient every two weeks, since it can take anywhere from two days to two weeks for allergy symptoms to reappear.You will likely need to use fresh meat for the rechallenge. Your vet can give you specific instructions on how much of the protein source to add back to the diet.

, Each time you add an individual ingredient back to your cat’s diet, observe your cat for itchiness around the head and neck.Whether the symptoms reappear will let you know which protein source is causing the allergy. Continue adding the ingredients until the symptoms reappear.

, Once you and your vet have identified which protein source is causing the food allergy, you can select a diet for your cat that does not have that protein source.If you can afford it, you could feed a prescription diet without that protein source. Or, your vet could recommend a high-quality commercial diet.


If you want to keep your cat on a homemade diet after the allergy-inducing ingredient has been identified, seek nutritional guidance from a veterinary nutritionist."
"
Look for the nutritional adequacy statement.,
Pay attention to the product name.,
Be aware of label claims.",How to Understand Cat Food Labels1," The nutritional adequacy statement will be located on the side or back of the product in small print. The presence of this statement means that the product meets standards approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). The statement will also claim which life stages the cat food is appropriate for like “maintenance,” “all life stages,” “growth,” or “gestation.” Look for these statements:“Cat Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profiles for all life stages.”
“Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that Cat Food provides complete and balanced nutrition for gestation.”
""CatFood provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance and is comparable to a product which has been substantiated using AAFCO feeding tests.” This statement is used for “family products”; products that are comparable (not identical) to ones that have been tested on animals.;
, Products that are labeled as “Chicken for Cats” or “Beef Cat Food” must contain at least 95 percent of the named meat (chicken or beef in this case), not including added water. The meat in the label should also be the first ingredient listed in the ingredient list. Products that are labeled as “Chicken Dinner for Cats,” “Salmon Entrée (Platter, Formula, or Nuggets) for Cats” are only required to contain 25 percent of the named meat. Products that contain the word “with” in the label are only required to contain 3 percent of the named meat, for example, “Cat Food with Salmon” or “Cat Food with Beef.”If a product contains two meats in the product name, like “Salmon and Tuna Cat Food,” the first meat in the name must make up a higher quantity, and the meats together must make up 95 percent (in this case) of the product.

, Products labeled as “gourmet,” “premium,” “ultra premium” or “super premium” are not required to have any higher quality ingredients than balanced or complete products. They are also not held to a higher nutritional standard than other balanced or complete products.Products labeled as “natural” only mean that they do not have any artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives; however, many cat food products do not contain these any way.
The label “organic” refers to the circumstances under which animals were raised and plants were grown. For example, to be considered organic, the meat used in the product must come from animals living in an environment mimicking their natural habitat and behaviors, fed 100 percent organic feed, and free of hormones and antibiotics.“Grain-free” does not necessarily mean low in carbohydrates. Many of these diets use peas, potatoes, or other starches in place of grain.The term “Holistic” does not currently have a generally accepted definition in the pet food industry, and does not represent any certain benefit to your cat."
"
Take note of the order of ingredients.,
Examine the ingredient names.,
Check the caloric content.,
Examine the feeding guidelines.",How to Understand Cat Food Labels2," The ingredients on the list are ordered in terms of their weight. Following this logic, the top ingredients make up a higher percentage of the cat food than the ingredients at the bottom of the list. However, there is a caveat. To disguise undesirable ingredients, manufacturers will break them up into smaller components. This way they can place them at the bottom of the list, when in fact they make up a higher percentage of the product than the named meat.For example, a manufacturer may break up the ingredient corn meal into smaller components such as corn bran, corn gluten, and ground corn. If you combine the percentages of the smaller components together, then they may make up a higher percentage of the food than the meat and other ingredients listed at the top do.

, Become familiar with the definitions of the ingredients listed on cat food labels. This way you can get an idea of what you are feeding your cat. Here are some common terms and their definitions:Meat: the clean flesh of slaughtered mammals such as cattle, chicken, lamb, and turkey. Flesh can mean heart, tongue, diaphragm, esophagus, striated skeletal muscle, sinew, overlying fat and skin, and blood vessels and nerves found within these pieces of flesh.
Meat by-products: the clean parts of slaughtered mammals (not including meat) such as kidney, brains, liver, blood bone, spleen, brain, fatty tissue, intestines and stomach. Meat by-products do not include horns, teeth, hair, or hooves.
Poultry by-products: the clean parts of slaughtered poultry such as feet, heads, kidney, liver, spleen, stomach, lungs, heart, and intestines.
Fish meal: the clean, undecomposed ground tissue of fish cuttings or whole fish.
Corn gluten meal: the by-products of manufactured corn syrup and starch, as well as the dry residue after the elimination of starch, germ, and bran.
BHA: a fat preservative.
Tocopherols: a naturally occurring compound, such as vitamin E, used as a preservative.

, Look to the caloric content to determine the amount of calories your cat will receive from a single serving of food.The caloric content must be listed as kilocalories per kilogram, as well as in familiar household terms such as “per can” or “per cup.” The caloric content of products varies greatly. Make sure to examine the caloric content to determine how much to feed your cat., The feeding guidelines often recommend feeding more than your cat needs and should be interpreted as general estimates. How much you feed your cat depends on its environment, temperament, age, activity level, and other factors. The product should state something like “feed one cup per six pounds of body weight daily.”Food labeled “for all life stages” should have specific feeding directions for maintenance, growth, and gestation.
If you are unsure how many calories you should be feeding your cat, ask your veterinarian and they will calculate it for you.

"
"
Look at the crude percentages.,
Calculate the percentages on a dry matter basis.,
Locate the percentage of moisture content.,
Divide percent protein by percent dry matter.",How to Understand Cat Food Labels3," These are typically located on the back or side of the packaging near the ingredients list under ""Guaranteed Analysis."" Crude protein, fat, and fiber, as well as the moisture content are the basic nutritional guarantees required by the AAFCO for pet food.The term “crude” refers not to the quality of the nutrients themselves, but to the exact method of testing the product.

, You must do this in order to compare the percentages of protein, fat, and fiber per pound of food for different food brands. You cannot compare foods on their crude percentages alone; this is misleading.Dry matter refers to the mass of the food when it is completely dried. It includes carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
This will also help you determine if you are getting your money’s worth per pound of food.

, By locating the moisture content percentage, you can determine the dry matter percentage. For example, if a dry food contains 15 percent moisture, then 85 percent of the food is dry matter.On the other hand, if a canned food contains 85 percent moisture, then 15 percent of the food is dry matter.

, If the product contains 25 percent protein, then divide 25 by 85. This equals .29 or 29 percent. Therefore, for every pound of food, 29 percent of the food is protein. Use this calculation to compare different food brands’ protein, fat, and fiber content.Use this same method to calculate the percentages of fat and fiber as well.
Remember that these percentages do not refer to the quality of the protein, fat, and fiber. Therefore, a brand may have more protein, but you need to examine the ingredient list to determine the quality of the protein.

Talk to your vet about the right food and supplements.,
Blend food at room temperature.,
Insert food into the tube with a syringe.,
Feed your cat slowly.,
Flush the tube when you're done.,
Do not hesitate to go to your vet with questions.",How to Tube Feed a Cat1," Every cat is different. Depending on your cat's health condition, your vet will suggest different types of food and supplements. Make sure you follow your vet's recommendations regarding your cat's diet. Ask any questions you have at the vet's office and feel free to call the vet if you have questions when you get home.You should know the type of food to use, the amount to feed your cat each day, and how much to feed at a time. Tube fed cats are not fed meals all at once.
Your vet can also give you general advice on how to get your cat to cooperate. Vets have vast experience dealing with stressed animals, so your vet's guidance regarding getting your cat to behave is invaluable.;
, Food should be served at room temperature. Prior to blending the food to serve to your cat, make sure it is at roughly room temperature. If you can store food out in the open, do so. If food must be refrigerated first, leave it out for an hour or so prior to feeding. Use a blender or food processor to get the food into a spreadable consistency that flows easily., To tube feed a cat, you feed the food into the tube through a syringe. Your vet should provide you with a syringe or advise you where to purchase one. Draw the correct amount of food from the syringe and then feed it into your cat's feeding tube.You usually measure the food first. Most syringes have measurements on the side you can use. You can also measure out the food first using measuring cups and then draw it into the syringe.

, Do not simply dump the full contents of the syringe into the feeding tube. Press down on the syringe slowly. Allow the food to flow through the tube and into your cat a little bit at a time. If food is moving slowly, you may want to pause and wait for it to go through the tube before pushing the remaining food into the tube., It's important to keep the tube clean for your cat's well-being. After feeding is done, flush out the tube with a small amount of water. Make sure you remove any lingering traces of food from the tube.If any food is clogging the tube, place a small amount of soda or juice in the tube. This should flush out lingering food.

, Tube feeding is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. Most people can successfully tube feed their cats at home. However, if tube feeding becomes a problem for your cat, contact your vet. They should be able to help you troubleshoot any problems.If you're really struggling with tube feeding, see if you can schedule a time to come into the office and have your vet show you how to tube feed. Going through a tutorial with your vet can help you learn how to tube feed successfully.

Feed your cat several times throughout the day.,
Pick a feeding spot.,
Keep everything in a tray near the feeding spot.,
Manage the fur near the tube.",How to Tube Feed a Cat2," Cats do not receive all their daily food at once with tube feeding. Food is administered in small amounts throughout the day. Make sure you know how much food to feed your cat and at what intervals to feed it. The timeframe and amounts of food depend on your cat's specific condition, so talk this over with your vet., Having a regular feeding spot can make tube feeding go smoother for you and your cat. Choose a spot in your home to tube feed. Ideally, your feeding spot should be somewhere where you can sit comfortably at your cat's level and tube feed.Think about your cat's comfort as well. Pick a spot that is quiet and put something down, like a blanket or bed, to keep your cat comfortable during the process.

, Having your supplies consistently prepared can make tube feeding go smoother. Set out a tray near your feeding spot with the necessary supplies for tube feeding. Have your syringes ready, as well as a cup of water for flushing the tube. If your cat's food can be left out in the open, keep blended food near the feeding spot. Also, have any measuring cups or other devices you use to measure food out near the spot.It's a good idea to have paper towels on hand to manage any mess.

, If possible, keep the fur around the feeding tube shaved to allow yourself easy access. You should also wipe up any food or debris from the area around the tube after cleaning. Talk to your vet about special wipes to clean the area around the tube.If you notice any rashes on your cat, they may be having an allergic reaction to cleaning wipes. Take them to the vet to get antibiotic ointment to treat the rash.

"
"
Keep extra supplies on hand.,
Make sure you have a quality blender.,
Comfort your cat if they're frightened during feeding times.,
Consult your veterinarian if you notice physical reactions.",How to Tube Feed a Cat3," There is always a chance something will get lost during syringe feeding. Have extra syringes and caps on hand. The cap to a tube should be kept on when not feeding, but it's not uncommon for caps to fall off. Due to their small size, they can be difficult to locate. Make sure to get a few extra caps from your vet's office., It's important to blend the food so it flows easily into the feeding tube. If your food remains solid and chunky, purchase a higher quality blender. Tube feeding will not be successful if you cannot get the food to the right consistency.Ask your vet for blender recommendations.

, Cats may become agitated or frightened during tube feeding. If this occurs with your cat, comfort them during the process. Strive to stay calm yourself during feeding, as your cat can pick up on your fear. Feed them in a quiet location and pet and talk to them during the process.Allow your cat space after tube feeding to calm down. You can let your cat go somewhere in the home and hide until they feel better.

, Complications with tube feeding are rare. However, the site near the tube may become infected. If you notice signs of an infection, such as reddish skin or discharge, contact your vet for treatment.In addition to treating an infection, your vet may be able to provide advice on how to prevent one in the future.

Appreciate the purpose of scratching or clawing.,
Be patient and be understanding.,
Purchase at least one scratching post (or other scratching apparatus) for your cat.,
Locate scratching posts strategically.,
Train your cat to use the scratching post.,
Adjust the position and type of the scratching post as needed.",How to Stop a Cat from Clawing Furniture1," A cat doesn't scratch to give you grief. A cat scratches because it's a form of exercise for the cat's muscles from the claws right through to the legs, shoulders, and down the back.In addition, scratching also sharpens the cat's claws and cleans the exterior sheath.


Cats also scratch to scent-mark territorial areas with their paws, which have scent glands usually indistinguishable to humans, but very distinct to other cats, dogs, and many other pets and animals.;
, You love your cat and the precious bond both of you share. Cats know when you care and will reciprocate. They will do their best to please their human companions, provided they know they're supported and praised.


Over time, with repeated loving practice, your cat should become used to leaving the furniture alone and using alternatives for their scratching.

, A scratching post is the answer to your scratching problem, but it will take time to encourage your cat to use it.


When purchasing the scratching post, there are some things to consider initially. Look for one that is at least as tall as your cat when he/she stands on his/her hind legs. Ensure that it is sturdy and cannot wobble when pressure is applied to it by your cat. Make sure that the scratching post isn't heavy and tall, or it may fall on your cat.
Scratching boards and posts come in different sizes and uses. Some are flat on the floor and some are raised. Some are made of hemp. Try different types. It is better to have too many around, than not enough.
Some cats prefer to scratch on a horizontal surface like the carpet. Orientate the scratch post horizontally or vertically to match their preference and they will be more likely to use it. There are cardboard, sisal, and carpet based options for horizontal surfaced scratching. Whatever you choose, avoid anything fluffy. A cat's scratching post must be like tree bark (their natural scratching element), rough and coarse.Posts with sisal fiber rope wound around them are best, and the scratchier it is, the less inviting your heirloom needlework pieces will seem.

, Figure out which pieces of furniture the cat has clawed and their locations. Make sure the scratching apparatus is prominently featured in the room and next to any furniture the cat seems to prefer scratching.


If you have just gotten a cat, place the post where it might be likely that a new cat would try to scratch.
If the cat is marking and scratching in multiple areas, create “good” scratching opportunities in each of those areas. It's a really good idea to have more than one scratching post, especially if you have upstairs and downstairs areas, your house is large, or you have more than one cat. This will lessen the probability that your cat will resort to furniture in other rooms without scratching posts.
If your cat is always scratching the chair you sit in most, locate a scratching post near it. You could also leave a piece of your laundry on the top of the scratching post for a while, or use its top tray as a drop spot for personal items, so that your cat sees it as part of your territorial marker, like your favorite chair. This is especially relevant if your cat is extremely attached to one person in the household. Putting the scratching post or cat tree in close contact with their favorite sofa or chair can make it even more enticing.

, Condition your kitten or cat to use the scratching post and nothing else for scratching. Encourage your cat to unleash his claws on the new scratching post by gently placing him in front of it. At the same time, gently stroke him and wait for him to respond to the post in front of him.


If you want to make the post more inviting, rub catnip or spray catnip oil onto the post.Every time your cat uses the scratching post, offer it praise and give it a pat and a treat.Some suggest that you encourage your cat by gently placing his front paws onto the post and even moving the paws up and down on it, but warn that many cats hate being forced to do anything and this can have a very negative effect.Alternatively, you could even ""show"" your cat how to scratch using your own fingernails.
You can also dangle a toy over the scratching post so that it bangs against the post. This should draw your cat's attention to the pole; In swiping at the toy, he or she may discover the joy of scratching the pole behind it.
Another method of conditioning your cat to like their scratching post is to withhold your greeting upon returning home until you reach the scratching post. Stand at the post and scratch it with your nails, telling your cat how happy you are to see them. When they come near the post and start clawing it, stop scratching it yourself and start stroking the cat while they scratches the post, all the while praising them for being such a good cat., Feel free to move the post around a bit if your cat is not paying attention to it. Don't try to force the cat to like it as it is, instead personalize the post to your cat's likes.


For instance, if you notice your cat exhibiting nervousness or dislike of the scratching post, try tilting it onto its side. This will make it smaller and less threatening while the cat gets used to it.Cats develop preferences for scratching surfaces or substrates. Use the surface your cat prefers. This may be sisal rope, carpeting, cardboard, or drapery fabric or something else entirely. Transitioning your cat to a new scratching post or surface will be much more successful if you work with your cat’s tendencies, not against them.

Syringe feeding
Tube feeding
Appetite-stimulating drugs;
, Anorexia is a symptom of a wide variety of health problems and it is not typically a stand alone disease in cats. Your veterinarian should tell you what they think the underlying problem is and you should discuss with them why they think that. Some possible illnesses that could cause anorexia include:


Diabetes
Kidney disease
Hepatic lipidosis
Hyperthyroidism
Pancreatitis
Conjunctivitis
Asthma
A fever


, Your veterinarian will suggest a course of treatment designed to treat its underlying illness. The treatments your veterinarian may suggest vary widely due to the varied causes of anorexia.


Treatments may include medications, such as treating a cat's diabetes with insulin. They may also include surgical treatments, such as removing infected teeth that are causing your cat not to eat.In some cases your veterinarian will not be able to find a physical cause of the cat's anorexia. In these cases, they usually diagnose the problem as psychological and suggest behavioral treatment.

, If the veterinarian is able to identify your cat's underlying condition, it's important that you continue treatment at home. Follow your veterinarian's directions and give any medications as they have been prescribed, for as long as they have been prescribed.The type of medication and length of giving it to your cat varies depending on what your cat's underlying illness is.

, If your cat continues to refuse food even after treatment for its underlying illness has begun, then you may need to takes steps to make it eat. The easiest way to get a cat to eat is to give it an appetite-stimulating drug. However, this does not always work. In some serious cases, your cat may also need to be fed through an implanted feeding tube or force fed until its appetite recovers.Force feeding a cat can be traumatizing to a cat and make it even more resistant to food. A feeding tube is considered a better option for cats that refuse to eat.
Whatever your cat is willing to eat, give it to them. This may be a special treat that you use to train them or a little bit of tuna leftover from your lunch. Basically, if an anorexic can shows interest in any food, give it to them.

, While your cat is recovering from anorexia it is important to make its food as fresh and appealing as possible. Never expect the cat to eat food that has been sitting for a long time and make sure that all food dishes are clean and tidy.


If your cat won't eat its usual food, you can try to feed it a higher quality food. However, you don't want to change the cat's food too abruptly, as this can cause digestive health problems.

, Healthy cats tend to eat a similar amount of food every day, so if your cat begins to eat less, you should take not of that. If your cat has a dramatic drop in how much it eats, this can signal a health or behavioral problem. This means that it is important that you don't just ignore changes in appetite.


With this in mind, it is important to keep track of how much your cat is eating on a daily basis so that you can identify when the cat's appetite changes.

, If your cat is not eating, that behavior is likely associated with a specific medical, dental, or behavioral problem. Make note of any other changes to your cat's routine or body, whether or not you think they are related to the anorexia.


Identifying other symptoms can help a veterinarian diagnose the underlying problem with your cat.

, Call your veterinary office and let them know about the problem with your cat's appetite. Schedule an appointment for that day or the next so that your cat's health can be assessed promptly.


If your cat has not eaten anything for over 24 hours, as opposed to simply eating less than normal, then that is an emergency and it should be seen by a veterinarian immediately., When you bring your cat in for evaluation, be ready to tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms. You should have a general idea of when the anorexia started and whether your cat has any other symptoms that might be related.When you tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms and how long they have been going on, the vet will be able to better assess the seriousness of the cat's health problems.

, Once the veterinarian has discussed your cat's symptoms with you, they will likely do an exam on it. They will visually assess the cat and feel its body for abnormalities or problems. They will then likely do a variety of tests to find the cause of your cat's anorexia, including lab work and imaging.You may be asked to hold your cat still or keep it calm while the exam is happening. Your supportive presence can do a lot to help your cat get through a veterinary exam.

Slow down your cat's eating.,
Limit water intake right after a meal.,
Manage hairballs.,
Differentiate between vomiting and regurgitation.",How to Treat Feline Regurgitation1," If your cat really loves its food or has to rush to eat to get food before other cats in the house, then it may be eating too quickly. This quick eating can then lead to regurgitating if your cat can't digest all the food. In order to stop this, you should feed your cat slowly. This can be done by either giving it smaller meals more often or feeding it with a puzzle feeder that makes the cat eat slowly.If you feed your cat dry food, you can spread the food out over an area of floor and force your cat to move around to get it. This will slow the eating down.
Keep other cats away while the regurgitating cat is eating. This will allow the regurgitating cat to relax and eat more slowly.;
, If your cat likes to go straight to its water bowl after a meal and gulp down lots of water, this can cause regurgitation. Instead, you should remove the cat's bowl while it eats and replace it with fresh water when it has had a chance to digest its food a bit, usually within an hour.

It is important that your cat always has access to fresh, clean water. However, it will not hurt your cat if its water is limited for an hour or so., Some cats regurgitate hairballs regularly, which can be a messy and potentially dangerous situation. If your cat regurgitates one hairball every week or two, that is not usually a reason for concern over your cat's health. However, if hairballs show up more frequently, your cat should be treated. In most cases, hairballs can be minimized by regular grooming of your cat and feeding a hairball remedy weekly.Discuss your cat's hairballs with its veterinarian and get suggestions from them about appropriate treatments.

, Regurgitation is different from vomiting, and thus has different causes and treatments. With this in mind, it's important to be able to tell one from the other. In general, vomiting is an active action that involves the cat's entire body seizing. Regurgitation, on the other hand, is a passive process in which the cat lowers its head and then food simply slides out of the esophagus easily and unexpectedly.Vomit usually consists of partially digested food and stomach bile, which is typically yellow. Regurgitation usually consists of undigested food that never got all the way into the stomach and mucus.
Regurgitated food is also often in tube form, as it was sitting in the esophagus before being expelled.
It is more common for cats to vomit than to regurgitate.

Use your tone of voice to correct their behavior.,
Use water to stop your cat's bad behavior.,
Redirect your cat's attention.",How to Stop a Cat from Clawing Furniture2," A sharp ""NO!"" whenever your cat goes anywhere near a clawed piece of furniture can help to reduce his interest in clawing it.Be aware, however, that the cat may only learn not to scratch when you are present, and may continue to scratch in your absence since they link the punishment directly to you.


Another way to curb clawing is to toss a can of pebbles or pennies to land near the cat (do not throw it at them) to startle them. Try not to let the cat see that you threw it. This way, it appears triggered by the scratching, and has nothing to do with you. That way the cat is less likely to scratch when you are away, because they don't associate you directly with the punishment.
Then, pick them up and place them next to the scratching pole as a means of conditioning.
Don't sound angry or go into a nasty tirade against your cat; remember they are simply following instincts and you're the higher-level being with the ability to control your emotional outburst.
Never scold your cat when they are near or using the scratching post. They need to associate the scratching post with all things pleasant and happy.

, If you have a spray bottle of water, you could try squirting your cat whenever they go near the furniture and start scratching it.Aim to do this before they start scratching but if not, squirt mid-scratch. This won't hurt the cat but it will help them to associate scratching that piece of furniture with a less-than-pleasant spritz of water!


Again, this can also cause the cat to link your presence to getting sprayed, so they may do their scratching when you are not there.
You can also use a citrus oil mix to deter your cat. Some cats are repelled by the scent of orange oil. Mix equal parts, about a cap-full each, of eucalyptus oil and orange oil in a spray bottle of water. You can test this on your cat by putting a small amount on a damp cloth and present it close to their nose. You will need to shake the contents before each use as the oil and water will separate after a short time. Using this method not only helps to deter your cat from destroying furniture or walls, but gives your house a pleasant and fragrant odor as well.

, Sometimes you will just need to physically stop the cat from scratching. Remove them from where they are scratching and give them something else to do. Try giving them a toy to play with or petting them for awhile, whatever they enjoy more than scratching.

Cover problem furniture.,
Consider creating a deterrent to certain areas with the help of a motion detector attached to a spray or ultrasonic noise.,
Shut doors to rooms with very special furniture, furnishings, and objects.",How to Stop a Cat from Clawing Furniture3," Some pieces just seem to get marked for special scratching treatment because they feel just right to your cat. In this case, there are several options you can try:


Apply double-sided tape to the furniture.Cats dislike the sticky feeling and won't continue to stick their claws wherever it's sticky, as the hairless skin of the cat's paws is extremely sensitive to touch.For larger furniture, adhere masking tape over the arms, or on the back of the furniture where the cat will often enjoy playing (and hiding from water spritzing).
For a larger area, such as a rug or carpet, leave contact sheets sticky side up over the surface you want to protect.You can also buy a product called ""Sticky Paws,"" which are medical grade adhesive sticky strips that can go on curtains, drapes, carpets, and anything else that might be a bit too tempting for your cat.Use the “knobby” side of a plastic or vinyl floor runner along the back of the couch to deter scratching. The cat won’t like the feel of the pointy knobs on their feet.
For cats who seem to live it up when you're at work or away from home, cover the furniture in plastic covers. Cats are not fond of walking over plastic because of its smell and feel.You could also try placing blown-up balloons hidden underneath a sheet covering the furniture which will burst when clawed, causing the cat a fright that will be associated with that piece of furniture long after the balloon has popped.Also consider using a “Scat mat” to deter cats from certain surfaces and areas.

, It is generally recommended to correct your cat remotely so that they do not associate the negative correction with you or other humans. Otherwise, you will create fear in the cat toward humans and likely train the cat to scratch in secret.


These products can be found online at various retailers.

, If you have antiques or furniture that is of great value, consider leaving it in a cat-free zone. Ensure that everyone in the family is aware that the cats must not be let into that area or room and always keep doors to these areas closed. Ask the humans in the house to take care rather than expecting the cat to know the difference between important furniture and less important furniture.


If the cat does wander in, shoo him out abruptly so that he associates it with being ""out of bounds.""

"
Keep your cat's claws neatly trimmed.,
Use plastic caps to cover your cat’s nails.,
Allow your cat some outside time where possible.,
Consider the downsides and alternatives to declawing your cat before having it done.",How to Stop a Cat from Clawing Furniture4," Since part of the reason for scratching is to sharpen and even shorten claw growth, you can help out with a regular, careful trim of your cat's claws.


If you don't know how to clip a cat's claws, ask your vet to show you how to do this the first time, as it is easy to hurt the cat badly if you don't what you're doing.A cat that is not used to claw clipping can be a little bothered by it initially but you need to persevere until they are comfortable with it. Again, praise your cat while your are trimming their claws so that they know you are caring.
It is useful to ""blunt"" the tips of the claws of an indoor cat that never has access to outdoor trees. You can do this with toenail clippers (never use claw clippers made for dogs) but you must know the correct cutting line to avoid injuring the cat. Ask your veterinarian or a groomer to show you this for the first time., “Soft Paws” glued to your cat’s nails will prevent the cat from damaging surfaces because the cap covers the sharp nail. You can glue these on yourself, or have your veterinarian do it for you. These caps will eventually fall off in three to six weeks and need to be reapplied.

, If your cat is already able to go in and out of the house, it is highly likely that they have found themselves a tree or two to scratch on. Encourage this (unless it's harming the tree) and continue to let them have appropriate outside time, as using nature for a scratching post will definitely reduce their desire to use your furniture as one.

, Declawing can be a quick and easy way to prevent furniture damage, however, it is a surgery, and like all medical procedures, comes with risks.


While it is still legal to declaw a cat in most (but not all) cities in the United States and Canada, there are some ethical considerations. Declawing is considered to be an act of cruelty, and is thus illegal in Europe and other countries. A significant proportion of cats having undergone declawing refuse to use the cat litter, develop aggressive behaviours (mainly biting and hissing), and show signs of intense stress and fear. It also makes them more vulnerable to predators, and does not allow them to stretch properly anymore. Do your research and make sure that you understand all that you need to know in order to make the decision to amputate the ends of your cat’s toes.The declawing procedure involves amputating the digit at the last joint of your cat’s front paws. Talk to your veterinarian if you think declawing is your choice. Some cats do fine but others suffer from chronic pain and, later, arthritis.Note that if you have a cat that goes outdoors, declawing their front paws may affect their ability to climb and defend themselves.Check the adoption or purchase contract for your cat. Some rescue groups and adoption agencies have “no declaw” clauses in the contract you signed to have your cat live in your home.

Take your cat to a veterinarian.,
Tell the veterinarian about your cat's symptoms.,
Allow the veterinarian to do a thorough exam.",How to Treat Feline Regurgitation2," If your cat is repeatedly regurgitating, take it to be seen by a veterinarian. Regurgitation once in awhile, for instance once a month, is usually not cause for concern. However, if your cat has hairballs more often than that, then you should get it checked out.When you make an appointment for your cat to be seen you should tell the vet what the issue is and how long the symptoms have been occurring.

, When your veterinarian is trying to figure out what it wrong with your cat, they will first need to figure out whether your cat is regurgitating or vomiting. Your details about the cat's symptoms can help them to do this, as it is rare that the cat will regurgitate on command for them to witness.In order for the veterinarian to differentiate between vomiting and regurgitation, you may want to take a video of your cat while it is having an episode. Showing your veterinarian exactly what is going on will help them immensely with their diagnosis.

, When figuring out what is wrong with your cat, your veterinarian will need to run tests and assess its physical health. The vet will likely give your cat an overall physical assessment by looking at and feeling the cat's body. Then they will run tests on your cat. These will vary but they will usually include a variety of blood tests.With the information you give the vet and the information they get from their assessment and tests, they should be able to give you an accurate diagnosis.

Treat problems with the esophagus.,
Give your cat anti-regurgitation medication.,
Treat related illnesses.",How to Treat Feline Regurgitation3," The most common medical cause of regurgitation in cats is a disease or problem with the function of the esophagus. If your veterinarian finds that your cat has an obstruction or malformation in its esophagus, then they will suggest treatment options for your pet.Common causes of regurgitation associated with the esophagus include foreign body obstruction, strictures, vascular abnormalities, or tumors.
Tumors will likely need to be treated with surgery.
Antibiotics can be used to clear up some abnormalities that are caused by infections.

, There are some medications that can be given to cats that will reduce their regurgitation. Your veterinarian may prescribe one for your cat. Remember, however, that these medications will treat the symptoms but will not eliminate the underlying cause of the regurgitation.Medications that can by prescribed include cimetidine or any other anti-emetic drug that is approved for use in cats.

, When your cat regurgitates, it is possible that it will inhale some of the food and liquid into its lungs. If that happens, it could cause the cat to get a cough or even pneumonia. If your cat does develop a cough or pneumonia, these problems should be treated by a veterinarian.Treatment for pneumonia in cats usually includes giving it a broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal or antiviral drugs. Additionally, your cat may need supportive care in for the form of oxygen, fluids, and nebulization, which keeps the lungs moist."

Consider your cat’s age.,
Consider your cat’s health.,
Adjust meals if your cat is throwing up.,
Watch for signs your cat is overweight or underweight.",How to Plan a Feeding Schedule for Your Cat1," How often you feed your cat depends, in part, on its age. Kittens need to be fed more frequently than adult cats, for example, because they are growing and expending a lot of energy. Use the following guidelines to determine how many times a day to feed your cat:


Kittens up to six months of age should be fed three times a day.
From six months old to about one year old, you should feed your cat twice a day.
Adult cats (one year or older) and senior cats can be fed either once or twice a day. Feeding your cat once a day is fine as long as it is healthy and doesn’t have any diseases that require a different feeding schedule.;
, Some cats may develop health problems that require you feed them at certain times during the day. For example, if your cat has diabetes, you may need to feed it when you give it medication. For these situations, it is best to consult with your veterinarian on how often you should feed your cat.


If your cat does have a disease, treat the disease first before changing its feeding schedule. If the disease is treatable, you should be able to return to a normal feeding schedule once your cat is healthy., Regurgitating before or after a meal can be a sign that your cat is either getting too hungry in between meals or is eating too much at once. If you notice these symptoms in your cat, try feeding it small meals more often throughout the day—possibly up to four times a day. Doing so will help keep your cat fuller throughout the day and allow it to eat smaller meals more frequently, both of which should help diffuse its need to regurgitate.A ""slow feeder"" or timed feeder that emits food in small increments will also help cats that eat too rapidly.
It is recommended that cats eat between 24 to 35 calories per day per pound (roughly 13 calories per kilogram), so split this amount up between the total number of feedings to make sure you’re not overfeeding your cat.If you change your cat’s feeding schedule, but it is still regurgitating consistently, take your cat to the vet to get checked out.

, You can consult with your veterinarian if you’re not sure whether or not your cat’s weight is ideal, or use a visual ""body scoring system"" for cats:Body score 1/5 (very underweight): cannot feel any fat, can see and feel hip bones and lower vertebrae, ribs visible for short-haired cats
2/5 (underweight): can easily feel ribs with minimal fat covering, visible lower vertebrae, visible waist behind ribs
3/5 (normal): can feel ribs with slight fat covering, waist visible behind ribs
4/5 (overweight): ribs difficult to feel due to fat, obviously rounded abdomen affecting waist shape
5/5 (very overweight): cannot feel ribs, no narrowing waist behind ribs, heavy fat deposits on lower back, face, and limbs.
Talk to your vet about dietary changes before trying anything extreme. A rapid weight loss diet can cause fatty liver disease in cats.

React calmly.,

Figure out if your cat is stressed or anxious.,
Decide if the cat is simply being overly playful.,
Check to see if your cat is sick or in pain.",How to Stop a Cat from Biting and Scratching," Never hit, shout, chase, or lose your temper with a cat. You will simply terrify the cat and cause it to become nervous and confused.


Never call a cat to you and then punish it. The cat hasn't got a clue why you're responding negatively to him. In fact, the cat probably expects a pleasant response if you call it.;
, The first thing to do is stop touching the cat and then hold your hands well out of striking range. If he doesn't calm down within a few seconds, stand up slowly so you can remove him from your lap. Walk away and do not return until he has calmed down.


Avoid soothing your cat after biting or scratching. Instead, signal your displeasure to the cat. After you've disciplined it, do not begin cuddling and petting him. This will confuse your cat and give him mixed signals. It may even begin biting you in order to get a cuddle.

, If you are trying to get from one room to another and a hissing, snarling cat blocks the way, look at the situation from his viewpoint. The cat believes he is trapped and you are walking towards him, which he perceives as a threat. He wants to run but there is no escape route so he must defend himself by attacking. The simple solution is to step aside, let the cat pass (which he will do at speed) and then go about your way.Don't feed your cat for 20 minutes following a biting or scratching incident, as this might be wrongly taken as a reward.

, Cats respond best to positive reinforcement, namely praising and rewarding appropriate behavior, while ignoring and withdrawing from inappropriate behavior.


Hand the cat a catnip mouse to bite instead of you. Then, praise the cat for biting the toy.

, As soon as the cat bites or scratches, say ""NO!"" in an authoritative tone. At the same time, point your finger at the cat. Stare at the cat directly with an unimpressed or fierce look. Stares are regarded in the cat world as a threat of dominance.


It also helps to remove yourself from the cat's vicinity after doing this, or to ignore him for about 10 minutes.

, When your cat bites or scratches, clap your hands and say ""NO!"" firmly. Remember, don't shout at your cat or clap directly in your cat's face. It can scare him and leave him nervous. Repeat this whenever biting or scratching occurs. Your cat should learn to stop.


This method works with a dominant, aggressive or cheeky cat. It's not recommended for use with a timid or nervous cat, since it can reinforce these traits.

, The moment your cat stops biting or scratching you, stand up and walk away in a dismissive fashion without any further interaction. Make sure that the cat is all alone in the room with no human interaction for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat this each time he tries to bite or scratch you. He will quickly associate the bad behavior with being ignored.


This method won't work with all cats, but works well with very affectionate cats, since they'll miss the attention, and with kittens, since they're still learning manners.

, Learn to play act. When he gives you a nip while playing, let out a loud squeal and pull your hand away. Then, stand up and walk away, signalling the game is over. If you do this consistently, the young kitten will soon learn that biting ends the game and will avoid doing so.If your cat is giving you love bites and you want to discourage this, press back gently against the bite. Pressing back makes it uncomfortable for the cat, so he/she will stop biting down. Pulling away fast from a play bite or grab is when you're most likely to get clawed from playing rough.

, A cat in middle of playing often forgets to be gentle and you may get a painful scratch or the cat will continue to play later, scratching you unexpectedly. To prevent this, provide toys that are clearly not part of you, such as fishing toys on strings, a laser-light pointer, or a catnip mouse.Cats need to bite, chew and scratch for fun and practice, just not on you or any other human. Try playing with the cat using a fishing pole toy, so your hands will be free of bites.

, Build regular play sessions of 5 to 10 minutes into your day. Get the cat moving after a fishing toy and continue playing until the cat is worn out.


The idea is to mentally stimulate your cat with chasing behavior and physically wear it out. A tired cat is a lot less likely to attack than a bored cat with excess misdirected energy., Cats that are not neutered are more territorial than their neutered counterparts. While being entire (or not neutered) doesn't automatically mean a cat is aggressive, neutering does have a calming effect and tends to make the cat more sociable and home-loving., Watch for clues like dilated pupils, skin rippling, or ceasing to purr. The cat may vocalise and give a low, throaty growl, or a quiet, ululating, whine, or hiss. He might tip his ears back and flatten them against his head. Its whiskers may bristle forward and he may draw back the corners of his mouth and open his mouth slightly (often while hissing).A cat that is playing will also have large round pupils, because he is excited. Take this into account when considering the cat's other body language - so a cat on your lap should not be excited and not have large pupils.
If the cat is cornered, he may often crouch and look anxiously from side to side, as if seeking an escape route (which is what he is doing)., These cats often grow into adults who seem to lash out viciously for no reason.Hand-reared cats that are aggressive usually give subtle signs for humans to back off. Learning these cues can prevent biting and scratching.

, A cat that is stressed and has no escape route is likely to lash out. Stress can come from being cornered by a noisy toddler, change in environment, or new people, so obviously it is important to be aware of your cat's emotional needs and reactions. Avoid labeling the cat as aggressive; it may simply be responding to stress.The best response is to restore calm and a settled atmosphere. Turn down noisy TVs, ask children to be quieter around the cat, and if anyone is upset, ask them to cry or shout out of the cat's hearing.

, If you encourage the cat to attack moving hands, feet, or fingers when playing, don't be surprised if the cat later attacks a foot, even though the game is over. The cat may assume it's still play time., A cat that is in pain or is ill can become defensive making it more likely to attack. Cats showing signs of sickness (losing weight, thirstier, vomiting) or pain (short-tempered, yowling, scratching, biting) should be checked out by a vet. It could be their bad behavior will improve once the underlying health issue is corrected.An older frailer cat that may resent being picked up or cuddled and might bite or scratch to get some peace. Ask family members to be mindful of the cat's age and need for gentler handling. Giving the cat plenty of space should help any behavior issues.

Put a golf ball in the middle of your cat’s food bowl.,
Use a food bowl with a built in lump in the middle.,
Buy an automatic feeder.",How to Slow Down a Cat Who Eats Too Fast1," To ensure your cat takes her time when she eats, pour her dry food on a flat surface, like a plate or a baking pan. This will force her to eat only a few pieces of dry food at a time and take smaller bites of her food.;
, You can make or buy a puzzle feeder for your cat, which has the added bonus of providing mental stimulation. Your cat will need to work to get her food from the puzzle. This will prevent her from binge eating as the food will be dispensed in small amounts. You can purchase a puzzle feeder or make one by gluing cardboard tubes together in a grid and putting a few kibbles in each tube.One such feeder is a plastic ball with holes. You can put dry food inside the ball, and your cat can then play and try to eat the food as it falls through the holes. This will prevent her from binge eating and encourage her to use her hunting skills to get her meals., This will make your cat eat more slowly because she cannot simply scarf down her food. Instead, she has to practice lapping up her food slowly and swallowing before she can take another bite., An obstruction, like a golf ball or a ping pong ball, can force your cat to slow down when she eats as she will need to pause while eating to move the obstruction or eat around the obstruction.


Make sure you use an object that your cat cannot swallow, like a golf ball or a ping pong ball.

, Many pet stores sell food bowls made for cats and dogs that have one big lump in the middle or several small lumps. These food bowls will help your cat get used to eating more slowly and to take smaller bites of food., An automatic feeder is set up so that as an owner you have control over how much your cat eats with the simple press of a button. Many feeders can be set on digital timers so you know exactly how much food your cat is getting at one time. There are also measurements on the feeder to help you determine how much food your cat will receive and to prevent over or under feeding your cat.You can set the feeder so your cat receives smaller portions of food throughout the day, which will help you cat slow down when she eats and prevent her from eating too fast.

If your mornings are hectic trying to get ready for work and get the kids ready for school, it may be better to feed your cat in the afternoon or evening. If you’re feeding your cat two or three times a day, pick the times that are easiest for you and do your best to stick to this schedule.It might help you remember to feed your cat at the same time every day if you stick to a ritual. For example, put food out when you are waiting for your coffee to brew every morning, or feed your cat as soon as you get home from work in the evening.

, Remember, your cat will get used to the schedule you choose and may “remind” you when it’s meal time. For example, if you feed your cat around 7a.m. every Monday through Friday morning, don’t be surprised if your cat wakes you up on the weekends at this time as well. Your cat will become accustomed to the feeding schedule you set and will expect to be fed promptly.

, Each cat is different, so your cat might prefer to be fed at a different time than your friend’s cat. For example, if you notice your cat doesn’t eat its morning meal, but seems to beg for more food before bedtime, try switching up your cat’s feeding schedule to accommodate its preferences.


However, if your cat’s preferences make it difficult for you to maintain a consistent feeding schedule, it might be better to stick to the schedule that works best for you."

Search for missing patches of fur.,
Look at your cat’s skin.,
Check your cat’s claws.,
Watch your cat’s grooming habits.,
Weigh your cat.,
Check your cat’s gums.",How to Spot Signs of Nutritional Deficiency in Cats1," Look over your cat for signs of missing fur. One of the first symptoms of malnutrition in cats is loss of fur, so bald spots signal that your cat may be missing something from its diet.If you’ve found a stray cat or adopted a cat, also check for dark fur patches. When a cat loses fur due to nutritional deficiency, it grows back darker. This can help you better understand your new cat’s health history.
Even if it’s not a nutritional deficiency, it’s important that you get to the bottom of what’s causing your cat’s missing fur.;
, While you’re petting your cat, part its fur to see if the skin is dry and scaly. Be sure to look at the skin all over your cat’s body, not just in one spot because it may have isolated patches of dry, scaly skin, especially if your cat is just starting to develop a nutritional deficiency., Cats with nutritional deficiencies may have caved in or concave claws, meaning that the claws will look hollow in the center. Hold your cat and gently press on its paw to push out its claws.Be careful not to hurt or stress your cat while you’re trying to check its claws.
Be cautious when checking claws because you may get scratched. Consider wearing gloves to protect yourself.
If your cat is a stray, you may want to hold off on checking its claws because it’s more likely to scratch you, and you don’t know its health history.

, Cats with nutritional deficiencies will stop and reduce their grooming. If your cat is no longer licking its fur or has crusty patches because it hasn’t cleaned itself, then something is likely wrong., A nutritional deficiency is often linked to being underweight, so check to see if your cat has lost weight or falls under the healthy weight recommendation for its age and size.If you can’t weigh your cat, see if you can see and feel its ribs and joints. It’s normal to be able to feel the outline of a cat’s ribs, but if they’re pronounced and noticeable then the cat is likely underweight.

, Use your finger to gently open your cat’s mouth and check its gums for swelling. Swollen gums will look puffy and red.Be careful not to put your finger all the way in its mouth because your cat may bite you.
Try wearing gloves.
If your cat is a stray, allow your vet and the trained technicians to check your new cat’s gums. They will want to check its teeth also, since stray cats can have damaged or broken teeth that require care.

Cover surfaces you want to keep cats off with aluminum foil.,
Use cat repellent scents.,
Use water.,
Don't make loud sounds to punish the cat.,
Provide alternative spaces.",How to Repel Cats1," If your cat is constantly scratching at a couch, or won't quit leaving a layer of fur on the back of a chair, an easy and effective technique can be to line the surface with a sheet of aluminum foil. The sound and the texture of the foil is undesirable for the cat, and they'll usually avoid it. You can always remove the foil when you're using the chair or company is coming over.


Some cat owners have also reported success using strips of masking tape on the arms of couches or pillows to create a strange texture the cats won't like. Sticky side up or down, it can be an effective repellent.
It's also effective to use scented repellents on small sheets or pieces of foil to make the cat less attracted to the area. These scents are discussed in the following step.;
, Citrus-scented cleaners are the most effective at keeping cats off of surfaces, so citrus cleaners are great to use on counter tops, around appliances, and gently on furniture and other places in your home where you do not want your cats to go.


Lemongrass, lavender, and coleus are other natural cat-repellent scents. Try tossing lavender and citrus peels in small bowls and place them on shelves next to breakable items, or other places where you do not want your cats to go. Add essential oils in those same scents to increase the smell, if necessary. Spray lavender or citrus fabric fresheners on rugs to keep cats out of certain rooms in the house. You can also use these sprays on other soft surfaces, such as curtains and bed spreads, to deter cats from those places.
Commercial cat repellents are often made from fox urine, or the waste of other predators. It's probably not something you want to spray indoors, but the use of repellent is discussed in the following method.

, If your cat won't stay off your fern, or keeps climbing up and messing with the couch she always claws, use a little water to flick onto the cat. You can keep a small glass of water close by to the place you're trying to repel the cat from, dip your finger in, and flick some water around to discourage the cat.


Better yet, buy a couple small toy squirt-guns and hide them at strategic places around the house so you'll always have an armament close by. When you use it, aim at the cat's body. Avoid its face, as a strong stream might actually hurt the cat's eyes or nose.
Do it calmly, without raising your voice. It should be the water that the cat associates with the location, and the discomfort, not your presence or your voice., Clicking spoons together, snapping your fingers, or yelling are not effective ways at getting your cat to stay off of surfaces or objects. You'll get the results you want in the short term–the cat will run away and hide somewhere, probably. Long-term, though, cats will come to react that way whenever they hear the sound of your raised voice, two things clicking, or snapping sounds. You'll be training your cat to be skittish, but not to avoid the object you want avoided.

, Is it any wonder your cat wants to curl up on your super-soft comforter and take a nap? If you want to keep your cat off your bed, you need to provide a comfortable and equally-inviting sleeping alternative for the cat. Not all cats like to sleep in beds, but little spaces with furry warm blankets are inviting and pleasant. Prepare a box with an old blanket, and sprinkle a little catnip in there to make it more enticing.


If your cat is scratching furniture, it's absolutely essential that you get a scratching post and tend to the cat's nails regularly. Cats with their claws must regularly scratch things, so you need to provide them a surface to dig into.
It's also a good idea to make surfaces you want the cat to avoid as difficult to get to as possible. Cats are obviously sneaky jumpers and creepers, so this can be difficult, but trying to remove jumping surfaces and other objects the cat uses to perch on can help to keep them off high surfaces and difficult-to-reach spots.

Feed your cat smaller portions of food more often.,
Provide more than one feeding station in a multi cat household.,
Bring your cat to the vet if she continues to eat too fast and appears undernourished.",How to Slow Down a Cat Who Eats Too Fast2," If your cat eats too fast and vomits up her food or starts to show signs of digestive issues like bloating, you may want to adjust her feeding schedule. Instead of three big meals a day, try feeding your cat smaller portions five to six times a day for one to two weeks.


After one to two weeks, check to see if the new feeding schedule forces her to slow down when she eats. Smaller portions throughout the day will also help her digest her food properly and maintain an appetite for her next meal.
You can also put food in smaller dishes throughout your home so your cat has to move around to eat more food. This will make her treat feeding time more like a “hunt”, where she is mentally and physically stimulated, and force her to pace herself as she eats., If you have more than one cat at home, you may have an issue where one cat bullies another cat and eats the other cat’s food, or one cat hogs all the food when it comes time to eat. Avoid these issues by setting up more than one feeding station in your home, ideally in separate rooms or different areas of your home. This will force your cats to spread out when they eat and provide enough space for each cat to get enough food.Using multiple feeding stations along with smaller portions throughout the day for all the cats can help your cats slow down when they eat.

, If you try several of these steps and your cat still eats too fast but does not appear to be putting on any weight or cannot satisfy her appetite, your cat may have a medical issue that needs to be addressed. Take your cat to your vet for a checkup to ensure her overeating or fast eating are not a sign of a medical issue."

Set a reminder on your phone.,
Create a schedule for your family.,
Use a timed feeder.",How to Plan a Feeding Schedule for Your Cat3," If you have trouble remembering to feed your cat at the same time each day, try setting a reminder on your phone. Although you may not always be able to feed your cat at the exact same time every day, setting daily reminders can help you remain consistent when you can.

, If your entire family takes responsibility for feeding your cat, it may be helpful to create a schedule that details who is responsible for feeding the cat, what time they should feed it, and how much they should feed it. This will help ensure your cat isn’t being double-fed or that its meals aren’t accidentally getting skipped.


Hang the schedule somewhere everyone in the family will see it—maybe on the refrigerator door or next to your cat’s food bowls.
It might also be helpful to have each member of the family put an “X” or slash on the schedule after they feed the cat to ensure the schedule is being followed properly.

, If you are not home consistently or at the same times throughout the day, you can use a timed cat feeder to make sure your cat is getting its meals on a schedule. These feeders will work with either dry, canned, or raw foods. Using a timed feeder can be a big help in keeping your cat on a consistent feeding schedule when you are away for extended or inconsistent periods of time."

Watch for decreased activity.,
Look for muscle weakness.,
Notice if your cat appears to have trouble seeing.",How to Spot Signs of Nutritional Deficiency in Cats2," If your cat’s food is unpalatable, it may not eat enough to meet its nutritional needs. Check the recommended feeding amounts to make sure that you aren’t overfeeding the cat before you determine that the food is unpalatable. Try a different brand of cat food if your cat doesn’t like what you’ve been feeding it.Since cats have different tastes than humans, feeding a cat human meals can lead to nutritional deficiency since your cat may not like the food.

, A lack of nutrients can affect your cat’s neurological processes. Additionally, your cat’s energy will be lower because it’s not getting enough vitamins and minerals to support its energy needs.A depressed cat will have behavioral changes, such as lacking interest in its normal activities and refusing to eat. It may also stop playing with its toys, its family, and the other pets.
If your cat just sits still staring at one spot for most of the day, then it may be depressed.
Your cat may also have neurotic behavior, such as getting confused or behaving erratically.

, If your cat is not getting enough nutrients to sustain its activity needs, then fatigue and lethargy can set in. While cats sleep a lot, they also have active moments. If your cat is no longer having active moments or seems to have difficulty getting up, then it may be suffering from malnutrition., If your cat has a nutritional deficiency, its body will be unable to support healthy muscles or the activity needed to keep them. The cat’s muscles will be lean, and your cat will be unable to run and jump like a healthy cat can.Watch your cat walk to check for an uneven gait, circling, falling, or bad coordination, which all suggest issues with malnutrition and muscle health., Failing eyesight can occur in cats that suffer from malnutrition. Your cat may begin bumping into furniture or may have trouble finding its way around the house."

Take your cat to the vet.,
Notice if your cat gets sick often.,
Check your cat’s litter box.,
Notice if your cat passes gas.",How to Spot Signs of Nutritional Deficiency in Cats3," Your vet can tell you if your cat has a nutritional deficiency or if it’s suffering from another issue. If your cat does suffer from malnutrition, then your vet can help determine why and can recommend a plan to help your cat, such as changing its food or adding a supplement.


Taking your cat to the vet is especially important if you’ve taken in a stray cat. The vet can give you more information about the health issues your stray cat faces and can test for issues like Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and feline leukemia, which is essential if you’re going to let your new cat be around other cats.
The vet can also update your cat’s shots.

, Cats who aren’t getting enough nutrients will easily become ill because its immune system will not be able to put up a defense.Sick cats may hide or be hunched over.
A sick cat may either eat and drink less or eat and drink more than when it’s healthy.
Your cat may also be vomiting or acting confused.
Your cat could also start coughing., Nutritional deficiency can cause both diarrhea and hard stool, so either can be a cause for concern.Don’t assume the worst if your cat has only had one incidence of diarrhea or hard stool, but if most of its waste is affected, then your cat may have an issue.

, Excessive flatulence (farting) can signal that something is wrong with your cat’s diet. While it could be a result of changing your cat’s food, excessive flatulence can also be caused by a nutritional deficiency. If your cat has become very smelly to be around, then check to make sure that it’s getting proper nutrition."

Protect the things you don't want touched by cats.,
Consider establishing a place in your yard for cats use.,
Consider trapping and neutering stray cats in your neighborhood.",How to Repel Cats2," If outdoor cats are coming around your yard, it's because they're looking for food and probably finding it somewhere. If you have pets, make sure their food is indoors and impossible to get to, and that there is no extra food lying around where strays can get at it. It's also a good idea to make sure mice haven't taken up residence in your porch or foundation, or you might end up welcoming the extra feline security.


Check all your trashcans for security, making sure the lids are secure and no food scraps are hanging out or easy to reach. Keep your trash pile manageable and secure so that no cats will come sniffing around the scent those tuna cans.
Talk politely to the neighbors to find out if they've been feeding cats. If one person starts laying out food, it makes it very difficult to keep the cats away. It's also a recipe for overfeeding, which ends up negatively affecting the cats' health in the long run.

, Cats, even feral ones, really don't like water. Place motion-activated water sprinklers in strategic spots where you see cats regularly, and where you'd like them to avoid. Place them in areas where you know cats enter the yard, and in several other spots, as well, so you get good coverage.


After a couple days, change the location up slightly so the cats will be sure to get scared off and won't be able to learn the new pattern. It shouldn't take many water scare-offs before the cats leave your yard alone.

, There are a variety of plants that look attractive in your yard, but are really unattractive to cats. Specifically, planting the herb rue in and around your garden will make cats stay far away. In the fall, you can harvest and dry rue to store it during winter and use as cat repellent. In the spring, sprinkle it in the garden to keep cats away from your starts.


Other nice plants known for their cat repellent properties include citronella, lemongrass, eucalyptus and lavender. These are pleasant scents for people and attractive looking plants to have in your yard, but cats hate them with a passion., You can mulch the surface of your garden, as well as between outdoor plants, bird feeders, and other places you'd like to keep cats away, using citrus fruit peels, coffee grounds or pipe tobacco. All are known cat deterrents, and have nitrogen-fixing properties for the soil, making them excellent for the environment and for scaring cats off.

, If you've got real cat problems and no pets of your own, you may not want to play nice anymore. Without being cruel to the cats you want to keep away, you can invest in more reliable and effective methods sure to keep cats away, including commercial cat repellent sprays and sonic devices designed to irritate animals.


Try a commercially sold cat repellent. Usually, these are made of synthesized or collected predator urine, and a small amount around the perimeter of your yard should do a lot to keep cats and other animals away. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and make sure the substance won't harm the animals.Install an ultrasonic pet repellent designed to repel cats. These devices create high-pitched audio transmissions that humans and most other animals do not hear, driving them away enthusiastically. Do not use these repellents if you have pets of your own. You may also want to talk to your neighbors to find out whether or not they have pets if you want to use one of these devices.

, If you've got a budding garden and want to keep cats and other pests away from your vegetables and plants, you can create barriers that will make it physically difficult for anything to get in. Close off the entrance to sheds, porches or other areas that cats might enjoy sleeping or urinating in. Taking away their shelter may keep them out of your yard entirely.


Put small rocks in the garden where there is exposed dirt to prevent cats from digging. You can also cut plastic carpet runners to fit between garden rows or any other area where a large amount of dirt is exposed. Lay them in the garden with the spoke side pointing up and then lightly cover them with soil. These spokes won't injure the cats' paws, but will deter them from stepping there. You can find plastic carpet runners at most office supply stores and carpet stores. They can be a bit expensive, but once you customize them for your garden, you can use them year after year.
Lay chicken wire flat on the soil between rows as an inexpensive alternative to carpet runners. Use rocks or ground spikes to anchor the ends of the pieces and cover the chicken wire with soil.

, If you make the cat's usual haunts less attractive, you might want to provide them with an out-of-the-way area in your yard to decrease the chances of them returning to the forbidden zones. This is an especially good idea if it's your cat, or if you enjoy the cat's presence, but want them to stay out of your sugar-snap peas.


Plant catnip in the opposite corner of the yard from where you want the cats, and allow the grass to grow significantly taller. Add a tall perch or two from an old bar stool or bench if there is not a tree, fence or other high spot available for the cat to survey its domain.
You can provide outdoor cats a litter box by tilling the soil in a designated area or putting sand on the ground in that spot. Clean the area regularly to encourage them to keep using it.

, Recently, the ASPCA has promoted a policy called Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) as a way of controlling feral populations. If you've got a serious problem with stray cats in your neighborhood, consider helping to control the population and help the animals in your neighborhood stay healthy by having them neutered and releasing them again.

Feed discrete meals.,
Monitor feeding time.,
Remove food dishes after a set amount of time.,
Use calming sprays.",How to Peacefully Feed Cats in Multi‐Cat Households1," Feeding all of your cats at one time, instead of letting them graze, will minimize conflict and fighting. Instead of allowing access to food at all times, which can lead to conflict when two cats want to eat from the same bowl at the same time, timed meals will allow all cats to have their own space and food to focus on.

How often you feed your cats each day depends on your schedule. In many cases, it works best to feed your cats once in the morning before you leave and once again in the evening when you return.Provide food puzzles if you have a cat, or cats, that is used to grazing instead of eating at meal times. This will help them transition to timed meals. Putting a small amount of kibble in one of these puzzles won't replace a whole meal but it may satiate a cat enough until meal time comes around.;
, Do not feed your cats and then leave your home. It is important that you monitor feeding time, so that you can make the cats stay at their own feeding stations and break up any conflicts that might occur.It may be that your presence calms your cats while they eat because they know that they will be protected from other cats trying to get their food when you are around. This will allow them to focus on their food more than on defensiveness.

, When feeding multiple cats you should remove food dishes after the cats have eaten or after a set amount of time, if one or more of your cats are very slow about eating. This will teach the cats that there is a set time to eat and if they don't eat at that given time, then there is no food to be had. The goal is to make meal time a time for strictly for eating, not a time to play games, show dominance, or fight for territory.Setting specific meal times and taking away food when meal time is over requires a gradual training process that may take some time for your cats to adjust to. If your cat meows repeatedly at you for food when it is not meal time, just remember that you are working to make a peaceful household and your cat will not starve if it has to wait an hour for food.

, If your cats are very territorial and tend to fight over food, you may want to try using a calming product made for cats during feeding times. These products tend to be non-toxic sprays that use pheromones to calm cats and reduce fear and aggression. Spray one of these products, which are usually available at most pet stores, around the feeding area or on the specific cats that are most fearful or aggressive.The pheromone sprays used for calming cats mimic the pheromones given off by mother cats to calm their kittens.

Invest in ultrasonic devices.",How to Keep Cats Out of Your Yard1," These mixes are the best option against cats that use your garden as a litter box, and are available at most pet stores and on the Internet. Shake the granules or spray the concentration near garden beds that are used as litter boxes.


The cat repellent usually uses predator scents to scare the cat into finding a new territory.
Choose a non-toxic formula to reduce risk of hurting pets, children or plants.;
, You can find animal deterrent sprinklers online, usually for about $40 to $100 US.


Set the sprinkler in the place where the cat enters the yard, or near places you want to protect.
Consider buying more than one sprinkler, if the cats live nearby. Given enough time, a cat may find another way into the yard.

, Choose motion activated devices, which are available online for $20 to $40. When a cat jumps into your yard, the device will make an unpleasant sound and detract from the environment.


Humans cannot hear the high-frequency sound, although it will be unpleasant for other types of animals.
This solution is best for deterring cats who spend a lot of time in the yard.

Give each cat its own dish.,
Don't place food dishes against walls.,
Place the cats as far away from each other as possible.,
Isolate cats eating different foods.",How to Peacefully Feed Cats in Multi‐Cat Households2," When feeding multiple cats, competition can be fierce if every cat doesn't have its own dish to eat from. Separate dishes allow each cat to have their own space and their own food to focus on, instead of focusing on defending against another cat.Make sure that the food bowls are as identical as possible. You do not want to create competition for a food dish that is easier to eat out of or is slightly bigger.In most cases, when you first set out multiple food dishes the cats will naturally gravitate to one of their own. Once they have basically picked their bowls, make them stick to them to establish their territories.

, In many cases, a cat in a multi-cat household will want to be in a position while eating where it can see any other cats coming towards it. If you place food dishes against a wall, the cat will naturally be forced to have its back to the wall. This may add to its anxiety and not allow it to relax during eating.

Placing your cat's bowl even a foot away from the wall should allow it to sit in any place around the bowl that it feels is best.

, When feeding cats in a multiple cat household, you need to space them away from each other. This may mean that you place food dishes in separate corners of the same room or you place feeding stations in completely separate rooms.Giving all your cats space from other cats will allow them to better focus on their food instead of turf wars or food competition.
It is ideal if your cats cannot see each other during meal time. This add tremendously to your cat's ability to focus on food instead of the other cats.

, If your cats eat different food, it is important that you feed them in different spaces. This will help you to keep each cat eating the food that it is supposed to eat and it will prevent fights over whatever food your cats consider the tastiest.

It may be that one of your cats eats different food and your other cats eat the same food. If this is the case, only the cat with different food needs to be isolated during meal time.
Cats that are eating different food need to be kept separate until all cats in the household are done eating. The will remove the temptation to sneak a bite from the bowl of the last cat eating.

"

Coax cats to their own bowls.,
Stop fights right away.,
Avoid conflict before it starts.",How to Peacefully Feed Cats in Multi‐Cat Households3," If more than one cat goes to one bowl at meal time, you should coax the cat away who does not normally eat at that bowl. This could be done by picking the cat up, calling to it, or luring it towards its own bowl with a bit of food. This separation will prevent territorial disputes and conflict during meal time.

There can be power dynamics between cats that they need to sort out themselves. When cats are initially establishing whose dish is whose, there may be some switching up that occurs.

, When fights break out over territory or food you should break them up right away. Fighting over food, especially between cats who usually get along, can lead to unhealthy aggression, so it should be stopped before it gets serious.If you have two cats that repeatedly fight over food dishes, these cats should be fed in different rooms.

, In order to have a peaceful household with multiple cats, you may need to resort to keeping certain cats away from each other most of the time, which includes meal time. This will allow you to avoid conflict before it begins and it allows both cats to have peaceful and calm time in their homes.

If you have a very small home, this can be difficult to achieve. Keeping cats that don't get along separated works better if you have a large house or at least several rooms that can be closed off.
While it is true that some cats may have conflict at first and then learn to get along, that is not always the case. If you have tried to get your cats to get along and nothing seems to work, it may be time to give them separate territories in your home."

If you don’t want to remove the bird feeders, make sure they are free hanging, in locations where the cat can’t climb or jump to attack birds.

, If your children have a sandbox for play, make sure it is only open during active playtime. If it cannot be closed or covered, consider removing the sandbox.


Cats are attracted to sand as a litter material. Allowing children to play in places that have cat feces can expose them to zoonotic diseases.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) suggests distracting cats from your yard by placing a small sandbox nearby. Although you will be creating a litter box that you have to change frequently, it will be a more attractive place for cats than your gardens.

, If you feed your cat outdoors, it is only a matter of time before other cats will use your house as a food sources.

, Male cats that are not neutered can find the scent and discover your yard.

Plant rue in your garden.",How to Keep Cats Out of Your Yard3," After you prepare your dirt to grow seeds or starts, cover the area with a horizontal layer of chicken wire.


Cut holes in the places where your plants will grow with a wire cutter.
Gardening solutions like this are best for stopping cats that use flowerbeds as litter boxes.

, Once you have planted your beds or garden, lay down a layer of flat stones around the plants. The water will still seep into the ground below, but cats and weeds will be deterred.


In place of stones, you can also use pine cones. The sharp points at the end of pine cones are uncomfortable for cats. In either case, limiting the amount of soil exposed to the air will reduce the appeal of your garden.
Gardening companies sell special mats, called Cat Scat Mats that are pressed into the soil. They contain plastic spikes that cats will not want to walk on. However, if you need to step into your garden to weed or water, it can also be uncomfortable for humans.

, Ruta graveolens is a mostly ornamental herb. Cats usually despise the smell of it.


Be careful when touching rue if the weather is hot. Exposure to the plant can cause blisters on the skin.

Have patience.",How to Calm Your Angry Cat," A cat’s primary motivation for displaying angry or aggressive behavior is fear. Cats are not as domesticated as dogs and easily revert to their wild state. This means that cats are one step away from being a wild animal still and many wild animals live in a constant state of alertness for danger, including a fear of people.Top of the list for inducing fear is strangers, simply because a cat doesn't know what that person is all about until they've had time to observe and trust that the person is cat friendly. Keep in mind that the reason for your cat’s fear may not always be immediately apparent to you.For example, your cat may begin to hiss at a toddler because the child pulled on the cat’s tail at some point when you weren’t in the room. The cat may then associate the toddler with pain in a way that causes the cat to become fearful.A poorly socialized cat can even have a strong fear of strangers and strange surroundings.;
, Reading your cat's body language can help avoid conflict. It is useful to recognize both fear and aggression. However, there is an overlap between both sets of behavior, so don't get too hooked up on differentiating the two. The important thing is to recognize the cat is stressed, and stressed leads to possible attack. Be aware that a cat can turn from being calm to afraid or angry in a matter of seconds. Signs of fear or aggression include:Piloerection (hairs standing up)
Dilated pupils
A direct stare at you (precedes attack)
Averting its gaze (fear)
Whiskers stiff and drawn back
Ears flattened against the head
A hunched body posture
Growling
Drawing backs the lips and hissing.

, Though most of these behaviors are often thought of as signs that an angry cat is about to attack, the behaviors are more typical of a stressed and fearful cat that wants to escape the situation., This term applies when one cat takes out its anger on another cat or person even though the source of the anger was someone or some other cat completely different. If this happens to two cats living together, it can be quite difficult to get them to get along with each other again, depending on how serious the attack was., Be aware that some cats will get overexcited during play and may bite or scratch, which can be misinterpreted as aggressive behavior.


If your cat is in a more-aggressive play mood, then you can always use dangling toys to keep your hands and fingers away from the play bites.

, Petting-induced aggression is common in some cats. The behavior doesn’t necessarily have to be at first pet. The cat may seem to enjoy the petting before suddenly becoming aggressive at the act. However, this should not be confused with anger. Reasons behind the aggression may include:The cat using the behavior as a way of saying, ""That's enough thanks.”
The cat becoming so dozy with pleasure that it suddenly startles awake and bites in self-defense.
This form of aggression often occurs in single kittens (only one in the litter) or hand-raised kittens. They lack socialization with other kittens, who would swipe them back if they lashed out too hard or bit too hard. However, do NOT swipe your cat back. Instead, learn to read the body language that the cat is about to flip. The cat may give a single, telltale twitch of the tail, or it may stop purring and the skin on its back may twitch. At this point, immediately stop petting the cat and stand up to tip it off your lap., If your cat is angry with you or has redirected its aggression toward you, then you are a possible target for an attack, which can result in scratches or bites. However, most cats will not actually attack unless you continue provoking it after the initial warning behaviors.


If you actually need to handle the cat, wear protective clothing and throw a blanket over the cat to help subdue the animal. However, this is only a short-term solution if it is essential to catch the cat because of potential injury. It will do nothing to endear you to the cat and will make it even less cooperative next time.
Have a water pistol readily accessible if you live with a cat. It can be an ideal method for squirting an angry cat without having to get your hands involved. It might be enough to separate brawling cats and it can certainly be a good source of defense if the cat decides to attack you through redirected aggression.

, The best step you can take once you’ve recognized a behavior associated with your cat being angry or fearful is to simply back off. Step away from the cat in a way that reduces the fearful response. If possible, leave the room the cat is in, or if the cat is reacting to another person or animal, then have them leave the room. If you cannot leave the room, then make sure you back away in a manner that doesn’t block the exit since the cat may want to leave the room.You’ll likely want to leave the cat alone for ten or twenty minutes to give it enough time to calm down.
If the “threat” is another cat you’ve just brought home, then the desensitization process can take time, and you should keep the cats separated with only gradual introduction. You can find more information on the topic at: How to Bring a Second Cat Into the Family and Not Make Your Old Cat Upset


, Don’t stand over or stare at the cat while it’s in an agitated state as this amplifies the threat. If you are in no immediate danger and eager to help a fearful cat feel more confident, either lie on the floor so you are less of a threat, or make yourself small by sitting down., Taking your focus off the cat completely gives the cat the opportunity to assess you at its own pace to realize that you aren’t a threat.


This includes relaxing your body language and your voice. Try talking to someone else in the room or even softly singing to yourself. Instead of creating tension, this reinforces the impression that the cat has nothing to be concerned about., Often, your cat may simply deal with its own fearful reactions by finding a safe place to hide. For instance, if your cat fears strangers, it will likely hide at the first sign of a doorbell or knock at the door. Consider keeping the cat’s kennel in a quiet, undisturbed room, giving the cat a place to hide until it decides it’s ready to come back out.Cats can feel a similar sense of security from high-up places as well. Consider providing a cat tower with a high perch for the cat to hide away, especially if a new dog in the home is the source or your cat’s fearful behavior.

, After you have given your cat time and space to calm down, approach cautiously without actually touching the cat. You need to be sure that all visible signs of anger are gone, including the raised fur, hissing, and arched back. However, even with these visible signs gone, your cat may still be harboring feelings of anger and be flighty and afraid, so taking it slowly is important.

, Sit or lie on the floor with treats in your hand. Let the cat sniff and explore around you. Even if the cat keeps its distance and just watches you, this builds confidence in the long term that you are not threat.


If your cat wasn’t at all socialized to humans in the first twelve weeks of its life, then this step is crucial. Trying to make first contact will only make the cat more fearful of you. Always let the cat initiate physical contact by sniffing your and then rubbing its head against you. This transfers some of the cat’s scent onto you and makes you a bit safer in its eyes. Even then, do not reach out to the cat. Think of this as a test. You can pass the test by sitting utterly still and letting the cat feel in control. Only after it comes to you regularly should you very slowly reach out and attempt to stroke the animal., Shake a bag of treats or open a can of your cat’s favorite food and place it in the food bowl. Be sure that there is plenty of fresh water available since the cat may be very thirsty after such high emotions. However, don't force food or drink on your cat. The animal will know it's there when it's ready., Never, under any circumstances punish your cat. Remember, aggression is born of fear, so punishing the cat only ramps up fear and makes another aggressive display more likely. Instead, fight anger with loving patience., Illness or pain can lead to your cat exhibiting angry or aggressive behavior. If your cat begins suddenly displaying angry or fearful behaviors despite previously being docile (or if you simply haven’t made any progress with the above steps), then see your vet to rule out any medical conditions.Common causes include high fever, tooth pain, gingivitis, abscesses, wounds, arthritis, fractures, ear problems and sprains or strains. Fur balls can sometimes trigger an angry response in a cat where the fur ball is causing colic or gastric inflammation.If the vet determines that the problem isn’t an illness, he or she may suggest anti-anxiety medication if nothing else seems to keep your cat calm.
If your cat exhibits the behavior in relation to a very specific event—such as car rides or even visits to the vet—then your vet may also prescribe a mild sedative for your cat. This allows you to preemptively calm the cat before subjecting it to the stressful situation. After a few instances of experiencing the situation while sedated, you may even notice that your cat becomes desensitized to the stressor.

, In situations where the person or thing inducing a fearful reaction from your cat cannot actually harm the cat, then you can try desensitizing the cat to the stressor in the same way people usually get over their own phobias.For instance, if the stressor is a person, begin by letting the cat hear the person speaking in another room until this no longer has any effect. Then step it up to having the person on the other side of the same room as the cat while completely ignoring the cat until this has no effect. Allow the person to get closer until the cat finally chooses to make contact.
To add a counterconditioning element to desensitization training, you can include treats during the process. This not only desensitizes the cat to the stressor but begins making the cat associate the person with positive reinforcement instead., Depending on the level of socialization your cat had as a kitten, the amount of time it takes for the cat to develop trust can range anywhere from days to years."

Set up your freezer containers correctly.",How to Make Kitten Food," You’ll need either chicken, turkey, or rabbit. Commercially available products should be relatively safe for food preparation and the kitten’s consumption.One option is to use three pounds of poultry (chicken or turkey) thigh meat including the bones and skin. Another option is to purchase a mix of 2.25 lbs of a whole carcass ground rabbit plus 0.75 lbs of boneless chicken or turkey meat including the skin and fat.
This recipe will last 10-14 days for a cat eating 4-6 ounces per day.;
, You may need to prepare more water if you cat needs more to drink. Have water set aside in separate cups for mixing and drinking., You will use the yolk raw, but lightly cook the egg white. Soft boiling the eggs is a good solution., Fish oil can come in five to 10 capsules averaging 1,000 mg per capsule, and are a good source of fatty acids. Poke holes or cut off the tips of the capsules to pour out their contents into the water.Avoid using cod liver oil as this will be included in other ingredients.

, You will need vitamins E, B-complex, and taurine (an amino acid) to further augment the food you are making. You’ll need to get 400 IU (268 mg) of vitamin E. Also have on hand 50 mg of vitamin B-complex. Have 2,000 mg of taurine ready.Vitamin E should be prepared preferably in powdered capsule form. Vitamin B-complex is best used in capsule or tablet form. Taurine should be added in loose powdered or capsule form.

, You’ll eventually use 1 teaspoon of table salt with some iodine for potassium and sodium boosts.Add salt only if you are using poultry protein product and no rabbit.

, You’ll need to add four ounces of chicken liver for every three pounds of poultry.This is only to be done if you are not using rabbit protein which contains liver already.

, Try guar gum at 1/16 teaspoon twice daily mixed into the food. You can fill 1/8 of a teaspoon halfway each time.This will help prevent constipation in the kitten.

, First, use a meat grinder or food processor to grind the poultry meat and skin. Next, combine the meat into a mixing bowl. Combine by hand and knead the meats together for a few minutes to make sure everything is thoroughly mixed., Once they are all dissolved, add the vitamin mixture to the meat mixture. Continue mixing the meat and supplements and then use knives to portion it off into other containers you can store in freezers., If you’re using poultry only then putting your chicken or turkey product in the oven and cooking the liver will be necessary. Bake the poultry and liver at 350 degrees for approximately 15 minutes (time will vary). Remove the meat from the oven and pour on cold water to halt the cooking process.You want the meats only half raw, though the liver will end up slightly more cooked than the poultry.
Save the fat drippings as additives to the ground meat.

, You can use knives or scissors. Put the ground meats and fat into the refrigerator temporarily. This step is optional.Use a meat grinder for the more meaty bones and any meat not chunked. Include the liver and eggs.

, Pour the supplement mix into the meat mixture. Make sure the meat and supplements are mixed well then portion them out into containers and put them into the freezer. Leave 3/4"" of space for the food to expand., You’ll need to move the frozen portions to the refrigerator a couple of days ahead of use. The new kitten food you made should be in the refrigerator for approximately 48 to 72 hours in a defrosted state.Consider using large plastic containers on the order of 1 - 1.5 pounds in capacity. Adjust for the number of kittens and other cats you have.
If you want to warm up the food then apply some hot tap water or heating in the microwave for 10-15 seconds.

, This should ideally be some kind of poultry or rabbit. Get chicken thighs and/or drumstick meat. Rabbit also can work. Leave approximately half the skin., If you cannot get heart then you can use a supplement of 4,000 mg of taurine powder or capsules. You will also need to substitute the amount of meat to the total of raw muscle meat. In other words add 14 ounces of raw meat.The heart can be chicken heart

, The best kind of liver in this case would be chicken liver. Alternatives to chicken liver would be vitamin A and D supplements. You need to add 40,000 IU of vitamin A and 1600 IU of vitamin D. You will also need to add 7 ounces to the raw muscle meat total., You will need this for mixing. Have additional water prepared for drinking in separate containers if your kitten needs more water with the meal., Make sure this is the variety meant for human consumption. This is an important calcium source in cat food and essential for your kitten’s growth., This will be part of the supplement slurry later. Select eggs that are from free-range, antibiotic-free chickens preferably., You will need several other vitamin and nutritional supplements to add to the food mix. You need to get 4 capsules of raw glandular supplement such as the multi-gland supplement by Immoplex. Get 4,000 mg of salmon. Buy 800 IU vitamin E. Have 200 mg of vitamin B-50 complex. Have 1.5 teaspoon of Morton Lite salt (with iodine).The salmon oil, B-50, and vitamin E should be in capsule form. You don’t need the Morton Lite salt with iodine if you are using rabbit meat.

, Do this for all the poultry but not the rabbit. Use a peeler or your hands to remove the skin., Have several knives or scissors ready to go. Cut the poultry or rabbit into chunks the size of dice or slightly larger than half-inch cubes. Save the chunked pieces. Do not grind them. You can cut off the skin if its poultry, but leave on the skin if you are cutting up rabbit., You’ll need this for mixing later. Combine these meats thoroughly and store them temporarily in a refrigerator. Use a meat grinder or processor to grind and combine the meats., Fill a bowl with 2 cups of water. Mix in all of the supplements except the gelatin. If you had extra vitamins to replace the heart and/or liver put them into the water at this time. Whisk the mixture briefly and add the gelatin at the end. Stir well., Retrieve the refrigerated meat mixture for this step. Combine the supplement mix into the recently refrigerated meat combination, and then add in the chunked meat cut earlier. Mix these thoroughly. Portion out the final mixture into containers and put them in the freezer., Leave enough space for the food to expand. Use the refrigerator for defrosting for a couple of days before use.This recipe makes 4.4 pounds (2 kg) of food which can last 12-14 days for the average cat.

Consider products like Pro Bloom or Cat Sure. Both are formulated for cats.
Think about other powdered goat milk products. By using a powdered product, you can keep it on hand so you can make catsicles whenever you want.;
, While you may think that cat food is only good served straight out of the can, your cat will likely get very excited over a wet food catsicle. Use different flavors of your cat’s wet food. Remember, smooth cat food, rather than chunky cat food, works best.

Purchase new wet foods that your cat has never eaten before., Perhaps one of the most alluring catsicles is the tuna catsicle. Tuna works great as a catsicle because of its texture and the fact that it can be used with other ingredients.

Light chunk tuna may work better than solid white albacore because the pieces are smaller and juicier., Take a large bowl and pour your main ingredients into it. Stir the ingredients so they are well mixed. You may need to add milk or water to create a smooth consistency. Some mixtures might include:

Some chunks of tuna, the liquid from a can of tuna, and a few tablespoons of goat milk.
Goat milk and other cat-friendly liquids.
Wet cat food and a couple tablespoons of goat milk., Once you’ve mixed your main ingredients, you can decide whether you want to mix in some extra treats. Make sure to spread the treats out evenly. Stir the mix once you’re done sprinkling treats in.

Try to use soft treats. For example, consider sprinkling some traditional soft treats or catnip into the catsicles., Once you’ve mixed your ingredients and sprinkled treats into the mixture, pour it into individual containers. Containers should be small enough to serve to your cat as a snack. You’ll want to fill your containers with between a quarter to a half of an inch of mixture (6.35 ml to 12.7 ml).

You can use a variety of containers, including: Dixie cups, ice cube trays, store-bought popsicle molds., Before you place the catsicles in the freezer, make sure they’re completely covered. Consider using plastic wrap or Tupperware. By covering them, you’ll limit the chance of them spilling. In addition, you’ll lower the risk of them getting freezer burn., When placing the catsicles in the freezer, make sure they’re on a level surface. If they’re not on a level surface, they will spill or freeze unevenly.

You may want to clear out part of a shelf or even an entire shelf to place your catsicles., While you may be able to take some catsicles out of the freezer earlier, you should leave them in for at least one day. Allowing them to sit in the freezer for a day will help ensure that they are completely frozen.

The quicker you use the catsicles after the first day, the better. The longer they remain in the freezer, the higher the chances of them becoming freezer burned.
Properly stored, catsicles may be good for up to several months., When you’re ready to serve your cat a catsicle, run a little warm water on the underside of the container. This will make it easier for you to pop the catsicle out of the container and serve it.

After you’ve warmed the bottom of the container, place the catsicle into your cat’s bowl. Make sure the bowl is somewhat deep, so your cat doesn’t make a mess everywhere."

He or she will be able to determine your cat’s needs, offer sound advice, and prescribe a mild sedative or anti-nausea medication to help alleviate your cat’s nervous tendencies.It is also wise to discuss any required changes to your cat’s existing medications.Discuss the option of using a synthetic feline pheromone spray with your cat’s veterinarian. This may also be a useful option for helping your cat’s stress levels during and leading up to transport.;
, Remaining calm and acting normally may alleviate some of your cat’s anxiety prior to your journey. Allowing your cat to move freely about the house and avoiding eye contact will help establish a peaceful, shared environment for you and your cat.Do not raise your voice or become angry with your cat. This can reinforce an already nervous cat’s anxieties and fears., A nervous cat is calmer when he or she is in familiar territory. Cars can be loud, intimidating environments, so it is important to introduce your cat to the vehicle gradually.Practice bringing your cat out to the car in small intervals, providing treats when the cat remains calm. Gradually repeat this process several times, making your cat wait a little longer each time to earn a treat. If your cat is nervous, limit the time spent in the vehicle and do not offer a treat.
Once your cat no longer acts nervous in your vehicle, practice driving a short distance and reward your cat when he or she remains calm. Provided that your cat is not acting nervous, extend the trips each time and reward good behavior with a treat. Over time, your cat will be much more familiar, comfortable, and at ease in your moving vehicle."

Store the Carrier.",How to Take Your Cat to the Vet," Both hard and soft cat carriers will allow you to safely carry your cat to and from the vet. The harder ones are better for vehicle transport. Training your cat to enter the carrier could take a few hours or a few weeks. In order to have sufficient time to test it out before use, try to obtain a carrier 1-4 weeks prior to the appointment.If you already have a carrier, make sure that he can still fit inside of it.
If you do not have a carrier, one can be purchased at your local pet store, department store, or online.
As an alternative, you could ask to borrow a carrier from a friend or possibly find one at your local thrift store, but be sure to clean and dry it thoroughly before use. A little vinegar added to mild soap and water will help eliminate odors.;
, Carriers should be large enough for your cat to turn all the way around in it. If you choose to purchase a carrier online, do so far in advance of the appointment to ensure that you receive the carrier in time to habituate your cat to it.

, It is likely that your cat will turn tail when she sees the carrier, so don't pull it out from storage right before leaving for the appointment. This could make her remember the last time you went to the vet, if that experience was traumatizing.


Use the carrier at nap and play time. This will help eliminate negative associations your cat might have to the carrier.
To get him used to the carrier (again), first line it with shredded newspapers and a couple of small towels or large strips of fabric that contain a scent familiar to your cat.
Put cat treats in and around the carrier to lure her inside. It might take some time for your cat to enter the carrier, so add fresh treats when needed.

, Once she seems comfortable in and around the carrier, you can put her in it.


Quietly close the carrier door, and speak soothingly to her.
Be gentle when placing your cat in the carrier. If she still refuses, do not force her in. Instead, give her more time to get used to it.

, Once inside the carrier, taking your cat on short drives through the neighborhood could help ease your cat's anxiety.


Gently carry your cat to your vehicle, or to the train, subway, or bus stop. On public transportation, use a large towel to cover the carrier, so that your cat will be less anxious.
Place the carrier on a seat. If you are driving, buckle the carrier in for safety.
Speak soothingly to your cat, or play soft music during the drive.
Lengthen the trip each time, until the day of the appointment.
Be sure to bring plastic bags, mild disinfecting wipes, and small towels for cleanup in case she has an accident during the trip.

, Before leaving, make sure that your cat is ready. Groom him by brushing his fur and, if need be, clip his front claws so that he does not scratch you or the vet.

, To help your cat stay clean and comfortable, be prepared.


Pack plastic bags for waste disposal, and mild disinfecting wipes and small towels for cleanup.
Pack a large towel to cover the carrier while among crowds or in the waiting room.
Pack your cat's favorite treats and some of his favorite toys. You can even place one inside the carrier to help him feel even safer.
If you are driving to the vet's office, obey all traffic laws, maintain the speed limit, and avoid sharp turns.
If the trip is long, make sure she has an area inside where she can relieve herself. The shredded newspapers work well as litter while you're on the road. Bring extra newspaper.

, Cover the carrier, or keep the carrier covered, with the towel once you are in the waiting room.


Do not take your cat out of the carrier unless it needs to be cleaned. Other animals in the waiting room might incite your cat to pounce at or scratch them.
If your cat seems happy without the towel, then do not use it but keep in on hand, just in case.

, Once your cat survives the waiting room and is called in to the see the vet, it is important that you continue to soothe any anxiety she may feel.


Continue to speak soothingly to her, especially if the carrier is covered. She needs to know that you are close.
Ask the vet for the best way to remove your cat from the carrier. Once inside, she might be just as afraid to come out as she was to go in.

, Very gently and while speaking soothingly, reach inside the carrier to remove your cat. Set her on the table, if you are instructed do so.


Follow the vet's instructions for how to handle your cat. If asked to hold him down firmly, do so without undue pressure. If you are unsure how to do this, ask the vet or her assistant (if present) for help.

, Depending on the type of appointment your cat had, or if you are returning to the vet after leaving him there for surgery or observation, taking your cat home can create another anxious experience for him.


Make sure the carrier is clean before leaving. Clean it, if necessary, replacing the newspaper and towels.

, Give your cat a treat for being a good patient and shower her with affection before placing her back into the carrier. Before leaving the office, be sure to confirm when she might need to return for a checkup or follow-up appointment.

, Cover the carrier again with the large towel, if your cat seems nervous. Gently set the carrier in place. If returning in a car, buckle up the carrier again.

, Your cat will be ready to feel at home again.


Once home, set the carrier down and gently open the door.
Do not force your cat out; she will exit on her own when she is ready.

, Clean and dry the carrier thoroughly and store it in a place where it will not get damaged (or return to the person from whom it was borrowed). Many carriers can be used for plane travel, running errands, and when visiting friends or family.


Clean, dry towels and newspapers can be stored in the carrier for later use.
Regular use of the carrier will keep your cat feeling comfortable with it.

It is important for all cats to become accustomed to their carriers, but this is particularly beneficial for nervous cats. Leaving the crate out in the open will help prevent your cat from solely associating it with transportation.Place your cat’s food or treats inside the crate. This will offer a positive association with the crate; if there is yummy food inside, it surely can’t be a bad place!Placing comfortable bedding and familiar and favorite toys within the crate can also set your cat’s anxieties at ease., When the day of travel arrives, place a towel in the floor of the crate. This will help clean up any accidents your cat may have during travel and will keep your cat clean., If your cat does not freely enter the crate on the day of travel, place the crate on its end with the door facing toward the ceiling. Pick up your cat with one hand holding his or her front legs as the other hand supports the bottom., Slowly lower the cat inside the crate, bottom first.This will help prevent a nervous cat from feeling that they are being forced inside or are being trapped., Once the cat is inside, cover the carrier with a towel or light blanket. This will help keep the cat calm and prevent motion sickness."

Buy a harness and leash.,
Start small.,
Give your cat freedom.,
Head outside.",How to Transport a Nervous Cat3," It may be strange to see a cat on a leash, but it is great option for transporting your cat if you do not have a crate. Be sure to select the right size and type of harness and leash for your cat. With practice, time, and patience, even a nervous cat will learn to be comfortable in a harness and a leash., Begin by placing your cat in the harness indoors for ten-minute sessions each day, rewarding the cat with a treat for good behavior. Once the cat is accustomed to the harness, attach the leash.

, Eventually, with consistency and praise, the cat with get used to moving about on his or her own while wearing both the harness and the leash. At this time, begin picking up the leash and walking around the house with your cat for small intervals. Reward your cat with treats when he or she remains calm.

, Once your cat is confident walking around the house with you, it is time to head out to the great outdoors! Little by little, your cat will become more familiar with this routine and it will be a great method for transporting your cat.

Pick up your cat.",How to Transport a Nervous Cat4," If an emergency arises and you do not have a crate or a harness to transport your cat, wrap your cat gently with a towel. Wrapping a nervous cat in a towel can help prevent injury to both you and your cat, as well as help the cat feel safe and secure., On a flat surface, gently place your cat in the middle of the towel, several inches from the top.

, Pull the short end of the towel over the cat’s neck and body, and tug the corner of the towel forward. Tuck the towel corner under the cat’s neck.

, Grab the opposite side of the towel and gently pull it over the cat’s body and tuck it beneath the belly. Make sure that it fits securely but comfortably and that the cat’s head is not covered or restrained., Slowly lift your cat and place him or her an open-top box."

Take your cat to the veterinarian for a thorough examination. You should also show the diet and recipes to a certified animal nutritionist to make sure they provide all the nutrients your cat needs.


The veterinarian can help you locate a certified animal nutritionist in your area or you can find one online.;
, When you grind and freeze raw cat food, this reduces the amount of taurine available to the cat.You'll need to supplement this amino acid to prevent major eye and cardiac problems.Recognize that a taurine deficiency doesn't show up immediately. Instead, it will take a few years, but by then the damage may be irreversible.Ask the animal nutrition expert to recommend a specific dosage for your cat.

, Any time you handle raw food, you need to wash your hands frequently and safely store the meat. This is important to prevent salmonella poisoning.Always use fresh meat, never meat that looks like it's starting to go bad. This can increase the risk of disease.


Handling raw meat when pregnant can increase your risk for toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease. Wash your hands frequently or wear gloves when handling meat.If you're concerned about the nutrition of a raw diet, understand that no nutrients are lost by preparing raw food rather than cooking it for your pet., Depending on what meat you choose to use, you may have a hard time finding high-quality meat. While it might be easy to buy a whole chicken from your grocery store, you may need to seek out a local farmer or butcher to get organ meat. If you can only find whole chicken to use, only grind up and offer bones that are small. However, if you include bones that are too large, your cat will simply avoid them. Just make sure not to cook the bones, which can cause them to splinter and damage your cat's digestive system.Fortunately, pre-made mixes of ground raw meat are increasingly available in refrigerated and frozen sections of pet stores. All you need to do is thaw and add supplements to the meat., Cut up the carcass and separate the muscle meat. Cut the muscle meat into chunks or process it through a meat grinder using the extra-large grinding plate. Leaving chunks of meat can give your cat something to chew on and gives good tooth and gum exercise. Set the meaty bones aside. Place the prepared muscle meat in the refrigerator.If using chicken, remove as much skin as possible. Chicken necks are a good choice to use since they're mostly cartilage, are easy to chop, and are easy for the cat to digest. You can also use rabbit or dark meat from a chicken or turkey.

, Once you've prepared the muscle meat, use a scale to weigh out the organ meats. Grind these through a meat grinder or food processor and set them in the refrigerator while you prepare the remaining ingredients.At this point, you can also take the meaty bones out of the refrigerator and pass them through a grinder. Avoid using a food processor to grind the bones, since it's probably not equipped to handle them.

, In a separate bowl, whisk the salmon oil, glandular supplement, kelp, dulse, vitamin E, vitamin B complex, egg yolks, and water until it's combined. If you're using the psyllium, add it last and stir again.You can discard or store the egg whites for another use.

, In a large bowl, combine the hand-chunked muscle meat with the ground meat and ground bones until completely mixed. Add the supplement slurry and stir again until it's evenly distributed., Spoon the finished cat food into manageable containers such as freezer bags or one-cup plastic freezer containers. Avoid overfilling the containers. Instead, leave at least 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) gap or headspace at the top. This will allow the food to expand as it freezes. Label the containers with the type of meat and the date before freezing.Wide-mouth mason glass jars can keep the food fresh for longer, but be sure to buy jars specifically made for freezing, not just canning.

, Remove the food from the freezer during mealtime and warm the food in a baggie. If you have some of the food in the refrigerator, you'll still need to warm it up before serving it. Some cats will vomit raw food if it’s cold when it hits the stomach.To warm the baggies, simply run them under hot water until warm to room temperature or just above. Never use the microwave to warm the food, especially if you've used bones. Cooked bones splinter and can be very dangerous to a cat, but raw bones are soft and easily digested by a cat.

Pick a date.,
Ship during the week.,
Learn the company's guidelines.,
Find a good kennel.,
Get a health certificate.,
Decide whether to sedate your cat.,
Label the container appropriately.,
Check the weather.,
Drop your pet off.,
Have someone ready for pickup.",How to Ship a Cat1," Most of the time, you can't book a cargo flight ahead of time. However, you can call and reserve a space on your preferred flight and airline. It's best to call and talk to someone so you have all the details worked out.Note that you will pay for your pet the day of shipping.;
, In many cases, your cat will get better service during the week because more employees are on. Therefore, try to schedule it so your cat can leave on a weekday., Each airline has different requirements when it comes to pet shipping, though many are the same for each company. Nonetheless, check with the airline to see what it requires or prohibits.


For instance, American Airlines prohibits the shipment of snub-nosed breeds, such as Persian, Exotic Shorthairs, or Burmese cats.This restriction is for the safety of your pet, as pets with snub-noses can be susceptible to oxygen deprivation and heat stroke.Another American Airline's guidelines is the crate and pet can't be over a hundred pounds. While that would be hard to do with a cat, you want to make sure your crate isn't too heavy.

, Airlines also have certain requirements for the kennel. For the most part, the transport kennel usually must be rigid, escape-proof, and meet other requirements, such as ventilation on at least 3 sides for domestic flights. However, each airline may have specific requirements.For instance, on American Airlines, the kennel can't be bigger than 36 inches (91.4 cm) long, 26 inches wide, and 28 inches high. Nonetheless, your pet should be able to sit up, turn around, and lay down.You may also need to provide water and food dish that is securely attached to the inside of the kennel yet can be reached from the outside.
Most also require you to provide bedding that can absorb any bathroom mistakes your cat does in the kennel. For instance, towels and shredded newspapers are suggested options., Most airlines require that you have your pet's health certified within the last 10 days. If it happens to have a return flight, it must also have a health certificate within 10 days of that flight.Your vet will provide the health certificate once he or she checks the animal out. Make sure to ask your vet in advance to see if he or she provides this service.
Often, you'll need two copies of the health certificate., Many cats do not travel well, and you may be wondering whether you should sedate your cat for flying. You can do so. However, most airlines discourage it. The main reason it is discouraged is that high altitude can change how the medication affects your cat. Talk with your vet about what's best for your cat., You need to write ""LIVE ANIMAL"" on the top and at least one side. You also need to add ""THIS SIDE UP"" with arrows on two sides.You also must provide other pertinent information, such as when the cat was last fed and when it should be fed again. In some cases (American Airlines), the airlines recommend that you feed the cat within four hours of the flight,while other airlines (Delta) recommend you feed the cat a light meal no less than four hours before the flight.When labeling the container, you need to note if the cat is sedated or not. You'll need to provide information on how the cat was sedated, including the weight of the cat, how much medication was given, when it was given, the generic name of the medication, and how it was given to the cat.

, Most airlines will only ship when the temperature is in a certain range for the protection of your animal. For instance, American Airlines mainly ships animals when the temperature is between 45 °F (7.2 °C) and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.This measure is also to protect your animal, as your animal will be outside while loading the plane.
If your vet will certify that your animal is acclimated to it, some airlines will let you go below this range.

, Your airline should have a list of drop-off locations for pets, and it can be different from passenger check-in. Ask your airline for the drop-off location, or check online.Ask about any extras the airline offers to keep your mind at ease. For instance, Delta offers GPS tracking devices for an extra fee, so you always know where your cat is., Your animal will need to be picked up on the other end. Like drop off, where you pick your pet up varies by airline and and airport. Call or check online to find out where pickup is on the other end.Don't forget to notify the airlines who will be picking up your cat if it is not you.
Often, pickup will be in the cargo area.

If possible, close off a space in your garden.,
Don't force her out.,
Allow her to walk around supervised for short periods.",How to Keep a Cat from Running Away when It Is Moved," Before you move it's important to take some steps which will prepare your cat. If the worst happens and your cat does run away, ensuring that she has been micro-chipped will mean she is fully registered and can be returned to you if she is picked up or found. Most cats now are micro-chipped.Your vet can do this quickly and easily and it doesn't hurt or distress your cat.
A tiny microchip is inserted under the skin which can be quickly scanned by a vet. The chip will have all of the owner's details on so you can be quickly reunited.You need to update your details when you move or if you change phone number, since the database is only as good as the information you give it.;
, A more old-fashioned way to identify your cat is to get her a collar with your phone number on. This way if she sneaks off and gets lost, or heads back to your old house and someone finds her, they can quickly and easily get in touch with you.


This is a cheap and simple thing to do but it could make a big difference.
It's sensible to leave your phone number for the people moving into your old house in case your cat heads back there.

, Before the move make sure you have a suitable cat carrier that will last the journey without falling apart or breaking. She will have to stay in the basket for quite a while, and it can be a very stressful experience for a cat. Take some time to make it comfortable with her favourite blanket.Let her get used to the basket before you try to get her to go into it.You can do this by leaving the basket out in the house for a few days before the move. You can even put a little piece of dried food in there to encourage her in.

, Moving is stressful for everyone, your cat included. While all the packing is taking place keep your cat in one room with everything she needs. When it comes to the day of the move it is especially important to isolate your cat from the stress and noise.Consider using Feliway, a calming pheromone product for cats, starting two weeks before the move, allowing it plenty of time to take effect.
Keep her in one room, which should be kept closed off all day. Make sure everybody knows that the cat is in there and it must remain closed.
It's advisable to put her into the room the night before the move and keep her in there overnight.

, Before you bring your cat into your new house, you should prepare a room that you will keep her in for the first few days. Make sure the room is fully equipped with all her favourite toys and blankets. You also need to have enough food and water, as well as a litter tray, and all food and water dishes.


Cat rely on scent, so putting furniture in the room that smells of you can also help.
Put a sign on the door and tell the movers not to open it, a panicked cat could make a run for it.
You should also make sure all your family know which room you are keeping the cat in when you move.

, Your cat should be the last thing you move. Once you have moved all the boxes and furniture, bring your cat in in her basket. Take her into the room you have prepared, but keep her in her basket while there is still a lot of comings and goings.

, Once the move is complete and a semblance of normality is returning you can ease your cat into her new surroundings. The key to helping her successfully acclimate to the new house is to move gradually. You should keep her in the one room for the first few days, but you can let her out of her basket to explore the room once the moving noise has died down.When you open up the cage or basket spend some time sitting with her in the room to help put her at ease. Give her some food or treats.
Don't worry if she goes and hides in a corner or under a bed somewhere, she is just taking time to adjust to her new surroundings. Be patient with her and don't try to force her out of cover.

, After a couple of days you can begin to allow your cat to explore some more of the house. After making sure that all potential routes outside are closed and secured, invite her to have a look around a few more rooms. Gradually allowing access to other spaces will help to lower her anxiety.Keep an eye on her when you allow her to explore more and be on-hand to comfort or play with her if she appears stressed.
If you have a cat-leash you could use it to make sure she is unable to make a run for it. If your cat is not used to a leash this could just make her even more stressed out.

, You can use a plug-in pheromone diffuser to release scents that are designed to calm stressed cats. You can buy these from your local pet store or vet, and they help to create a more reassuring environment after a move.It is a particularly good idea to use one in the room your cat will be spending a lot of time in at the start.
Different cats will react in different ways to these diffusers and some may not react at all. You could keep some catnip handy as an alternative.

, It's important to be relaxed around her, and to allow her plenty of time to adjust to her new surroundings. She might take a while to get back to her old personality, becoming more withdrawn or quiet after the move. Showing patience and sensitivity will help to reduce any anxieties and create a comfortable and welcoming environment., While you gradually introduce her to her new house, it's important that you don't allow her to get outside yet. Keep her in the house for two weeks so she can become fully acclimated to her new surroundings before you let her out.Spending this long in the new house helps to establish it as her new base, and lower the chances of her trying to make her way back to the old house.Take extra care to make sure your don't leave doors or windows open in this period and generally be observant and careful.
If you have a very adventurous cat who is desperate to go outdoors, don't give in. Keep her in for a minimum of two weeks; the amount of time depends on the disposition of the individual cat.

, When you are ready to introduce your cat to your back garden the same rule of gradual exposure applies. If you can, block off a small area of your garden to do this. Let her into this closed off area to be exposed to the sights and sounds of your garden.An enclosed space should be one where there is no chance of her getting out to a road or escaping over a fence into a neighbouring garden.
When you take her out you should stay close to her and be attentive.

, If she doesn't want to go outside, then she is probably still adjusting to the new house and is not yet completely comfortable. The adjustment period can vary so don't force her outside, this will only stress her out more. Be patient and let her go at her own speed., Take her out into the garden for short periods and let her explore. Keep a close eye on her at all times, and take a toy and a couple of treats to help put her at ease. Start with short periods and gradually increase them as she becomes more accustomed. Begin with a few minutes at a time and go from there.Always ensure there is an easy route back into the house if she gets spooked or wants to dash back in. Leave a door wide open for her and don't block it off.

Keep your cat’s blankets, toys, beds, food, and water out until moving day to keep them in their natural state for as long as possible.,
Pack the cats belongings, extra food, and water in a set aside empty box the day of the move.,
Before the move make sure to take your cat to the veterinarian and make sure that your vet issues any vaccinations or procedures needed, so that you have a fresh start for your move and updated records.

,
Get copies of the updated records and keep them accessible while in transit.

,
When you begin to pack your belongings, the best non-threatening way, is to pack and empty one room at a time.",How to Pack and Move Your Cat1," ;
, This helps to put their nerves at ease for as long as possible. 

,,, After one is completed place your cat inside the room along with it’s travel crate, bedding, toys, food, and water. This process allows your cat to feel accustomed to its crate and its new room/home throughout the packing process.

Pick a new spot for the mother and kittens.,
Make a new nest once your spot is chosen.,
Line the container with a clean, thick towel, blanket, or discarded clothing.,
Have the mother come out of her current spot by enticing her with some tasty treat.,
Pick the kittens up out of their old nest, making sure to securely handle them to prevent them from falling to the floor.,
Have the mother follow you into the new spot.,
Keep newborn kittens and the mother in place.,
Leave the family alone for a few days to allow them to adjust.",How to Move Newborn Kittens," Ask yourself some questions prior to the move. Can you close the new area off to keep the mother from moving the kittens? Will the area be able to hold a litter box for the mother so she can relieve herself? Is there a safe spot (well away from the litter box) to place her water and food bowls?


The chosen area also need to be quiet. This means away from the general hub-bub of the house, out of reasonable earshot of televisions, phones, and radios.
It needs to be out of drafts and if the weather is chilly or the air conditioner on it needs to be at a reasonable temperature: between 75-80 degrees is ideal. Closets in guest or seldom used bedrooms work well, as does a quiet corner of a laundry or mud room. Basements, as long as they are dry and warm, are also a good choice to relocate a kitten nest.;
, A sturdy cardboard box as long and wide as the mother cat makes a great nest. Laundry baskets can also make a good nest provided the openings are less than an inch wide. If they are any bigger the kittens can potential slip through putting them in danger of injury or chilling.

, Place it in the quiet spot, then set up the cat’s litter box, food and water bowls. You want to make the spot inviting for the mother cat just as much as you want to make the nest safe and warm for the kittens.

, Small bits of cooked chicken or a tablespoon of canned tuna might work. You want to lure her out of the nest but you also don't want to take her completely away. It's important for her to see what you are doing, but from a small distance.

, Kittens cry when being handled to attract the mother’s attention. Don’t let their mews discourage you from moving them to a safe spot., Let her watch as you set the kitten down. She should be allowed to follow the kittens into the new nest.


Some mother cats resent having their kittens touched and may be aggressive. Wear long sleeves, pants and thick gloves if you suspect the mother might try to protect her kittens when you move them., Once all the kittens and their mother are in the new nest, close the door to the area. Check them infrequently throughout the day to let the family adjust to their new surroundings.The mother cat will probably not like the new spot, and may try to move and hide the kittens again. Keeping this in mind, choose a spot where you can keep the mother from doing so by closing a door.
Feeding the mother tasty treats once or twice a day for a few days may make her more accepting of the new spot.

, Keep the area closed off. The mom cat may be itching to move her kittens at the first opportunity putting her family back at risk. The mother may be upset at first but she should calm down gradually. Make sure she and the kittens have everything they need and that the mother is taking good care of the kittens.

Make sure you add a tag to your cat.,
Decide where your cat is going to be delivered.",How to Ship a Cat2," Most companies will have you fill out a form about you and your animal. Often, this form is also a contract that you will follow the company's guidelines for shipping a pet.Mostly, you will say who's going to be providing the health certificates for your animal and that the company has the authority to charge your card.
You'll also agree to abide by the company's rules, such as providing an appropriate kennel or choosing an appropriate kennel from the company for your pet.

, By USDA regulations, your cat needs to have enough room in its kennel when traveling. It should be able to stand up, turn around, and lay down fully. In other words, it should be half a foot longer and half a foot taller than your pet. When you call or go online for an estimate, use these estimates to choose a kennel size for your cat.In some cases, you will need to provide your own crate. In other cases, the company will provide a kennel for the pet. Check with your company to see what it does., Your vet needs to certify that your cat is in good health for travel. Most vets provide this service, but call ahead of time to find out. Your health certificate must be completed within 30 days of travel for some companies, but always check with the company you're shipping with., In some cases, the shipping company will provide transportation to an airport, where your pet will be put on a plane. In that case, you need to follow the rules for your particular airline, such as providing food and water bowls attached inside the crate or kennel., Call your preferred transport service to set up travel. You can find pet transport services on the internet. Once you pick one, you can talk to a representative to decide how you want your pet to travel.Some services offer ground and air transport, while others only offer air.If you have a snub-nose cat, you'll likely need to send it by ground transport.
Some services also offer private pet transport, meaning your pet will be the only one being transported., Even with trusted transportation services, things happen. Make sure your cat has a collar with your name and number on it so you can be called if the cat is lost and found somewhere else. You might also consider getting your cat microchipped, so someone can find your information even if your cat loses its collar.A microchip is just a tiny chip your vet places under your cat's skin. It can be scanned to provide information from a database. You just need to be sure to update your information online.

, These pet services typically go door to door, so you need to know where your pet is going. If you don't have someone on the other end, you can arrange for a vet to kennel your cat until you arrive to pick him or her up.

Keep your cat indoors for a few weeks.",How to Move with a Cat," Although you will do your best to prevent your cat from getting spooked and running away during the moving process, she may still find a way to bolt. Proper identification will be very useful if someone finds her. Make sure that her ID tag has your mobile number on it, since your landline number will change after the move.If your cat is not already microchipped, take her to the veterinarian to have that done.A microchip is a small device that is implanted just under the skin. If someone finds your cat, they can take her to a veterinarian’s office or animal shelter that can scan the microchip and identify you as her owner.
Preparing ‘lost cat’ flyers is also useful. These flyers should contain a picture of your cat, your cat’s profile, the addresses of your veterinary clinic and local animal shelters, and your contact information. If your cat does run away, having the flyers already prepared will allow you to quickly start posting them in the area.;
, Ensure that your cat is up to date on vaccinations and parasite control. Moving is a stressful process for your cat, so you will want to make sure that she is as healthy as possible. Your veterinarian can administer any necessary vaccinations and provide you with more parasite control.While you are at the veterinarian's office, ask for a copy of your cat’s medical records. This is especially important if you will need to switch veterinary offices after you move.Having a copy of your cat’s medical records will make it easier for the new veterinarian to know your cat’s full medical history.
Talk with your veterinarian about anti-anxiety medication. Depending on your cat’s temperament, she may need medication to reduce her anxiety during the move. Your veterinarian can discuss what medications are available and how you should administer them, if necessary., If you are traveling cross-country with your cat, you will probably need to spend the night at a hotel. Finding a hotel that accepts cats may be challenging, though, since not all pet-friendly hotels accept cats. Even if the hotel accepts cats, it may not have pet-friendly rooms available when you are moving. In addition, pet-friendly hotels could charge you an expensive convenience fee.When you arrive at the hotel room, cat-proof the room as much as you can before letting your cat out of her carrier. The room will be unfamiliar to her, and she could easily find a place to hide or crawl under (under or behind the bed, under a chair).It may be best to keep your cat in your hotel room's bathroom, and set up the room as you did when you moved out of your old home. Leave her carrier in the bathroom with her., Start getting your cat comfortable with her carrier several weeks prior to the move. You can use either a hard-top or soft-top carrier. The hard-top carrier is more sturdy, but you may need the soft-top carrier if you are flying to your new destination and plan to carry her with you on the plane.Make the carrier look inviting by leaving its door open and placing her bed and some treats inside.Encourage her to spend time in the crate by feeding her meals in the crate.Place a blanket over the carrier to make it look like a safe hideaway to your cat, which will be helpful on moving day.Reward her with a treat each time that she goes in the crate. Doing this creates a positive association with the crate.Ride with her when she is in the carrier. Start with placing her in the car with you without driving. When you see that she can remain calm in the car when it's not moving, take her on short drives, then longer drives. Reward her with treats each time that she stays calm in her crate while she’s in the car with you., The sight of moving boxes may be enough to make your cat very anxious. In the weeks before the move, set out some empty moving boxes for her to explore and get comfortable with. If she seems extra wary of the boxes, try spraying some cat pheromones (available at your local pet store) on the corners of the boxes; the scent of these pheromones should encourage her to explore the boxes.Giving her time to explore the boxes can end up being play time for her, which will help reduce her anxiety with the move., Preparing to move means that you will be busy packing boxes and running errands. Even with these changes in your schedule, make sure that you keep your cat’s routine as consistent as you can to reduce her anxiety with the move. For example, continue to feed and play with her at the same time each day.If you see that she is getting increasingly anxious even with a consistent routine, you could try to increase your play time with her., On moving day, people will constantly be moving from room to room and going in and out of the door. This level of commotion will make your cat extremely anxious. Keeping her in a separate room will protect her from the commotion. To make the room comfortable for her, put her food bowl, water bowl, litter box, toys, and bed in the room.Place her in the room before you start the actual process of moving. Once she is comfortably settled in the room, place a sign on the door advising people to keep the door closed.The bathroom is a good place to put her, since people will not need to go in and out of the bathroom.
You may also want to put her carrier in the cat-safe room, since she will have become comfortable with it at this point.
If you are not moving far away, you may want to consider boarding her for the day of the move. Discuss this option with your veterinarian., Your cat will probably be anxious on moving day and may not want to eat. Even if this is the case, offer a small amount of food at her usual feeding time so that her stomach doesn’t get upset later in the day., You can do this either when she is in the cat-safe room or when you prepare to put her in the car. Make sure that you keep the carrier door closed until you are in a closed room inside your new home. Although it may be tempting to open the carrier door beforehand to soothe her, her fear and anxiety may cause her to bolt., Do this before you begin unloading and unpacking your things. Prepare this room like you did before, but also place her scratching post in the room with her. Open the carrier door and scatter some treats throughout the room to encourage her to come out of her carrier and explore the room.Even after the hustle and bustle of moving day is over, keep her in the cat-safe room for a few extra days.It will probably take those extra days for her to calm down and feel more comfortable in her new environment.
Spend some extra time with her in the room. You can play and interact with her, but also do quiet activities in the room, such as reading., While your cat is in the cat-safe room, make sure that the rest of the home will be safe for your cat to explore and acclimate to. Make sure that there are no pest traps, since these traps contain pesticides that are toxic. Hide electrical cords, ensure that the window screens are secure, and cover any nooks where you cat may hide and get stuck.Set up multiple litter boxes throughout your home, especially if your new home has multiple levels.
Place her scent around the house. To do this, put a clean sock on your hand and gently rub the sock against her cheek to get her pheromones. Rub the sock against the corners of furniture at her eye level. Do this several times before you let her out of the cat-safe room. When she comes out, she’ll recognize her scent as if she’s already marked her new territory., Your cat may be tempted to mark her territory in your new home. Having familiar scratching posts and her favorite toys throughout the home will encourage her to scratch and play with what's familiar to her and not find new areas to scratch or mark., Your cat may feel too anxious to eat much while she's getting used to her new environment. Even if she may not feel like eating, feeding her small and frequent meals on a regular schedule will help her feel some sense of normalcy and routine in the new home. In addition, the frequency of meals will increase the amount of time that you spend with her, which will also help reduce her anxiety.Feed her these meals in the cat-safe room.
Establishing regular schedules for playing and sleeping will also her acclimate to her new home., Give her plenty of time and space to explore her new environment. Even after a few days, she may still be anxious, so let her get comfortable at her own pace. Offer her treats as she explores and give her access to some of her favorite toys.Offer her hiding or resting places, such as cat tunnels, where she can go while she is exploring.It may be helpful to introduce her to one room at a time, rather than having her explore the entire house at once.Keep a litter box in the cat-safe room until your cat becomes acclimated to the entire home. That room will still be her sanctuary for a while, so allow her to continue using the litter box in that room for several weeks., This is important if your cat was indoor/outdoor or fully outdoors. The outdoor environment will be just unfamiliar as the inside of your new home, so letting her out too soon may cause her to run away.If you would like to let her outside, consider putting a cat leash on her, which you can find at your local pet store.


You can also purchase a cat-safe enclosure for your cat to be in while she is outside, which will protect her from predators.It may be helpful to scatter some of your cat's used litter around your house before you let her outside. This will help your cat feel like she's in a familiar area when she's outside and will let other neighborhood cats know that there is a new cat."

Wait until your kitten is enthusiastic and curious about the outdoors.,
Create sections of the day where he gets to go outside and slowly get more used to it.,
Once he is familiar with the backyard let him go outside by himself.,
Try to protect them from the road and traffic.,
If you live on a less busy road, skip leashing him.",How to Introduce Your Kitten to the Outdoors Safely," Don't force them to go outside if they're not ready. Slowly ease into it. Once you see that your kitten is ready for the outdoors keep the back door open a smidge and let him wander over to it. Once he gets outside he'll probably already be sniffing and adjusting to the new location and smells.;
, Keep the sections from 5-10 minutes. Make it part of his routine so he becomes more eager to go outside by himself.

, Sill be aware that he is outside but don't keep a close eye on him. Eventually after he has had several sessions with being outside by himself. Let him freely go in and outside whenever he wants.

, The hardest part of letting your kitten go outside is letting them be exposed to the road. Some will only let their kittens out the back. But if you want your kitten to also freely go out the front. Here is what to do. If you live on a very busy road first put him on a leash. He will be able to become familiar with the new smells but not vulnerable enough to get hit by a car. Still keep a close eye on him but let him explore without the leash. Slowly become less aware of him going out the front and start to pay little to no attention. Then let him explore by himself. It will take a while to get used to. But eventually your kitten will be able to go outside, freely whenever he wants.

, Still keep a very close eye on him especially when cars go past, but let him explore by himself. When he gets tired or bored he will come inside because he doesn't know where else to go. Eventually let him go outside whenever he wishes (out and front.) Soon you will realise that letting him explore on his own was the best decision you ever made.

Choose a reliable carrier.,
Make the carrier as comfortable as possible.,
Put the carrier in the back seat of your car.,
Try to make the ride as comfortable as possible.,
Keep the temperature comfortable inside your car.,
Try to maintain some shade in the car.,
Consider purchasing a cooling body mat.,
Have your cat wear a collar with an ID tag.,
Get your cat acclimated to car travel before long trips.,
Pack a kitty travel kit.,
Give your cat a light meal before a long trip.,
Try to hide the fact that you'll be traveling.",How to Keep a Cat Safe in the Car," The first step to ensuring your cat has a safe trip in the car, no matter how long the drive may be, is to buy a sturdy and well-ventilated cat carrier. Your cat cannot safely roam the car, as it could easily get underneath the brake pedal, burrow into the underside of a seat, or even hop out the window. You'll need a carrier that will stand up to travel wear and tear but will also allow your pet to have a constant flow of air to prevent overheating.A good carrier should be strong, somewhat lightweight, and secure.
Avoid cardboard carriers, as these are practically useless. If your cat has an accident inside, the carrier will rapidly deteriorate.
You'll want to make sure your cat can comfortably sit or lie down in the crate, but you don't want it so big that your cat will tumble around inside.
An ideal carrier opens from the top. This will make it easier to get your cat into the carrier and reach in to feed or pet your cat without allowing for an easy escape.
Make sure the carrier is well-ventilated so that your cat does not overheat on the trip.;
, The hard plastic or wire mesh of a cat carrier isn't particularly comfortable for your cat to spend extended amounts of time on. If you're going on a longer road trip, making the carrier comfortable is even more important to ensure that your cat doesn't get sore or injured. Padding the carrier will also help lock in any accidents your cat might have, ensuring that your car doesn't end up smelling or getting stained.Put down a layer of newspapers on the floor of the carrier. Then put down a soft towel so your cat will have something comfortable to sit or lie on.
The newspaper and towel will help absorb any accidents your cat might have on the trip while also giving your cat some extra padding against the carrier.
If you want, you can also put down a plastic liner to help contain accidents.
Make sure nothing blocks the flow of air into and out of your cat's carrier.
Check the lock on the carrier gate. Make sure your cat will not be able to escape from the carrier unless you open it yourself.

,

Add some toys in the carrier to make your cat feel less stressed. The best place to situate your cat is in the back seat of your car. If you have some boxes or suitcases you can arrange on either side to stabilize the carrier, that might help give your pet an even sturdier ride. If you don't have anything to put on the sides, you might want to put the carrier on the floor - just make sure that your cat will still get a steady stream of cool air (or warm air, depending on the climate and time of year).Make sure the carrier is in a secure spot in the back seat. That way if you have to stop suddenly, you'll know that your cat will remain safe.Depending on the size and shape of the carrier, you could even try using a seatbelt in the back seat to strap the carrier securely in place.
Once your cat is in the carrier and the carrier placed in the car, do not let your cat out for any reason while you're on the road. A cat roaming freely in your car could easily get stuck under the seat, jump out a window, or cause an accident., Once your cat's carrier is settled in, you'll be ready to hit the road. However, even if the carrier is padded, your cat may still have a frightening ride. You can help make the ride as comfortable as possible by watching the road, paying attention to traffic, and avoiding unpleasant bumps and swerves.Try to avoid sudden stops/starts, as this can jostle your cat inside the carrier.
Avoid potholes and big bumps as best you can.
Keep the radio on at a low volume to block out some of the traffic sounds on the road. This can help calm your cat during the drive.
Talk to your cat while you drive. If he or she is meowing or yelling, use a soothing tone to reassure your cat that everything is okay.

, One of the biggest safety hazards to having cats (or any pets) in the car is the risk of extreme weather. It doesn't take much for a car to get hot enough in the summer that an animal could overheat. Even a moderately warm day in the 80 degree Fahrenheit range (26 degrees Celsius) could quickly heat a parked car to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). Having the windows open may not be enough. Because of this, you'll need to take precautions to ensure that your cat does not get exposed to extreme or uncomfortable temperatures.Always keep the air conditioner running in the summer and the heater going in the winter.
Never leave your cat unattended in a parked car. If you're traveling with someone, leave the car running with the air conditioning on and take turns going into rest stops so that someone is always with the cat.
Remember that high humidity levels can also overheat your pet. Keep an eye on the outside temperature and the humidity level, both where you are and where you'll be traveling to.

, If your cat's carrier is in direct sunlight, even with the air conditioner going, it can still become dangerously hot for your pet. Try to keep the carrier in the shade if at all possible, but remember to make sure that the carrier's gate is not blocked so that air can still circulate through the carrier.If you do stop anywhere, try to park in the shade. This should be done in addition to having someone stay in the car with the air conditioner on.

, If you plan on traveling through extremely hot areas, like a desert, or through extremely humid regions, you may need to take extra precautions. Having the air conditioner on will certainly help, but having a cooling body mat can help give your pet some added protection against the heat and humidity.Cooling mats may rely on a refrigerated component that is inserted into the mat, or they be water-activated.
Some cooling body mats stay cool for up to three days while also remaining dry. This can be important when cooling off a cat.
You can purchase a cooling body mat at many pet stores, or though an online retailer.

, Even if your cat is an indoor pet, it's a good idea to have your cat wear a collar with an ID tag for the entire trip. That way, on the off chance that your cat manages to escape, it's more likely that someone will find and return your cat if it's clear that the cat has a home.The ID tag on your cat's collar should have your name and cell phone number. Remember that a landline phone number won't help you if you're on the road.
Consider getting your cat microchipped. This can help a veterinarian or animal control worker identify your cat and access your contact information, in case your cat manages to slip off the collar somehow.

, Traveling in a car can be scary for cats. They often associate being in a car with going to the veterinarian, which is usually an unpleasant trip for cats. Because of this, you'll want to get your cat adjusted to safe, pleasant car rides before taking him or her on a longer road trip.Go for a series of short drives with your cat. Try to go a few times each week, and start preparing your cat a few weeks in advance.
Remember that even the sound of a car engine starting could frighten your cat. Be patient and try to get your cat acclimated well before you plan on making your longer trip.Try to lengthen the duration of your drive a little longer each time. Aim to add about 15 to 30 minutes every trip.

, Even if you're not going very far, it's generally a good idea to be prepared in case a short trip gets extended. Driving in winter can easily force you to spend the night somewhere, for example, and it's best to make sure your cat has everything he or she would need.Some basics to pack include:


any medication your cat might need
cat food
several bottles of water
a food dish
a water bowl
a litter box and litter
a waste scoop

, Because riding in a car can be traumatic for cats and may cause them to lose their appetite, it's best to make sure your cat eats before traveling on a long car trip. That way your cat will have enough time to digest the food and use the litter box.Feed your cat three to four hours before you plan on leaving.
Make sure you only give your cat a light meal. Aim for about half of what you would normally feed your cat for breakfast or dinner (depending on when you'll be traveling).

, If your cat isn't used to car trips, or if your cat has had a traumatic car trip in the past, the sight of your car could set off a panic in your pet. The best way to avoid this problem is by hiding the fact that you'll be traveling from your cat.Choose a breathable cloth (like mesh) and drape the cloth over your cat's carrier before you carry it out to the car.
Once you're inside the car, rearrange the cloth (if possible) so that it allows your cat to see you straight ahead, but surrounds the perimeter of the carrier's gate to block out the sky and the ground.

Use a swaddle or pheromone wipes to lower your cat’s anxiety.",How to Transport Cats by Plane1," Contact the airline you are planning to fly with to check if you can transport your cat in the airport cabin in carrier under the seat in front of you. Avoid transporting your cat in the cargo or luggage hold if possible. Most airlines will allow you to take your cat on the plane in the cabin area for a small fee. Try to call the airline well in advance of your flight, as there is a limited number of animals allowed in the cabin during a flight.;
, Some airlines restrict how many pets can travel in the cabin on a particular flight. Booking your flight early will ensure there is a spot for your cat. When choosing your seat, keep in mind you will not be able to sit in an exit row or against the bulkhead, as there must be a seat in front of you for the carrier.

, The airline should be able to provide you with the exact dimensions of the space under the airline seat. This will dictate the size of your transport carrier for your cat., Most airlines will accept either hard-sided carriers or soft-sided carriers. Soft-sided travel carriers are easier to slide under the airline seat space. But only certain brands of soft-sided carriers are allowed by certain airlines. So check which types and brands are permitted in the cabin before you buy a carrier.


A month before your trip, feed your cat in the carrier so he associates it with a positive activity. Play with your cat in the carrier and allow him to lounge or rest in the carrier. This will make it seem as welcoming as possible.

, This will help him get more comfortable with the carrier and ensure it becomes part of his routine. Practicing getting in and out of the carrier will be good preparation for the security checks, when your cat will need to get in and out of the carrier on command.

, You will need to ask your vet for vaccination records for your cat and a health certificate for travel. These documents are required by the airline to allow your cat to fly.Your vet should give you a health certificate that confirms your cat is in good health and free of parasites. All your cat’s vaccinations should also be up to date, including his Rabies vaccination.Your vet may also suggest implanting a microchip into your cat that will make it easier to locate him if he goes missing during travel. It acts as your pet's ID for life. Microchipping your pet is a simple procedure, where your vet injects a microchip the size of a grain of rice (12mm) under the surface of your pet's skin, between his shoulder blades. It does not hurt your pet and no anesthetic is required., Traveling with a cat that has an empty stomach will limit the risk of nausea and vomiting. You can carry some of your cat’s food with you, in case he gets incredibly hungry on the flight.


Don’t forget to also carry any medication your cat might be on in a clear plastic bag.

, This will soak up any accidents by your cat during travel. Keep extra pads, a few zip lock bags, paper towels, and latex gloves for any necessary cleanup and containment of an accident.

, This will help to identify him in case the carrier gets lost in transit or in the airport. Put your name, permanent address, telephone number, and final destination on the tag.

, Your cat’s travel carrier must go through the luggage x-ray screening device at the airport, but your cat cannot. So you will need to attach a harness to your cat with a leash to prevent him from escaping. You should then carry your cat in your arms through the human screening device.Before you take your cat out of the carrier, prepare yourself and your belongings for screening. Remove your shoes, toiletries, and electronics and place them in bins to go through the x-ray machine.
Remove your cat from the carrier, keeping him in the harness, and send the carrier through the machine.
Carry the cat as you go through the human screening device. Then, find the carrier and safely place your cat inside before gathering your belongings.

, Most cats can travel well without any medication. But some cats can experience tremendous stress during air travel. Talk to your vet if you are concerned about your cat’s anxiety levels when flying.Your vet might prescribe Buprenorphine, Gabapentin, or Alprazolam for your cat. Be sure to give your cat a dose at home before the flight as a “dry run” to make sure your cat does not react negatively to the medication.

, If you want to avoid medicating your cat, you can try a Thundershirt, which swaddles your cat, much like swaddling an infant, to reduce anxiety.You can also use pheromone wipes or spray on the carrier before the flight to lower his anxiety levels.
There are also pheromone calming collars available that you can buy to calm down your cat for the flight.

Most U.S. airlines are required to report all companion animal incidents that occur in the cargo hold.Look at the performance record of the airline you are planning to fly with. If possible, choose an airline with a low number of companion animal incidents in the cargo hold.


Animals flown in the cargo area of airplanes are killed, injured, or lost on commercial flights each year. Excessively hot or cold temperatures in the cargo area, as well as poor ventilation and rough handling are often to blame for these incidents.However, many cargo holds are now pressurized and have a certain level of climate control. Talk to the airline about any safety features in the cargo hold that will make your cat's travel more comfortable.

, This will cut down on the amount of security checks you and your cat will have to go through. It will also lower the delay time of getting your pet off the plane, especially if your pet is traveling in the cargo hold.Always travel on the same flight as your pet. You can confirm this by asking the airline if you can watch your pet being loaded into the cargo hold before getting on the flight.
Look for early morning or late evening flights if you are traveling in the summer as this will be the cooler times of the day and make the cargo hold less hot and stuffy for your cat. Choose afternoon flights if you are traveling in the winter, as it will be less chilly in the cargo hold for your cat.

, Look for a collar that can’t get caught in the carrier doors. Put your name, home address, telephone name, and final destination on the collar.You should also put a travel label on the carrier with the same information in the event the carrier, and your cat, get lost during travel.

, This will protect your cat’s nails from getting hooked in the carrier’s doors, holes, and other crevices in the cargo area., You will need to ask your vet for vaccination records for your cat and a health certificate for travel.

Your shelter or breeder may be able to lend you a carrier for your first trip home.
Ask your shelter or breeder for a blanket or towel that your cat has been sleeping with to put in the carrier. The familiar smell will be comforting to your cat on its trip to your home.;
, Your cat or kitten will obviously need to eat and eliminate waste the day you bring it home, so be prepared by having all of the essentials you will need. These include food and water dishes, a litter box, and a supply of kitty litter.


Kittens grow a lot in their first year, and they have specific dietary and nutritional needs. If you’re adopting a kitten, be sure to buy specially formulated kitten food.You may want to talk with your shelter or breeder and select the same type of food and litter your cat or kitten is already used to, at least for the first few weeks. You can gradually add in different types so your cat doesn’t face too many changes at once.

, While some cats may be happy to sleep on other furniture in the house, they will feel more secure and comfortable if they have their own bed. You can choose a bed as simple as a cat-sized pillow, blanket, or mat or a nest-type bed that will help keep your cat warm while sleeping. Cats like to sleep off of the floor, so place your cat’s bed on top of a chair or table. Be cautious about this with very young kittens or elderly cats. This may increase their risk for injury.
If you have more than one cat, providing a bed for each of them will help ease territorial issues.
You may need to move the location of the cat’s bed a few times before you find a place that your cat prefers.

, It can be easy to forget about these if you haven’t had a cat before, but they are important for making your new pet feel at home.


Make sure any cat toys you buy don’t have small pieces that can be easily eaten by your cats.
Similarly, steer clear of toys with strings or ribbon on them. If these become loose, your cat can swallow them. Keep rubber bands and elastic away from your cats as well because they can swallow these and choke on them or sustain intestinal injuries from them.

, You will want to make sure your new cat or kitten is in good health as soon as it becomes yours, so find and schedule a visit with a veterinarian as soon as possible. It is best if you can take your cat to the veterinarian before you even bring it home.


Your veterinarian will check for pests like ear mites, fleas, and worms.
Your cat or kitten will also receive any vaccinations it needs.
Keep in mind that kittens can be spayed or neutered as early as eight weeks, but ideally before 6 months of age. However, spaying or neutering is a wise idea at any age after eight weeks.

, Animals can easily transmit parasites or diseases to one another. To prevent this from happening as much as possible, make sure your resident pets are up to date on their vaccinations before introducing a new cat or kitten to your home.

, It can be overwhelming for your new cat or kitten to get used to the unfamiliar environs of your house or apartment. To help ease this transition, place your cat’s food and water bowls and litter box in a quiet space in your home, maybe even a room with a door that can be closed.How long you keep the cat in this temporary location is up to your pet. Often, cats are comfortable to explore the rest of your house after a few days, but some cats may take more time. Carefully watch your pet to see when it is ready to explore.Once your cat is used to you and your home, you can place these essential items in a more convenient location.
Keep the temporary location available for your cat to re-enter if it is overwhelmed when venturing out.Keep a supply of cat toys and a scratching post in this room as well.
Since cats like to hide when scared, it is helpful to have some furniture or empty boxes in this room to provide a hideaway.

, Welcoming a cat or kitten into your home is like bringing home a curious toddler. Nearly anything visible or reachable can provoke curiosity, so be sure to remove any breakables or items that can be easily knocked over before bringing home your new friend.Check your houseplants to be sure they aren’t poisonous if eaten by your cat.
Be fastidious about keeping your floors and surfaces of anything your cat or kitten may ingest, like rubber bands, thread, or string. These can cause intestinal blockages.
Keep your toilet covers and dryer doors closed. Also, check the dryer before putting laundry into and watch to ensure your cat or kitten does not go into the dryer. They may be seriously injured or even killed from being shut inside of a dryer while it is running.
Tie up or securely anchor window shade or blind cords so your cat can’t be strangled.
Use covers for your electric outlets and bundle and stow away electric cords so your cat won’t chew on them.
Pay attention when using recliners as well. Cats and kittens my go up inside of a recliner when the footrest is extended, and they may be seriously injured or killed by the mechanism in the recliner if you put the footrest back down while they are under there. Be sure you know where your cat or kitten is at before putting the footrest back down.

, Once you arrive home with your new pet, go to the room you have prepared for your cat. Place the carrier there on the floor and open the door to the carrier. Let your cat come out on its own timetable.Do not coax your cat. This can cause unnecessary stress.
Try to maintain a sense of calm and quiet during this process.
You can leave the cat alone in this room, or you can sit quietly in a corner (maybe while reading a book) while waiting for your cat to emerge.

, If your cat approaches you and seems interested in you petting it, go ahead. Otherwise, just remain calm and give your pet time to explore and adjust.Use slow, controlled movements when near your cat. Sudden movements or loud noises can easily startle your new family member., Your children have probably been dreaming about having a cat for as long as they can remember, and they will be excited to have it home at last. However, you need to make sure your child is ready to interact with this new family member so that everyone remains safe.


Children need to be told not to chase the cat, pull on it, or tease it.
Remind your child to be gentle when petting the cat.
Instruct your children to wash their hands after playing with the cat to avoid transferring germs.
Have your child offer the cat or kitten a treat the first time they meet.

, Both your new pet and your resident cat or dog will need to adjust. Give your resident pet extra attention, so it doesn’t feel stressed or anxious about the new family member.Stay in the room when introducing your pets, so you can be close by if a problem arises.
If there is any hissing or growling when your pets encounter each other, separate them and try to get them together again a few days later.
Make sure your dog is leashed the first few times it encounters your cat. Dogs can be aggressive, and kittens may lurch for your dog’s face.
Have treats for all of your pets on hand when introducing them so you can reward good behavior.

, Cats bury their waste by nature, so training your cat to use its litter box will be easy. You can place your cat or kitten in the litter box every hour or so, or after meals or naps, to show it where it is.


Remember cats do not like to eat next to their litter box, so allow some separation between the two.
If you have a dog, keep the litter box out of its reach so the dog doesn't eat the cat’s feces or scare the cat from relieving itself.

Don't take on too much responsibility.,
Consider your financial situation.,
Take the size of your home into consideration.,
Keep your personal happiness and well-being in mind.",How to Avoid Owning Too Many Cats1," In order to avoid owning too many cats, you need to think about the responsibility and time it takes to care for a cat. The care and responsibility required for multiple cats can be overwhelming and no longer fun. With this in mind, consider not taking on too much responsibility and only having as many cats as you can easily care for.

For some people, caring for one cat is their limit. For others, having multiple cats is not too much responsibility. It all depends on the individual.
It is a sign of animal hoarding when you can no longer care for the health and safety of your cats because of their sheer number. When you get too many cats, it is just too overwhelming and time consuming to take care of all of them properly.;
, If you want to avoid owning too many cats, you need to think about how much each may cost you. On average, one cat can cost you between $300 and $1200 a year, depending on the cost of veterinary bills, food, and care items. With this in mind, assess whether you can afford having more cats than you already do.Part of avoiding having too many cats is knowing your limits. It may be that you can't afford more than one cat and getting a second cat would cost you too much. Other people can easily afford to have multiple cats.

, If you want to avoid getting too many cats, you need to understand how many cats will fit comfortably in your specific home. The number of cats you can have depends greatly on your space because you want to assure that your cats can get alone time, that they can run and bounce around, and that you have space for their beds, litter boxes, and toys.Some people say that you should never have more cats than you have bedrooms in your home. This idea allows cats that don't get along to easily stay away from each other and prevents your home from feeling too crowded.
Some argue that for each cat you should have 200 square feet. This would typically allow for more cats than the number of bedrooms scheme but would still give each cat a bit of its own space.

, Having a cat can greatly improve your life and your happiness. However, having too many cats can negatively impact your life and your happiness. If your cats already take up a lot of your time and you avoid social engagements, having people over, or other things that would make you happy because of your cats, consider avoiding getting any more of them.If you are considering getting another cat but you are hesitant, try erring on the side of caution and not getting it. Instead, spend the time you would have spent on a new cat with your existing cats or with friends and family.

Assess whether you are caring for your cats adequately.,
Determine if you can keep your home clean.,
Assess whether your home is overcrowded.,
Consider whether the number of cats you have negatively impacts your life.",How to Avoid Owning Too Many Cats2," In order to care for a cat properly, you need to provide it with food, socialization, health care, and affection. If you have so many cats that you are not able to provide all of these things for all of your cats, then you have too many cats.It may be that you simply don't have the time to give all of your cats the love and affection that they deserve. If this is the case, then you probably have too many cats.
One limitation to caring for your cats properly is your financial situation. If you can't afford enough cat food or veterinary care for all of your cats, then you have too many cats. If you can't pay for your own needs and your cat's needs, then you have too many cats.

, It is important for your and your cats' health that you keep your house clean. This can become difficult when you have too many cats. If you find that your home is not as clean as you wish it was, then you may have too many cats.

Many people who have too many cats find it hard, or impossible, to clean their cat's litter boxes often enough. This can lead cats to go to the bathroom elsewhere, leading to an even bigger cleanliness problem in the home.
If you are unable to keep the smell of the cats at bay, even with regular cleaning, then you have too many cats in your home., Determining whether you have too many cats depends on how big your home is and whether there is space for all people and pets in that home. If you are tripping over cats constantly and there is no room for the cats to get away from each other, then your home is overcrowded and you may have too many cats.On the other hand, if your cats have space away from each other and you are not constantly on top of each other, then you may have enough space for your number of cats.
One clear sign that you own too many cats is if you don't know the exact number of cats in your home., Having too many cats can be overwhelming and it can make you feel isolated and alone. If you are happy and healthy and you have multiple cats that you care for well, then you probably don't have too many cats. However, if you have multiple cats and you are stressed out and overwhelmed by their care, then you probably have too many.

For example, if you are neglecting your social life or your health because of your cats, then you may have too many cats.

Make sure that your cat is healthy enough for travel.,
Get a carrier.The safest place for your cat to be while traveling in a car is in a designated cat carrier.,
Get your cat used to its carrier.Leave the carrier in your home near one of your cat’s favorite places, with its door or flap open so that your cat can enter.,
Try short trips first.If you know that your cat will accompany you on an upcoming long drive, take it on some short trips first.,
Pack a cat traveling kit.When traveling, you’ll want to make sure that your cat has all of its regular essentials, as well as any supplies specifically needed for traveling.,
Collar your cat.As a precaution, get a tag made for your cat that lists your phone number, and your home and destination addresses.,
Feed your cat before starting the trip.Your cat should have a light meal three to four hours before your trip begins.,
Place your cat in its carrier.,
Keep your cat comfortable.During your journey, make sure that your car stays at a comfortable temperature, and that your cat’s carrier stays out of direct sunlight.,
Consider using pheromones.,
Consider nutraceuticals supplements.,
Consider using pharmaceutical sedatives.,
Keep it quiet.Most cats will appreciate you keeping it quiet in the car when traveling.,
Make periodic rest stops.Stop every now and then to check and make sure that your cat is comfortable, and to see if it needs food or water.,
Stay with your cat.Never leave your cat unattended in a car.,
Reward your cat at the end of the journey.",How to Drive Long Distance With a Cat," Trips in a car can be physically and emotionally stressful on cats. Before you embark on yours, have your veterinarian review your cat’s health and make sure it is healthy enough to travel.You can also discuss with your vet whether or not feline sedatives are a good idea while traveling with your cat.These can calm some felines, but your cat may react badly to the medicines, or it may wear off during the trip. Never give your cat a sedative designed for humans.;
, You cat may not enjoy being in the carrier, but it will protect it from harm while you are on the road. Choose one that is:Well-ventilated
Large enough for your cat to sit, stand, turn around, and lay down in
Made of a sturdy material, whether soft (cloth or mesh) or hard (plastic or wire)

, If your cat has time beforehand to inspect the carrier, nap in it, etc., it might feel more comfortable and less stressed in it later on.

, Gradually increase the length of time you are on the road. Hopefully, these short trips will acclimate your cat to being in its carrier and in your car, so that the longer trip goes more smoothly.

, Before you leave on your trip, make sure to pack:


Favorite toys, pillows, blankets, etc.
Food and water
Bowls
A litterbox and litter
A waste scoop and/or plastic bags
Brushes, combs, and other grooming supplies
Any medications your cat takes
A pet first-aid kit (ask your veterinarian about getting one)
Travel papers (showing vaccinations, health records, etc.), if needed in your destination

, If you don’t want your cat to wear a collar and tag normally, this only has to be a temporary one. It is invaluable as a precaution in the event that you and your cat are separated during the trip.


If you wish, you can also have an identifying microchip placed in your cat., That way, your cat won’t go hungry, but won’t be overfed, either.


If you and your veterinarian have decided to give your cat sedatives, make sure to give it a dose prior to your trip, according to instructions.
For trips under two hours, you won’t need to feed your cat on the road. Otherwise, feed it every two to three hours. Your cat may not want to eat or drink while traveling.Don’t feed your cat while moving in your vehicle, as there are risks that it could choke, become sick, or get loose in the vehicle. If you need to feed your cat en route, stop first.

, Make sure that your cat is securely in its carrier before you place it in your car. It may take some coaxing to get your cat to enter and stay in the carrier, so offer it some treats or a favorite toy, and be patient.


Letting your cat loose in the car while traveling is not safe. If your cat is not safely in its carrier, it may crawl to a dangerous place (such as under your feet), or it may become even more stressed.
Only let your cat out of its carrier when you are safely at your destination or a stopping point.

,


The safest place to keep your cat’s carrier is in the backseat.
Don’t leave a car window window down while traveling with your cat.It might try to escape, the noise might bother it, or the wind might make it cold.

, Pheromones can help a cat to settle and feel content. Pheromones are signal-carrying hormones that are released in order to promote a specific response by another member of the same species. In cats, one of these is the feline facial pheromone.


One product that mimics this feline facial pheromone is called Feliway. You can spray it in your car to make your cat feel more comfortable.

, Zylkene is a nutraceutical, which is a food supplement that has a pharmaceutical-like action on the body. Because nutraceuticals are not drugs, they are much safer and rarely have side effects. The active ingredient in Zylkene is derived from milk protein and it acts on the same part of the brain as diazepam. This calms the cat and removes some of her anxiety.


Zylkene is available without prescription and comes in 75 mg capsules. The dose for a cat is a 75 mg capsule once a day, given with or after food. It can take a couple of days to take effect, but if there is no noticeable difference after seven days, it is unlikely to help your cat.

, Sedatives are prescription medications that should only be administered to healthy animals. If your cat’s veterinary appointment is for a routine wellness examination, your veterinarian may prescribe a sedative if your cat’s stress is severe. Do not administer sedatives if you are not sure that your cat is in healthy condition.


Buprenorphine, gabapentin and alprazolam are examples of medications that have recently begun to be used to reduce the anxiety associated with car travel or veterinary visits. If one of these medications is appropriate for your cat’s situation, your veterinarian will prescribe it.
Be sure to ask your veterinarian about the potential side effects in order to properly weigh the pros and cons.

, If you have a stereo on, keep it at a low volume. Keep the windows rolled up to reduce road noise, and try to avoid any excessive traffic noises (such as honking your horn), as these may startle your cat.

, Many rest stops have enclosures for you to let your pet out without having to worry that they will run off. It may also need to use its litterbox. You can also stop and let your cat stretch its legs, as long as you use a harness and leash.

, During hot weather, a parked car can quickly become overheated (even if you crack the windows), which can cause heatstroke or worse. In cold weather, a parked car can become frigid, and your cat could freeze.

, Once you arrive at your destination, don't be surprised if it takes your cat a while to get back to normal; at first, it may only want to run and hide. Give your cat plenty of treats and attention after it calms down.

Do not pick a carrier that is too big or too small.,
Choose a carrier that is 1.5 times bigger than your cat.,
Get an adult sized carrier.",How to Choose a Cat Carrier1," Carriers that are too big will cause your cat to tumble about as your transport it. This is very uncomfortable and unsafe for your cat. On the other hand, your cat my feel cramped inside a small carrier, which may increase the anxiety it is already feeling.It is also hard to balance large carriers as you transport them, especially if your cat is inside.;
, Your cat should be able to lie down, stand up and turn around easily in the carrier. If not, then the carrier is too small.For example, if your cat is 10 inches (25 cm) tall and weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg), then choose a 25-inch (65-cm) tall carrier that can hold 25 to 30 pounds (11.3 to 13.6 kg).
If you plan to travel with your cat, make sure the carrier can comfortably fit your cat and its food and water bowls inside.

, Even if your cat is a kitten, choose a carrier that will be the appropriate size for your cat when it reaches adulthood. While your cat is a kitten, line the carrier with a thick blanket or towel. This will prevent your kitten from sliding in the carrier as you transport it."

Understand that a lot of people may say they have a lot of pedigree cats for sale, but hardly any are proper/hobby breeders, so scams are scarily common!,
Make sure the breed you want will fit in with your lifestyle, budget, home, and other pets/family.,
Research breeders.,
Contact them.,
Wait for them to get in touch.",How to Buy a Pedigree Cat1," Don't worry, if you find a breeder you can't be sure your cat will be fine and everything in order.;
, If you're having trouble finding the right breed for you, then just look up ""What cat breed will fit in with (certain pets, little children, small house, etc.)"" on Google.

, All you need to do is look up, for example; ""British Shorthair breeders in my location."" Look at their website. Check it carefully! Make sure it says the following things:


You can see the mother and/or father. This is extremely important! If you can't see at least one of the parents, you can't be sure they've bred the cat themselves.
It'll be fully weaned, vaccinated, GCCF registered, etc. This is all very necessary. If it doesn't say all this, either move on to a different breeder or proceed with caution!
Be sure they care about their cats and kittens. For example, they might say that they always check out potential buyers, or they don't sell to 'just anyone' to ensure their cats will not be abused/neglected in any way.
If it says all the above, and more good things, they can most likely be trusted.

, Email/ring them. Make sure to include the following information:


Where you live: Near a busy road, big/small house, garden or no garden, etc.
If you have any, tell your children/pets. Say your kids' ages and what kind of other pets you have, and how you think they'd get on with the cat.
What personality and characteristics you'll need your cat to have. Are you an experienced cat owner, or is this your first? Could you cope with a temperamental cat, or will you need it to be steady and calm? Do you want it to be independent and not very sociable, or a lap-cat that loves attention?

, If they don't have a cat for you, find another breeder, or, if you are prepared to, wait for another litter and a suitable cat. If they are interested, and have the perfect kitty for you, schedule a time to visit so you can meet your future companion and discuss prices, etc. Visit the breeder, and if all is well, you can get the cat.

Pick a nylon carrier.,
Try a plastic carrier.,
Limit your use of cardboard boxes.",How to Choose a Cat Carrier2," Nylon or soft carriers are great for cats that are calm when being transported. When purchasing the carrier, place a heavy book or object inside it to make sure the bottom doesn’t sag.If it does, then choose a nylon carrier that has a sturdier base, or choose a plastic carrier instead.

, Plastic carriers are a great choice for anxiety-ridden cats. They are sturdy enough to withstand an anxious cat’s scratching and thrashing. Additionally, plastic carriers with steel doors are much sturdier than ones that have plastic doors.Plastic carriers are also very easy to clean.
If you decide to purchase a plastic carrier, then make sure its handle is strong enough to support your cat’s weight.

, Cardboard boxes cannot withstand an anxious cat’s scratching. They are also very easy to escape from, and a cardboard box will not protect your car seats from urine or water spills. However, if you do not have a carrier and it is an emergency, then use a sturdy cardboard box to transport your cat to the vet.Make sure to place a thick blanket or towel in the bottom of the box, and cut breathing holes into the sides of the box.
Pillowcases and laundry baskets should not be used to transport your cat. Your cat can become injured or escape from these carriers very easily.

Choose a carrier that is well-ventilated.,
Pick a carrier that opens from the top.,
Try a carrier with seatbelt loops.,
Acclimate your cat to its carrier.",How to Choose a Cat Carrier3," Choose a carrier that has openings or windows on at least two sides; however, three openings are preferred. This way, you can prevent your cat from overheating or suffocating inside the carrier., Carriers that open from the top or have a removable top half are extremely helpful if you have a reluctant cat. They make it easier to get your cat in and out of the carrier.They also make it easier for your vet to access your cat, while still making your cat feel comfortable.

, These carriers contain loops that allow you to buckle your cat and its carrier into the car seat. The added security these carriers offer may just be the thing you need to ensure your cat’s safety while you transport it., Do this by leaving the carrier out for your cat to sniff and explore. Place a blanket with your cat's scent in the carrier with some treats to entice your cat to explore the inside. Once your cat goes inside the carrier by itself, reward it with treats and praise.Leave the carrier out at all times so your cat can become familiar with it and associate it with positive experiences.

"
"
Visit them again.,
Get your cat.,
Most cats hate car journeys.,
Before you bring your cat inside, if you didn't know this already, though the breeder might have discussed this with you, cats need their own room when they first move into a new home.,
Your cat should stay in that room for at least a month or so before exploring the rest of the house.

",How to Buy a Pedigree Cat2," Before you do though:


Make sure you have met the breeder and know they are right for you.
Make sure you have seen and reserved the right cat for you, and seen its parent(s).
Make sure you have agreed a price with the breeder (pedigree cats can cost up to £500-£550, any more than this is probably a little overpriced, unless it's a very rare and special breed).

, Make sure all necessary paperwork is taken care of, and take your new companion into your car, in its little carrier.

, This is usually because they are moving, but their body is stationary. This is unsettling for them, so keep checking on your cat to make sure it is managing okay. If you managed to take a blanket/toy belonging to your kitty, put it in your cat's carrier so it will be a bit more relaxed. If you can, (though don't risk anything!), gently stroke your cat to calm it and reassure it that everything is okay before the car drive.

, Just a room, doesn't have to be grand or anything, where they can have some alone time and get settled in. Take the cat into the best room for this purpose, and make sure there's:


Food and water for cats
A scratching post

Some cat toys

A bed with some comfy blankets

Build in a budget for toys.,
Plan for emergency surgery at some point.,
Think about the cost of chronic conditions.,
Factor in boarding costs.,
Determine the cost of a cat sitter.",How to Budget for a New Cat," You need to make sure to factor in the adoption fee of your cat, if there is one. This is important, as fees could range from small to large. Make sure to talk to the shelter or breeder before finalizing your budget.


You may be able to adopt a cat for free from a local animal shelter.
Fees for purebreds, like Siamese cats, can top $300 to $500.;
, Perhaps the largest initial cost you’ll incur when getting a cat is medical bills. Regardless of whether you’re adopting a kitten or a mature cat, you’ll have to take your cat to the vet for an examination and for at least some vaccinations. Some costs include:


Spaying or neutering. This costs anywhere between $100 to $200.
First medical exam. This may run you between $40 and $80.
Initial vaccinations. They could cost between $50 and $100., A big part of your initial budget is going to be cat supplies. Before you even bring your cat home, you’ll have to have a wide variety of items. Some of the initial supplies you may need will include:


Toys for your cat or kitten.
A scratching post or something similar.
A water bowl, food bowl, and litter box.
Grooming accessories like nail clippers, a brush, and a toothbrush and toothpaste., Food costs are the one constant, major, weekly cost you’ll incur as a cat owner. Thus, you should spend some time pricing the cost of food so you can make an informed budget.


The cost of food may vary depending on whether you use wet food, dry food, or a mix of both. Average costs range from $100 to $200 per year.
Like regular food, treat costs vary. They may range from $5 to $40 per year., After your cat’s initial vet visit and vaccination, you’ll also have to pay for yearly exams, vaccinations, and more. Without regular care, your cat won’t be able to have the quality of life you want it to have. Some medical costs include:


Annual vaccinations. These could cost between $35 and $70.
Teeth cleaning. This may cost between $150 and $300.
Examinations. You’ll have to pay exam fees whenever you go to the vet. You should factor in 2 to 3 exams per year, at somewhere between $35 and $70., Your cat will quickly outgrow – or destroy – their initial toys. Thus, you’ll have to continue to buy toys throughout your cat’s life. This is important, as cats need constant stimulation to be properly socialized and fulfilled.


Buy toys they can play with on their own. For example, invest in some stuffed mice or similar toys.
Purchase a few toys you can play with them. A cat fishing pole, with a stuffed mouse or a feather on the end of it will likely entertain you and your friend for hours.
Your toy budget is somewhat discretionary. While you should make sure your cat always has toys, you can shop around for toys and spend as little or as much as you want., While most cat owners don’t want to think about it, you should budget for the eventuality that at some point in your pet’s life they will have a medical emergency. Some emergencies may include:


Broken bones after being hit by a car or falling from a tree.
Surgery to remove tumors.
Kidney stone removal., It is very likely that as your cat gets older, they will develop at least one chronic condition. This could wind up being a substantial cost for you in the future. Thus, you need to consider this when you budget.


The cost of chronic conditions may vary. They could include the cost of surgery and medicine. While surgery could be in the thousands of dollars, medicine costs could range from as little as $10 a month to over $200.
Some of the most common chronic conditions for cats include: periodontal disease, kidney failure, feline leukemia.
A great way to offset the budgetary impact of chronic conditions is to purchase pet insurance for your cat. Premiums and deductibles vary based on policy, but the cost should range between $10 to $30 a month (depending on breed and age)., From time to time you’ll have to travel and won’t be able to take your cat with you. Because of this, you should factor in the cost of boarding over the course of the cat’s life. If you don’t, you’ll budget won’t really be accurate.


If you’re someone who doesn’t really travel, you may want to factor in at least 2 to 3 days a year of boarding. This way, if something unexpected happens, like the death of a family member in another state, you’ll be prepared to board your cat.
If you’re someone who travels moderately, consider factoring in 5 to 7 days a year of boarding.
If you travel a lot, you should factor in substantial boarding costs for your cat.
Boarding costs for cats vary depending on the region. While it may only cost $10 to $15 a night in the American South, it could cost upwards of $30 in the Northeast., While some people might just board their cat, many cat owners prefer to hire a cat sitter to look after their cat when they are away. Thus, you should consider the cost involved.


Ask friends or family in your area if they know someone who cat sits. Inquire about what that person charges.
Look for a professional cat sitting service. These services will typically send someone to your home once or twice a day to check on your cat, refill their food, and refill their water.
Ask a family member or friend if they'd cat sit for you. They may do it for free or for a small cost.
The cost of a cat sitter could run from $15 to $45 a day, depending on who does it and where you live."

Do you want to go to the beach, the country, the mountains, or a big city? If you think about the general type of place you want to go, this can help you narrow down your search.


However, when choosing a cat friendly vacation destination, it's good to avoid getting too specific about your ideal location. The specific town or location you choose may not have the cat-friendly amenities that you need.
You should also think about the ideal climate for your cat. Decide whether your cat could cope with the type of place you are considering traveling to.;
, If you want to go somewhere very different from where you live, you will need to assess whether your cat can travel there easily. For example, if you live in a cold climate and you will need to travel hundreds of miles to get somewhere warm, then you need to assess whether your cat can comfortably travel that far for vacation.


Some cats are good travelers and some are not. If your cat is not a good traveler, you will either need to vacation somewhere close to your home or leave your cat at home during your vacation.
Above all, you should place your cat's comfort and happiness above all else. If you want your cat on vacation but you are afraid for it to travel, then err on the side of caution and leave it at home with a cat sitter., Once you pick a type of place you want to go and how far you can travel, you can begin searching for cat-friendly accommodations. There are websites designed to help pet lovers find vacation spots but you can also do a specific search on your own. Do a general online search for towns or locations that fit your vacation requirements and then do an additional online search for specific areas and the words ""pet friendly"" or ""cat friendly.""


For example, if you live in London and you want to go to a country town nearby, do a search for ""countryside vacation near London"" first. Then, once you have a list of countryside vacation spots near London, combine the names of specific towns with ""pet friendly"" or ""cat friendly.""
Remember, you don't just have to stay in hotels while on vacation. Search for vacation rental houses or apartments. Some of these are owned by families that bring their own pets to them, so they may be likely to allow other pets to stay.

, When taking a cat-friendly vacation, you need to remember to plan everything ahead of time so you know that your cat will be welcomed at every step. This means that you need to plan not just the hotel or house you will stay in, but also how you will get there with your cat. You need to make sure your cat can go on your flight, in your rental care, or on your mass-transit transportation methods.


It is important to let an airline know that you are planning on bringing a pet on board when you make your reservation. However, they usually state that they have the right to refuse your pet if there are too many pets on board.If you are planning on leaving your country on vacation, the airline you use may require proof your cat has been vaccinated for rabies before they let it on board. You will need to have documentation of this vaccination with you., When taking your cat on vacation you will need to bring the right supplies for its care. Basically, everything that your cat needs at home, it will need on vacation. Be sure to bring:


Travel carrier (with your name and number on it in case of emergency)
Small litter pan and litter
Food and water
Food and water containers
Your cat's bed
Your cat's toys
Treats
Medications
Current prescriptions and vaccination records

, Take your cat to a veterinarian before you go on vacation and make sure it is well enough to travel. Your veterinarian can check all of its vital signs and make sure that it is up to date on its vaccinations.If you are having any doubts about taking your cat on vacation, discuss the idea with your veterinarian. They know your cat and should have a good idea if the cat can withstand the stresses of travel.

, When taking your cat to a new place, you should know ahead of time where to take it in the case of an emergency. This should ideally be an animal hospital because it is likely that they are open 24 hours a day.


If you are going somewhere without an animal hospital, it's still important to have the name and number of a veterinarian in the area.
You may also want to bring a copy of your cat's medical records, so that if it has an emergency the veterinarian it is seen by won't have to wait for records to be sent., Before you take your cat on vacation, you should make sure that it can be identified if it gets lost. Put tags on the cat that include your name, phone number, and email address, if there is room.Even if your cat has a microchip, put a collar and tags on your cat. This information will allow anyone to contact you quickly if they find your cat.

, If you love your cat and you want to take it on vacation, try a short weekend trip to see how it does. Spending a few days away from home with your cat will help you to assess whether it will be a good traveling companion in the future or if it should stay home next time.


When planning a cat friendly vacation you should keep in mind that it is usually a better idea to drive with a cat than to fly. This is especially true of cats with flat faces, such as Persians, as they can have a hard time breathing in areas with oxygen deprivation., It is best to center your cat's needs when planning a trip, rather than assuming that your cat can just go along on a trip you will enjoy. For example, there are some tours or trips that are created explicitly for pet owners, such as cruises that have on-board kennels that take care of your pets.Cruises that allow cats will require that the cats stay in a kennel on board. These kennels are fully staffed and allow you to visit your pet when you like.

, If you take your cat on vacation with you, you should make sure its a trip that will include spending a lot of time with it. A nice getaway where you plan on staying indoors, reading, cooking meals, and watching movies would be perfect to bring a cat along for. A trip where you will go on daily adventures and not return to your accommodations all day is not ideal for bringing your cat.


If you are planning on staying at a vacation house and you want to spend time outside at the house, consider bringing a harness and leash for your cat, so that it can spend some time outdoors with you.

, You should make sure that your cat has deluxe accommodations while it is away from home, so that the trip is as relaxing as possible for it. In most cases, it's best to keep your cat in a hotel room or vacation rental while on vacation and make sure that the temperature is what your cat is used to. Keeping it in more rustic accommodations can be hard on the cat, especially if the weather is extreme in your vacation destination.


Provide the cat a bed, toys, a scratching surface, and ledges and views to enjoy, and space to roam. This will require that you pick your accommodations with your cat in mind.
Even if you cannot let your cat roam freely in your vacation accommodations, you need to give it more space than just its carrier on a daily basis. Consider putting the cat in a pet tent to give the cat some space, a full litter box, and access to food and water."

Get your cat microchipped at a vet clinic or animal shelter.,
Identify your cat using a cat-safe collar at all times.,
Check the collar often to be certain the tag is readable and the latches are working.,
Keep your cat as an indoor cat.,
Take photos of your cat in case it becomes lost.,
Use a leash and harness when outdoors.,
Always transport your cat in a sturdy carrier when leaving the house to prevent escapes and protect them in the car.,
Don't tempt your cat to escape by leaving doors or windows with torn screens open.,
Train your cat to come on command, if you can.,
Use a cat playpen to give your cat some fresh air and entertainment.,
Instruct temporary caregivers to keep the cat inside, watch doors and windows, and show them how to use the carrier in case of an emergency.,
Be especially careful during stressful times like holidays, family upheavals, and weather extremes: a cat that is normally relaxed may behave in unusual ways when stressed.

,
Do everything you can to find your cat if he goes missing.",How to Avoid Losing Your Cat," This is the best way to ensure that, if your cat ever becomes lost, you will be reunited. A microchip is a tiny radio transmitter that is inserted under the skin and remains there for the rest of the cat's life. If your cat ever shows up at a vet or animal shelter, they will scan for the chip, retrieve your information, and contact you.;
, Make sure your phone number is clearly readable on the ID tag. Cat-safe collars either have break-away latches or elastic to allow the cat to escape should they become caught on something.


Putting a collar on your cat tells strangers at a glance that your cat has a home. Without one, someone could take your cat home assuming it is an unloved stray.

, Take this time to check how tight it is around the cat's neck. If you have a growing kitten or your cat has been packing on the pounds, you will need to loosen the collar so it is comfortable.

, Cats that are allowed to roam outside live, on average, less than half as long as indoor cats. Many simply disappear one day, and their owners never know what happened to them. In addition to the many dangers like cars, other animals, and disease that can hurt or kill your cat, an indoor cat that gets out is likely to stay much closer to home than an outdoor cat who becomes lost. This makes finding them much easier if they do turn up missing.

, These can be invaluable for use on flyers and handing out at animal shelters and vet clinics. Try to take color photos that show off visual identifiers like unusual markings, face shape, and coat pattern. If your cat is lost, local vets may be able to recognize your cat if someone brings it in as their own, and animal shelters will have an easier time figuring out which of the 15 brown tabbies is yours.

, Some cats learn to walk on a leash and can be taken for strolls, while for others this is a safe way to let them explore the backyard. Always attach the leash to a harness designed for cats (not a collar) and make sure it is properly adjusted to avoid injury.

, Place an absorbent towel in the bottom of the carrier, and provide food and water for long trips.


Use a towel or blanket that smells familiar if possible. Try putting it in the bottom of the cat's favorite bed a few days before any car trips so it can acquire her smell.
Many cats will object to carriers at first, especially if they come to associate them with uncomfortable trips to the vet. Make the carrier less threatening by leaving it out with the door open when you are home, and hide treats and toys inside, even if your annual vet visit is months away. If the cat comes to see the carrier as a fun place to hide, it will make using one much easier.

, Once they learn a way out, they can sneak out much quicker. Fix the hole in the fence before they realize how exciting life on the other side is. When opening the door, deter your cats from coming too close; train them to stay at least 5 feet (1.5 m) back. This makes answering the door much less stressful!

, If she escapes or becomes lost, she will know to come back when you call.

, You can find these in specialty stores or online. Provide shade, water, and a soft bed in the pen. Always monitor your cat when she is outside, either by doing something nearby (this can be a great way to entertain your cat while gardening), or by staying near a window with a good view of her. Never leave a cat unattended outside.

, Be sure to note any bad habits (""He always bolts for the back door when I open it!""). Leave emergency numbers like your regular vet, emergency clinic, and local shelters, so the caregiver can contact them if the cat becomes lost or sick.

,, Most importantly:


Search your area, checking known hiding places as well as other areas that would interest him. Look in small, dark places like under decks, in garden sheds,etc. Call his name, and listen closely in case he is calling back (often the case with scared or trapped cats).
Contact your local vets, shelters, and animal control, providing them with photos or distinguishing marks, and the animal's microchip ID number.
Post flyers in your area with multiple pictures of your cat, distinguishing marks and behaviors, and your contact information. You may wish to offer a reward.
Leave a live trap near your house with your cat's favorite, smelliest food inside. Animal control and shelters will usually rent or lend these traps for short term use, or you can purchase them at big box hardware stores. Check the trap frequently, and be sure to release any unwanted visitors a safe distance away (skunks and raccoons are notorious for finding their way into these kinds of traps).

Visit a local rescue shelter.,
Search online.,
Find a breed-specific rescue group.,
Foster a special needs cat.",How to Adopt a Special Needs Cat1," If you would like to give a special needs cat a good home, call your local rescue shelter and plan to visit their facilities. Ask if there are any senior cats, cats with disabilities, or cats with illnesses that have been overlooked by other adopters. Some special needs cats can be in shelters for a long time, so ask an employee how long a particular animal has been there.When visiting a shelter, it is important to talk to them about your home situation to make sure you can properly accommodate the cat. Let them know whether you live in a house or an apartment, if you have children, whether you work long hours, and other information that may impact your ability to care for a cat.;
, There are many online databases that focus on rehoming special needs cats. Many of the animals listed on these databases have been spayed or neutered and have received the required vaccinations. You will also be able to search based on the cat’s age, sex, and size in addition to the type of special needs that it may have., Purebred cats are more likely than mixed breeds to develop particular health problems, behavioral issues, or other special needs.Consider finding a breed-specific rescue group to see if any special needs cats have been found or surrendered by their former owners. These groups often take in senior animals or animals with special needs that a regular animal shelter may deem as unadoptable.Persian cats, for example, are prone to breathing conditions, while both Sphinx cats and Maine Coons are known to contract a form of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Breed-specific rescues can help you understand the needs of these cats., Contact your local rescue agency to discuss fostering a cat with special needs. As a foster parent, you will agree to provide a temporary home for a cat until a new owner has been secured. In this capacity, you will be able to help a special needs cat and discover if caring for a special needs cat is something you can commit to for the duration of the cat’s life."

Make preparations for a cat with limited eyesight.,
Provide a stress-free environment for an anxious cat.,
Create an accessible environment for a cat with missing limbs.,
Think about dietary needs.",How to Adopt a Special Needs Cat2," If you adopt a cat that has limited eyesight or is completely blind, be sure keep its environment familiar and clutter-free. Do not move furniture or the cat’s water or food bowls, its litter box, or its crate or climbing posts. Try to avoid making loud, sudden noises so the cat is not startled, and be sure to keep the cat indoors for its safety.In the early days, it is best to stay with the cat to help them adjust. Do not crowd or over-handle the cat, but try to be home to help address any challenges as soon as they come up.
Start by introducing your cat to a single room, and gradually expand its territory over time. Allow them to get fully comfortable in a single space before introducing a new one.Be extra careful about the furniture in the room, as they rely a great deal on their whiskers and touch to help navigate. Cat-proof the furniture in advance, and then leave it in place once the cat gets to know the room. Movement of features could disorient a vision-impaired cat., If your cat was abused, neglected, or experienced a traumatic situation, try to provide a stress-free environment at home. Plan to play with your cat every day to stimulate its mind, and stick to a schedule and a routine to reduce its anxiety. Also provide it with safe hiding places where your cat can retreat.


Leave the carrier in the corner of a room, or leave a closet door cracked so your cat can safely hide. You can even drape a towel over the back of a chair or provide it with a cardboard box to jump in.Cats can be thrown off by changes to their daily routine, so try to stick to a consistent feeding, sleeping, and playing schedule. If you have other pets, consider getting your cat comfortable with you before introducing new animals.If you feed your cat every morning, plan to do that every day. Set an alarm on your phone so you can remember to play with the cat each evening.
If the cat experiences extreme anxiety, you may want to talk to your vet about using anti-anxiety medications or pheromones to help the cat stay calm and familiarize itself with the environment. If your cat's daily functions are impaired by anxiety, contact your vet.

, If your cat is missing a limb, it may have trouble jumping and landing properly. Cushion your cat by placing pillows, cushions, and plush blankets in areas where they may often try to jump, like the ledge of a window or the back of a couch. Consider providing a tiered cat tower so the cat can easily move from level to level, or use a ramp so they can walk up to various levels throughout the house., Some cats may not have a physical or emotional disability, but they may have an allergy to certain foods and require a special diet. If a cat has kidney issues, urinary tract problems, or has an issue with weight management, they may also require a specific diet.In addition, some cats may require that you prepare their food at home, which will require a particular balance of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, and other nutrients.Talk to your veterinarian or a rescue shelter employee about the dietary needs of your cat.


Hyperthyroidism is a common disease that can result in weight loss, altered eating patterns, and increased urination. Talk to your vet if you notice any of these symptoms. They can test your cat and prescribe treatment, which typically includes medication and a shift in diet, but may also include surgery. Feline diabetes is another diet-related disease common in cats. It is easily diagnosed by a physical exam and blood test, and can typically be treated at home with an adjusted diet and twice-daily insulin injections that you can administer at home."

Consider your finances.,
Budget for the cost of additional medications.,
Plan for the cost of emergency veterinary visits.,
Opt for pet insurance.",How to Adopt a Special Needs Cat3," Owning a pet can be expensive, but owning a special needs cat can incur additional costs. Before adopting a cat with special needs, consider whether or not you will be able to afford the care, treatment, and medical attention a special needs cat requires.


A healthy cat may incur a yearly veterinary bill that ranges between $50 to $200 (U.S.) for routine care.If you adopt a special needs cat, for example, that cost may increase due to more frequent visits to the veterinarian. A diabetic cat may need to have a blood glucose test during veterinary visits, and that could increase your bill by $50 to $100 for each test., If you adopt a senior cat or a cat with a disease, consider what medications it will need to take and how much these medications cost. A six month supply of insulin for a diabetic cat, for example, can range between $70 to $185 (U.S.).If you adopt a senior cat with arthritis, you may be paying $40 for a 90-day supply of pain medication.For hyperthyroidism, medication may cost $350 to $700 a year., When you own an animal, it is recommended that you set aside an emergency fund in case your animal is injured or sick. If your special needs cat has an emergency, you could possibly incur a bill that ranges between $2,000 and $4,000 (U.S.).Plan to set aside money that will help your special needs cat in an emergency.

, If you adopt a special needs cat, getting pet insurance may help you save on the additional medical bills and veterinary visits. A policy on a cat can cost around $175 (U.S.) annually.A insurance policy is a great way to make sure you can cover the veterinary bills that a special needs cat may incur more quickly than other animals.

Make sure that you’re committed to giving your furry buddy a “forever home.”, Cats can be a great choice for people with limited space, such as apartment-dwellers. However, you should check with your landlord, homeowner’s association, etc., to make sure that you’re allowed to have a cat live with you.


Cats should actually not be “outdoor” cats. Indoor cats in general live longer, healthier lives than outdoor cats and are at a lower risk of developing diseases and injuries. Indoor cats are also more comfortable with humans., Cats don’t usually require as much companionship as dogs do, but nevertheless, it’s important to consider how much time you’ll have to spend with your cat. If you won’t have the time to play with your cat, give it the necessary food and attention, and bond with it, now may not be the right time for you to get a cat.You should be able to give at least one hour per day of time to your cat. This will help you bond and will keep the cat feeling happy and healthy.Daily grooming, which can take up to 20-30 minutes, may also be necessary if you adopt a long-hair breed.
Talk with your vet or the animal shelter about your time commitments. They may recommend that you adopt a pair of cats, particularly if you find siblings. More than one cat means they can keep each other company when you’re away at work or gone for a long weekend.
Kittens often require more upfront time commitment because they must be trained to use a litter box, not scratch on furniture, etc.

, Feeding and caring for a cat is not free. The cost can range between $500-$1,000 a year on average.Your expenses will vary depending on whether you have a kitten or an adult cat, as well as the type of breed you have. Veterinary care and grooming are common expenses that can add up over time.


Kittens are usually more expensive to start with, as they usually need vaccinations, dewormings, and neutering or spaying. They are going to grow up and become cats, so why wait? Adopting an older cat is just as good, especially since they are calmer.
Although cats naturally groom themselves, long-haired breeds may require additional grooming. Cats with brachycephaly, or ""pushed in"" faces (like Persians and Himalayans) will often need the area around their eyes cleaned to prevent infection.Look at the prices of quality cat food and treats in your area. This can help you get an idea of what it will cost to feed your cat.

, You need to consider what your home environment is like before you adopt a cat. Here are some questions to ask yourself:


Do you already have other pets? How will a new cat fit in with them?
Do you have young children? Young children may be too rough with kittens and can accidentally harm them.What’s the activity level in your household? Are you energetic, on-the-go? Or do you prefer calmly chilling on the couch? Kittens tend to be very active and will need constant supervision. Adult cats are often calmer and need less supervision, although this can vary by breed and even individual cat.

, If you or someone in your household has allergies or other health issues, consider how a cat could affect these.Millions of people are allergic to things like pet dander, saliva, dead skin, and urine.Considering the breed’s hair length can help prevent allergy troubles.


A short-hair (smooth glossy coat) breed is best for most people. These cats usually do not require extensive grooming. While they shed, you can clean up fur fairly easily with a vacuum or brush.
Medium-hair (modestly fluffy coat) and long-hair cats (long, flowing coats) require grooming. You will need to brush and comb their fur regularly. With long-haired cats, grooming is often required daily.
A few breeds have no hair (and are hypoallergenic). However, these cats routinely get very cold and require things like sweaters to keep them warm. They’re also not furry when you pet them, which is undesirable to some people.

, The type and age of cat you adopt will affect the type of relationship you have with it. Do you want a cat that will sit on your lap and just chill with you? Would you prefer a cat that will keep you entertained and interact with you?Considering what you hope to get out of having a cat will help you decide what type of cat is right for you.


Kittens’ personalities aren’t fully developed, so it can be harder to know what kind of attitude and relationship they’ll have with you until they’re older.
Consulting a breed encyclopedia, such as Animal Planet’s Cat Breed Directory, can help you learn about the common characteristics of particular breeds, such as their speech, independence, and intelligence. Keep in mind that every cat is different, though.

, Purebred cats have advantages and disadvantages. Cat breeds have distinct characteristics that are often passed down through generations, such as a Siamese’s tendency to meow all the time or a Siberian’s willingness to be handled. If it’s very important that your cat have a particular characteristic, you might consider a purebred cat, but remember that there’s no guarantee that any trait will be present in every individual cat.Purebred cats also tend to have particular health problems. For example, Persian and Himalayan cats tend to have heart and kidney disease problems, while Maine Coons have hip problems and heart disease issues.

, Animal shelters, humane societies, and foster networks have a great selection of cats who need loving homes. In the United States, 6-8 million pets are in shelters every year, but only about half are adopted.Visit your local humane society or animal shelter, or look online to see if there are cats in need of a home in your area.


Pets adopted from shelters often cost less than purchasing a cat from a breeder or pet store. Cats from pet stores and breeders can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars, but it’s rare for a shelter or foster network to charge more than $100 or $200 to rehome a cat.
You don’t have to buy from a breeder to adopt a purebred cat. There are many rescue organizations that rescue abandoned or mistreated purebreds.In fact, up to 25% of pets in animal shelters are purebreds.Talk with the employees or volunteers at the shelter. They often can tell you the history of the cat, as well as any medical or behavioral issues the cat has., Investigate any breeder’s reputation before purchasing a cat. If you can, visit and examine the conditions the cats are being kept in for yourself. The last thing you want to do is contribute to breeders mistreating animals. If you see cats being mistreated or feel that the breeder is not being upfront with you, don’t buy a cat from the operation.Look for telltale signs of cat abuse, such as piles of cat hair everywhere, overwhelming odor, injured animals, and overgrown nails. The cats should be healthy and should seem happy.
Ask about the cat you’re considering. Ask the breeder about whether it will be likely to have any health issues, behavioral problems, or special needs. The breeder should sound knowledgeable and honest about any issues.
Make sure the cats are comfortable with other animals and people.
Be very suspicious of unreasonably low prices. A designer breed that should cost thousands of dollars being sold for a few hundred suggests that the breeder is either cutting corners or being dishonest about the cat. On the other hand, sky-high prices don’t guarantee quality.

, You may find ads online or in the newspaper for cats that are for sale or “free to a good home.” While it’s certainly possible to adopt a cat from a neighbor or even a stranger on craigslist, you should be aware that there are risks to this.


The person offering the cat may not know much about its temperament, history, or breed. Make sure that you get any medical records or other paperwork from the person offering the cat.
If it is a cat for sale, you may have a hard time getting your money back if the cat turns out to be different than you were promised.

, Pet stores may sell cats they have purchased from a breeder, or they may have an “adoption center” where rescued cats can be adopted. Be aware that employees at pet stores may love animals, but they rarely have the same level of knowledge about the cats that the people who work with animal shelters or rescue groups do.Always ask the store where they get their cats and kittens for sale. Stores may acquire their cats from kitten mills that breed cats under unethical, harmful conditions. Research the breeders that provide the cats. They should seem knowledgeable about the breed, any potential behavior or health issues, and the cat’s personal history (family, etc.). Purebred cats should also have documentation from a local vet and paperwork, such as registration papers or health certificates.If your pet store offers adoption from shelters or adoption agencies, choose one of those cats. Adopting a cat rather than purchasing one will ensure you do not send profit to an unethical kitten mill.

, Sometimes, a cat may just show up at your doorstep and ask for love. While this is certainly one way to include a cat in your life, there are a few things to consider:Make sure that the cat doesn’t belong to someone else. Sometimes, “stray” cats have eluded their owners, who really want them back. Place an ad in the classifieds or on the internet describing the cat you’ve discovered. Call your local animal shelters to see if a missing animal has been reported.
Remember that stray cats may have behavioral issues. Life on the streets is hard, and a stray cat may have trouble integrating into a new home life, especially if you already have other pets.
Get the cat examined by a veterinarian before taking it into your home. Cats can carry diseases and infections. Before you adopt a stray cat and let it live with you, have it examined by a vet to make sure it’s healthy.

, Much like humans, cats should not be judged by their outer beauty alone. While there’s nothing wrong with feeling drawn to an adorable face, make sure you consider more than the cat’s appearance when making your decision., Many shelters and foster networks offer free adoption counseling, where they will ask you about your needs, lifestyle, and personality and make recommendations from there. This is a great way for you to meet cats that will mesh with you and your needs., It’s helpful to get an idea of how the cat will interact with everyone in your household, especially children. If you can, bring everyone when you meet the cat to see how everyone gets along.

, Ask an employee or volunteer to show you how to handle the cat. Every cat has individual preferences about how it is handled that the workers will probably be more familiar with. This can help prevent things like biting and scratching. If the cat resists, don't force it. Some cats are very affectionate, but just do not like to be held. Other cats may simply be uncomfortable in an unfamiliar environment and will warm up over time.Make your hand into a fist and extend it towards the cat. This is a human method for mimicking a feline greeting.If the cat head-butts your hand, this is a friendly greeting. If he/she looks away or backs away, the cat may not like meeting new people.
If the cat attempts to scratch or bite you, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t adopt it. Many cats scratch or bite when they are anxious or afraid. However, a cat who bites or scratches may not be a good choice for a household with small children.

, Make sure that the cat is healthy. If you do see problem areas, it isn’t a sign you shouldn’t adopt the cat -- sometimes, cats in shelters or foster homes have health problems that just need a little love and care to clear up. Here are some things to look for:Eyes. They should be bright and free of discharge or buildup.
Nose. It should not have any discharge, and the cat should not display excessive sneezing.
Ears. They should be free of dark wax or buildup and should not smell bad. The cat should not shake its head frequently or paw at its ears.
Chest. The cat’s breathing should sound clear, without wheezing or coughing.
Fur. It should be clean and free of any parasites, such as fleas or ticks. Look in the armpits and on the belly for signs of fleas.
Skin. It should be clean and undamaged. If the cat does have old wounds, they should be clean and well-tended.
Bottom. It should be clean and should not have any signs of diarrhea or worms. (Check the litter box for signs of diarrhea or parasites, too.)

, It’s important to get as much information about the cat as you can before you make your decision. Some good questions to ask include:How long has the cat been there?
Why is the cat there?
How does the cat interact with other cats, the staff, and other animals?
What is the cat’s personality like?
Does the volunteer/employee/breeder have any concerns?
Does the cat have any health issues?

, Especially with purebred kittens, it's important that they be socialized with a variety of different people, sights, sounds, smells, and other experiences in their first 12 weeks of life. Without proper socialization, the kitten could grow up into a cat that doesn't like people, or is even aggressive. Studies show that kittens who get plenty of human contact in their first 7 weeks are more likely to mature into friendly, well-developed cats.Good socialization includes holding and petting kittens for at least a few minutes every day soon after they're born. However, newborn kittens should not be taken away from their mother for more than a few seconds at a time. Doing so could make her anxious or even cause her to reject the kitten.
Other important socialization processes include playing with toys, interacting with people in games such as chasing and pouncing, and exploring different types of objects, such as cardboard boxes, paper bags, and scratching posts.
Make sure that the kitten has not been socialized to consider fingers and toes as toys. Kittens may accidentally scratch or bite while playing, but this behavior should not be encouraged. The kitten should always be redirected to an appropriate toy if scratching or biting happens.
Kittens should also encounter many different people so they're less likely to be shy of strangers.

, With all the tiny kittens available, it can be tempting to go straight for the cute and forget about older cats. However, older cats pose some advantages:Their personalities are usually set, so you are likely to know more about how the cat will behave and what its attitude is like.
Older cats are often litter box-trained and don’t require as much supervision.
Older cats are usually calmer and are better with small children.
If your older cat wasn't properly socialized as a kitten, you can still teach her remedial socialization. It may take a lot longer, but with patience and training, even an adult cat can become less skittish., Cats sometimes come into shelters with another cat with whom they have already bonded, or form a bond while in the shelter. If separated they may suffer emotionally and have difficulty forming future bonds with other pets.If you are looking to adopt two cats, an already bonded pair is a good choice, as they will comfort each other through the stress of relocation.

, If available, see which tests and vaccinations the cat has already had. This can help you determine the cat’s overall health and plan for any future health expenses.


It’s common to check cats for the Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia (FeLV) before bringing the new pet to a home that has another cat. These diseases are easily transmissible to other animals. It’s a good idea to test your potential cat before adoption, whether or not you have another cat at home.

, In many cases, this is included -- even required -- when acquiring a new cat. Typically, you will be allowed a certain amount of time to schedule this initial visit, which will catch anything you may have missed. This can be helpful to discuss with the vet any needs that your new cat has.


If you have other cats or pets in your household, it’s recommended that you take your new cat to the vet before you bring it home., Many shelters and foster networks will allow you to bring a cat home for a short ""trial"" period (usually a few nights to a week). If you are able to do this, it is very helpful for ensuring that the cat will blend in with your family and any other animals you have.


Remember that the cat may be very anxious in your home at first. Be patient as the cat becomes adjusted to its new environment.

Look for an umbilical cord stump.,
Examine the kitten’s eyes.,
Check the kitten’s ears.,
Examine the kitten’s baby teeth.,
Check for adult teeth.,
Weigh the kitten.",How to Tell How Old a Kitten Is1," If you find one, you can be sure you’re dealing with a newborn kitten.The mother usually bites the cord until it breaks. The remaining “stump” will be a small piece of tissue hanging off the kitten’s belly.
Cats’ umbilical cord stumps usually fall off in the first 3 days of life. If your kitten still has a cord stump, it is likely only days old.;
, A kitten’s eyes will go through several developmental stages as the begin to open and then ultimately change color. Looking at and watching for changes in the eyes can help you assess a kitten’s age.


Kittens do not open their eyes until they reach about ten to 14 days in age, but some do open their eyes as early as 7 to 10 days. If your kitten has closed eyes, he is likely a newborn. If your kitten has already opened its eyes, she is at least a full week old.If your kitten's eyes are just starting to open but still appear squinty, she may be in her second or third week of life. When kittens begin opening their eyes, the eyes are bright blue in color, regardless of what color their eyes turn later as they grow up.
If you have an older kitten and you notice her eyes beginning to change color, she is likely around 6-7 weeks old. At this time, the irises will begin to transition to their permanent, mature color. Note that if the kitten is growing into a mature, blue-eyed cat, you may not be able to observe any color change to help you determine its age.

, Like the eyes, a kitten’s ears go through developmental changes in the early stages of development. You may be able to pinpoint the age of a younger kitten based on characteristics of or changes to the ears.


If your kitten’s the ears are stuck close to her head, she is probably less than one week old. Baby kittens are born with their ear canals closed,which results in ears that appear flattened back against the head. A kitten's ears will begin to open up at between 5 and 8 days in age.
Watch for the kitten’s ears to pop up. The kitten’s ears will take longer to open than its eyes. Though the closed ear canals begin to open at between 5 and 8 days, it takes longer for the ears to pop up visibly. The ears will pop up sometime between the second and third week of your kitten's life., A good way to assess the age of both young and juvenile kittens is to check the presence and development of her teeth. A kitten with no teeth is likely a newborn, younger than 2 weeks of age. If teeth are present, you can still estimate the age based on the number and characteristics of the teeth.


The first deciduous (baby) teeth should push through the gums around 2 or 3 weeks of age. The first teeth to pop through will likely be the incisors. If you don’t see the teeth visually, you may be able to feel them by gently feeling the kitten’s gums.The deciduous canines begin growing at 3-4 weeks of age. These are the long and pointed teeth that grow next to the deciduous incisors.
The deciduous premolars begin breaking through the gums at around 4-6 weeks. The premolars are the teeth that grow between the canine and molar teeth.
If all of a kitten’s baby teeth are present but she does not yet have molars, she should be around four months of age. She should have:

6 incisors in the top jaw and 6 in the bottom jaw
2 canines on the top jaw and 2 in the bottom jaw (one on either side of the last incisor)
3 premolars on the top jaw
2 premolars on the bottom jaw.



, If you find larger, adult teeth in a kitten, it is likely four months or older. The timing of the teeth may be a little less precise in an older kitten than it is in a very young kitten, but you should be able to get a good idea of the kitten’s age based on when her adult teeth come in.


The adult incisor teeth are the first to come in, around 4 months.
Between 4 and 6 months, the baby canines, premolars and molars are replaced by adult teeth.
If your kitten has all her adult teeth and all four molars, she is likely at least 7 months old.
Be aware that these guidelines are based on normal, healthy kittens; medical issues or accidents can cause teeth to be missing or come in late.

, A prediction based on weight can be imprecise due to differences in size and breed, but the weight can be a factor that gives you more information about your kitten’s approximate age. .


The average healthy kitten weighs about 3.5 oz at birth, and gains about a quarter ounce per day.So, a normal kitten will weighing from 3.5 to 5.25 oz is in its first week of life. (Note that a kitten weighing less than 3.5 oz may be sick or undernourished. Take the kitten to a veterinarian for evaluation.)
A normal kitten will weigh from 4-6 oz (113-170 g) and be smaller than a human adult's hand at 1 to 2 weeks.
Most kittens will weigh from 6-8 oz (170-225 g) when they are 2-3 weeks old.
A kitten that weights .5 to 1 pound (225g to 450g) is likely around 4-5 weeks old.
A kitten weighing between 1.5 pounds to 2 pounds (680g-900g) is likely 7-8 weeks old.
The average cat aged three months or more will weigh one pound per month of age until its weight stabilizes at around 10 pounds. So, a 3-pound cat will likely be 3 months old, and a 4-pound cat will be 4 months old. Though this is a generalization, it's a useful rule of thumb for cats over 12 weeks in age until the cat reaches its adult weight, which is about 10 pounds for most cats.

Monitor the kitten for signs of weaning.,
Watch the kitten’s mobility.,
Observe the kitten's reaction to noise and moving objects.,
Assess confidence and playfulness.",How to Tell How Old a Kitten Is2," This step only applies to kittens that are still with their mothers. The mother will stop allowing her kitten to nurse at around 4-6 weeks after its birth.That’s when her milk begins to dry up.


If the mother has fully weaned her kitten off milk, the kitten is probably about 7 weeks old. After 7 weeks, mother cats will no longer allow her kittens to nurse. You might notice that the kitten tries to approach its mother to nurse, but is swatted away and rejected.
A kitten of 7-8 weeks will begin leaving her mother more frequently and for longer periods of time for more adventurous exploration., A kitten’s proficiency in walking can indicate her age based on normal development. Kittens are unable to stand or walk around until they reach around 2 to 4 weeks of age.Until then, they spend their time snuggling up to their mother and siblings, sleeping, or nursing. If a kitten needs to move in the first few weeks, she does a belly-crawl.


Wobbliness and uncertainty when your kitten walks indicates that your kitten is around 2 weeks old. If your kitten is beginning to look confident in her ability to walk, she is likely older than 3 weeks.
Between 3-4 weeks, a kitten will begin to demonstrate the righting reflex, which is the ability to turn in mid-air to land on their feet.Around 4 weeks of age, the kitten will be able to walk more steadily and explore its environment. Its natural curiosity and playfulness will emerge with this increased mobility. Kittens of this age will begin to show pouncing behavior.A kitten who can run is at least five weeks old. , Although the eyes and ear canals begin opening in the second or third week of life, those senses are still developing at an early age. Response to external stimuli indicate an age of about 3.5 weeks.

, A healthy kitten will grow more confident around the fifth and sixth weeks of its life. This is due, in large part, to its growing coordination and mobility. A kitten of this age will begin exploring its environment more fearlessly than a younger, more hesitant kitten.


By 7-8 weeks, a kitten should be highly coordinated and mobile. She will enjoy running around, playing and socializing with humans and other pets, and exploring higher spaces by practicing its jumping motions.

"
"
Look for signs of puberty.,
Watch for signs of continuing sexual maturity.At 4-6 months, a kitten cat is essentially going through its teenage years.,
Identify the “juvenile” stage.",How to Tell How Old a Kitten Is3," At around 4 months, kitten behavior begins changing as a result of changing hormones. Kittens of this age will meow loudly at night or try to escape the house to get outdoors.These can be signs that the kitten is beginning to go through puberty.

, A cat of this age will begin to lose its plumpness (baby fat) and develop a sleeker body, even as it gains weight.


Male kittens over 4 months may begin scent marking (spraying urine) to attract females to mate.
Female kittens may begin going into heat between 4 and 6 months. This also involves scent marking, along with loud yowling and writhing about.

, Kittens 7 months or older are considered juveniles, and they are both larger in size and sexually mature. Be aware that a juvenile female cat can become pregnant if she is not fixed. Along with sexual maturity comes increased aggression.


Kittens begin to challenge other cats for dominance starting at around 6 months.Juvenile kittens tend to bite more often than younger kittens or grown cats.
Cat bites tend to occur a lot from cats in the juvenile age group, so take care when handling cats from this age group.

"
"
Ask the agency or person from whom you’re adopting.,
Ask a veterinarian.",How to Tell How Old a Kitten Is4," Good agencies and breeders keep sound records of their kittens, and will be able to provide at least a close guess. If they did not witness the birth firsthand, the best they can provide is an estimate. Even if a shelter receives a kitten well after its birth, they have an experienced staff and veterinarians who can provide professional estimates.

, When you take your kitten for its first veterinary exam, ask the vet for his or her educated estimate of its age. During this same visit, your veterinarian will also advise you on the tests and vaccines your kitten will need to lead a healthy life.

Do not begin weaning too early.,
Let the mother cat begin the weaning process.,
Allow the kittens to continue nursing intermittently.,
Begin with a milk substitute.,
Serve the kittens a kitten-specific wet food.,
Dampen small kibble before serving it to the kittens.,
Place wet food in a low saucer or dish.,
Begin by serving a single tablespoon of food.,
Feed the kittens multiple times throughout the day.,
Offer the kittens a little solid food on the tip of your finger.,
Introduce food to each kitten individually.",How to Introduce Solid Food to Kittens," Kittens need their mother’s nutrient-heavy milk to gain sufficient weight in the first two or three weeks of life. Forcing the kittens to wean early will be physically harmful to them, and will also upset the mother cat. The kitten’s eyes will be open and it will be steady on its feet before weaning naturally begins.If the kitten’s eyes are still shut and the animal is not yet steady on its feet, it’s still too early to begin weaning the kitten.;
, The kittens will be weaned naturally: starting when the kittens are around 3 or 4 weeks, the mother will begin pushing them away when they nuzzle her to nurse.At this point, the kittens will begin to look for other sources of food, and you can start to present them with solid food.


Were the kittens living in the wild, at this point in their development (3 or 4 weeks) they would begin eating birds, squirrels, and other animals that their mother killed for them.

, Weaning is not a sudden, abrupt process. Although kittens will begin being weaned in week 3 or 4, they will continue to need diminishing amounts of their mother’s milk for the next 4 weeks. During weeks 5, 6, and 7, kittens will become more assertive with their mother and will initiate nursing on their own, rather than waiting for their mother to initiate nursing.It’s also important that the kittens gain independence from their mother as the weaning process goes on. This will encourage them to look for food sources other than their mother’s milk.
Between weeks 3 and 8, give the kittens room to wander around in your house or apartment, to fulfill their natural curiosity.

, If you’re concerned that kittens will not readily take to eating solid food, you can provide a milk substitute as an intermediary step.A milk substitute is designed to provide kittens with the nourishment that they need. Pour a small amount of milk substitute into a low bowl, and place it in the room with the kittens. You should serve the milk substitute around the times when the kittens usually nurse from their mother. So, if the kittens typically nurse every two hours, you should set out a fresh bowl of milk substitute at the same interval.


You can find a milk substitute at most pet stores, and it may even be for sale at your local supermarket. If you prefer to order online, you can order a milk substitute (sometimes called a “kitten milk replacement”) from stores like PetCo and PetSmart.
Do not give kittens cow’s milk. Cow’s milk is not very nourishing to the kittens, and can give them upset stomachs and diarrhea.

, Many cat food brands manufacture a kitten-specific wet food that will provide the specific forms of nutrition needed by kittens between 3 and 10 weeks old.The food packaging itself should include instructions for when to switch the kittens over to a food for full-grown, adult cats.


Kitten-specific wet food should be included in the “Pet Food” section at any local grocery store. If you’d like a wider variety or are searching for s specific brand of food, you can look at a local pet-supply store.
If this is your first time introducing kittens to solid food, you can ask the pet-supply store sales staff which wet food for kittens they recommend.

, It often works well to transition kittens from soft, wet food to kibble. You can feed kittens wet food starting in week 3 or 4; by week 5 or 6, you can begin to introduce some dampened kibble.When you decide to start serving kibble to the kittens, you should first dampen the kibble with a small amount of water or milk. This will make the kibble easier to chew and swallow for kittens not used to hard food.


Even if you’re introducing kittens to hard kibble before introducing them to soft, wet food, it’s still important to serve them kibble that has been designed specifically for kittens.

, To begin feeding solid food to the kittens, you can scoop some soft, wet food (or milk substitute) into a small dish. Make sure to use a low dish so that the small kittens can easily access the food. This food should be served at roughly room temperature, although you can refrigerate leftover wet food. Do not serve the food to the kittens hot, as it could burn them.To encourage independence, set this dish away from the mother. You can place the food dish (and a water dish) near the kittens’ litter box., Although the kittens will soon develop larger appetites as they stop consuming their mother’s milk and begin to grow rapidly, at first they will eat relatively little. Scoop only a tablespoon of wet food (per kitten) into the dish; the kittens are too small to eat much more than this.By serving only a small amount of food, you’ll save yourself from having to throw substantial amounts of cat food away after every feeding. The kittens will also likely step in the food in the saucer, so be prepared to throw this food out also.

, Unlike grown cats, kittens need to eat many times throughout the day, as they’ll be used to frequently nursing from their mother. Since kittens will eat solid food periodically during the day, you need to serve food multiple times.Plan to give the kittens wet food 4 or 5 times each day: for example, set out a tablespoon of food per kitten at 8 am, 11 am, 3 pm, 6 pm, and 9 pm.


As kittens grow older and pass 10 weeks of age, you can begin to reduce the feeding times gradually: drop down to 4, then 3, then try only feeding kittens once in the morning and once in the evening.

, If the kittens are hesitant to approach the wet food, or are uncertain of how to interact with the new substance, pick up a little on the tip of your finger (or on the top of a clean spoon) and offer it to the kittens. Once they have a chance to smell the food, the kittens will begin to eat. Don’t be surprised if they initially only eat small amounts of the wet food.When offering wet food, be careful not to force it into the kittens’ faces. This could give them a fear of food, and could also accidentally be inhaled. Just hold your finger (with food on it) 2–3 inches from the kitten’s nose and let the cat come closer.

, Due to personality differences, some kittens will naturally be more inquisitive, and others more shy. To make sure that all of the kittens are successfully weaned, you can introduce solid food to each one individually. You can do this by picking up the kittens one at a time and taking them each over to a small dish with food in it, or by extending your finger with a small amount of food to each kitten individually.If some kittens are especially shy around the food, try gently holding their mouths open and swipe a tiny morsel off food on their tongue. This will let them taste the food and hopefully encourage them to try more.

If you're a renter, read over the terms of your lease regarding companion animals. If they are allowed, ask your landlord if your rent will be increased.Make sure no one in your household is allergic to cats. If someone is allergic, make sure they can manage their allergies before bringing a furry friend into the home. You can also consider adopting an allergy-friendly breed. These cats don't let loose as much dander as other breeds.;
, While adult cats are independent, kittens don't like to be alone for too long. If you live alone, think about who will feed your cat if you have to work late or go away on business. Ask yourself if you're willing to clean the litter box at least daily and give the cat regular brushings. Even with regular brushings, cats shed regularly. This means you'll need to vacuum about once to twice a week.If you don't live alone, you'll need to ask your housemates (significant other, children, flatmates, etc.) if they're willing to help with the responsibilities. If you have children, you could add feedings and brushings to their chores., Many shelters take care of the first check-up, microchipping, and spaying/neutering. However, you'll need to set money aside for yearly examinations and vaccinations. If you plan on letting your cat outside, you'll need to budget for heartworm prevention. You'll also need to consider the expenses involved in buying food, treats, and cat litter. If you have to be away from home often, you should also consider the cost of a trusted cat sitter.


It's also a good idea to have an emergency stash of money for unforeseen injuries and/or illnesses., Since kittens can be sensitive to harsh chemicals and other pollutants, opt for dust-free litter that won't irritate young eyes or lungs. If possible, try litter made from natural materials, like corn husks or shredded newspaper. Some natural brands come in a convenient clumping formula.Litter boxes come in a wide variety from simple pans to self-cleaning facilities. Since cats have an instinct to eliminate in dirt or sand, you don't need to litter box-train your new kitten. You will need to place the litter box in a quiet room away from the heaviest activity. The bathroom is a popular choice., Kittens need their own food bowls, even if they'll be sharing your home with older “siblings.” This is because cats tend to be territorial and can lash out at the new kitten if they try to “steal” food. Most food bowls have two compartments, one for wet food and one for dry. You can choose from plastic, metal, or ceramic. You'll also need to buy a separate bowl for water.


Keep the food and water bowls away from the litter box, since cats don't like their food and waste in the same location. Choose a different room. For example, if the litter box is in the bathroom, put the food and water bowls in the kitchen., Because kittens are still growing, they need food with the nutrients that can take care of their needs. Make sure the food is specially formulated for kittens. Compare the label with adult cat food. Make sure the kitten food is higher in calories (for energy) and DHA (for nervous system growth). Buy both canned and dry food so that your little one will get used to both.


Stick to brands that test their food with the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) or their non-U.S. equivalents. These brands are more expensive, but they're more nutritious and will put your kitten at a lower risk for illness later in life., You'll need one not only to take your new family member home but also for visits to the vet and other outings. Make sure you buy a carrier for an adult cat to avoid having to buy a larger one later. You can find carriers at pet supply stores and big box stores.

, Cats of all ages love to survey the outdoors for birds, squirrels, and other woodland creatures. Provide a perching area by at least a few windows to give your cat a variety of viewing angles. You can buy perches in pet supply stores or big box stores. They come in a wide variety, ranging from padded extensions for your window sill to floor-to-ceiling cat “trees” with multiple perching levels., Cats need to file their nails to prevent them from growing into the pads of their feet. Satisfy this need with scratching posts in the rooms you think your cat will spend the most time in. Scratching posts come in a variety of forms from simple and lightweight to large and complex. Some even come with catnip that draw the cat to the post—and away from your furniture.You can also scratch-proof your furniture if you think your cat might be tempted. Apply double-sided tape or upside down carpet runners to your furniture. If you opt for carpet runners, make sure the knobby side is facing up., Anything that dangles can strangle your cat. This includes vertical blinds, curtain/shade cords, and pooling curtains. Tie up any long cords to a height that would be out of reach to a kitten. Consider replacing your blinds and long curtains with safer alternatives like window shades and horizontal blinds., Kittens love to explore and can find dangerous objects if you're not proactive. Search for loose change, rubber bands, or anything else that might pose a danger to your cat. Look under and behind furniture, in between cushions, and in small open areas between furniture and walls.


If you can, close up any small spaces by pushing your furniture or appliances as close to the wall as possible. Tiny bodies can easily get stuck in these areas., Plants like lilies, poinsettias, tulips, and azaleas are highly toxic and can kill your cat. Opt instead for non-toxic plants like African violet, yellow rocket, or bamboo. For a complete list of toxic and non-toxic plants, check out the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)., Always adopt from a shelter. Cats end up in shelters due to abandonment, the illness/death of a past owner, and a variety of other reasons, but rarely because they're “damaged.” All they need are good, loving homes. Because animals are often euthanized to make room for new arrivals, you'll save a life when you adopt a shelter kitten., Applications often ask for your identifying info like your full name, address, and phone number. In many cases, you'll be asked for a photo ID to verify this information. You'll also have to provide information about other animals living in your home and the dates of their most recent vaccinations. Answer all questions honestly. This is to protect the kitten's safety., Wash your hands before handling anyone so that you don't spread disease to them. Be open-minded and find a cat that you feel will be a good fit for you and your family. Pick them up, play with them, and pet them. Each cat is different and has different personalities. If a cat is shy or sleepy at that moment it could just be that time of day or they may not be too used to humans. Don't try to force anything.


If you share your home with other people, bring them to the shelter with you. It's important that the entire household get involved in the decision., Many shelters require prospective pet parents to wait at least 24 hours before they can bring their little one home. This is to give you extra time to think about your decision to adopt and discuss it with others in your household. If you reconsider, you can back out without any penalties. During the waiting period, the shelter will put a hold on the kitten you chose to prevent someone else from adopting them., Most shelter contracts ask that you commit to spaying/neutering the kitten if that hasn't been taken care of. You'll also agree to keep them properly fed and vaccinated, not use them for experimentation or other form of cruelty, and will return them to the shelter if you can't provide proper care. Other terms include swearing that you have no history of cruelty to animals and will allow shelter employees to visit from time to time., Adoption fees can range from $100 to $300 and upwards. They usually include any medical care the kitten received while at the shelter, as well as transportation costs from their first home. It also helps to cover the costs of care for the animals still awaiting forever homes.Shelters always appreciate it if you chip in a little extra money as a donation. Every little bit helps to keep animals alive., Place the carrier in a quiet room. Don't force the cat to come out. Instead, let them choose to come out and investigate on their own. Give them space and time to adjust to this new environment. Most kittens will need one to two weeks to get used to their new home."

Ask for permission to interact with a cat.,
Look at the cat’s body language.,
Talk to the cat in a soft voice.,
Open the door to the cat’s cage.,
Introduce the cat to a new space.",How to Assess a Cat's Personality1," If you have not been granted access to the cat you’re interested in, visit the shelter, shop, or rescue organization where it is being housed. Ask the staff, “Has this cat’s personality been assessed?” If it has, request a summary of the assessment. If it has not, ask “May I assess this cat’s personality?” When they assent to your request, begin the assessment process.Assessing a cat’s personality is typically part of the process involved in matching cats with potential owners. With a personality assessment in hand, families and individuals interested in obtaining a cat can make a more informed decision.
If you believe you need a professional to help you conduct the cat’s personality assessment, ask for such an individual at the shelter or rescue organization where the cat is being housed.;
, There are basically three types of body postures you should look for. One is the soft and relaxed posture. This is characterized by a cat who is reclining or walking with an easygoing gait. The second posture is the tense body with twitching tail. This posture indicates a nervous demeanor. Finally, a flattened body (for instance, ears against its head and tail on the ground) with dilated pupils indicates a cat that is defensive and very fearful., Right after looking at the cat’s body language, speak to it in a reassuring manner. For instance, you might say, “Hello, good cat. You look very well today.” Observe the cat’s response.If the cat is very friendly and outgoing, it will move toward you and meow, or engage in additional behaviors to solicit affection (for instance, trying to touch you with its paw).
If the cat is moderately friendly and outgoing, it will come to the front of the cage but remain silent.
If the cat is slightly friendly, it will vocalize with a chirp or meow.
Unfriendly cats will attempt to hide.
Hostile cats will hiss, growl, stand their hair on end, keep their ears down, and in rare cases, charge at you (even from within the cage).

, After talking to the cat in a soft voice, open its cage while watching it. Cats who are more adventurous and outgoing will remain relaxed and walk right up to you when you open the cage. They might also remain standing but flick their tail back and forth. Cats who are a bit shy but not fearful will remain relaxed and calm, but will not approach you or make any motion. Cats that are very anxious or afraid will crouch in a low, defensive position and make their bodies stiff.Do not talk to the cat while opening its cage.

, After opening to door to the cat’s cage, transport the cat to a new room using a cat carrier. Place the carrier on the floor and open the door. Using a stopwatch, measure how long it takes the cat to exit the carrier.If the cat takes 25 seconds or less to exit and it steps out with head held high, and looks about inquisitively, your cat is very outgoing and friendly.
If the cat takes 25 seconds or less to exit and it steps out with a compact or slinking posture, it has a cautious personality.
If the cat exits the carrier within 25 seconds quickly, then runs beneath a hiding place (a table, chair, or similar place), the cat has a fearful personality.
If the cat takes more than 25 seconds to exit, or does not exit at all, it might be scared, or it might just be an easygoing cat that enjoys observing more than exploring.

"
Time how long the cat interacts with you in a new space.,
Call the cat over.,
Extend your hand to the cat.,
Pet the cat.,
Don’t test the cat using fake appendages.,
Play with the cat.",How to Assess a Cat's Personality2," Once the cat exits the carrier, reset your stopwatch and measure the time the cat spends interacting with you. Interaction is defined as sitting in your lap, rubbing against your leg, meowing or chirping at you, and looking at you. Do not encourage the cat to interact with you. Make no sound or motion apart from looking at the cat.If the cat spends less than 30 seconds interacting with you, it might be shy or afraid.
If the cat interacts with you for 30-60 seconds, it has a pleasant and agreeable personality. In day-to-day activities, the cat will probably divide its time equally between playing or interacting with you and spending time in solitude.
If the cat interacts with you for over 60 seconds, it has a very friendly and agreeable personality, and probably craves human attention.

, Once you’ve measured the length of the cat’s baseline level of interest in you, move to a distance of about six feet (two meters) from the cat. Crouch down. Call the cat to you in a soft and encouraging manner. Watch carefully how it interacts with you.If the cat does not make eye contact, it is more cautious and shy than a cat that does make eye contact.
If the cat sniffs or nuzzles you, it is very friendly and enjoys being the center of attention. If it rolls on its back, inviting a tummy rub, it has a trusting personality. This is also a sign it is friendly and open to new experiences.
If the cat watches you from a distance and does not approach, it has a relatively private personality, and prefers monitoring the situation rather than engaging with other pets or people.
If the cat retreats, it has the type of personality that spooks easily and perhaps needs time to develop trust.

, Your hand should be below the cat’s head with the palm facing up. If the cat didn’t approach you when you called it, approach the cat slowly and carefully. If the cat swats at your hand, hisses, or tries to bite your hand, back away. This indicates that the cat likes being left alone and doesn’t enjoy social interaction. If the cat sniffs, licks, or nuzzles your hand, this indicates the cat is relatively outgoing and social., While talking to the cat in a gentle, reassuring manner, turn your hand over so the palm faces down. Curve your hand slightly. Place your hand on the cat’s head, then move it gently along the length of the cat’s body until you reach the mid-back. At that point, lift your hand up, then place it again on the cat’s head. Repeat the motion several times while monitoring your cat’s reaction.Cats that are fearful or hostile will bite or swat your hand away.
Cats that are independent but also enjoy spending time with people will roll on their backs, meow or make another vocalization, and circle you attentively.
Cats that are highly social and very outgoing will rub against your hand, encouraging you to continue petting them.

, In order to test their cat’s personality, some people like to “stroke” the cat using a hand made of rubber or plastic. However, these objects will alarm most cats, who rely on smell more than visual data to identify what is and is not dangerous., Happy and healthy cats will never pass up a chance to chase a toy. Move about three feet (one meter) away from the cat and sit on the floor. Slowly pull a piece of yarn along the floor in front of you. You could also roll a ball or use a similar cat toy. Observe the cat’s reaction.Cats that have playful and energetic personalities will watch the toy intently and chase it. They might try to snuggle against you while you move the toy about, too.
Cats that are less energetic and extremely independent will ignore the toy, attend to something else, and/or not make eye contact with you.

"
"
Allow the cat to relax.,
House the cat comfortably.,
Do not conduct a personality exam alongside a physical exam.,
Only assess cats during periods of good health.",How to Assess a Cat's Personality3," If you’ve just recently moved the cat to a new environment – a new home or an animal shelter, for instance – give it time to acclimate to the environment. Most animals will be skittish and anxious when they first arrive in an unfamiliar place. In order to accurately determine what sort of personality the cat has, wait at least a day or two for it to calm down., You can put the cat at ease by housing it in a clean, quiet room, and using a cage that has plenty of room to move around. Since cats are fearful when trapped and looked down upon, house the cage at waist level or above. Play some soft music for the cat, and allow the cat to look out into the room to see human activity. Keep other cats away, unless they are of the opposite gender of the cat whose personality you wish to assess., During physical examinations, cats are prodded and turned over. They might receive shots or have their blood drawn. These experiences will alarm and stress your cat, making it difficult to accurately assess the cat’s baseline personality. Therefore, assessing your cat’s personality while it is receiving a physical exam is not a good idea., Don’t try to assess cats who are sick or injured. When cats are sick or injured, they will be less responsive and might act in novel and unpredictable ways. Therefore, wait until sick or injured cats are healed before assessing their personalities.For the same reason, don’t try to assess the personality of a cat in heat.

Get a meat grinder.,
Prepare the bones to be ground.,
Prepare a ""catching pot"" where the ground bones will fall into.

,
Grind the bones.,
Disassemble the meat grinder when finished, and wash thoroughly with hot water & soap.

",How to Grind Bones," Many prefer electric meat grinders because they're easier and faster, but also more expensive ($80+). Manual meat grinders are 'a thing of the past' but can still be found online, in shops, and on sites like eBay and Craigslist for relatively cheap (under $40). Be sure to choose a grinder that comes apart completely so that it is easy to wash.;
, If preparing a meal for an animal, use raw bones (only raw bones - never cooked!) and use the soft, pliable bones that the animal would normally eat in the wild. Poultry wing tips, the ribcage, necks and backs are all good choices. Do not attempt to grind up leg bones or anything larger or thicker than your thumb - these may prove to be too difficult for the grinder, and while perhaps gnawed on, the actual bone would not likely be consumed by a cat, anyway (too large & coarse). Fish, poultry, rabbit & rodent bones are all okay to grind.

,,


Marrow, blood, and other tissue will be present in some bone. This is OK and healthy for the animal to consume.

, After you have looked at 3 or more cats, decide which cat to get.

, Before getting your cat, check for any sickness. Check the eyes, to be sure that their eyes are healthy, they should be nice and bright, and the ears the should not smell or have a black substance inside of them. Check the nose for any signs of wheezing, and then check the cat's fur for fleas or ticks. Any harmful bug should not be in their fur.

, You will need to fill out paperwork and may need to provide information about your living situation. You will have to pay a small fee (usually under 50 dollars) and take your cat home.

, For about a week, keep your cat in a room that's safe for him or her. A shelter cat can be harder to take care of; since it may have been abused in its old home. Make sure to be kind to your new friend. Take your cat to the vet the first week to make sure he or she is healthy and does not have any disease from the shelter.

, If you have other pets like a dog, get him or her in a cage, and also get your cat in a cage and shut the doors. Put your cat and your other pet facing each other in their cages for a little while so they can get used to one another. Do one pet at a time if you have multiple pets.

, When you adopt a new pet, they should be your friend for life!

Your vet will provide you with the correct dosage depending on your cat’s weight and food. They can also recommend a suitable supplement for your cat., Fatty acids have plenty of benefits for your cat’s health. That being said, there are a few negative side effects that can result from giving your cat too much fish oil. For example, it can reduce blood clotting abilities. If your cat begins to experience diarrhea it is a sign that you are over dosing, Each product will have different dosing requirements, so read the packaging carefully. If you change brands, even if it's the same type of supplement, reevaluate your cat's dosage using the new brand's guidelines to make sure that you're giving your cat the correct amount.

It's best to ask your vet to help you determine the proper dosage. They will be able to help you make sure that you do not accidentally harm your pet.

, Fatty acid supplements are commonly used by veterinarians and their clients, and it is likely your veterinarian has a product that they know and trust. Fatty acid supplements can interact with some medications, and some cats should not have them. Always consult your veterinarian before starting your cat on a new supplement., Greenlip mussel oil is harvested from mussels and is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids for cats. They contain 33 fatty acids, five of which are essential omega 3 fatty acids. Greenlip mussel oil comes in a small, easily digestible tablet and does not have as strong of a flavor as other fish oils. As a result, it is much easier to feed to cats., Cats don't process omega 3s from plant based sources and as a result they need to be given animal sources of fatty acids. Some cats may also be allergic to fish and unable to get their essential oils through fish oils. If this is the case, try giving your cat krill oil. This is a great source of omega 3 fatty acid and comes in both capsule and liquid form.Be sure to always give fish oils that are made specifically for pets.

, Cod liver oil, which is considered an excellent supplement for humans, should not be given to cats. This oil, although full of healthy omega 3 fatty acids, also contains high levels of vitamin A and D, which can be toxic to cats., Some fatty acids can be given to your cat in the form of a capsule or pill. For example, Greenlip mussel oil comes in a small capsule that you can feed to your cat. Try hiding the pill in a treat so that your cat will easily take the pill., You can also buy fish oils in liquid form. The best way to give liquid fish oil to your cat, is by putting a few drops on top of their food. This way they will consume the fatty acids while eating. Fish oil can have a strong smell and taste so it is best to start with a small dose and continue adding until your cat has become comfortable.You can also break open a capsule and squeeze the liquid onto their food.

, Some pet foods will list essential fatty acids in their ingredient list. Look for Omega 6 and Omega 3 fatty acids. That being said, due to the processing involved in making commercial pet foods, most of the nutritional value of the omega 3 fatty acids is lost during this process. As a result, it is still good to supplement omega 3 fatty acids in your cat’s diet.Talk with your vet to determine the proper dosage for your cat.

, Sardines are an excellent source of omega 3 fatty acid and can be given to your cat as a treat. Unlike salmon, sardines do not live long enough to store toxins in their body, making them a great source of essential fatty acids. It is not as easy to determine the appropriate dosage when providing cats with fatty acids through fish.Providing supplements is a much easier way to ensure that your cat is getting the proper dosage.

, Fatty acids are readily available through a variety of cold water fish, such as salmon, cod, tuna, and sardines. You can try giving your cat water cold fish as a snack, to supplement their regular food."

Make your own treats.,
Avoid foods that are toxic to cats.,
Read the labels on premade treats.,
Look for treats high in protein, amino acids, and minerals.",How to Give a Kitten Treats1," If you plan to give your kitten treats, making your own is the best option. These treats can include cooked pieces of tuna, chicken, fish, liver, or eggs. Kittens need about 30 percent of their diet to come from protein, so lean meats are a great option for snacks. For an even healthier option, buy organic meats and eggs to cook for your kitten.Cut treats into bite-sized pieces. This will help you control the portion size of the treat and make it easy for your kitten to eat and digest.It might take some trial and error to discover which treats are your kitten’s favorites. Try feeding your kitten a variety of treats until you discover which ones it likes best.;
, Many “human” foods can be harmful to cats. When you’re making treats for your kitten, keep it simple. Stick to mostly lean, unseasoned meats and avoid the following foods as they can be toxic to cats: raisins, grapes, onions, onion powder, alcohol, salt, tea, caffeine, chocolate, garlic, bread dough, avocados, certain nuts (like macadamia nuts), fruit seeds, mushrooms, and tomatoes. You should also avoid feeding your cat cooked bones as these can splinter and cause internal damage to your kitten.In addition, many cats are lactose intolerant, so giving your kitten milk could cause it to have diarrhea.Always check with your vet about what you should and shouldn’t feed your kitten.

, Figuring out what is in premade cat treats is not always easy; labels are often vague, neglect to list all of the ingredients, and often don’t include a calorie count. When you’re picking out a premade treat for your kitten, look for treats that are approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). At the very least, this will ensure your kitten’s treats meet pet food manufacturing standards.

To find out more about the ingredients in a specific type of treat and the amount of calories it contains, contact the pet food manufacturer. There should be a number provided on the packaging.
You vet should be able to provide you with some quality options for kitten treats as well.It is recommended you avoid giving your kitten catnip until it is between three and six months old., Although the labels on cat and kitten treats are usually vague, if it does list the ingredients, choose a treat that has a high protein content and also provides a good amount of amino acids and minerals. Kittens require a higher amount of these nutrients than adult cats.Ingredients on pet food labels are listed in order of predominance, so when you’re looking for a treat that is high in protein, choose one with “meat” or “meat meal” listed as the first ingredient.
It is best to stay away from treats that have artificial colors, flavors, stabilizers, and preservatives, but it can be tough to find one that excludes these altogether. If you can’t find a treat that contains no artificial ingredients, look for ones that are identified as “Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS).”"

Talk with your veterinarian.,
Decide whether to buy seeds or grown plants.,
Buy from a reputable store.,
Sign up for a delivery program.,
Select the right type of grass.",How to Give Cat Grass to a Cat1," At the annual appointment for your cat, bring up your interest in getting some grass for your cat. Talk to the vet about whether or not that would be beneficial for your cat’s individual health and circumstances. Ask them for tips regarding buying the grass and monitoring your cat’s health as they eat it.For example, you might tell your vet, “I’ve noticed that my cat is very interested in my houseplants. Do you think it would be a good idea to get my cat a bed of indoor grass to chew on?”;
, The benefit of buying seeds is that you potentially get a longer growing period as the grass will be good to eat for a full two weeks after maturation. However, you have no guarantee that planting seeds will result in quality, even grass. Buying a full-grown grass patch will allow to access the health of the grass, while allowing your cat the chance to eat it right away., Most pet stores, outdoors stores, and hardware stores offer cat grass plots or the seeds needed to plant your own patch. Before you buy, read any online reviews that you can find about the quality of the plants sold at that particular store. This is especially important if you choose to buy from an online vendor.Also, try to determine whether or not your purchase will be covered by some sort of guarantee. Many stores will offer to refund your money on any plants that don’t live past a certain period.

, If you would like to offer grass to your cat on a consistent basis, but don’t want to deal with the hassle of picking it up or growing it, then a delivery option might be good for you. Some online pet stores allow you to sign up for bi-weekly or monthly grass deliveries. Quite often, this cat grass is fully grown, ready to be consumed, and sometimes even organic.If you agree to one of these programs, make sure that they offer different types of grass so that you can switch in case your cat disagrees with a particular one.
With a delivery program, make sure that you have good place to receive the deliveries. You won’t want the grass sitting outside for too long before bringing it inside, for example.

, There are many different types of grass that fall under the general label of cat grass. You can choose orchard grass, common oat, barley, or even wheatgrass. These plants all have different tastes when eaten, so it is a good idea to purchase a few varieties or rotate them out for your cat. Then, watch to see if your cat eats more, or regurgitates more, of one type.Getting a mixed blend cat grass plot, or seed package, is another option. If your cat eats a mixture of different grass types this mimics what they might do in the wild.You may also find that certain grass types grow better in your home than others. Experiment with sunlight exposure and light levels with the grass varieties.

Purchase organic catnip.,
Buy loose catnip.,
Purchase a catnip spray.,
Grow fresh catnip.,
Freeze catnip.",How to Give Catnip to Your Cat1," When shopping for catnip, opt for brands that are organically grown. In addition to being pesticide and chemical-free, organic catnip is generally fresher and more effective than lesser quality catnip. Organically grown catnip is sold in fresh, dried, flake, pellet, oil, and spray forms., Catnip is more or less potent in different forms, depending on the level of nepetalactone present. When you buy loose catnip, look for kinds that have fewer stems than leaves and blossoms. The latter contain more of the chemical and have a stronger effect.Dried catnip can be safely chewed or ingested by cats, and may be inserted into toys, or simply sprinkled around your cat's play area in a small amount (e.g. approximately one tbsp, or 0.5 oz).

, For a lighter concentration of catnip, purchase a spray, which will have lower levels of nepetalactone. Catnip spray can be used to steer your cat towards certain toys or furniture in an effort to keep it away from others (e.g. spraying your cat's bed to keep it away from the couch). Look for a spray that contains all-natural ingredients, and no chemicals or preservatives., Buy a catnip plant to have a constant, fresh supply of the herb, or grow catnip indoors. If you have a garden, grow catnip plants outdoors. Make sure plants get plenty of sunlight and moisture. Cut off leaves as needed to give to your cat to chew, paw at, rub against, or eat.Fresh catnip can be dried and stored for later use.

, To preserve the effectiveness of catnip, store it in the freezer. Freezing will prevent the herb's essential oil from drying up, which would reduce the effectiveness of the herb. Place catnip in a freezer bag or plastic container and seal it firmly before freezing it. Remove catnip from the freezer and thaw when needed."

Give treats in moderation.,
Provide treats for positive behavior.,
Give treats as a skill-building game.",How to Give a Kitten Treats2," You should give your kitten treats no more than two or three times a week. Feeding it treats more frequently may cause your kitten to avoid eating its food in the hopes of receiving a treat that it finds tastier. Overfeeding cats can contribute to obesity issues and result in health problems.Treats should make up no more than five percent of your kitten’s diet., The best time to provide treats to your kitten is when you’re giving it as a reward for positive behavior, like using the litter box or coming to you when you call its name. When you begin this type of training, you’ll be giving your kitten far more than the recommended amount of treats. Once your cat starts consistently demonstrating the behaviors you’ve trained it to do, cut back on the amount of treats you give it. Instead, reward it with a treat only occasionally, replacing treats with other types of rewards like throwing its ball or showing it affection.

When you’re training your kitten, reward its positive behavior immediately. Cats have short attention spans and will not know what to associate the treat with if you wait too long after they perform the behavior you want.
If you’re feeding your cat more than the recommended amount of treats, cut down on the amount of food you give it at meals. Think about your kitten’s overall food intake, factoring in treats, and keep it consistent., Kittens and cats have a natural instinct to hunt prey. You can turn giving your kitten treats into a fun skill-building game by hiding its treat and encouraging your cat to hunt it down. To do this, try some of the following methods:

Hide a treat out of sight (under a chair, for example), and then encourage your kitten to go find it. Let your kitten smell the treat first so it knows what to look for. You may need to help your kitten by giving it hints as to where the treat is hidden. For example, drag your finger along the ground toward the treat or shine a laser pointer or light in the direction of the treat.
Get a food puzzle for your cat to play with throughout the day. Put a treat in this puzzle and let your cat figure out how to get the treat out.
Attach the treat to the end of a string and let your kitten try to catch the treat as you move the string around."
"
Choose the correct container.,
Soak your seeds prior to planting.,
Cover the seeds.,
Keep the soil moist, not wet.,
Keep the grass trimmed short.,
Replace your grass every two weeks.",How to Give Cat Grass to a Cat2," You’ll need a container that is large enough to provide space for the grass to grow. But, also one that is a manageable size to keep and maintain indoors. Most people find that a small flower planter or a 6 inch (15.2 cm) by 6 inch wooden square container is sufficient. After all, you will be continually trimming and replanting, so a large container isn’t necessary for the health of the grass.You’ll also want a container that your cat will feel comfortable approaching and eating from. For example, if shiny objects frighten your cat, you may want to stay away from a silver planter or one that will catch the light.

, After you purchase your grass seeds and prepare your planter, take the seeds out of their package. Place them in a glass and fill it with water. Let the seeds soak up the water for 6-8 hours. Then, remove the seeds and place them immediately into the planter surrounded by fresh soil., At the bottom of the planter, add at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil. Place the seeds on top of this soil and cover them with a light sprinkling of soil. Don’t bury the seeds deeply, just make sure that you can no longer see them. If you want to accelerate the growing process, cover the soil with a layer of plastic wrap, which will trap any moisture. Give the seeds 3-4 days to grow and then remove the wrap., Fill a small spray bottle with water and mist the soil at least once each day. You want the soil to be damp to help the seeds to take hold, but not saturated or they will fall too deeply into the soil and will not sprout out. In the initial period, you can peel back the plastic wrap in order to mist the soil.In order to keep the moisture from escaping, you may want to line your grass container with plastic or place it on top of something that can catch the run off.

, Most of the various brands of cat grass can grow quite high if left unchecked. However, cats may not feel as comfortable eating from containers with very high grass. So, use scissors to trim your cat grass down to a manageable height of 2 inches (5.1 cm). Your cat will also help to keep the grass trimmed by chewing on it, but it won’t be uniform., After about two weeks of trimming, your cat grass will reach full maturity and will need to be replaced. It is a good idea to plant a handful of plots, staggering them by a week at a time, so that you will always have fresh grass ready for your cat. Try not to keep the plot beyond this fresh period or the taste may change and your cat may reject grass entirely."
"
Remove all poisonous plants from your home.,
Place the grass in an accessible area.,
Let your cat check out the new grass.,
Expect your cat to eat more when stressed.,
Know that some regurgitation is okay.,
Consider pairing it with catnip.",How to Give Cat Grass to a Cat3," When your cat begins to chew on grass, they may see all of your household plants as fair game food. Before you introduce any grass into your home, go through and evaluate all of your houseplants. Remove those that are potentially poisonous or dangerous.Some plants that are dangerous to cats, include figs, onions, and lilies.

, If your cat likes to chew on other plants or furniture, you may want to put the cat grass container directly in front of these as a distraction. You also want the grass in a area that the cat frequently visits, so that they don’t have to seek it out. Place the container in a spot where the cat can’t knock it off either, or you may end up with a broke container and dirty carpet.The cat grass container will also need exposure to a certain amount of light, at least a few hours every day.

, After you place the grass down, expect your cat to walk around the container and give it a sniff or two. They may even try to claw or paw at the grass a bit. They may do some tentative chewing at this point or go directly into more aggressive biting on the strands., You may start to notice that your cat will go and chew on the grass plot, or lie down next to it, when they are feeling overwhelmed or anxious. After grass has been available to your cat for some time, they will start to associate it with calming emotions. This, in turn, may reduce some of your cat’s other destructive behaviors, such as furniture clawing., It is not uncommon for cats to spit up a few strands of grass and saliva after eating from their plot. This can actually be a good thing as it allows your cat to clear out other non-digested matter from their stomachs at the same time. Be prepared for these moments by having a good stain spray on hand.If you’ve noticed that your cat’s vomit includes blood, or if your cat stops eating their other food, then you should contact your vet for advice., You can either grow catnip in a separate container, which you can then place close to the grass plot. You can intermix catnip seeds with grass ones and grow it all together. Or, you can sprinkled dried catnip on top of the fresh grass. You may notice that your cat will rub their face on top of the grass plot after you do this and that is a normal reaction."
"
Buy refillable toys.,
Make a simple sock toy.,
Roll up a simple paper ball.",How to Give Catnip to Your Cat2," Instead of buying toys that are already filled or scented with catnip, purchase refillable toys at a pet store or online. Pre-filled toys may contain low-quality catnip that will lose its effectiveness quickly. You can fill refillable toys with good quality, organic catnip and continually replace it to make sure that the herb is always potent enough to have an effect on your cat., Make a simple catnip toy using a clean, stray sock. Add a pinch or two of catnip to the sock and seal it tightly with a knot. Replace catnip every week or so to ensure that it is potent.Alternatively, sew the top shut with a needle and thread.

, Cats often amuse themselves by playing with everyday household items, so stick to the basics when giving catnip toys to your cat. Put a pinch of catnip (in fresh, dried, pellet, or flake form) into a small paper bag. Crush it into a tight ball for your cat to play with.Crush the bag into a tight enough ball that it can't be opened up by your cat.

"
"
Observe your cat's reaction.,
Ration catnip for your cat.,
Use catnip for training.",How to Give Catnip to Your Cat3," Your cat's reaction to catnip should happen very quickly after it smells it (one or two sniffs of catnip is sometimes enough to evoke a ""high"" in your pet). Note that sensitivity to catnip is hereditary, and approximately 1 in 2 cats won't react to the herb at all. If your cat does react, you will observe it:


Sniffing
Purring
Licking and chewing the catnip
Rubbing its chin and cheek
Rubbing its body against things (e.g. the carpet)

, If you offer a cat catnip too often, the effects can wear off completely. Opt to offer catnip to your pet only once a week to maintain the ""high"" it experiences from the herb, which generally lasts for about 5-15 minutes. It may take up to two hours for your cat's behavior to completely return to normal, during which your cat will not be susceptible to the effects of catnip., If your cat has the bad habit of scratching furniture and other important household items, use catnip to train it out of this behavior. Purchase a catnip spray (from your local pet store, or online) and spray a scratching post for your cat. When your cat feels the overwhelming need to scratch, it will opt for the alluring surface of the scratching post instead of the couch or kitchen table."
"
Offer small amounts at frequent intervals.,
Change your kitten’s food brand.,
Ask your veterinarian about a convalescent diet.,
Try heating the food.,
Do not hide medicine in your kitten’s food.,
Make sure your kitten stays hydrated.,
Try finger feeding your kitten.,
Try feeding your kitten via syringe.",How to Get a Sick Kitten to Eat1," When your kitten is sick, the best approach is to offer smaller portions, but more often. Thus, offering a mouthful every one to two hours is ideal, as long as you are not waking the kitten up for feedings.


Note that very young kittens should be woken up for frequent feedings.;
, Sometimes sick kittens do not feel like eating their regular food and have to be given something different just to make them more interested in eating. By changing the brand or flavor, you might be able to get your kitten interested enough to taste some of the food. When your kitten is sick even getting a little amount of food in him can make a difference.Here are a few foods that are easier for kittens to eat:


Gravy-based cat food
Packaged chicken-flavored baby food
Boiled chickenUnseasoned, cooked rice

, Convalescent diets are specially designed to meet the needs of a sick animal that is not eating well. They are extremely nutrient dense, so a 1 kg (2.2 lb) kitten might receive his daily calorie needs from just under a third of a tin. The two most widely available diets are Hills AD (suitable for cats and dogs), and Royal Canin Feline Convalescent Diet. These highly palatable diets include:


Protein, which provides building blocks for repair of body tissues and strengthens the immune system.
Fats and carbohydrates, which provide metabolic energy for the kitten to run his organs and fight infection.
Zinc and potassium, which aid wound healing.
Vitamins E and C, plus Taurine, which have antioxidant properties to help the body detox, and also fortify the immune system

, If your kitten has a congested nose, he will stop eating for two reasons--he can’t smell the food and it is difficult to eat with a clogged up nose. Try heating the food a little bit (not more than 30 seconds in the microwave) and then serve it. Heating will enhance the aroma of the food and most likely lure the kitten into eating some of it. Warm food also tastes better.


Cleaning a kitten’s congested nose with nasal drops can also help in encouraging him to eat.

, A sick kitten needs his medicine, but never make the mistake of hiding his medicine in his food. Kittens can detect medicine — both through taste and smell — and will not eat food with medicine in it. Hiding the medicine will only ensure that your kitten will not come near the food next time, whether there is medicine in it or not.


Keep medicine separate and force feed it at regular intervals. It will be an unpleasant task and the kitten will not like it, but this is something you have to do.

, It is very important to make sure that your kitten is getting enough water and is staying hydrated. Dehydration in kittens can be a very serious problem and when they are sick it becomes even more serious. If your kitten refuses to drink water, try adding some water to her food. Not only will it make the food more palatable, it will also hydrate her at the same time.


The first thing to check when your kitten refuses to drink water is whether his water dish is clean or not. Kittens do not like to drink water from an unclean surface.

, Put a small amount of food on your finger and bring it to the kitten’s mouth. Try not to force your finger into the kitten’s mouth as it will irritate him. Let him lick the food at his own pace and be patient.

, If finger feeding does not work, give syringe feeding a try. You'll need a clean syringe with the needle removed, filled with a liquid food. Hold the kitten gently and insert the syringe in his mouth at an angle. Do not insert it straight into his mouth as doing so will make the food go straight to the back of his throat and could cause your kitten to choke. Bend it to the right or left side and squeeze a small amount of food onto the back of the tongue. The kitten will swallow the food that is on the back of the tongue. Repeat the process several times until you think he has had enough to eat, varying the position of the syringe to avoid rubbing the mouth too much in one spot.


Try using a milk replacer powder for cats if you don't have a liquid food prescribed by a vet. Do not use ordinary milk.
The food should be at room temperature, or preferably slightly warmer but not hot.

Be prepared for diarrhea or constipation.",How to Get Your Kitten to Eat," If you've found a newborn kitten outside and think it has been abandoned, watch and wait to make sure that the mother is not nearby.You should not stand close to the kitten or touch it until you've determined that there is not a mother cat nearby. Stay at least 35 feet away and wait for several hours before you intervene. It is not uncommon for mother cats to temporarily leave their litter while hunting. In some cases, a mother cat will reject a kitten, particularly if the kitten is a runt or otherwise unhealthy. She may refuse to nurse the kitten and may even harm it. In this case, take the kitten away from the mother and feed it yourself.
Only when and if you are certain that there is no mother to feed the kitten, proceed to the next step.;
, Newborn kittens are those under two weeks old, and they survive on a diet of milk and cannot digest solid food. Since their dietary needs are different from older kittens, you will need to bottle feed if your kitten is a newborn.


Kittens are born blind and deaf. If the kitten is a newborn, then its eyes and ears will still be sealed shut. A kitten's eyes will start to open when the kitten is around seven to 10 days old.
You can also determine whether a kitten is a newborn by looking for front teeth in its mouth. Kittens do not get their front teeth until three to four weeks old, so a kitten with no front teeth is likely a newborn.
Newborn kittens are also mostly immobile or just learning to crawl.

, Be sure you have the proper supplies on hand, and if not, have someone run to the store while you get the kitten comfortable.


You need a warm place for her to stay (a cardboard box with warm towels will do for now; newborn kittens can't climb out of boxes). The kitten must be warm before you attempt to feed her; feel her ears and pads of her feet, and if they feel cool, she is too cold to eat. Put her in your shirt or hold her in your warm hands and cover her with a blanket or towel until you can raise her body temperature.You will need powdered kitten milk, available from any pet store. Many pet stores also sell canned formula for kittens, but it can cause diarrhea in newborns, so stick with the powdered kind if it is available.You will also need a kitten bottle and nipple, available at pet stores. If that is unavailable or if you cannot get one in time, you can use an infant medicine dropper in a pinch, but it will take longer to feed the kitten and won't help the kitten learn to suck and develop its oral motor skills.

, Mix the formula according to package directions, warming it carefully to about 95°F (35°C). Wash the bottle and nipple, then pour the formula into the bottle, swishing it gently to ensure that the heat is evenly distributed (to avoid burning the kitten's mouth).


To feed the kitten, do not flip her on her back or elevate her head. She will choke. Instead, picture how a kitten nurses on the mother, with feet and head downward. Tip the bottle, not the kitten, and let the kitten suck the milk out of the bottle.
If the kitten does not begin suckling, hold her head between your palm and fingers and squeeze a few drops of formula into her mouth.
Brand-new kittens will eat only a teaspoon or so for every 4 ounces of body weight. Be sure you don't force the kitten to eat more than she wants.
Be sure to store any unused formula in the refrigerator. It contains milk and it will spoil if left at room temperature.

, This might sound silly, but a bottle-fed kitten needs to be burped just like a human infant. The process of bottle feeding can fill a kitten's abdomen with air, which must be expelled gently.


Hold her up on your shoulder with a hand under her belly. Gently pat her back.

, Kittens under four weeks old have not yet developed the ability to urinate or defecate without being stimulated, which the mother typically does by licking the kitten's anus.Dampen a washcloth with warm water and wipe under the kitten's tail gently, in one direction. The kitten will likely urinate after every feeding and defecate once or more a day. When you are stimulating her anus, you must keep doing it until she has finished urinating or defecating, or she will not finish emptying her bladder or bowels.
If you do not stimulate her to eliminate, she will not be able to eat more food. After she has used the bathroom, offer her a bit more formula. If she seems uninterested, she is likely done.

, Newborn kittens, like newborn humans, have tiny stomachs and must be fed frequently to survive. Set an alarm and ensure that you offer food every three hours.You must also stimulate her to poop every time she eats.
Do not over- or under-feed the kitten, which can cause diarrhea and dehydration and can be fatal for a newborn kitten., There are several health issues that might be why she is not eating.


If milk dribbles out of her nose and she seems to choke when nursing, ask the veterinarian to check for a cleft hard palate in her mouth.

, Kittens typically get their back teeth at around five weeks of age, and this is when they can begin switching from a milk-based diet to a solid food diet.


Gently open the kitten's mouth and look for front and back teeth. The teeth should be fully emerged, not just lightly poking through the gums.

, There are many types and varieties of solid kitten food on the market, including many varieties of crunchy, dry cat food and soft, moist canned food. Many kittens prefer softer food, as it is easier to eat and can ease the transition from milk to solid food.If you don't want to pay for more expensive canned cat foods, try adding a bit of warm milk to kitten kibble and let it sit for a minute to soften.

, Kittens have different nutritional needs than older cats, and cat food will not provide enough calcium, protein, and other things that she needs.Kittens must eat kitten food until they are about six to nine months old, or until they have been spayed or neutered.

, Kittens have tiny tummies and need to eat every few hours.Try offering her moist, warm (but never hot) kitten food every three hours, but leave a small amount of dry kitten kibble for her to chew on as she pleases throughout the day., Don't reserve water for meal times. Monitor the water bowl and ensure that your kitten drinks.


If she doesn't, use a kitten bottle or infant medicine dropper to give her some water.If she becomes dehydrated, you can offer children's Pedialyte., If an older kitten refuses to eat solid foods, you can bottle feed or even force feed milk-based formulas such as kitten formula from the pet store or the emergency kitten formulas listed in the next part.


This is not a long-term solution, since the dietary needs of older kittens and cats is very different from newborn kittens; however, it will keep your kitten from becoming dehydrated and will buy you some time as you figure out what she will eat.
To force feed a reluctant or ill kitten, use a small syringe or eye dropper (you can ask for an infant medicine dropper at any pharmacy). Fill it with kitten formula (or alternately, with a mix of canned kitten food and milk, whisked together to make a slurry), then insert in the side of the kitten's mouth while holding the kitten securely on your lap (do not turn the kitten upside down. Always feed a kitten feet-down). Squirt it gently and repeat. Don't overfeed the kitten., If she will not eat and is looking sick, she could be suffering from a serious feline illness and need treatment. Even if her illness is not severe, she will not be able to survive if she doesn't eat.


A vet can assess your kitten's condition, treat her illness, and give you tips for getting her to eat.

, While it is convenient, it is not nutritious enough for a kitten and a kitten on an exclusive cow's milk diet will starve.


Cow's milk will also cause diarrhea which will lead to dehydration.

, If you can't get your hands on kitten formula locally and don't have time to wait on an internet order, you can make a recipe using ingredients available at your grocery store. Try one of these, but remember: these are not long-term feeding solutions but only for emergencies:


Try powdered human formula, but at double the normal strength. You can purchase human baby formula at any grocery or big box store. It is not nutritious enough for kittens, so double the amount of powdered formula to one part of water.
Try a goat's milk based formula: Combine a quart of whole goat milk; a tablespoon of plain, nonfat yogurt; a teaspoon of light corn syrup (such as Karo syrup), one egg yolk, and a package of unflavored gelatin in a small saucepan. Heat just until the gelatin is dissolved, and store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week. To use, heat a small amount for a few seconds in the microwave, until it feels warm when you dip some onto your wrist.
Try mixing one can of evaporated milk, one egg yolk, and two tablespoons of light corn syrup (such as Karo syrup). Store in a sealed jar in the fridge. To use, mix the formula with equal parts of hot water. You can also add a drop of human baby liquid multivitamins once a day to the formula for added nutrition.

, These formula recipes will work in an emergency, but can cause digestive issues since they are not ideal kitten food. In case of these issues, there are a few things you can try:


In case of diarrhea, you can replace some of the water with unflavored Pedialyte. This is a product made for human children, found in most big box stores and pharmacies.For constipation, add a drop of vegetable oil to one bottle of kitten formula. Do this once a day until the constipation is gone.

Give your kitten meloxicam if they are over six weeks old.,
Keep your kitten warm.,
Provide a comfortable nesting space.,
Seek veterinary care if necessary.",How to Get a Sick Kitten to Eat2," Meloxicam (also known as Metacam) belongs to a family of drugs called NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs). Meloxicam works by inhibiting an enzyme, COX-2, which triggers prostaglandin release, which in turn limits the inflammation that leads to fever. Meloxicam is a useful drug to reduce fever.


Meloxicam is only for kittens over six weeks of age, and only if no sickness or diarrhea.
Meloxicam needs to be given with food lining the stomach, so never dose your kitten with meloxicam if they are not eating at all.
The recommended maintenance dose is 0.05mg/kg one daily of feline meloxicam. Thus, a 1 kg (2.2 lb) kitten needs 0.1ml of cat Metacam. Note that meloxicam is formulated in two strengths: for dogs (1.5mg/ml) and for cats (0.5mg/ml). Dog Metacam is three times more concentrated, and extreme care should be taken when considering its use in the feline as inadvertent overdose may easily occur.
Meloxicam should only be used in well hydrated animals. Dehydrated animals may have impaired renal function; the additional decrease in blood supply to the kidney may tip the animal into renal failure.
Meloxicam must be given with or after food. If the cat is not eating, be sure to line his stomach by syringe feeding a small amount of food. Do not give Metacam on a completely empty stomach. The inhibitory effect on the blood supply to the stomach will be exacerbated, which can lead to serious gastric ulceration.
Do not give meloxicam with or after other NSAIDs or steroids. Doing so can cause gastric ulceration, gastro-intestinal ulceration, and bleeding -- with possibly fatal blood loss.

, A chilled kitten will feel sluggish and be slower to recover, which will make it more difficult to get him to eat.

, Sick kittens feel vulnerable, and they will recover more effectively if they have a place to hide. Provide a nesting area or cardboard box lined with blankets.

, If your kitten seems very ill, or if your kitten's symptoms persist for more than a day or so, see a veterinarian.

Watch for constant scratching.,
Pay attention to constant licking.,
Keep an eye on your cat’s coat.,
Look out for gastrointestinal distress.,
Watch for food avoidance.,
Understand these symptoms can indicate other medical problems.",How to Know if Your Cat Needs Gluten‐Free Food1," When a cat has an allergy or intolerance to a particular food-borne allergen, like gluten, they may develop small, pale bumps on the skin in response to the allergen. These small, fluid-filled bumps will cause the cat to scratch. Common places for the bumps and subsequent scratching include the head and neck area., If your cat has a gluten allergy or intolerance, it might begin persistently licking its paws, legs, or abdomen. The licking can be a result of inflammation. It can also indicate an allergic response to allergens like gluten., Food sensitivities can affect your cat’s fur. For example, a feline food allergy can result in hair loss and a general deterioration of your cat’s coat. If you notice significant changes in your cat’s fur, it could point to a food sensitivity., Sensitivities to gluten can result in gastrointestinal issues in animals. Keep an eye out for signs of gastrointestinal distress like diarrhea or vomiting, as these could be indicators of a food allergy or intolerance., If your cat has intolerance to its food, it might avoid eating. Keep an eye out for avoidance behaviors in your cat. If your cat is choosing not to eat, it could be a sign that the current cat food is causing them distress., If your cat is experiencing these symptoms, it could mean they have an intolerance or allergy to gluten. However, these symptoms can also indicate other underlying medical conditions. Have your vet examine your cat to determine the cause of symptoms.

Use specially formulated milk.,
Pour the milk onto a saucer.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to Give Cat Milk to Your Cat1," Specially formulated cat milks are lactose-free. Choose a cat milk that is enriched with taurine—an essential amino acid that is required for heart and eye health. You can find specially formulated milks at your local pet store, or ask your veterinarian.Because the majority of adult cats are lactose intolerant, do not give your cat cow’s milk.
You may give your cat organic, lactose-free ""people"" milk as well. However, start with a small does, like a teaspoon, to make sure there are not any negative side effects first.
Do not feed your cat soy milk.;
, Administer the milk per the instructions on the bottle. Because cat milk does not keep for long, make sure to discard any remaining milk after 45 minutes. This way you can prevent your cat from eating spoiled milk., If your cat experiences diarrhea, vomiting, and/or bloating after drinking the milk, then refrain from giving it more milk. Make sure to take your cat to the vet if it experiences any of these symptoms."

Consult your veterinarian about changing your cat’s diet.,
Avoid serving your cat dry food.,
Introduce your cat to wet food.,
Feed your cat wet cat food.",How to Feed Your Cat Natural Foods1," Your cat’s dietary nutrition is important, and the animal’s health could be damaged if you make an ill-advised change to their diet. Schedule an appointment with your vet, and ask their advice about the feline diet.


See if the vet recommends providing your cat with a natural (or raw) diet, and ask which specific foods—and in what quantities—they suggest feeding your cat.;
, Although the majority of commercial cat foods are made of dried kibble, these actually contain relatively little nutritional value for cats. Dried kibble has next to no water content, gives cats an excessive amount of carbohydrates, and often contains plant-based proteins rather than the animal-based proteins that cats need to stay healthy.Dry kibble is also heavily processed and contains few natural ingredients. If you’d like to give your cat natural foods, the first step is to switch them to a wet food.

, If your cat has been eating only dry kibble, now is the time to switch them to a wet food. Do not leave wet food sitting out all day for your cat; feed them at two or three daily meal times. If the cat does not eat the wet food within 30 minutes, pick the food back up. To ease the transition, you can start by mixing in a moderate amount of dry food with the wet food, and then slowly phasing out the kibble.You can find a high-quality wet food for purchase at your local pet-supply store. Speak with the staff or owner, and ask their recommendations for a wet cat food.
Also read the nutrition label on a few different brands of wet food. Select the option that provides high protein, low carbohydrates, and plenty of vitamins. If possible, select a low-grain wet food.

, A high-quality canned cat food will contain healthy proteins and nutrients for your cat. While wet canned food undergoes some degree of processing, it’s much less than high amounts of processing done to dried kibble. Wet food is also low in carbohydrates, which will benefit your cat’s nutrition. A cat’s diet should be very low in carbs, with carbs composing only 1–2% of the whole diet.Cats living in nature get a large percentage of their water from the food they eat, since animal flesh has a high water content. Serving your cat a high-quality wet food can provide cats with a natural means of staying hydrated.

Look for signs that your kitten might be depressed.,
Spend more time with your kitten.,
Find things that will entertain your kitten.,
Consider whether or not your kitten is depressed because she is sick.",How to Get a Sick Kitten to Eat3," Aside from eating, there several signs that your kitten is depressed. These include a lack of energy and sleeping more than usual, loss of interest in her regular activities, becoming reclusive, or showing aggressive behavior.

, The most common reason that kittens become depressed is because they are not shown enough attention. To combat your kitten’s depression and get her to start eating again, play with her and show her love as much as you can. Hold her while you are working or watching a movie, play with her in the mornings and afternoons, and praise her with treats and affection.

, You can’t always be home to play with your kitten. Invest in some toys that will keep your kitten entertained while you are away. Climbing trees, toys, scratching posts, and food puzzles are all great ways to keep your kitten entertained while you are away.Consider getting your kitten a friend. If you can afford to do so, you may want to bring another kitten into your home so that each kitten will have someone else to play with; however, it's important to keep in mind that integrating a new kitten can get harder as your original kitten gets older.

, If you pay a lot of attention to your kitten and are constantly showing her love, she is probably not depressed because you don’t play with her. Instead, she is probably depressed because she is in pain in some way, either through sickness or because she got hurt. If you can’t seem to figure out what is ailing your kitten, take her to the vet.


Kittens should be playful and alert. The most likely reason for a kitten to be depressed is immediately after homing. If you have owned the kitten for a while and she is quiet, then it's more likely there is a health problem.

Use appetite stimulants as a last resort.,
Ask a vet for advice.,
Consider mirtazapine.,
Investigate cyproheptadine.,
Ask about intravenous diazepam.,
Suggest Vitamin B injections.,
Use caution with one-off steroid injections.",How to Get a Sick Kitten to Eat4," Some drugs have a stimulatory effect on appetite. These are usually a treatment of last resort in kittens for several reasons. First, many of the drugs are human medications, so breaking the tablets down to provide a small enough dose is extremely difficult. Second, young kittens do not have fully developed hepatic and renal function. These organs are not yet operating to maximum capacity to break drugs down, and so the kitten is potentially more vulnerable to overdose toxicity than an adult cat. Lastly, these drugs have been known to cause unpleasant side effects even in smaller doses.When your kitten is not eating because of a health problem, it is important to diagnose the underlying problem rather than mask the signs.

, A qualified animal care professional should make the decision on which drug to prescribe your kitten, if any. The most common options are described below so you can ask a veterinarian about them, and understand the general function and dosage.

, This is a human medication from the tricyclic antidepressant group. No information is available as to why, but it is noted that it has a stimulatory effect on appetite in cats. The smallest tablet size available is 15 mg, and the dose per cat is 3.5mg, equivalent to a quarter of a tablet. For a small kitten weighing less than a kg (2.2 lb) it is extremely difficult to calculate a proper dose, and you end up giving a small crumb of a tablet. This dose can be repeated once every three days.

, This is another human medication. It is an antihistamine and a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor. Again, the mechanism is not understood, but this medication stimulates appetite in cats. The dose is 0.1 – 0.5mg/kg given by mouth two or three times daily. The smallest tablet size is 4 mg, and so (just as for mirtazapine) it is extremely difficult to cut the tablet accurately into small enough pieces. As an example, a 1 kg (2.2 lb) kitten require one eighth of a 4 mg pill, and it should be kept in mind that many kittens do not reach 1 kg (2.2 lb) until they are 3 months old.

, Some cats have an idiosyncratic reaction such that a one-off dose of intravenous diazepam makes them very hungry. This only works by IV, and in small kittens it can be very difficult to find a vein large enough to catheterize. The dose is 0.5-1.0 mg/kg given once only, intravenously. Thus a 1 kg (2.2 lb) kitten requires 0.2ml of a vial of 5mg/ml emulsion of injectable diazepam.


This is a treatment of last resort because it is also associated with an unpredictable side effect that causes liver failure.

, Vitamin B plays an important role in maintaining appetite. If the level of Vitamin B, specifically cobalamin, falls too low in the bowel wall, or in the blood stream, then the kitten's appetite can fail. This is easily rectified by four, weekly subcutaneous injections of a multi B vit injection. A typical dose is 0.25 milliliters (0.0085  fl oz) given by subcutaneous injection once every four weeks.

, A side effect of steroid is appetite stimulation. In most cases of sick kittens this option would not be used because steroids also suppress the immune system, which could weaken the kitten's ability to fight off infection. If however, the kitten is protected with antibiotics, and the vet assesses that steroid is unlikely to worsen the existing infection, then a one-off dose of steroid to kick start the appetite may be appropriate. The dose range is wide, ranging from 0.01 – 4 mg/kg of dexamethasone, but a conservatively low dose is advisable for the purpose of appetite stimulation. Thus a 1 kg (2.2 kg) kitten requires 0.5mg of dexamethasone, which in a formulation containing 2mg/ml equates to 0.25ml by intramuscular injection.

Talk to your vet.,
Check the ingredient list.,
Try a month-long trial.,
Follow up with your vet after the month-long trial.",How to Know if Your Cat Needs Gluten‐Free Food2," Before you change your cat’s diet, you should talk to your vet. Your vet can help determine if your cat has an intolerance or allergy to gluten. To make this assessment, the vet may perform a physical exam and ask you questions about your cat’s medical history. Your vet may also perform saliva or blood tests., Gluten is commonly found in cat food. Choose a cat food that is free from gluten-containing ingredients like wheat, barley, and rye. You should also be on the lookout for ingredients that could be contaminated with gluten, like oats, buckwheat, rice, or quinoa. Whenever possible, select a food labeled gluten-free.You can choose a wet or dry food, as long as it is free from gluten-containing ingredients.

, Place your cat on a gluten free cat food for at least thirty days. During this period, closely monitor your cat’s symptoms and note if they improve or disappear. At the end of the thirty days, give your cat a food that contains gluten for one week. If your cat’s symptoms reappear, your cat might benefit from a gluten free food., If you decide to change your cat's diet, you should make an appointment with your vet to discuss your cat's progress. This will allow you to communicate changes in your cat's health to your vet and troubleshoot any unresolved issues.

Pour the mixture into a bottle specifically designed for kittens.You can purchase powdered formulas, as well as a bottle and teat set, from your local pet store or veterinarian.
Always make the formula fresh.

, Fill a pot with one to two cups of water. Place the bottle in the pot, and then place the pot on the stove. Set the heat to medium. Remove the bottle once it feels warm, i.e., five to eight minutes.Before feeding your kitten, test the temperature of the milk by squeezing a few drops onto your inner wrist. The temperature of the milk should be body temperature or slightly above room temperature. If it is too hot, then let it cool down.

, Make sure the kitten is lying flat on its stomach. Entice your kitten to suckle by turning the bottle upside down. This will enable a drop of formula to come out so the kitten can smell it.Never feed a kitten on its back.
Make sure your kitten is warm before feeding it, i.e., 96 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If not, then warm your kitten with a heating pad before feeding it.

, Place the bottle's nipple into your kitten's mouth. Gently move the nipple back and forth in your kitten's mouth to encourage it to eat. Once your kitten latches on, let it eat at its own pace.Try not to fill your kitten's mouth with milk. This may cause your kitten to breathe in the milk, which can cause pneumonia.

, In general, kittens should eat eight milliliters of formula per ounce of body weight each day. Divide the amount of formula by the number of feedings to determine how much formula to feed your kitten at each feeding.For example, a kitten that weighs five ounces should be given 40 milliliters of formula per day. Divide 40 by 7 (number of feedings if you are feeding your kitten every three hours) to get a total of 5.7 milliliters of formula for each feeding.

A kitten one month old or younger is unable to digest or excrete solid food. If you have a kitten who has not yet been weaned (the process of changing from milk to solid food) you'll need a product called kitten milk replacement to help your kitten make the transition.


If your kitten's mother is part of your household, she will provide all the milk your kitten needs. Having milk replacement on hand can still be convenient when you need to start getting the kitten used to solid foods. You can mix the milk replacement with solids to soften their texture a little.
If your kitten is still very young and has already been taken away from her mother, you will need to bottle-feed the kitten until she's old enough to eat solid foods. It is essential that you get kitten milk replacement to meet her nutritional needs. Cow milk is not a good substitute.
Call a veterinarian and ask for kitten formula recommendations. The formula typically comes in powdered form that you mix with water. Top brands include PetAg KMR® Powder and Farnam Pet Products Just Born® Highly Digestible Milk Replacer for Kittens.;
, If your kitten is over four weeks old, it's time to start feeding her solids. It is important to choose food made for kittens, not cats. Since kittens grow so quickly in the first few months of their lives, they have different nutritional needs than cats. Feeding a kitten cat food will result in the kitten becoming weak or sick.


Kitten food is usually labeled with terms like ""kitten formula"" or ""kitten growth formula"" to help you distinguish it from cat food.
The ASPCA recommends feeding a kitten special kitten food until she reaches the age of one year old. At that time, you may switch to regular cat food., Most veterinarians don't recommend buying generic or store-brand pet foods. It's better to buy a quality brand of kitten food that comes highly recommended, because the effectiveness of name brands is usually backed by research. If you're not sure what brand to choose, call a veterinarian and ask.Check the packaging for this statement: ""Meets the nutritional requirements of kittens established by the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)."" Avoid brands that don't carry this statement.
You can also look for this statement. It is found on the highest-quality products: “Complete and balanced nutrition for kittens based on AAFCO feeding trials.”

, Since kittens aren't able to chew as well as full-grown cats, they need soft food in addition to dry. Both canned and dry foods should be formulated especially for kittens, not cats. For canned foods, make sure to check the expiration date and avoid buying dented or damaged cans., Kittens need fat, fatty acids, calcium, protein, and many other nutrients to grow healthy and strong. Kitten food meets these requirements, so it should make up the majority of your kitten's food intake. If you want to feed your kitten extra treats, they should make up no more than 10 percent of your kitten's total calorie intake. Cooked slices of meat, chicken or fish are usually fine choices. Avoid feeding your kitten the following:Raw meat, eggs, or fish, which may contain parasites or harmful bacteria
Milk or cream, which can cause diarrhea
Onions, garlic, chocolate, coffee, tea, raisins, and grapes, which are toxic to cats

, Kittens who are not weaned need a milk-only diet. Don't try to introduce solids until the kitten is over four weeks old. If the kitten is still with her mother, the mother will everything necessary to make sure she's getting the milk she needs. If the mother is not there, you will need to bottle feed the kitten. To bottle-feed a kitten, follow these steps:


Kittens under four weeks old must be fed every three hours around the clock (including at night). Purchase kitten milk replacement formula and a bottle designed for feeding a kitten. These are available at your vet's office or a pet store.
Sterilize the bottle and nipple by boiling them in water for five minutes and allowing them to fully dry.
Mix the formula according to the manufacturer's instructions.Warm it up in a pan on the stove to reach 95 to 100 degrees F. Test a drop on your wrist to make sure it isn't too hot or cold.Place the nipple in the kitten's mouth. Let the kitten drink until full.
Kittens this young can't urinate or defecate on their own. You must stimulate the kitten's genitals by turning the kitten on her side and rubbing her genitals in one direction until no more urine comes out.This must be done a few minutes after every feeding.

, When a kitten is ready to wean, she will begin biting at her mother's nipple or the nipple on the bottle you use to feed her. This usually happens when she is about four weeks old. At this time, you can begin introducing solids to her diet.Place a small amount of food in a food dish for the kitten. If the kitten doesn't seem ready to chew the food, mix in a few tablespoons of milk replacement formula or water to soften the food.
Leave solid food out at all times (replacing at least once a day with fresh food) so the kitten has time to approach the food when she wants to.
Gradually reduce the amount of milk offered as you increase the amount of solids offered. The pace at which a kitten is weaned is different for each kitten. Be patient and monitor how much solid food she eats. If she isn't with her mother, offer milk replacement formula until she starts refusing the bottle.
By seven weeks, most kittens will be ready for a solids-only diet.

, Kittens like to eat small portions of food often throughout the day. While it's possible to enforce a feeding schedule, it's not necessary to do so until your kitten is fully grown. Leave a dish of dry food and a dish of canned food out for your kitten to snack on whenever she wants. Be sure to replace uneaten food with fresh food once a day.Don't forget to leave out a dish of water at all times, too.
At this point you can introduce occasional treats, such as slices of cooked chicken. Be sure treats make up less than 10 percent of the kitten's calorie intake.

, If your kitten seems low energy, is gaining too much weight or seems to thin, there may be a problem with the food. It's important to pay attention to signs that your kitten may not be getting the nutrition she needs.If your kitten seems to dislike her food, and rarely eats it, she might not like the taste. Try switching to another flavor or brand.
If your kitten won't eat, or if she eats too much and becomes obese, make an appointment with the veterinarian to assess the problem.

, When your kitten turns one year old, she's ready for adult cat food and an adult feeding schedule. Begin offering food twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. During other times of day, remove the food and offer water only. This will keep your cat healthy and prevent her from becoming obese., If you see a stray kitten, your first impulse might be to scoop her up and take her inside to keep her safe. A young kitten's best chance for survival is staying close to her mother, who can provide her with nourishing food and protection. Instead of taking the kitten inside right away, wait and see if the mother is still nearby.


Keep an eye on the kitten for the next several hours to see if the mother returns. If you need to move the kitten, move her to a safe area that's not too far from where you originally found her.
If the mother returns, you can offer her food and outdoor shelter so she can safely nurse her kitten (or kittens, as the case may be). After the kitten is weaned, you can consider adopting her. See How to Adopt a Stray Cat for more information.
If the mother does not return, you'll need to take steps to rescue the kitten.

, The vet will help you determine whether the kitten is still nursing, as well as assessing the kitten's overall health. It's important to take the kitten to the vet before you take her into your home. Have her checked for fleas and ticks before bringing her home.

, If the vet has determined that the kitten is still young enough to nurse, you'll need to bottle-feed the kitten until she's ready for solid foods. You'll be able to get the instructions, equipment and milk substitute you need from the vet's office or a recommended pet supply store. Keep the following general guidelines in mind:


Kittens under four weeks old must be fed every three hours around the clock (including at night). Feed the kitten milk replacement formula from a bottle. Kittens this young can't urinate or defecate on their own. You must stimulate the kitten's genitals by turning the kitten on her side and rubbing her genitals in one direction until no more urine comes out.Do this a few minutes after every feeding.

, When the kitten is over four weeks old, she's ready for solid food. Be sure to provide high-quality kitten food, both dry and canned, as you wean the kitten from her milk-only diet. Leave food out at all times so the kitten can eat at her leisure, and always provide fresh water as well. Do not provide adult cat food until the kitten is over a year old.

Feed your cat cooked poultry.,
Give your cat small pieces of cooked salmon.,
Feed your cat cooked cod or flounder.,
Serve your cat occasional eggs.",How to Feed Your Cat Natural Foods2," Were they living in the wild, animal meats would be the staple of cats’ diets, and they are one of the best natural foods that you can serve your cat. Cats will eat nearly all types of meat, including beef and pork. However, cooked poultry (chicken or turkey) is best for your cat.When you first serve your cat cooked poultry, give it a small to moderate amount of meat, in case it doesn’t like the flavor. Start by giving your cat about ¼ cup (2 ounces) of meat.
Avoid giving your cat meat with a lot of fatty tissue. Although cats will eat the fat, it provides them with little protein and gives no dietary benefits. Too much fat with a single meal can also give your cat diarrhea.

, Salmon is rich in healthy fats and protein, and will make a healthy complement to your cat’s diet. Sprinkle a small handful of salmon on top of your cat’s food at dinnertime. Salmon is often found in wet commercial cat foods, so if you give your cat extra salmon, you’ll simply be increasing the amount of a protein they’re already receiving.

, Both of these fish are healthy for cats to eat, and will not carry high levels of mercury, which carnivorous fish like tuna or swordfish have been known to carry. Most types of fish are high in nutrients and will give your cat proteins and vitamins that they need to stay healthy.Make sure to only feed your cat cooked fish, as raw fish can carry illnesses. For example, raw freshwater fish may contain tapeworm eggs, and raw oily fish contain thiaminase, which breaks down thiamine, a vitamin that your cat’s body needs.
As with the salmon, you can sprinkle a small handful of cooked cod or flounder on top of your cat’s food with their dinner.

, Eggs can function as a high-protein dietary supplement for house cats. Cats will likely scarf down any eggs that you set in front of them, but should only be served fully-cooked eggs. Prepare eggs by hard boiling or scrambling them.Avoid giving cats raw eggs, or eggs that are partially raw. This includes soft-boiled, fried, or poached eggs.


Although eggs are primarily thought of as a food for human consumption, they are high in protein and would constitute part of a cat’s natural diet, were it living in the wild.

Confer with your veterinarian.,
Serve your cat a variety of raw meats.,
Provide your cat with calcium supplements.,
Supplement your cat’s raw diet with occasional vegetables.",How to Feed Your Cat Natural Foods3," Although the number of cat-owners who advocate serving your cat a raw diet is growing, there are certain concerns that you should discuss with a vet or an animal nutritionist. Although raw foods are the most natural, there are always associated health risks.For example, raw meats may be contaminated with bacteria, or may carry parasites.


Additionally, it can be difficult to put together the right raw diet for your cat. Cats have specific nutritional needs, and without the help of a veterinarian, it will be challenging to assemble a nutritionally complete raw diet for your cat.

, Cats are notoriously picky eaters, and will be as particular about their raw food as they would be about any other type of food. Purchase commercially prepared raw meat at your local grocery store: start with common types like poultry, beef, and pork. Some cats may also prefer game meats, such as pheasant, quail, and rabbit.Before serving, cut the meat into smaller pieces that your cat can chew without much difficulty. Aim for pieces that are about a cubic inch (2.3 cubic centimeters).
Give the raw food to your cats at two or three specific mealtimes during the day. Avoid letting the raw food sit out for more than 30 minutes, as it may accumulate bacteria or begin to spoil.

, While the majority of nutrition that a cat needs will come directly from the meat, it’s also important that cats have calcium in their diet. You can purchase a calcium supplement at your local pet-supply store or health-food store. Consult the nutrition label or speak with your veterinarian to determine how much daily calcium your cat needs.Some more ambitious raw-food enthusiasts will purchase beef or pork with the bone still in, and then grind the bone itself to supplement the cat’s diet.
Do not serve your cat cow’s milk. Cats are lactose intolerant, and cow milk can be harmful to their digestive system.

, Since cats are obligate carnivores, they need a meat-based diet, but can have other occasional additions. For example, since meat is low in fiber, cats can benefit from occasional servings of a vegetable, in order to provide roughage and keep their digestive system working well.Occasionally serve your cat steamed broccoli or carrots, in addition to their raw food, at regular meal times. Although you can try mixing a vegetable in with your cat’s meat, they may be more inclined to eat the broccoli or carrots if you place them in a separate dish.

Get different colored bowls for each cat.,
Keep a list handy of which food to place in each bowl.,
Feed your cats in different spaces at first.,
Set bowls out at different ends of a room.,
Monitor your cats while they eat.",How to Feed Different Diets to Multiple Cats1," If you’re used to free-feeding your cats out of one large bowl, you’ll need to transition to scheduled feedings and use individual bowls. Your cats won’t care about the color coded bowls, but they’ll help you keep track of which kind of food to feed each cat.Make sure each cat also has its own water bowl, especially if you’re feeding them in separate rooms.
You can also write a cat’s name on each bowl in permanent marker.;
, If you feed your cats in the kitchen, keep a list with feeding information on the refrigerator. Write each cat’s name, its food variety, and its bowl’s color if you’re using a color coded system.Matching the right food with each cat will probably become second nature, but you should take your time and develop a system to avoid confusion. Mix-ups can be dangerous, especially if one cat has a prescription or therapeutic diet.

, It’s best to feed your cats in shifts when you start getting them used to individualized diets. Keep all but one of your cats out of the feeding room, then set out the appropriate food for one cat. Give it 20 minutes to eat, then when it’s done, move on to the next cats one at a time.You can also keep your cats in separate rooms with closed doors and feed them at the same time.

, As your cats get used to their individual diets, you can try feeding them in the same room at the same time. Fill each bowl with the appropriate food and set them in opposite sides of the room.The farther apart you set the bowls, the more comfortable your cats will be, since cats like some privacy during mealtime. You’ll also have an easier time keeping one cat from getting into another’s food.

, Keep an eye on your cats while they eat, especially if you feed them in the same room at the same time. You’ll need to make sure none of them try to get into another’s food. It’s also important to make sure they’re not refusing to eat.Contact the vet if any of your cats refuses to eat or experiences vomiting or diarrhea in reaction to its new diet.

Weigh the kitten and adjust diet accordingly.",How to Feed Newborn Kittens Commercial Milk Replacer," It can be dangerous for a kitten to be fed cold milk when it is already cold. Feel the pads of the kitten’s feet and place your finger in the kitten’s mouth. If either is too cold, slowly warm up the kitten.This step is particularly important if you have found the kitten outside. However, even normal room temperature is uncomfortable for a kitten. At one week old, kittens prefers a temperature of 86 to 90 degree’s Fahrenheit. This will gradually decrease over the next three weeks to approximately 75 degrees Fahrenheit.;
, If your kitten feels cold or even cool, wrap it in a towel or blanket. Hold it close to your body and rub it continually. Give it approximately 20 minutes to warm up., Open the lid of the milk replacer and sniff it. It should smell sweet, like condescended milk. If it has a strong smell or is past the expiration date, toss it out., The box should have instructions about the ratio of powder to water. Follow these instructions closely.


There are canned formulas that are premixed. These, however, can cause diarrhea, which can be dangerous for kittens. It is best to use a powdered milk replacer, if possible.Verify that the milk replacer is specially designed for kittens. Kittens have special dietary needs that make other types of milk inappropriate.

, You will need a specialized pet nurser that releases a single drop of liquid at a time. Only put in as much milk replacer as you intend to feed the kitten that sitting.A baby bottle will release liquid too quickly, choking the kitten.
There are tubes that can be used to administer milk replacer to kittens who are reticent to eat. However, these can be extremely dangerous for a non-professional to handle. Visit your veterinarian for guidance before using one of these.If the bottle does not come with hole in the nipple, use a cuticle cutter to make a very small hole in the nipple. Make the hole as small as possible. Cutting too large a hole is a mistake you cannot correct. After cutting the hole, the replacer should drip out, not flow in a steady stream., Cats prefer to drink milk at approximately 100 degrees Fahrenheit. A microwave, however, will heat the milk unevenly, possibly burning and injuring the kitten. Fill a bowl or glass with hot water and place the bottle in it for a couple of minutes, allowing it to warm up.


Err on the side of cooler milk. You do not want to accidentally burn the kitten., Try a taste of the milk. Verify that it is not sour—which means that it has gone bad—and that it is not scalding hot or extremely cold., Keep the kitten close to you, in a blanket, lying down. Its head should be in the neutral position-parallel with the rest of its body and well supported.Holding your kitten while you feed it will help socialize it. It also keeps it warm.

, The kitten should naturally suck on the bottle. It ought to eat until it is satisfied. If your kitten does not want to use the bottle, consult a veterinarian about using a tube to feed your kitten.


Once the nipple is in the kitten's mouth, try wiggling it a little. This will cause some milk to come out and help the kitten understand what is happening.If the kitten is still reticent to eat, gently rub the kitten's back or head. This reminds the kitten of its mother.

, It is common for milk to come out of the kitten’s nose when it is eating. It generally is not dangerous, but it is a sign that it is eating too quickly. Stop briefly or hold the bottle at a less extreme angle.


Hold the bottle at approximately a 45 degree angle. Do not hold the bottle at an angle that allows the kitten to swallow air., The kitten should stop sucking on the bottle when it is full. There are guidelines for how big feedings should be in each week of infancy, but feedings can vary somewhat depending upon the kitten’s appetite.


If the kitten falls asleep while feeding, you can gently nudge it awake.

, Spend a few minutes after the feeding to play with or rub the kitten. This socializes it and helps burp it, making it feel better after a big feeding., Normally, a mother will lick the kitten to encourage it to urinate and defecate. Without the mom, you will need to fill that role. Rub the genitals gently with a wet cotton swab. Rub the anus too, if the kitten does not appear to be defecating., The bottle and nipple should be washed and then boiled in water. Perform this cleaning between each feeding., The formula, like milk, is very susceptible to spoiling when left out. Toss out any formula that has gone more than an hour without refrigeration. An open container that has not been out for long, should be returned to the refrigerator.This applies to both powdered and canned formula.
Don’t prepare more formula than can be used in a 24 hour period., You should feed your kitten approximately once every three hours, possibly more. Each feeding should be between 1-7 ml, totaling 32 ml per day.Sleep with your kitten nearby, because it will want to eat throughout the night. Do not wake it for feedings. It will wake you by crying.

, You should feed the kitten slightly less frequently at two weeks, but you should feed it more milk replacer in each feeding. Feedings should be between 7-9 ml for a total of about 60 ml per day., The kitten will begin to consume more with each feeding. It should consume about 10 ml each feeding for a total of 90 ml per day. You should try to introduce it to solid food during this week., The kitten should eat more during its fourth week, but it will be getting much of its nutrition from solid food. Reduce feedings to seven per day, about 10 ml each., Weigh the kitten every day on a precise electronic scale to mark its progress. If the kitten is not meeting benchmarks, try to increase food intake. The kitten should weight approximately:


100-200 grams (.22-.44 lbs) in its first week
200-300 grams (.44-.66 lbs) in its second week
300-360 grams (.66-.79 lbs) in its third week
350-420 grams (.77-.93 lbs) in its fourth week."

Use dry or canned food.,
Add new food gradually.,
Select a diet cat food.,
Use treats sparingly.,
Measure meal portions.,
Set out the right number of meals per day.,
Feed the cat at the same time.,
Try feeding the cat at timed intervals.,
Give treats infrequently.,
Report extreme changes in your cat’s weight to your veterinarian.,
Ask your veterinarian about portion changes.,
Give your cat treats with guidance from a veterinarian.",How to Feed an Overweight Cat," This can affect price for the owner and palatability for the cat.Dry food is usually cheaper than canned (wet) food, and stays fresh longer.
You need to put out more water for dry food diets.
Canned cat food contains more water—about 70-80 percent of the food is water. But it tends to be more palatable for a cat so makes it more likely the cat will overeat.
You can mix in bits of dry and canned food if your cat seems to like both as long as it’s getting enough to eat per meal.;
, If you are going to attempt to introduce a diet cat food or supplement to the cat’s usual food you need to do it slowly.Try to keep the same food dish as it is a safety signal to the cat.
Offer new food alongside the old food so the cat can try it. If it won’t eat it then you can try something else. If it likes the new food then you can gradually increase the new food until it replaces the old.

, There are some cat foods that better balance their ingredients to help cats lose weight.Crash dieting is bad for a cat and can result in a disorder can occur called hepatic lipidosis.
Instead you should work with your veterinarian to select a feeding regimen to help your cat manage their eating habits and nutrition to lose the weight gradually.
Get an initial weight of the cat and over three to four weeks add increasing portions of the selected feline weight-loss diet food to the cat’s dish.
Mix the new diet food in with the old food so the cat gets used to the change.
Notice how much the cat eats daily.
The cat should be weighed after four week intervals. If there is no change or an increase in weight then the portion of overall food needs to be decreased. If there is too much weight loss (more than half a pound in just four weeks), or the cat has stopped eating for 2 or more days, then there could be a more serious illness at work and you need to consult your veterinarian.

, Treats can be good for your cat for a variety of functions from helping with their coat to improving their mood. But too many can add weight.Treats should make up no more than 10 percent of your cat’s daily calories.
Avoid giving treats too close to the cat’s feeding time so they eat their regular cat food and don’t miss out on their essential nutrients.

, If you don’t want to use a diet cat food you can try using standard cat foods in more controlled portions.This will take a bit more effort to measure the amount of food you are putting into the cat’s food dish for each feeding especially if you leave it in the dish all day
Look at the pet food’s suggested daily amount and divide it into two servings to be given 8 to 12 hours apart.
Another rule of thumb would be if you have a 7 pound cat then they need to have 1/25th the meal size of a human or 0.6 to 1 ounce of food per meal. This also could be thought of as 24-35 calories per pound the cat weighs per day.
The portions may vary a bit with your cat’s individual needs. Consult with your veterinarian if you are unsure.

, This can vary with age of your cat.For adult (aged 1 year to 11 years) or senior cats (aged 11 or older) meals should be set out twice or once per day.
If you are feeding twice per day then set the meals out 8 to 12 hours apart. Use the portion control steps from earlier.

, Keeping the cat on the same feeding schedule will help when changing its diet.Keeping consistent with feeding times will help calm the cat and acclimate it to changes with food.
If you feed in the late morning and late evening then don’t change.
Try not to start feeding the cat at times you know will be hectic for you and risks you forgetting to put food out.

, Leave the food out a certain amount of time and then pick it up.If you are feeding the cat once or twice a day you need to leave the meal out long enough to give it a chance to eat.
To avoid the cat over indulging pick the meal up after a reasonable time limit—30 minutes to 1 hour.

, Just as the treats should make up only a small portion of calories for a cat they need to be given only a few times in addition to meals.Avoid giving treats near meal time and space them out to two or three times per week so they remain fun and novel for the cat.
Even if the cat is overweight you should not cut out treats completely, but consult your veterinarian for how you can keep them in the cat’s diet at a reduced amount.

, If the cat’s weight has changed more than a half pound within a four week period then you need to see a veterinarian.This could be a sign of a nutritional imbalance or more complicated illness.
Look for signs of change in appetite and drinking habits as well.
If the cat has not eaten in 48 hours then seek veterinarian attention as soon as possible.

, The portions will change with a cat’s individual needs.The veterinarian can help you adjust the portions for your cat’s weight and other conditions such as diabetes or infection.
Work with the veterinarian to treat your cat’s other conditions in conjunction with weight control.

, See how you can keep treats in the cat’s diet even though they can add to weight gain.Ask about reduced introduction of treats into the diet, change in variety of treat, or other varieties of treats you might give.
Follow your veterinarian’s recommended options when it comes to treat type and frequency.

Examine your cat’s weight and nipples.,
Take your cat to the veterinarian.",How to Feed a Pregnant or Nursing Cat," During the early and middle stages of pregnancy, your cat can keep primarily eating their typical food. However, you should mix in added protein to help facilitate healthy kitten growth. Do this by cooking and adding small pieces of chicken, beef, fish, or egg to your cat’s dry or wet food.Cats can be picky eaters, and pregnant ones especially so. Try different proteins until you find one your cat prefers.


The added protein will also give the mother cat strength and energy as her body grows the kittens.
Throughout the pregnancy and nursing period, the mother will need plenty of protein.;
, During the late stages of pregnancy, the queen should be fed a protein-rich, high quality wet cat food, which should contain few carbohydrates. This combination will encourage healthy kitten growth, and also give the queen energy. Wet, canned foods are a good food choice: they contain meat and other proteins, are fortified with vitamins, and contain few carbs.You should be able to find a high-quality wet food at your local pet-supply store. When comparing wet foods, check the nutrition labels to see which contains more vitamins and minerals (including calcium) that will benefit your queen.

, Towards the midpoint of your cat’s pregnancy, begin switching her onto a high-quality wet kitten food. Kitten food contains higher percentages of nutrients and vitamins than do adult cat foods, and will provide the queen with more of the protein and calories she needs during pregnancy.Keep in mind that your cat’s food consumption will increase during pregnancy. She’ll usually eat about 50% more than she would when not pregnant.
A cat’s pregnancy typically lasts from 58–70 days. Plan to switch your queen to the nutritious kitten food by about the 5th week (35 days).

, As the pregnancy progresses and the litter of kittens take up more space inside of her, your queen will eat smaller and smaller meals, but her meals will also become more frequent. So, make sure that food is always available for your cat when she’s hungry. Rather than feeding her at specific meal times, you can leave food sitting out.Wet food may go bad if left out too long. You can avoid this problem by putting out a small portion of wet food and waiting until you cat eats it, then putting out more.

, The queen will likely be exhausted and have low energy—and no appetite—for the first few days after giving birth. Her appetite will soon return, though. Continue to feed her the high-quality kitten food, and you can continue to mix in additional protein. Give the cat a dish of this food three times daily, spaced at regular intervals.If you notice the cat continuing to gain weight after giving birth, you may need to cut back on the food. Do not overfeed your cat to the point of obesity.

, It’s important that your mother cat consumes food containing plenty of calcium shortly after giving birth. Calcium will increase the mother’s milk production, which in turn will encourage bone growth in the developing kittens.Check the nutritional information on canned cat foods to find one that is high in calcium.


Alternately, you can give your mother cat calcium supplements. This is not an uncommon procedure, and will ensure that your mother cat is consuming enough calcium and passing it on to her kittens. Calcium supplements should be available at a local pet-food store.
Check with your veterinarian before you start giving your cat calcium supplements.

, While she is lactating and feeding her kittens with milk, the mother cat will need the protein and nutrients that the kitten food offers her.However, once the kittens have weaned (usually around 6–10 weeks after birth), you can transition the mother cat back to an adult food.Do this by mixing a small amount of the adult food in with the kitten food. Increase the percentage of adult food over time, until the cat has fully transitioned to adult food.
You can also re-introduce dry food into the cat’s diet at this point, and do not need to feed her extra protein.

, Housecats typically go into heat sometime between late spring and early fall, roughly from March to September. While in heat, a female cat will exhibit behaviors including increased displays of affection, increased restlessness and hunger, and howling to attract male cats. The cat will remain in heat for about 10 to 14 days.If your female cat is in heat and is allowed to go outside, she’ll attempt to attract and mate with male cats. Naturally, there is a high chance that she’ll become pregnant.

, If your cat is pregnant, she’ll begin to gain weight rapidly. Even an already-overweight cat will put on a noticeable amount of weight if she becomes pregnant. When a female cat becomes pregnant, her nipples will increase in size and become noticeably darker in color. If you notice your cat gaining weight and its nipples darkening, it’s almost certainly pregnant.This change in the nipple size and color happens during the third week of pregnancy (about 21 days).

, If you have begun noticing signs of pregnancy, schedule an appointment for your cat to see a veterinarian. The vet will be able to confirm the pregnancy (most likely with an ultrasound), and will advise you about any potential health complications that could result.This would also be a good time to ask your vet about your pregnant cat’s diet, and to ask their advice about how to keep your pregnant and nursing cat well nourished.

Change your cat’s diet when it’s in good health.,
Transition to a new diet slowly.,
Try putting a small amount of the old food on top of the new food.,
Ask your cat’s vet if it’s okay to add something extra tasty to new food.,
Consult the vet if you need to switch a cat’s diet quickly.",How to Feed Different Diets to Multiple Cats2," If one of your cats has recently been ill or hospitalized, avoid changing its diet unless the vet tells you it’s necessary. Waiting until it’s recovered before switching its food will prevent food aversion and make the transition easier.If you suddenly start feeding a cat new food while it’s sick, it will likely associate the new food with being sick, and it’ll resist its new diet in the future.

, Switching to a new diet abruptly can cause digestive problems, particularly when changing from dry to wet food. Start by feeding your cats their new food at one meal per day and the old food at other daily meals. Gradually work towards feeding them new food at all meals over the course of four to seven days.You can also try mixing the old and new food together. Feed your cat 75 percent old food and 25 percent new on the first day, 50 percent of each on the next day, 25 percent old food on the third, and only new food on the fourth.

, If you have trouble systematically switching your cat’s meals, you can mix old and new food together. Try placing a small amount of the old food on top of the new food. Gradually decrease the amount of the old food you include with each meal until you can omit it completely., If you have any problems getting your cat used to its new diet, you can try adding a tasty, high-value flavor to its new food. Pour in a bit of canned tuna juice or a flavor you’ve observed your cat show preference for in the past.Be sure to ask the vet if it’s okay to add anything to your cat’s food. If your cat is obese or on a prescribed or therapeutic diet, an additive might not be the healthiest choice.

, If you do need to switch your cat’s diet abruptly, you should do so with the vet’s guidance. The vet might find it prudent to keep the cat in their office for two or three days to oversee the diet transition.Keeping the cat with the vet or having it hospitalized during a forced switch will help prevent digestive problems or malnourishment.

"
"
Start with more frequent scheduled feedings.,
Work gradually toward two to three consistent daily feedings.,
Consider using an electronic microchip feeder.",How to Feed Different Diets to Multiple Cats3," If your cats are used to free-feeding, start getting them used to scheduled feedings with four or five daily meals. Divide their daily recommended portion accordingly to avoid overfeeding.For example, divide one full day’s food portion by four if you’re feeding it four meals, so each meal consists of one-fourth its daily need.
The amount of food a cat needs to eat per day depends on its age, size, and overall health. If you haven’t already, work with your cats’ vet to come up with a meal plan appropriate for each cat., After two or three days, eliminate one of the scheduled feedings. Be sure to adjust meals’ portion sizes accordingly so your cats get their recommended daily value. Eventually, wean them down to two to three meals per day.For best results, schedule mealtimes at consistent times each day.

, You might have difficulty keeping consistently scheduled mealtimes for multiple cats due to work or being out of town. There are electronic feeders available that release food at certain times of day or only to a cat with a corresponding microchip.You can find an electronic feeder online or at your local pet supply store.

Swap the old food bowl for a new one.,
Clean the food bowl.,
Move the food bowl.",How to Ensure That Your Cat Finishes Its Food1," Your cat may avoid eating based on the shape or size of its food bowl. Exactly what your cat doesn't like about a particular food bowl will depend on your cat's specific preferences. Try offering food in a new food bowl that has different features from the first to encourage your cat to start eating more easily.For example, if the original food bowl was large, opt for a smaller one.
Swapping out a rectangular bowl for a circular one can let you know if the shape of the bowl was bothering your cat.;
, Both humans and cats dislike eating out of dirty bowls. Any leftover food can give off smells that will make your cat less likely to eat its food. If your cat's bowl hasn't been cleaned in a while, you can give it a quick wash to help make it more appealing to your cat.You can wash the cat's bowl with soap and water.
Make sure you clean out any old food that may have become stuck to the bowl.
Fully rinse all soap off from the bowl and make sure it is completely dry before using it again.

, The location of the food bowl is important when trying to get your cat to eat more of its food. Cats prefer clean and quiet places to eat, free from loud noises, bad smells and other animals. Check the location of the food bowl and move it if needed to help your cat recover its appetite.Make sure the food bowl is in a quiet place.
Keep the food bowl away from the litter box.

Avoid free-feeding.,
Establish an eating schedule.,
Let hunger prevail.,
Provide attention before mealtimes.,
Mix up the food you provide.,
Switch up the food.",How to Feed a Fussy Cat1," Letting your cat nibble all day, or free-feeding, can cause it to gain weight. This can also turn them into a picky eater. Gradually stop or avoid free-feeding altogether if you notice your cat is a fussy eater.Instead of free-feeding, many vets recommend feeding your cat at specific mealtimes.Avoid giving your cat table scraps, which can also contribute to fussy eating habits.;
, Most cats get hungry after twelve hours of not eating. Place your cat on a regular schedule of two meals per day. This can ensure your cat is hungry enough to not turn down food.Be patient when switching your cat to a schedule. Changing a routine can confuse them and may initially cause them to continue being fussy.Recognize that some cats (and especially kittens) may need more frequent feedings. Consult the vet when establishing your cat’s eating schedule.

, Being really hungry can make your cat eat.At scheduled mealtimes, place the cat’s food in its favorite spot for 30 minutes. Then remove it, even if the cat hasn’t touched the food. Repeat this at the next mealtime. At some point, your cat should be too hungry to refuse its meal.Contact the vet if your cat doesn’t eat after 24 hours. This can signal a problem and cause a potentially fatal condition called fatty liver syndrome, which slows the liver’s processing of red blood cells., Throwing your cat a ball or playing with a chase toy before they eat can stimulate their appetite. Try stroking or petting before mealtimes to calm your cat and get them ready to eat., Feed your cat a mixture of canned wet food and dry food.This can broaden their culinary horizons and ensure they get plenty of nutrients and moisture in their diet., Cats may have preferences for wet or dry food. They can also be sensitive to the freshness and temperature of foods. If your cat is fussy, give it fresh food or switch to a new brand if this doesn’t work.Replace dry food if you’ve had it for a while. Dry food can absorb moisture, especially in warmer months. Avoid feeding your cat food out of the refrigerator, which can make the meal lose its aroma. If a cat can’t smell its food, it won’t eat the meal. Heating the food in the microwave until it is just warm to the touch can make it more appealing.Switch to a new type of food gradually if your cat doesn’t like what it currently eats, as a quick switch can cause digestive issue. Mix the new and old food together gradually over a period of 7 days, putting more of the new brand in each day. Eventually your cat will be eating the new food exclusively."
