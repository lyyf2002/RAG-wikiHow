Ensuring your cat can eat out of its preferred bowl can also help.Give each cat in your home its own dish. Sharing bowls can make some cats fussy eaters.

, The location of your cat’s food dishes can contribute to their desire to eat. Place dishes in a space where other animals or humans can’t sneak up on them or trap them.

Warm up the food.,
Try canned food.,
Add a little tuna water on top.,
Offer baby food.",How to Encourage Your Cat to Eat2," Another way to encourage a finicky cat to eat is by heating up the food just a bit. Even kibble will benefit from this treatment. You don't want it too hot to eat, but a little bit of warmth will help release the scent of the food, which makes a cat more receptive to the idea of eating the food., If your cat has been on dry food and has seemed reluctant to eat, switching to canned food may help. Canned food releases more scent, encouraging your cat to eat.If you mainly want to stick with dry food, you can add a little wet food to the dry to encourage your cat to eat it.

, If you're cat isn't wanting to eat, increasing the good smells of the food may help. Pour a little water from a can of tuna packed in water (not oil) on top of the food. Most cats will be more than happy to eat anything doused in tuna water.You can also try clam juice or even Parmesan cheese., If you can't get a cat to eat at all, particularly a sick cat, you can try baby food for a time. Stick to all-meat products, as cats cannot have foods like garlic or onions. You can offer the cat a little on a spoon or your finger to get it started."
"
Mix the new with the old.,
Keep offering the new food.,
Be consistent when possible.",How to Encourage Your Cat to Eat3," Start by adding just a little bit of the new food to the old food. As days go by, gradually increase the new food and decrease the old food until eventually you're just feeding the new food.Switching foods may also help a finicky cat eat more, if it doesn't like the old food.

, You can't just withhold the old food until the cat eats the new food, as that can be very dangerous for a cat. Instead, offer the new food for 30 minutes. If the cat doesn't eat it, give the cat a small amount of the old food instead. Remove the food when the cat walks away. If you practice this method a couple of times a day, your cat will usually take to the new food in a couple of days.When cats don't eat, they can develop a problem with their liver, which can lead to death., For the most part, cats like routine. If your cat is happy with a food, try to stick with it, as changing can be difficult.

"
Watch your cat for allergy symptoms.,
Have your cat diagnosed.,
Use hydrocortisone to combat the itch.,
Get a prescription for antibiotic or antifungal treatments from your vet.,
Consider pursuing allergen specific therapy.",How to Deal with Cat Food Allergies1," Your pet's immune system may react negatively to a particular foreign substance, which creates allergy symptoms. The first sign of allergies is normally the presence of an itchy, scratching kitty.


The itchy patches may be localized or all over your cat’s body. When your cat scratches the same place over and over again, she may begin to lose hair in that spot. Additionally, your cat may have difficulty trying to breath and may begin to wheeze, sneeze and cough due to respiratory distress.
Other issues may include a discharge from the eyes also related to the respiratory problems, along with vomiting or diarrhea.;
, There are several factors that could be causing the allergies such as chemicals and other seasonal allergens, along with food allergies.


The only way to determine if the cause is due to diet is monitoring your cat before, during, and after she eats. Specifically watch for changes in your cat after eating. You can also bring your cat to the vet to have different tests performed to diagnose the problem.

, Once the allergies are diagnosed, symptoms should subside. You can use a hydrocortisone cream on itchy patches of your cat’s skin to help your pet find some immediate relief., Your veterinarian will most likely prescribe a short course of antibiotic or antifungal therapy. The antibiotic drug should be prescribed after having a bacterial sensitivity test done. The medication may come in the form of a pill or a topical cream.


The topical ointment is commonly a combination of neomycin sulphate and bacitracin or Mupirocin.
Commonly used systemic antibiotics are cephalosporin (10-20 mg/kg, once daily) or amoxicillin (10-15 mg/kg, once daily) and Gentamicin (5mg/kg once daily) for skin infection., Allergen specific therapy can also be performed by your vet. Your vet may also prescribe your can an anti-inflammatory drug, or an antihistamine.


Anti-inflammatory drugs may include a glucocorticoid (like prednisolone with a dose of 0.2-0.3 mg/kg; orally) or Dexamethasone. The drugs can help to treat any lesions caused by the allergic reaction.Antihistamines have not be fully proven to work against food allergies in cats (and the itching that the allergies create). Only give your cat an antihistamine if it has been prescribed by a vet.

Put your cat on a hypoallergenic diet.,
Change your cat’s protein source.,
Opt for foods with as few ingredients as possible.,
Make sure your cat’s diet includes one good source of both protein and carbohydrates.,
Feed your cat a home-cooked diet.,
Consider giving your cat some nutritional supplements.",How to Deal with Cat Food Allergies2," When your cat experiences a food allergy, medical intervention is often necessary. While at the vet’s office, your vet may advise you to put your cat on a hypoallergenic diet for a two to three week period to see if your cat’s allergies clear up.Hypoallergenic diets are very bland and limited in ingredients. If your cat seems to recover, switch your cat back to her regular diet for the next two weeks to see if the allergy symptoms return.
If symptoms do return, your cat needs to be returned to the hypoallergenic diet for good, or you can try feeding her another prescription diet.

, When your cat has allergies, it is frequently due to a protein component that your pet eats over a long period of time, such as turkey, pork, chicken or beef. Change the protein and you may resolve the problem.


However, this process does require a trial or test diet until you can pinpoint the exact protein that is at fault for your cat's discomfort. If you currently feed your cat a diet with chicken as the main protein, choose fish or another healthy meat to feed your cat.
If the new trial diet is not successful after two to three weeks, you consider feeding your cat a different protein for the next two to three weeks, until you find a protein that your cat can eat comfortably.

, When choosing a new food to help your cat with allergies, consider a choice with minimal ingredients. The first option should be a healthy protein, which should be different from the ones your cat has eaten previously.


Ensure that there is only one protein source in the food that you give your cat, or you will not be able to determine which product is affecting your pet. Also check to see that the food has no grains, fillers or by-products; these may cause your cat some discomfort.
Once you have introduced your cat to this new trial diet, keep her on the new food for at least 8 to 12 weeks, feeding your pet nothing else. If you see a positive change in your cat, continue to feed her this diet. If not, you may need to try a different novel protein food until you find one that provides satisfactory results.

, The diets you choose during this trial period should contain one good protein and one healthy carbohydrate, such as duck and peas, venison and potato, egg and rice or fish and potato.You can also find treats with the same components. Remember, the object of this trial period is to limit the number of ingredients your cat eats, so try to find treats that match the ingredients of your cat’s trial food. If you think your cat may be allergic to chicken, do not feed your cat chicken-based treats.

, You may also choose to feed your cat a home cooked diet. Preparing your cat’s food at home will give you the advantage of knowing exactly what your cat is eating.


To make your cat’s food, choose one healthy novel protein such as chicken or fish and a novel carbohydrate like potato or brown rice; these ingredients should be free of any chemicals the immune system might attack.
Contact your veterinarian for advice on where to find some of the best home cooked recipes for your cat. You can also run an online search.

, With a home cooked diet, your feline may need some nutritional supplements for a balanced diet. However, your vet may advise you to eliminate all supplements until the end of the trial diet, so contact the vet before giving your cat these supplements.


When appropriate, consider nutritional supplements that are often recommended in the veterinary field such as essential fatty acids; black currant oil, flaxseed oil, evening primrose oil and fish oils. These oils are usually administered at a dosage of about 200 mg daily.

Consider the age of your kitten.,
Take your kitten's activity level into account.,
Talk to the vet about the best food for your kitten.,
Select a food with a good protein source.,
Look for ingredients that help your kitten develop.,
Check the expiration date of the food.,
Choose a brand name kitten food.,
Create a calm feeding environment.,
Feed your kitten several meals a day.,
Switch up the flavors.,
Offer wet and dry foods.",How to Choose Food for a Kitten," Your kitten won't need to start eating cat food until it's at least four to six weeks old. Before this point, the kitten should still be nursed exclusively by the mother cat. Kittens from seven weeks to one year old should be eating kitten food.


Once your cat is a year old, you can transition to adult cat food. If you have a Maine Coon, you'll need to wait until it's 18 to 24 months to make the transition.Keep in mind that the age to transition any kitten to adult cat food is only a guide. Many vets recommend switching your kitten to adult cat food after you have them desexed. This is because kitten food is higher in calories than adult cat food, so a desexed cat may become overweight if kept on kitten food.;
, Most kittens are incredibly active, so they'll need a lot of protein and calories from their food. As long as you choose a high-quality food that's designed for kittens and not adult cats, the food should meet your kitten's active lifestyle.It's important to give kitten food to a rapidly growing kitten, to supply the right balance of vitamins, minerals, and protein for the growth of muscles and bones. In addition, kitten kibble is smaller and easier for kittens to chew on. However, be aware that kitten food is high in calories, so keep a wary eye that they don't gain too much weight.

, Ask the veterinarian to recommend a few kitten foods to try. The vet will be able to recommend the best food for your cat's body type. If you plan on making homemade kitten food, the vet should be able to recommend a recipe that comes from a certified veterinary nutritionist.It's also a good idea to ask your vet to recommend an adult cat food for your kitten to transition to as it gets older.

, Choose a kitten food that lists a meat product as one of the first ingredients on the nutrition label. You may see chicken, beef, lamb, turkey, or seafood listed. Check the guaranteed analysis on the label and ensure that the kitten food contains at least 30% protein and 20% fat. Your kitten will need these nutritious calories to keep its energy up.Avoid choosing a kitten food that lists mainly grains in the first few ingredient listing slots. Your kitten may have a harder time digesting these foods.

, The kitten food you choose should contain DHA, a fatty acid, and taurine, an amino acid. These will help your kitten's eyes, brain, heart, immune system, digestive system, and vision develop correctly.You should also see folic acid in the ingredients listing. This will ensure that your kitten's cells develop properly.

, Most dry cat/kitten foods will stay fresh for a year if it's unopened. Before you buy kitten food, check the expiration date on the package. If the food is expired or over two years old, avoid buying and serving it to your kitten.Wet food will keep for two years if it's unopened.

, Most cat food manufacturers make a food specific for kittens. Choose a brand name kitten food so you can be sure that it contains high quality ingredients. It may be harder to research the ingredients in a generic kitten food.Keep in mind that you may need to try a few different brands to find one that your kitten enjoys.

, Many kittens are used to being around other energetic kittens or an active household. To help your kitten focus on eating regular meals, place the food and water dish in a quiet place in your house. They should be away from your kitten's litter box and away from other pets so there's no competition for food.Clean the food and water dishes every day. If the containers get dirty, the kitten may not want to eat out of them.

, Instead of letting your kitten graze throughout the whole day, offer your kitten three to four small meals a day until the age of 12 weeks. Then, switch to three small meals per day after this point. Giving small meals will give your kitten a chance to digest smaller amounts of food. You should feed the three meals a day until your kitten turns six months old.Once your kitten is six months old, you can give it two meals a day.

, Just like people, your kitten may grow tired of the exact same kitten food every day. Don't be afraid to offer it different flavored foods or different textured foods. This can prevent your kitten from becoming selective about its food.For example, if you always feed your kitten dry chicken and brown rice flavored kitten food, you may offer it a salmon and chickpea flavored dry kitten food.

, You should offer your cat both wet and dry foods so that it becomes familiar with both. This can be helpful if you need to give the cat wet food as part of a medical treatment later on. Try alternating between serving wet food and dry food meals.For example, some diabetes treatment plans require the cat to have canned cat food.
Also, keep in mind that how much you feed is almost as important as what you feed your kitten. Do not let your kitten become overweight because this predisposes them to health problems later in life, including diabetes.

Choose dishes made of stainless steel.,
Get dishes made of ceramic, glass, or stoneware.,
Avoid plastic dishes.,
Consider eco-friendly disposable dishes.",How to Choose Food and Water Dishes for Your Cat1," The type of material your cat’s food and water dishes are made of should be one of your main considerations when deciding what to use. Dishes made of stainless steel are the best choice. These bowls are easy to clean and dry, which will help prevent bacteria from forming in the dish. In addition, stainless steel is generally unbreakable, so this type of dish should last a long time.Some people recommend avoiding stainless steel that was made in China. There have been unconfirmed reports showing that stainless steel produced in China may contain radon, which is a rare radioactive gas that can be harmful to your cat.;
, Like stainless steel, these materials are also easy to clean, which can help prevent bacteria from forming in your cat’s food or water dish. They are not unbreakable, like stainless steel is, but these materials are durable and should hold up well. In addition, they come in a variety of colors so you can find one that complements your home’s décor.If you are using stone dishes, make sure the glaze is lead-free and safe to eat food out of. In addition, ensure stone dishes are dishwasher safe.
Throw away ceramic, glass, or stone bowls if they become chipped or cracked.As long as they are in good shape, you can repurpose your old ceramic, glass, or stone dishes to be used as cat bowls.
Although the evidence is uncertain, you may want to be wary of buying ceramic dishes from China because some people believe the glaze used on these dishes can be toxic to pets., Although plastic pet dishes are inexpensive and readily available, they are not the best choice for your cat’s food and water dish. Plastic dishes are easily scratched, leaving crevices that are tough to clean and could foster the growth of bacteria. Though controversial, it is also believed that some plastics may emit harmful chemicals into your pet’s food.


Some cats may develop chin acne if they are exposed to the bacteria that can form in plastic bowls., Alternatively, you may want to use disposable dishes to ensure bacteria like E. Coli, Staph Aureus, Salmonella, and mold or yeast doesn’t grow in your cat’s dish. If you choose to use disposable bowls, ensure they are environmentally friendly and made from recyclable material.


For example, one brand of disposable pet dishes is made from sugarcane fiber which is 100% recyclable."

Consider your cat’s age.,
Think about any dietary restrictions.,
Consult your vet.,
Research brands.,
Examine various costs.,
Read the labels.,
Decide which size to purchase.,
Consider your cat’s preferences.,
Stay on budget.,
Avoid trendy products.,
Ignore unnecessary ingredients.",How to Choose Dry Cat Food," Dry cat foods are often categorized for cats by age. There are formulas that provide extra energy for growing kittens. There are options for older cats that provide necessary nutrients that aging kitties need.These specialized formulas are intended to provide your cat with the right kind of nutrition for its age and size.;
, Some cats have special dietary needs – like allergies or weight problems. For cats who are overweight, these specialized formulas help cats maintain a healthy diet so they can reach a more optimal and healthy weight. There are dry food options made for indoor cats, and some for outdoor cats.Some dry cat foods are made specifically for cats who have been spayed or neutered.
There are even special formulas for cats who are prone to hairballs or urinary tract problems.

, The best way to determine what specific health requirements your cat has is to discuss the issue with your veterinarian. At your cat’s next health checkup, ask your vet what kinds of dietary issues they think you should focus on when considering different dry food options.Your vet has the most knowledge and knowhow when it comes to determining what your specific pet needs. Trust their advice.

, There are many different brands to choose from when it comes to dry cat food. Look for a brand that has been around for a while and that has a good reputation for producing high quality food.You should also look for a brand that has several different options in case your cat’s dietary needs change over time. Switching foods between brands will be much less stressful on your cat’s digestive track.

, Most dry cat food brands offer several different levels of “quality” foods that are available at different prices. Most offer a budget or basic food, a normal formula, and a premium style. In general, it’s not necessary to choose the premium version unless your cat has a special dietary requirement., Learn how to read the labels on packages of dry cat food. They provide a lot of valuable information for you as a consumer and a pet owner. This is where you’ll find the list of ingredients contained in the food.The most important thing to remember is to look for a quality ingredient listed first. You want a food that has a real kind of meat – like poultry, beef, lamb, or fish – listed as the first ingredient. If it doesn’t, then the food contains more fillers intended to make your pet feel full without providing the kind of nutrition it needs.

, Dry cat foods come packaged in various sizes. While you are trying to figure out what your cat likes and what works for you, consider buying the smallest sized package of each food to avoid wasting money and food products unnecessarily.Once you have determined a brand, variety, and flavor your cat likes, you can consider purchasing larger packages. Typically, buying a larger package is cheaper in the long run because you get a discount for purchasing more at one time.

, Just like people, cats have natural preferences regarding what kinds of food they like and dislike. Your cat may prefer larger kibbles or smaller kibbles. The cat may like one flavor of dry cat food more than another. The only way to know for sure is to monitor your cat’s eating habits and try to determine which food your cat likes best.For example, your cat may show a noticeably increased appetite when you feed it food made with tuna or other fish products, whereas the cat seems less hungry at mealtimes when you feed it food that includes beef as its main ingredient. This could mean that your cat prefers the food containing the fish products and you should consider purchasing these products more often than others.

, Owning a pet can be quite a financial burden at times. But there is no need to spend inordinate amounts of money on the daily upkeep of your pet’s diet. In general, there is little evidence that fancy premium dry cat foods have any additional health benefits over more affordable options.Consider how much money you can afford to spend on your cat’s dry food each month and choose an option that is within your budget range.
Don’t feel bad about avoiding the more expensive options. They typically aren’t worth it.

, When it comes to your pet’s diet, it needs to be a pretty stable thing in the cat’s life. Choose a trusted brand that has been around for a while, not a new popular company that may change their products or go out of business in a short period of time. This will keep you from having to choose another dry cat food in the near future.


Choose a product that you know and trust, maybe even one that was recommended by a friend or veterinarian.
You don’t want to choose a dry cat food just because it’s popular in the moment, as this may not be the healthiest or most affordable option.

, Many dry cat food options contain active ingredients that are toted as beneficial for your cat’s health, but really don’t have any scientific evidence to back up those claims. Focus on foods that provide protein, calcium, fats, and vitamins.Again, avoid dry food products that contain anything with the word “meal” (like cornmeal) as the primary ingredient.
You’ll also want to steer clear of too many carbohydrates, as this is often just a filler ingredient. It is meant to make your cat feel full without providing any real nutritional value.

Use a food dish tall enough that your cat’s mouth is above its stomach when eating.,
Look for shallow, wide dishes.,
Choose dishes with a non-slip bottom.",How to Choose Food and Water Dishes for Your Cat2," Ensuring that your cat’s food dish is tall enough can help with its digestion. Swallowing its food will be easier if your cat’s mouth is higher than its stomach while it is eating. In addition, this allows your cat to maintain a more natural body posture while eating, which can reduce the stress that is put on its neck and back.


If you can’t find a dish that is high enough, you can use an elevated feeder to achieve the same results. Elevated feeders are raised slightly off the ground and usually hold two dishes—one for food and one for water., Some cats have very sensitive whiskers, so a bowl that is small in diameter might not leave enough room for them to eat or drink without their whiskers touching the sides, which can cause irritation. Look for bowls that are wide and shallow, leaving enough room for your cat to eat and drink comfortably without bending or rubbing its whiskers.Wide, shallow bowls may not be tall enough to ensure your cat maintains a comfortable posture while it is eating. If this is the case, try raising the dishes off the floor with an elevated feeder or by placing them on a slightly raised block.

, It will be easier for your cat to eat and drink if its bowl is not moving all over the place. In addition, keeping its bowl still can help keep the area around your cat’s dish cleaner. Look for bowls that have a non-skid rubber on the bottom to help prevent it from moving while your cat eats.If you can’t find any dishes with non-slip bottoms, you may be able to make your own by gluing a piece of non-skid material to the bottom of the bowl.

Place your cat’s dishes in an open area.,
Wash dishes daily with soap and hot water.,
Soak the bowls once a week in a bleach solution.",How to Choose Food and Water Dishes for Your Cat3," In the wild, cats like to be able to see their surroundings while they eat. This allows them to detect threats or predators. You should mimic this in your home. To do so, place your cat’s bowls in an open part of the room. Stay away from placing food and water dishes in corners, as this could make your cat feel on edge.Depending on your cat’s feeding schedule, you can put the food bowl away in between feedings. Your cat’s water bowl, however, should be left out at all times.
If you’re worried about your cat’s dishes looking tacky or clashing with your décor, try hanging an art piece or tea towels above the bowls. This will make them look more like they belong in the room., Your cat’s food and water dishes need to be washed every day. Using hot water and soap, scrub the dishes to remove any food residue. Rinse the dishes with hot water, making sure you rinse off any remaining soap.


You can also clean your cat’s dishes by running them through the dishwasher on the hottest setting.Instead of using soap, you can also use equal parts baking soda, warm water, and salt to clean your cat’s bowls. Scrub the dishes in a circular motion using this mixture and then rinse them well., In addition to washing your cat’s food and water bowls daily, soaking them in a solution of one part bleach and one part water will help ensure your cat’s dishes stay germ-free. Emerge the dishes in this solution for about 10 minutes once a week. Rinse them well when you take them out of the solution."

Notice if your cat is dehydrated.,
Monitor your cat’s weight.,
Consult your veterinarian.,
Consider brand longevity.,
Evaluate product variety.,
Read the label.,
Stay on budget.,
Make the change gradually.,
Put the wet food next to the old food.,
Let the old food run out on occasion.",How to Choose Wet Cat Food," One of the best reasons to decide on a diet of wet food for your cat is because of the much higher water content that is present in canned cat food. If your cat is prone to dehydration, this is an excellent way to ensure that you cat gets additional water in its diet.Some common signs of dehydration in cats include panting, sunken eyes, loss of appetite, dry mouth, and lethargy.
If you suspect your cat is dehydrated, you should take it to the vet immediately for a health checkup.;
, If your cat is struggling with weight problems, it may be time to switch your kitty to a wet food diet. Since canned wet foods contain about 80% water, they are actually much healthier for your cat than calorie-dense dry food.Additionally, if your cat is overweight and eating a dry food diet, switching to wet food could help because of the forced change in the method of feeding.
Many cats who eat dry cat foods are free-fed, meaning they eat whenever they want until they are full, not a measured amount each day regulated by their owner.
Wet cat food must be given in smaller amounts several times per day because the food will spoil if it is left out for too long.

, If you are struggling with the decision about whether or not to feed your cat a wet food diet, ask your vet about it. Your vet can inspect your cat, look at its health records, and discuss the best options with you. They can tell you if your cat has any special health needs that should be taken into consideration.It will also ease your mind to get a professional opinion.

, You want to choose a brand of wet cat food that is known for quality and has been around for a while. An older company will have perfected its methods, will probably produce a better product, and will be less likely to disappear on you in the future.Read company reviews online, ask friends and neighbors for recommendations, and consult your veterinarian regarding brands of wet cat food to purchase.

, Choose a brand of wet cat food that produces a variety of products. This will make it easier on you in the long run if your cat has changing dietary needs in the future. Look for a brand that has a budget product, a premium product, a variety of flavors (fish, poultry, beef, etc.), and a wide range of specialty products focused on specific needs (like urinary health, hairball prevention, and products for older cats).Switching products between the same brand is much easier on your cat than changing brands altogether.

, One thing to consider when choosing a wet cat food is the kind and quality of ingredients included in the product. Read the list of ingredients on the label and evaluate the quality of each ingredient. The first listed main ingredient should be a wholesome, genuine meat product.You want your wet cat food to include genuine meat products, not byproducts – like cornmeal or beef byproduct. Products with these lesser ingredients will contain fewer valuable nutrients for your pet and more filler just intended to make your cat feel full.

, While it is true that there is quite a wide price range in wet cat food products, it’s generally not necessary to spend top dollar on the pricier items.As long as you read the label and approve of the ingredients, feel free to purchase a cheaper brand option. There’s no need to break the bank on something that seems fancy, but really isn’t.

, When transitioning cat foods (especially from dry food to wet cat food), it’s important to make the change slowly over time – not just one big surprise all at once. This can confuse your cat and possibly cause it to eat less than it needs to remain healthy.Slowly start introducing the new food a bit at a time while still making the old food available.

, To introduce new wet food to your cat, place some of the new food next to the old food in the normal place where you feed your cat. Let the cat inspect the new food and choose which one it wants to eat.Keeping the routine as much the same as possible is quite important for the transition period.

, During the transition period (usually about two to three weeks), keep introducing the new food while the old food is still present. After a few days of this, you should let the old food run out – especially if the cat is still showing a clear preference for the old food.Let the old food remain empty for several hours to encourage your cat to eat the new food. Then refill the old food again to continue with the transition period.

Check the label for the number of calories.,
Calculate the calories using an online calculator.,
Look at the manufacturer's website for caloric information.,
Compare the calories in wet and dry foods.",How to Count Calories in Your Cat's Food1," In order to determine the number of calories in your cat’s food, you should look at the food label to see if the calories are listed. Cat food companies are not required to put caloric information on the label. That being said, some brands will include caloric information. This is often the case for foods that are marketed as “light.”, If you cannot find the caloric information printed on the label, then you can calculate the number of calories yourself. For example, use an online calorie calculator to determine the number of calories. In order to do this, you will need to look at the “Guaranteed Analysis” section of the food label. Here you will find all of the nutritional information regarding the percentage of protein, fiber, fat, minerals, etc found within the food.You will then input these numbers into the online calculator found here: http://fnae.org/carbcalorie.html

The calculator will determine the number of calories per 100 grams of food. It will also provide you with information concerning the percentage of carbohydrates.

, In some instances you can find the caloric information regarding your cat’s food by searching the specific product page on the manufacturer’s website. In many instances the manufacturer will list the caloric information on the website, rather than directly on the label.You can also email or phone the manufacturer to inquire about this information., Generally, dry cat food is more condensed and contains more calories than wet food. This means that your cat could get the same amount of calories by eating a small amount of dry food and a larger serving of wet food. In most cases, the calorie count for dry food is anywhere between 350 and 500 calories per cup, whereas wet food ranges from 120 to 190 calories per cup.Different proteins also have different average calorie levels. For instance, chicken-based foods typically have more calories than turkey, fish, or beef-based cat foods."

Talk with your vet.,
Use an online calculator.,
Calculate the number of calories yourself.,
Understand the average caloric intake for cats.",How to Count Calories in Your Cat's Food2," It is also important to have a good understanding of how many calories your particular cat needs to consume each day. This amount will vary between cats and is usually based on their age, weight, activity level, and whether or not they have been spayed or neutered.Ask your vet to assess your cat and determine the proper number of calories it should consume each day.
In most instances your vet will provide you with an ideal caloric range for your cat.

, It is also possible to discover your cat’s caloric needs using an online calculator. Complete an online search for a “cat calorie calculator.” You will then need to input your cat’s weight and indicate if your cat has been spayed or neutered. You will also be asked if your cat is a kitten.This calculator will provide a general indication of your cat’s caloric needs, but is not as accurate as a vet assessment.

, It is also possible to calculate the number of calories your cat needs by using a mathematical formula: Cal=(weight kg^0.75)*70*Factor. You need to calculate your cat’s weight in kilograms to the power of 0.75. Then multiply that number by 70. This will give your cat's Resting Energy Requirements (RER). You then need to adjust that calculation slightly depending on your cat’s age and activity level. For a normal adult cat you would multiply this number by 1.2.For example, an adult cat that has been neutered and that weighs 10lbs (4.54kg) will use the following formula to calculate their desired calories: (4.54^1.75)*70*1.2=525 calories/day.
If this were a kitten, you would adjust the factor number from 1.2 to 2.
Alternatively, if the cat was overweight the factor would be adjusted from 1.2 to 0.8.

, An adult cat needs approximately 25 to 35 calories per pound per day. The number varies slightly based on activity level. For example, an active eight pound adult cat would need to consume about 30 calories per pound per day for a total of 240 calories.Kittens need to eat slightly more because they are still growing. As a result, you should feed them frequent meals (approximately four per day) and they should eat as much as they can until they reach six months of age. At this point you can begin feeding them like an adult cat.
Monitor your kittens weight and development to ensure they are not over or under eating.

"
"
Determine your cat’s proper daily feeding portion.,
Subtract any calories that are given in the form of treats.,
Monitor your cat's weight.",How to Count Calories in Your Cat's Food3," Once you have determined the number of calories your cat needs to eat each day and the number of calories within its food, you can calculate how much food to feed your cat each day. For example, if your cat needs 400 calories per day and you are feeding your cat a dry food that contains 200 calories per cup, then you would need to feed your cat two cups of food per day.You could divide this up into two meals or allow your cat to graze all day and only provide a maximum of two cups of food.

, You should also take into consideration the calories contained in any treats that you give your cat. For example, if your cat eats 50 calories worth of treats each day, then you need to reduce the amount of calories they receive through their regular meals.For example, if your cat needs 200 calories per day and they eat 50 calories in treats, they would have 150 calories left to receive from food. If their food contains 100 calories per cup then they would need 1.5 cups of food each day.

, You will likely need to change the amount of food you give your cat throughout their lifespan. This is because their activity level and metabolism may change as they age. Monitor your cat's weight and adjust their caloric intake accordingly. For example, if your cat begins to gain weight, you may need to start feeding them less calories each day. Similarly, if they start losing weight begin feeding them more calories.Calculate their caloric needs by using their desired weight instead of their actual weight. This will help you determine the exact amount you should be feeding them.

Choose a calm, quiet feeding location.,

Select a feeding location away from the water bowl.,
Do not change feeding areas.,
Feed your cat and dog separately.,
Create feeding stations.,
Use creativity when positioning the feeding stations.",How to Choose the Right Place to Feed Your Cat," Cats wants to feel comfortable where they eat. If your cat’s food bowl is in a busy area of your home where there’s a lot of noise and foot traffic, your cat may not feel comfortable enough to eat her food.Select an area of your home that’s quiet and calm. This area could be an unused bedroom, the living room, or maybe a quiet hallway.


Try to make this quiet location fairly close to where your cat usually spends its time.;
, In the wild, cats eliminate away from their nests. Pet cats will not eat where they eliminate, and vice versa. If you put your cat’s food bowl next to the litter box, your cat won't know what to do—should it eat or go to the bathroom? Your cat may decide not to use the litter box, which could be problematic for you.To prevent confusion, put the food bowl in a completely separate area from the litter box.
If your cat already has a litter box problem, moving the food bowl away from the litter box could help resolve the inappropriate elimination., It seems logical to put your cat’s water and food bowls in the same place. However, in the wild, cats search for food and water separately. Setting the food and water bowls next to each other could prevent your cat from drinking enough water.Wherever you feed your cat, set the water bowl in a different area.


If you have a double bowl (food and water bowls together), purchase separate bowls. Cats typically don’t like double bowls because the water can get contaminated with bits of food at mealtime., Cats are creatures of habit and can become stressed if their environment or daily routine suddenly change. Once you have identified the perfect feeding area, do not switch locations. Only move the food bowl in certain situations, such as if your cat is old or injured and has difficulty walking to the food bowl.If your cat is overweight, consider moving the food bowl to a more distant location in your home. This would encourage your cat to get more physical activity., Dogs and cats have different nutritional needs. If you have a dog, create separate feeding areas to prevent your cat and dog from eating each others food.Also, your cat may not feel safe eating right next to your dog. As a result, your cat may eat as quickly as possible to get away from your dog, which could lead to digestive upset.If your cat feels unsafe next to your dog in the eating area, your cat may not eat at all.
You do not have to feed your dog and cat at separate times. You can feed them at the same time, as long as their feeding areas are separate.
If your dog eats only a little of your cat’s food, it may develop diarrhea. If it regularly eats your cat’s food, though, it could become very sick., If you have multiple cats, meal time could be an issue, especially if one cat is bullying the other cats. To make sure each cat gets their share of the food, create feeding stations in different parts of your home. That way, each cat can have its own safe space to eat without having to bully or get bullied., Feeding stations don’t have to be on the floor. For example, if you have a cat condo, put a feeding station on a flat surface of the condo. This location could work for a cat that is very shy or gets bullied by other cats or pets. The cat condo feeding station would also be out of reach of dogs and little children. Depending on where your cats spend most of their time, other potential feeding station locations are the:Office desk
Window perch
Bathroom counter

Make meal sized portions and freeze.",How to Cook for Cats," Cats have nutritional requirements that are vastly different from our own, requiring careful consideration and planning of the food they're receiving. Cats need a diet high in protein and fat. In fact, cats need twice the amount of protein that dogs need.Do not attempt to do this on your own — talk with your cat's veterinarian about getting a referral to a qualified veterinary nutritionist who can ensure your cat will be getting all the necessary nutrients.


Cats need approximately 85 percent meat, fat, offal, and bone in their diet, with vegetables, herbs, and roughage making up only 15 percent of feline dietary requirements.Formulating a correctly balanced diet is very difficult and something even veterinary nutritionists struggle with. If you get it wrong, the cat won't show signs for days and weeks, but problems develop months or years down the line. Don't change your cat's diet without consulting a nutritionist and allow yourself to have a false sense of security that your cat seems fine and healthy.;
, A healthy diet for a cat will ensure the following:clean water (available at all times and easily accessible), protein (most cats won't eat food containing less than 20 percent protein), fat (cats need fat for energy, essential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamin intake, and taste), vitamin A (cats need a good dose of this vitamin. It is found in liver, eggs, and milk but these ingredients need to be used with caution), vitamin B (Cats need vitamin B and will readily eat brewer's yeast if there are signs of deficiency, such as loss of appetite for a few days or a fever), vitamin E (Vitamin E is needed to break down unsaturated fats in the cat's diet), and calcium (This is an important part of building and maintaining your cat's bones).


Taurine is an amino acid that is also essential to a cat's diet. Sufficient amounts of taurine usually exist in commercial cat foods (both dry and wet), but your cat may be at risk of a taurine deficiency if you feed it homemade foods or a vegetarian diet. Taurine deficiency in felines can cause central retinal degeneration, leading to irreversible blindness, as well as heart failure. This is why adding taurine to your cat's diet is crucial.

, For instance, cats in different stages of life may need different feeding schedules or types of food. While most cats can regulate their food intake fairly well, there are some cases where you will need to regulate it for them.



Kittens need to be fed three to four times a day from the ages of six weeks to three months. By six months of age, feeding can be reduced to twice daily.
Adult cats should be allowed to eat when they want, grazing throughout the day, but if that is impossible, they should be fed at least several times each day.
If you have multiple cats that have different diets, you may need to figure out a feeding system that keeps them out of each other's food.

, Cats cannot thrive (or survive) on a vegetarian diet.It is recognized that there is intense debate and passion on this topic but placing the cat's natural needs first is a primary concern of cat well-being.


While there are specific supplements some vegetarians feed to their cats, such as taurine, and numerous suggestions for vegetarian cat diets, a vegetarian diet for a cat can result in blindness and heart failure. Not only is this type of diet a highly intensive effort for an owner, it risks a shortened lifespan and diseases, especially if it introduces a higher level of unhealthy carbohydrate products into the cat's diet.

, A fully home prepared diet with no quality brand name commercial foods included requires careful balancing to ensure that your cat is getting everything it needs. It is not recommended unless you have thoroughly researched what your cat needs and have raised the matter with your vet.

, If you haven't already noticed this, it can be frustrating to try to change your cat's diet. Don't be surprised if your cooking efforts are rebuffed! Persevere and keep trying until you pique your cat's curiosity. Removing your cat's usual food on the occasion of trialing the new food is an important part of encouraging her to give a new food a go.


Try gradually adding your homemade food to your cat's usual food. This will acclimate them to the new textures and smells of a homemade diet.
Don't leave uneaten food out. If your cat hasn't eaten it within the hour, dispose of it. Just try again another time.

, Remember that just because you can eat it, doesn't mean your cat can. Foods not to give your cat include onions, garlic, chives, grapes, raisins, chocolate (even white chocolate), sugar, uncooked yeast dough, and spices from your pantry such as nutmeg, baking powder, and baking soda.Other ingredients to avoid include alcohol (it has the same impact as on humans only much faster — just two teaspoons of whiskey can induce a coma in a 5 pound cat), dog food (wet or dry — dog food has completely different nutrient content), candy and gum (if sweetened with xylitol, this can cause liver failure), coffee, tea, and other caffeinated products such as cold medicines, stimulant drinks and painkillers (large quantities can kill a cat and there is no antidote), and human medication of any kind (acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be deadly to cats)., Cats need a well rounded diet but that does not mean that they need all nutrients in large amounts.


Limit fat trimmings and bones. Cooked bones should not be fed to cats and fat can cause pancreatitis in cats.If you want to feed your cat raw eggs, only give them the yolk. Raw yolks can be digested but raw whites cannot. Cook the egg whole if also using the white. Consider cooking the whole egg each time, as raw eggs can carry Salmonella. Even if they don't get sick, the cat can be a subclinical carrier of Salmonella, basically meaning that it can be transferred from cats to human beings.Raw meat should be frozen prior to feeding unless you are absolutely sure of its healthy origins.
Feed your cat liver no more than twice weekly.
Tuna can be addictive if overfed and result in a thiamine deficiency. Basically too much of the diet devoted to any kind of fish can also result in such deficiency.
Milk and milk products can upset many cats, including digestion and itchiness. Talk to your vet if you'd like to continue using it; not every vet or cat owner is convinced that milk is inappropriate for cats able to tolerate it.

, Unless you're absolutely certain that you're getting the balance right, cooking all of your cat's diet at home can result in deficiencies and harm your cat. Many vets won't recommend a home-cooked diet for pets simply because they know most people don't have the training or knowledge to do so, and that busy owners may stray from fulfilling recommended recipes aimed at providing optimal nutrition due to time constraints.In addition, vets may have concerns about the lack of sufficient knowledge about dietary needs, and lapses of attention to the diet caused by human life events.If you're eager to cook for your cats all the time, it is doable, it just requires a lot of (often conflicting) research and weighing up of the options of what's available in your area.
Consider your lifestyle. If you travel a lot and have other people feeding your cats, are you going to be able to ensure that their home-cooked diet is adequate? If you work long hours, are you prepared to make up batches of food each weekend to be feed throughout the week?
Some people favor feeding raw foods. This is controversial for a number of reasons, including an increased risk of infection from parasites and bacteria that are now not killed by cooking. A raw diet is currently not recommended by veterinary bodies such as the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) because the risks outweigh the benefits.

, Getting the recipe wrong, or having a recipe that is lacking in essential nutrients, could cause severe health problems in your cat. Just as in other animals, including humans, the key is a healthy balance. Even essential nutrients can negatively affect your cat's health if you give them too much.


Because the balance of nutrients is so important, you should get input about your recipe from your veterinarian or an expert on cat health, even if the recipe was formulated by someone else.

, Once you've got the basics of feline dietary needs, you're ready to start cooking for your cats. Note that the the following ideas are suggested recipes for occasional variety and do not represent a diet plan. If you wish to cook or make homemade cat food as a permanent dietary change for your cat, it's important to do your research to create a balanced diet that meets all of your cat's needs, and to get your vet's stamp of approval.


Your cat may not like homemade food but it will let you know soon enough!
If you have any concerns, talk to your vet about the appropriateness of cooking food for your cat, especially if your cat is growing, pregnant, unwell, or has medical conditions.

, For instance, purchase free-range, antibiotic and hormone-free whole chicken thighs from a reputable source. You can also use chicken livers, turkey, and egg yolks, among other options.


Make sure you fully cook the meat to destroy any bacteria. Then remove some of the meat from the bone and cut into chunks of around 1/2 inch (12.7mm) using sharp kitchen scissors or a knife.

, Place meaty bones into a meat grinder with a grinding plate of .15 inch (4mm) holes. Run 4 oz of chicken livers per 3 pounds (1.3kg) of raw chicken meat through the grinder. Run 2 cooked eggs per every 3 pounds (1.3kg) of raw chicken meat through the grinder. Mix everything together in a bowl and refrigerate.


If you don't own a grinder, you can use a food processor instead. It will not be as efficient or as easy to clean but it will cut the protein into small, digestible pieces.

, In a separate bowl, for every 3 pounds (1.3kg) of meat, pour in 1 cup water, 400 IU (268 mg) vitamin E, 50 mg vitamin B-complex, 2,000 mg taurine, 2000 mg wild salmon oil, and 3/4 tsp light salt (with iodine). Mix all ingredients together.


Pour the supplement mix into the ground meat and mix well.

, These ingredients should not form the majority of your cat's meals, in fact they shouldn't be a part of every meal, they can add key nourishment for your cat.


Mix a little steamed rice with some chopped salmon and a little bit of water. The consistency will be soup-like; simply pour into your cat's bowl.
Cut vegetables into small pieces and add to the meal (the type of vegetables are up to you).
Add oats to your cat's food. Bring 8 cups of water to a boil. Follow the directions on the package of oats for water to oats ratio. Add the oats and cover. Then turn off the heat, letting oats cook for 10 minutes until soft.
Some other suggestions include: An oat based raw cat food meal, tuna cat treats, and holistic cat food recipes for whole health.

, The average cat eats about 4 - 6 ounces a day. Keep your cat's meals in the freezer until the night before you plan on feeding it to them and at which point you should move it into the fridge. This will give the food enough time to defrost.

Good cat food will list a specific meat as the first ingredient.If the label just says “meat” or “meat product,” it may not be very high quality. It could also just have meat flavoring instead of actual meat. Make sure the type of animal protein is specified on the label.;
, Many cat foods will contain grains like corn, barley, or wheat. These grains provide carbohydrates for cats, which will give them energy. The top five ingredients in the food should be meat first, followed by grains.If your cat is prone to allergies, avoid food that contains grains like corn, soy, or wheat. These grains can trigger allergies in cats.

, These ingredients are animal fats and are essential to maintaining your cat’s health. If the cat food contains high quality meat content, it should contain taurine and arachidonic acid.If the cat food does not contain taurine or arachidonic acid, it likely does not contain animal sources of protein. Avoid cat foods that have plant sources of protein instead of animal sources of protein.

, Look for vitamins like vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin C, folic acid, and vitamin B12 in the food. These vitamins are essential to keeping your cat healthy.Minerals like calcium, phosphorous, iron, magnesium, sodium, and zinc should also be listed as ingredients in the cat food. These minerals help your cat maintain healthy joints, bones, and teeth.

, Most cat foods will contain animal by-products. If the food is high quality, it may contain animal by-products like liver, and lungs. These are fine for cats to consume. Lower quality foods may have animal by-products that are hard for cats to digest. Avoid lower quality cat foods with lots of by-products.By-products should appear last or close to last in the cat food. This will ensure the cat food is mostly high quality protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals.
Some cat food brands will list the by-products, such as ""animal liver or lungs"" while other brands may just say ""animal by-products.""

, Make sure the cat food does not contain chemical preservatives like BHT, BHA, ethoxyquin, and propyl gallate. Avoid cat food that have preservatives or additives high in the ingredients list. These foods are often very low quality and not safe for your cat to consume.Be especially careful of dry cat food that contains additives, preservatives, or fillers. Dry cat food that is low quality is often 50% filler or additives, which will not give your cat much nutrients or energy.

, The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) regulates pet food and helps to ensure pet food is to industry standards. Look at the label on the food to confirm it has been certified by the AAFCO. This means the food has been independently tested and deemed safe for pets."

Pick dry food for convenience.,
Feed the cat wet food if it tends to get dehydrated.,
Give the cat a mix of wet and dry food.",How to Choose Cat Food2," Dry food is often cheaper and easier to maintain than wet food. Dry food allows you to leave the food out for the day without having to worry about it going bad. Most adult cats can thrive on dry cat food that is high quality. Make sure the dry cat food contains mostly animal proteins.Your cat may prefer dry cat food over wet food, especially if you introduce dry food to the cat early in its development.

, Wet cat food can be more expensive and takes a bit more effort to maintain. It can be a good option if your cat is prone to dehydration and urinary tract issues.Wet cat food is perishable so it should be given to your cat at feeding time as soon as you open it. You should then dispose of any remaining wet cat food so it does not go bad.

, Rotating your cat’s food can help them stay healthy and encourage them to eat at every meal time. Try giving your cat a mix of wet and dry food, alternating between wet and dry. You can also give the cat wet food one or two times a week and dry food the rest of the week, especially if you are on a budget.You can also try giving your cat different brands of dry and wet food to see which one it likes best.

Give kittens food high in protein and fat.,
Get low-calorie food for an adult cat.,
Feed a senior cat food low in fat.",How to Choose Cat Food3," Kittens need a high protein diet as they will have more energy than adult or senior cats. Check the ingredients list on the label to confirm the first ingredient is a protein source like beef, lamb, turkey, tuna, or chicken.Kittens also need food that is high in animal fats like taurine. This will help the kitten develop strong bones, teeth, and joints.
You can find cat food formulated for kittens at your local pet store or online. These foods will contain folic acid and DHA for healthy development. Even if the food is labeled as ""formulated for kittens,"" read the ingredients list to make sure it contains high protein, fat, and other nutrients.

, Adult cats age one to ten should be given cat food that is low in calories to avoid becoming overweight. Look for food that is high in vitamins like calcium, vitamin E, and vitamin C to boost the cat’s immune system.Adult cats are at a high risk of becoming overweight, especially if they are given cat food that is high in calories and fat. Speak to your vet about the right food for your adult cat, especially if you worry it is becoming obese.

, Cats ten years or older require low-fat cat food. The cat food should contain proteins that are high quality and easy to digest. The food should also contain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to help boost the cat’s immune system, as senior cats are prone to health issues.Look for cat food that is formulated for senior cats. Most cat food manufacturers will offer food made especially for senior cats.

Buy cat food at your local pet store.,
Ask your vet for a recommendation.",How to Buy Healthy Cat Food," Before you can choose cat food for your cat, you should be aware of the type of food available for your feline friend. Your cat may need a certain type of cat food based on her temperament, her breed, and her dietary needs. There are four main types of cat food, including:Dry cat food: This type of food is composed of small, compressed nuggets. Dry cat food is high in carbohydrates and may not be ideal for certain cats.
Wet cat food: This type of food comes in cans and is very moist and soft. The food is not dehydrated like dry cat food, so it has a higher moisture content and less calories than dry food.
Raw cat food: This type is made of mostly meat, vegetables, and/or grains. Some raw cat food also contains extra supplements for added health benefits. This type of food is supposed to mimic a cat’s natural diet.
Special formula cat food: This type of food is made for cats that have health issues like obesity or bone disease. Your vet will often recommend special formula cat food for your cat to help address certain medical issues.;
, You should think about which type of cat food will benefit your cat the most. Some cat owners believe in only feeding their cat canned food, as they believe it is healthier than dry food. Other owners argue that cats can stay healthy on either dry or wet food and pet owners should choose whatever type is most convenient for their budget.There is also an argument for the benefits of raw cat food, though this type can end up being expensive.You may want to consider how often your cat drinks water. If she drinks lots of water throughout the day, she may be okay to just have dry cat food. But if your cat is not great at drinking water throughout the day, you may want to give her wet canned food, as it has a higher moisture content.
You may also try a blended diet for your cat, where you give her a mix of wet and dry cat food. This can be more cost effective for you as an owner and ensure your cat gets enough variety in her diet., You should always consult your veterinarian to find the right type of cat food for your cat. Getting your vet’s opinion will ensure your cat gets the nutrients she needs and stays healthy.Your vet may perform a body condition analysis on your cat to help determine if your cat is overweight, underweight, or at her ideal weight. You can also do this analysis on your own. Try to feel your cat’s ribs. If you cannot feel them, she may be overweight and need to go on a particular diet.
Your vet may recommend that you put your cat on dry or wet food to address any health issues. They may also suggest a special formula cat food if your cat has a specific health problem, such as helping your overweight cat lose weight.

, You should check that the cat food is formulated for your cat’s age, or life stage. A kitten will have different nutritional needs than an adult or senior cat. You should go for a food that is suited to your cat’s age so she stays healthy. There are three life stages covered by cat food brands, including:Kitten formula: This is food that is specially formulated for kittens. It will contain a higher amount of calories, protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus to encourage healthy bone growth.
Adult cat formula: This food made for all adult cats and provides all the nutrients required for lifelong health.
Senior formula: This food is made for older cats and contains less calories. It will also have different nutrients to encourage joint health and cater to sensitive stomachs in senior cats.

, You may do an online search for cat food brands that are highly rated for their quality ingredients. You could then do your own research into certain cat food brands to find one that is right for your cat and your budget.


You can find a list of top cat food brands on Reviews.com and ConsumerAffairs.com.
You may also consult with your vet to create a list of healthy cat food brands that he or she recommends for your cat. You may then do your own research into these brands to find the cat food brand that is right for your cat and your budget.

, You should read the ingredients listed on the label and make sure the first ingredient listed is meat or “meat meals.” Cats are carnivores and require meat in their diet to ensure they get enough protein. The cat food should be mostly meat, like beef, chicken, turkey, fish, or other meats.Fat should also be listed as one of the first five ingredients, as cats also require a level of healthy fats in their diet. The type of fat will vary, but might be listed as a vegetable oil, like sunflower oil, or an animal fat product.
Be wary of terms like “gourmet,"" “premium,"" or “natural” on the label, as these have no standard definition and are not indicators of the quality of the food., You should also check the ingredients list for any allergens, especially if your cat is prone to allergies. Avoid cat food that contains wheat, beef, chicken, and soy if your cat has an allergy or is prone to developing them., You should also look at the grain content in the food, as many cat foods use grains to provide enough carbohydrates in your cat’s diet. Most cats can digest and metabolize these carbohydrates as an energy source. But some cat owners try to avoid grains in their cat’s diets, especially if their cats are overweight or suffer from health issues.Keep in mind grain-free foods are not necessary lower in carbohydrates. Some cat foods replace grains with another carbohydrate, like potatoes. If you are trying to put your cat on a low-carb diet, you should check that the food is free of high-carb ingredients.
You should also check the food for any animal by-products and make sure they are quality by-products like animal liver and lungs. Most high quality cat foods only use quality by-products and will not include by-products unfit for consumption.

, You can buy healthy cat food brands online through their website or through a third party site that sells different cat food brands. You may compare prices on different sites before you buy, especially if you are opting for a more expensive cat food brand.You should also check for any discounts or special pricing for first time customers. You may also save money on the cat food by buying in bulk, though you should make sure your cat will consume all of the food before the expiry date to ensure you are feeding your cat fresh food.

, You can also purchase cat food at your local pet store. You may already have a neighborhood pet store that you frequent and ask them if they carry a specific cat food brand. Or you may search for a pet store in your area that carries the cat food brand and type you are looking for.

, Your veterinarian may be able to recommend a pet store that sells a specific cat food brand and type. Many vets are aware of different cat food brands and may know of a store that sells a certain type that they can recommend to their clients. Getting a recommendation from your vet could also ensure that the cat food is high quality and worth buying for your cat."

Pick a variety of treats.,
Buy treats for specific conditions.,
Check the ingredients.,
Buy treats made in safe countries.,
Ensure the treats have not been recalled.",How to Choose Cat Treats1," There are two main varieties of cat treats. Try semi-moist treats, which are generally softer than other cat treats. Your cat may also like crunchy treats, which are hard. Both varieties of treats come in a variety of flavors. Freeze dried protein treats are also available, but they aren't as common as other types of treats.


You can buy these at the grocery store, the pet store, or at your vet's office.
Popular brands include BLUE Wilderness, Whiskas, and Greenies.;
, There are varieties of treats specifically developed for conditions your cat may have. Ask you vet if specialty treats would be helpful for any condition your cat may suffer from. These include:


Grain free, if your cat has allergies
Tartar control, which help clean your cat's teeth
Hairball prevention, which have a formula of ingredients to cut down on hairballs
Joint health, which contain ingredients that help your cat's joints
Protein rich, with a high concentration of protein, When you are choosing a cat treat, look at the label of ingredients. The more ingredients on the list you don't recognize, the worse the treats are for your cat. You should recognize meats, grains, vegetables, and other similar ingredients. Many cat treats have unnecessary fillers, dyes, and preservatives that are not good for your cat.


Also avoid treats with too much fat, salt, and calories., There are many treats that are made in other countries. Many countries do not regulate the creation of animal treats, so you need to avoid treats from countries such as China, who has been cited for unsafe treat practices.If in doubt, look for a seal from the Association of American Feed Control Officials, who provide minimum regulations for cat treats., Before you pick a brand of cat treats, you should check the Food and Drug Administration’s pet food recall website. This will protect your cat from unsafe cat treats that have been taken off the shelves."

Give him catnip.,
Grow cat grass.,
Make your own treats.,
Avoid certain human foods.",How to Choose Cat Treats2," There are a variety of human foods, mostly meats, that you cat will enjoy. Although you should not supplement his normal cat food with too much human food, small portions of human food can be a nice treat for your cat. These foods include:


Tuna, cooked or canned
Salmon, cooked or canned
Chicken or turkey, cooked
Lean beef cuts, cooked
Eggs, cooked
Liver, cooked
Sardines, canned
Clams, canned
Cheese, in small cubes, one at a time
Milk, a tablespoon at a time since many cats cannot properly digest lactose, which can cause digestive problems, Catnip is a great natural plant that acts as a treat and toy for your cat. You can buy catnip toys for him to play with and sprinkle some on the floor, which provides him with a snack as well as something to play with.


You can grow a fresh catnip or buy store bought catnip. This variety may be fresh or died., Cat grass is a plant similar to oats and wheat that attracts cats. Plant a tray of cat grass to sit by a window during the winter or have a patch in your backyard. This will give your cat something to play. You can pluck some for him to eat.


Cat grass is very low in calories.
It is common for some cats to vomit the cat grass back up. If this happens with your cat, switch to catnip., If you aren't happy with commercial treats or basic human food, you can make homemade treats for your cat. Look for recipes with healthy ingredients, such as lean meats, vegetables, grains, and eggs. There are many different kinds of different cat treats out there, such as sunflower treats, chicken biscuits, tuna treats, and sardine cookies.Play around with many different varieties of ingredients to see what you cat may prefer. Make sure you bake them in small pieces to avoid overfeeding your cat.
Homemade treats are good options because you can control what is in them and how much of each ingredient he gets. Look for recipes with the best natural ingredients that avoid foods toxic to cats., There are certain human foods that are harmful to cats. These foods can cause health problems, such as weight gain and diarrhea. In some cases, these foods may cause death. These foods include:


Salt or any food with too much salt
Avocado
Grapes or raisins
Chocolate
Nuts, such as macadamia
Citrus, especially rinds
Coconuts or coconut oil
Onion or chives
Leeks
Garlic
Liquids with caffeine, such as coffee or tea
Alcohol

Follow the 10% rule.,
Measure the amount of human food.,
Replace treats with love.",How to Choose Cat Treats3," Your cat's treat intake should never exceed 10% of his daily calories. This may seem like it would be hard to do, but cats need very few calories every day. The average eight pound cat only needs 130 to 210 calories.


Many commercial treats have about two calories a piece, but this means your cat should have no more than six to 10 per day.
It is really important not to overfeed your cat. This can cause many health problems and shorten his lifespan., When you are giving your cat human food, you need to be very conscious of how much you give him. Any meat you give them should be in small pieces, no larger than a pencil eraser tip.


If you give them much more than this, he will get too many calories from human food, which can lead to obesity.
Too much human food can also cause his nutrition to become imbalanced., If you find that you feed your cat too many treats every day, replace some of the treats with affection instead. While treats are great ways to tell your cat you love him, petting him or having a play session with his favorite will show him you love him more."

Make sure your breath is minty fresh before you go to your room and call it a night. Pick your full outfit (tops, bottoms, underwear, shoes, socks, scarves, hair accessories, sweater, jewelry, everything). Before bed, apply a moisturiser and maybe a lip butter. Light some candles as well, and set them in an even, sturdy, cleared spot so that they don't tip or light other things on fire while you sleep. If you have some, spray a scent like lavender or ocean breeze on your pillow to fully relax yourself.;
, Put on a warm, comfy robe and go out to your main room. Turn on the TV and have a nice breakfast while watching. Cereal with fruit or nuts, fruit crepes, French toast, eggs Benedict, etc. are perfect, filling, delicious breakfasts. Hopefully you drove to your school before the first day, because you should know the latest time you can leave.

, You shouldn't brush your teeth straight after breakfast, or the flavor will reappear. Floss completely, brush extremely well, and use mouthwash. On your way to school, chew a piece of mint gum and keep mints in your locker at all times. Split pieces of gum for before and after lunch if your school allows it.

, If you're going to put accessories in your hair and/or curl it or straighten it, put on the leave-in shampoo after this. Keep a comb in your locker in case you need a quick little fix.

, Make it natural or very light for the first day, as in no more than concealer/powder, light blush, natural or very little colored eye-shadow, as well as a thin coat of mascara. You can, at the very least, wear lip gloss.

, Only bring a few things, since your first days are usually filled with instruction. You should take your binder to keep in your locker, a bag of pencils, and a planner/agenda.

, Keep a drink, a main course, and two extra snacks. If you're taking a sandwich, don't use bread from an unopened package, because it'll stick to your teeth (making lunch awkward!) If you don't take lunch, know how much it costs, and bring a bit extra just in case. If you don't get a lunch card passed out to you, get your student ID from a teacher and write it down so you have it for lunch.

, You don't have to constantly smile, but keep your lips normal - not smiling but not frowning. Keep your back straight, and don't look at your feet. Once you're inside and the halls are open, call the attention of a kid who looks about your age and isn't busy (talking to their friends or fiddling with something). Ask them where your first class is, but if classes are in the same spots, ask where your locker is. Pick a nice, friendly-looking person so you're not ignored or insulted. They'll probably be happy to oblige. Once they help, thank them, and then casually ask, ""Hey, what's your schedule?"" If you share any classes, you're set for those!

, Don't be shy! It seems hard, but it's super easy to say, ""Hey! I'm _____. May I sit here?"" If you approach them nicely, they'll probably say yes no matter what. However, if a kid is acting weird or seems rude, find another seat. You don't want to have to tolerate them, and it's not the attention you want.

, Sitting in the front makes you seem like a teacher's pet, and sitting in the far back makes you seem like you don't care. Another pro to sitting in the middle is that you're surrounded by all sorts of people - friendly, like you, rebels, and nerds. Fitting in with all groups is a perfect way to get attention, but be yourself.

, You may seem like an intruder if you take one of the last seats at a crowded table, so get there early. Introduce yourself, and ask a question, like ""where's the gym?"" or ""do you know where cooking class is?"" It also shows confidence, and in that case, don't be too quiet or too loud.

, Don't fake them for attention. If you sit next to somebody and see something cute that they're wearing, go, ""Hi, I'm___. I love your _____!"" It's great to make somebody smile and feel good about themselves, and people want to be surrounded by people who make them feel good.

, If somebody says something funny out loud and seems nice, respond to the joke sarcastically or with another. If the person smiles and/or laughs, introduce yourself. Being funny, for girls and guys, is just about the NUMBER ONE WAY to get people to be your friend. The best kinds of friends are unannounced friends - you don't have to say it, you just are.

, If you watch somebody drop their stuff, help them pick it up. Maybe say a teasing joke, like, ""Ah, books are so tricky."" Smile at them so they know you're just kidding around. If they say something, respond and introduce yourself. If somebody's going through a hard time, try to help them out, but never force them to tell you anything.

, Not necessarily chess club, but maybe art club, Christian club, or a local anti-drugs or anti-bullying group. You'll get to meet amazing people here. You get to pitch ideas and be part of the school. Go for anything you like, really, whether it's art, drama, leadership, sports - whatever!

Use both.",How to Choose Between Dry or Canned Cat Food," One option is to try out both types of foods and see which one your cat likes better. Many cats do prefer wet food, though not all of them. Older cats and cats who've lost their appetite can benefit from wet food because the scent is stronger, encouraging them to eat., One benefit of dry food is you can use it in food puzzles. A food puzzle is a game you put the food in, basically a tube or a plastic toy with holes in it. Your cat has to push it around to get the food out. It provides some fun and entertainment for your cat, making them ""hunt"" for their food. Canned food does not usually work in these games., Generally, dry cat food is cheaper than canned cat food. Partially, that's because dry food doesn't need to be individually portioned like canned cat food is. If cost is a consideration for you, then dry is probably your best bet.If you are working within a budget, you may not be able to afford to feed your cat canned food all the time. If that's the case, go with a high quality dry food, which can be cheaper. Top quality dry food should not contain by-products, artificial ingredients, or fillers like corn, wheat, or soy. The meat protein source should be named.You can also store dry food more easily, as dry food is less perishable. Therefore, you can store a larger, opened bag in an airtight container (not refrigerated). In addition, you don't need to pick up what your cat leaves behind in its bowl, as it keeps well. Leftover canned food needs to be refrigerated., When choosing a food, whether dry or canned, look for one that matches your cat's age. Your vet can help you pick out one that's right, and they can even help you figure out your cat's age if you don't know it already. You should be feeding kitten food to kittens and senior food to elderly cats. You can also get food based on activity level., If your cat has a special condition or health issue, talk to your vet about which is best for your cat. Your vet may recommend a special kind of dry or canned food to best serve your cat's health and wellness needs., One of the benefits of wet cat food is it provides more moisture to your cat than dry food does. Some cats don't enjoy drinking as much water as they should, or they are picky about their water sources. In that case, feeding them wet food can help with their hydration. Your vet should be able to tell if your cat is getting enough water.Cats who have kidney problems or who are prone to urinary tract infections may benefit from wet food, for instance.However, a free-flowing cat water fountain can also encourage your cat to drink, which you can buy at a pet store or online., Dry cat food can be better for your cat's teeth, as the crunch helps reduce tartar build-up. It's not the only way to help your cat's teeth (some treats are designed to help), but it can be beneficial in keeping them healthier.Some vets debate the benefit of dry food, particularly since most cats will need some kind of dental work at some point in their lives. Therefore, ask your vet what's right for your cat's dental health., Your cat is a carnivore, meaning it mainly needs proteins and fats to survive. Canned food usually is higher in fat and protein than dried food, which tends to have more carbohydrates per serving. Your vet can help you pick out a food with a protein level appropriate for your cat., When a cat food is evaluated for the amount of protein, it's done on a ""dry matter basis."" All that means is that it doesn't take into account the water in canned cat food. Therefore, you may think a dry food you're looking at has more protein than canned, when in actuality, it's just the water in the canned cat food that makes the difference. Look at the amount of protein per serving rather than per ounce of food to determine how much your cat is getting., Whether you give your cat dry or canned cat food, it's important to read the label. An adult cat should be getting about 25-30% of their diet from protein and 15-20% from fat. If you read the ingredients, look for a meat meal, such as chicken, lamb, or fish meal, to be in the first three ingredients.If it says ""meat and bone meal,"" that's not as good for your cat.

, Because canned food is already measured out, it can make it easier for you to maintain portion control. This benefit can be important if your cat is overweight, as portion control can help your cat lose weight.However, you can also carefully measure portions with dry cat food by using a measuring cup appropriate for the amount of food your cat needs.
Many pet parents overfeed their animals. You should easily be able to feel your cats' ribs when rubbing their bellies., Another benefit of canned cat food is that it can help your cat feel fuller because of the water content. It's a similar to when a nutritionist tells you to eat soup or drink a glass of water before dinner. It helps you feel full without feeling deprived, and the same goes for your cat., The Association of American Feed Control Officials regulates and tests foods for all types of pets. You can check out a food on their website, though you can also look for words like ""complete and balanced"" on your cat food label. This phrase is regulated, guaranteeing the food provides proper nutrition., You also don't have to choose between dry and canned cat food. Some owners feed their cats canned cat food several times a week and dry food the rest of the time. Others use canned most of the time, but they may buy dry food for puzzle toys. Be aware, though, that some cats will develop a preference, and they may refuse to eat certain foods."

Talk with your vet.,
Consider your cat's nutritional needs.,
Choose a commercial diet.,
Discuss homemade diets with your vet.,
Select vitamin supplements for your cat.,
Encourage your cat to eat.,
Use a separate bowl to feed your FIV cat.,
Adjust your cat’s diet as the disease progresses.",How to Choose a Diet for an FIV Cat," In general, cats with FIV do not need a special diet. However, because not all FIV cats are alike, there is no ‘one size fits all’ diet for FIV cats. Because your FIV cat may have specific dietary needs, talk with your vet before selecting a diet for your cat.For example, if your cat has another health condition, such as chronic kidney disease, it may have special dietary needs.


A cat with chronic kidney disease would need a low-protein diet.Ask your vet questions about what your FIV cat's diet should be: Does my cat need a prescription diet? Are there any specific nutrients that my cat needs? Can I feed my cat treats? What if my cat doesn't like the food?
Your vet will recommend a diet based on your cat’s overall health.;
, An FIV cat needs a nutritionally complete (contains all required nutrients) and balanced diet. Protein is one of the most important nutrients in a cat's diet. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need animal-based proteins (chicken, beef) in their diets.Animal-based proteins contain amino acids (building blocks of protein) needed for healthy growth.Taurine is a very important amino acid for cats. It is found in animal-based proteins and is essential for a cat's health. A taurine deficiency can lead to problems with vision, heart muscle function, and digestion.Other than protein, cats also need carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals in their diets., Many commercial diets are available that would provide your cat with proper nutrition. These diets come in several forms, including dry and canned. Dry foods are typically inexpensive, but may not be very tasty or digestible. Canned foods are tasty, but may not be nutritionally complete.Dry food usually contains plant-based proteins (grains, vegetables). These proteins do not give cats enough of the amino acids they need for proper health.Semi-moist cat food is another option. However, semi-moist food tends to be high in carbohydrates and aren't very nutritious. Also, additives or dyes in the food can cause allergic reactions in cats.On the food label, look for a certification from the Association of American Feed Control officials. This certification ensures the food meets minimum nutrient requirements.Ask your vet for recommendations on which commercial diets would be best for your FIV cat.

, Other than commercial diets, you could make a homemade diet for your cat. A homemade diet must be nutritionally balanced to satisfy your cat’s dietary needs.Be aware that homemade diets can be very time consuming to put together. If you do not have a lot of time, a commercial diet would likely be the better option.


If you decide to make a homemade diet, do not add uncooked foods to that diet. FIV cats have weakened immune systems, making them very vulnerable to food-borne infections from parasites or bacteria. Uncooked foods like raw meat or eggs could make your cat very sick.To make a homemade diet for your cat, use an animal-based protein source (cooked chicken, turkey, beef), carbohydrate (rice, boiled or mashed potatoes, whole oats), and vitamin and mineral supplements.The portion size you feed your cat will depend on several factors, such as age, activity level, and overall health.
Talk with a veterinary nutritionist before starting your cat on a homemade diet. The nutritionist would create a diet for your cat and give you recommendations on how to prepare the food.

, Supplements of vitamin C and vitamin E can help keep your FIV cat healthy.In particular, a vitamin E supplement can help strengthen your cat’s immune system.Ask your vet for recommendations on high-quality vitamin supplements for your cat.


Follow the product label instructions when feeding the supplements to your cat.

, Cats with FIV tend to have intestinal problems and poor appetites. If your FIV cat does not feel like eating, you will need to encourage it to eat. At mealtime, add a tasty topping (chicken or beef broth) to the food. You could also add a bit of tuna to the food.These extra toppings may add just enough extra flavor to entice your cat to eat.


Look for the broth in your grocery store’s soup aisle.
Contact your vet if you are not able to encourage your cat to eat. Your vet may prescribe a medication to stimulate your cat’s appetite.

, The saliva from an FIV-positive cat can contain the disease-causing virus. Therefore, if you have multiple cats, consider feeding your FIV cat with a separate bowl.Minimizing the risk of the virus spreading will be important for your healthy cats.


Fortunately, it is unlikely that your healthy cats will get FIV simply by sharing a food bowl with your FIV cat.If you would like to feed all of your cats from the same bowl, talk with your vet before doing so.
Clean the separate food bowl just as you would clean the other food bowls.

, Your cat’s dietary needs may change as the FIV progresses and your cat’s immune system gets weaker. Your vet can recommend dietary changes to keep your cat as healthy as possible, despite the effects of the disease.FIV can have negative effect on oral health in cats.If your FIV cat's dental health starts to suffer, your vet may recommend feeding your cat a dental diet."

Live as an adult.",How to Get Emancipated as a Teen," When a person reaches age the age of maturity, which is the United States ranges from 18 to 21 depending on state, he or she becomes a legal adult, taking on the rights and responsibilities that come with adulthood. Teenagers who are emancipated before the age of majority gain those same legal rights and responsibilities. They are no longer supported financially by their parents, and they are no longer legally allowed to rely on their parents to meet their needs. Consider the following rights and responsibilities you would have as an emancipated teenager:You must find your own place to live, and be responsible for paying rent.
You must provide your own food, clothing and other material needs.
You may get a marriage license, driver's license, or join the armed services without your parents' permission.
You may sign contracts without your parents' involvement, and be legally responsible for upholding them.
You may buy and sell property.
You may enroll in a school or college by yourself.
You may choose what medical treatments you receive, and you are responsible for paying for them.;
, Teenagers have a variety of reasons for wanting legal independence from their parents, from getting married at an early age to facing an abusive situation they want to leave. Consider pursuing emancipation if one of the following reasons applies to you:You are legally married, and wish to have the same rights as an adult.

In this case, emancipation is achieved with parental consent and permission from the court.


You are already financially independent, and wish to have the rights that come with financial independence.
Your parents or guardian have told you that you cannot live with them.
Your parents or guardian are physically or sexually abusive.
The situation at your parents' or guardian's home is morally repugnant to you.
Your parents or guardian have stolen your money.

, It is not easy to take on the legal rights and responsibilities of an adult at an early age. Many teenagers don't have the resources to pay for rent, clothes and groceries without assistance, and a judge won't grant emancipation unless you show you can take care of yourself. In addition, gaining emancipation can cause a permanent rift in a family, and should only be pursued when no good alternatives exist.Consider talking to your school counselor or a trusted adult friend about your options. He or she may be able to mediate an agreement between you and your parents that would help you feel comfortable living under their guardianship until you reach age 18.
If you don't want to live with your parents anymore, and your reason is that you don't get along with them or you disagree with their rules, you're probably better off staying with a relative or friend for a while instead of pursuing legal emancipation.
If you are in an abusive situation, emancipation still might not be the best choice, since emancipated individuals can no longer be aided by Child Protective Services. Contacting your state's Child Protective Services might be the option that better meets your needs.

, When you pursue emancipation, you must prove to the courts that you are financially independent and that you have a job. If you don't yet have a job, find one as soon as possible.



Write a resume that includes previous jobs, volunteer work, and clubs and other activities. Look in the classified section of your local newspaper for jobs that don't require a high school diploma.

Save as much of your money as you can. Don't spend money on clothes or entertainment. Buy what you do need second-hand, or try to find it for free. Grocery shop frugally; buy cheap staples like beans, cabbage and tuna. Open a savings account at your local bank.

, When you pursue emancipation, you must be able to show the courts that you are living in a permanent home. You will probably not be able to afford a house; look for a small, very cheap apartment, or set up a permanent arrangement with a relative or friend.

, The emancipation process is easier if your parents agree that it's the best course. If they don't, you will have to prove that they are not supporting you.

, In most jurisdictions, either you or your parents can file a petition for your emancipation, with or without the assistance of a lawyer. Contact the Circuit Court in your jurisdiction and ask for a petition, then fill it out along with any other forms you are required to provide, which may include the following:


An Affidavit to the petition, which is a description of your reasons for filing it.
A financial statement describing your personal financial situation.
A verification that you have employment, and thus will be able to pay your bills.
A statement indicating that you have social independence.
An Affidavit from either your parents or an adult who knows you personally and believes emancipation to be in your best interest, such as your physician, social worker, psychologist, teacher, school counselor, school administrator, or minister.

, When you have the paperwork filled out, return it to the Circuit Court and pay the filing fee. Filing fees vary from state to state, but are generally from $150 to $200.


If you you cannot pay the filing fee, ask for a fee waver form from court staff.

, After your paperwork has been processed, you'll receive a date for a preliminary that you must attend, with or without a lawyer. Your parents or guardian will be given notice that they may also attend if they wish.


The court will ensure that you are able to sustain yourself financially and socially.
Your parents or guardian will have the chance to object to your petition if they wish, and explain their reasons for doing so.
In some cases an investigation will be conducted. If your parents and guardian are found to be providing an acceptable home, and do not wish for you to be emancipated, your petition may be rejected.
If the evidence presented is found to be true, your case will move forward and a court hearing will be scheduled.

, At the court hearing, you as the minor are responsible for proving that your parents either approve of emancipation or aren't supporting you, that you have the ability to manage your financial and social affairs, and that you understand your rights and responsibilities.


If you are able to provide proof that is acceptable to the Court, emancipation will be granted, and will be kept on file with the Court until you are 25.
If you or your parents object to the decision, either to grant you emancipation or not, you may file an appeal with the Court of Appeals.

, Once you have gained emancipation, you are responsible for living entirely without the help of other adults. You are no longer legally allowed to rely on your parents for assistance, so it's important to do well at your job and keep up with your bills to create a stable life on your own.

Think of past situations that have required a cell phone, or would have been made easier with one.,
Do any of your friends have cell phones?,
Think about your life right now, without or little usage of a cell phone.,
If you have a very busy schedule, or rely on carpooling much and public transportation, the chances are good that a cell phone may be a good tool to have should something go wrong.,
Think about what you want and need in a cell phone, and go with just that.,
Are your parents divorced where you go back and forth, or stay with only one parent for all/majority of the time?,
Decide.,
Evaluate your own behavior.",How to Determine If You Need a Cell Phone," This can go from not having a camera to take a picture of something, or needing to call someone for an emergency.;
, Do they actually use them? How often have you called your friends cell phone, only for it to go to the voice-mail? How often have you actually seen them using it? Chances are, if they don't need it, they probably just got one as a fashion statement, or gave in to peer pressure.

, Chances are, you probably borrow someone's phone or use a home phone when you need to make a call. Are you getting by just fine, and secretly want a phone because your friends show off theirs to you?

, What if your ride didn't show up due to an emergency? What if you are stuck somewhere due to a cancellation in plans?

, Make a chart or list with the necessary criteria. Look at your list and see what the reasons are. If your reasons go more along the lines of communication purposes (calling, texting, email, etc.) then you likely may find a cell phone very useful. If your list goes along the lines of how flashy and cool you want your cell phone to be, and more as a show off tool then you may quickly lose interest in your phone, and not use it very much.

, Do you often miss your dad/mom? Having your own phone would be a good way to connect without depending on your parent., By now, you should have made a non-biased decision about whether or not you need a mobile phone. If you need a phone, try to discuss with your parents why you feel you need a cell phone, and show them all the work you have done. This shows maturity and responsibility. It is always a good idea to show specific phones that address the needs that you have. Try to find the cheapest one possible.

, Although you might need a phone, evaluate how you have dealt with valuable objects in the past. Have you always given your money to your parents because you've lost it in the past? Have you ever dropped an electrical item in the water? Your parents may use these against you, despite how impressed they are by the work you have put into this project. Consider your own age, as well. If you are under 11, there really shouldn't be any need for you to have a cell phone, unless your parents feel the contrary. Many parents have their own views on an appropriate age for you to get a cell phone (keep in mind that your generation is the first to have a cell phone as a child-your parents probably only got one very much later in life since cell phones came around in the 80's!)

,, Make sure you have a nice backpack with several pockets and places to put extra supplies. You should have one for your binder, folders and textbooks, one for your pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, protractor, etc., and one in case of an emergency.

,, Greet people with a smile and compliment people on their clothes or accessories, even if it's not necessarily something you like. It will make them feel good about themselves, as well as you, when you see a smile on their face.

,, Take a shower the night before the school day and make sure you look and feel squeaky clean for the day ahead of you.

,, Before bed, make sure you have everything ready for tomorrow. Have your clothes laid out, have your homework done and most importantly, don't forget to brush your teeth! You'll regret it in the morning, stinker! When you're all set for tomorrow, get into your comfiest pajamas and crawl under your soft bed, preferably doing something relaxing such as reading a book or sipping a cup of hot tea. You'll fall asleep in no time.

,, Yogurt with granola and berries with a glass of orange juice is a good choice. Cereal is a good choice too, just not Fruit Loops or Captain Crunch! Keep it healthy and natural.

,, Don't let anyone get in your way today. No one can let you down if you are strong and don't let them. Stand up for yourself and have the day of your life!

Accept your parent’s separation.,
Reflect on how you’re feeling.,

Talk with your mom about how you feel.,
Address your concerns.,
Listen to what she has to say.,
Write her a letter.,
Ask to spend time with her.,
Avoid comparing your mom’s new love interest to your other parent.,
Be supportive.,
Be open to the person she is dating.,
Avoid talking badly about the person your mom is dating to your other parent.",How to Deal with Your Mom Going on Dates," Perhaps your parents got divorced, were never married and decided to go their separate ways, or maybe your other parent has passed away. There are many reasons parents aren’t able to continue on together, and as their child, it can be hard to accept this reality. Sometimes, when your mom starts dating, it serves as a cold reminder that your parents aren’t and will never be together again.Try to understand that it isn’t up to you whether your parents will be together or not. If your parents are no longer together, then that is how it will be, and you can only try to make the best of the situation.;
, You may be feeling a lot of different emotions about your mom’s decision to start dating. You may feel betrayed, or angry, sad, scared, or even happy for her. Try to identify all the different feelings that are going on. Try to identify what it is about her dating that is causing each emotion. Thinking deeply about your feelings can help you untangle them. When you talk to your mom about what’s bothering you, you’ll be able to express yourself more clearly.Sometimes it can be helpful to write down all the different emotions you are feeling to keep it all straight.
For example, if you write down that you are feeling “betrayed,” follow that thought. What is it about your mom dating that makes you feel betrayed? Do you feel betrayed because you think she is trying to replace your dad and create a new family?

, What do you think will happen now that your mom has started dating? Try to imagine and work through different scenarios. Maybe she will meet someone and get married, or maybe she will meet someone and get her heart broken. What role do you play in each of those scenarios?


Thinking through different scenarios can be a good way to feel like you have some control over the situation. Ultimately, you really don’t, but it can be helpful to feel like you know what role you will play in several different scenarios.

, Dealing with this new situation can be really tough, especially if you feel that you can’t talk to your mom about what’s going on. Instead, talk to a friend or trusted family member about the situation. Tell them why it’s bothering you. They may be able to point out things you hadn’t thought of, or offer guidance.It may be very helpful in this situation to get help from a professional counsellor, who can help you understand what you’re feeling.
Avoid talking to your other parent about your mom’s dating. Even if they already know about it, it’s unlikely that they’ll be able to approach the subject without putting their own emotions into it.

, When your mom is dating, she may make choices that you believe to be poor ones. She may go on dates with lots of different people, she may stay out very late, or she may date people that are obviously wrong for her. However, it is important to recognize and remember that she is an adult who is able to make decisions for herself. She may not always make the best decisions, but they are her mistakes to make, not yours.


If your mom has not dated for many, many years try to keep in mind that it is probably a very scary and challenging time for her. Dating can be hard and emotionally draining. Try to remember this and be understanding of the situation.
Although it may not feel like it sometimes, you are the child in this relationship. It is not your responsibility to keep your mom from making poor decisions or mistakes.

, It’s important when you do this not to accuse your mom of neglecting you or not caring about you. Instead, focus on talking to her about how you feel. Are you feeling scared that you’ll lose her to someone? Maybe you’re worried she will get hurt? Are you worried she is trying to replace your dad? Pinpoint exactly what you’re feeling.Try to do this at a time when you are not fighting with your mom or angry about something. Otherwise, you risk saying things you don’t mean, which may really hurt her feelings.

, When you are talking with your mom, this will be the time to address any concerns you have about her decisions related to dating or about the person she is dating. Do this respectfully. It may be helpful to say something like, “I know it is not my place to tell you what to do, but I have noticed that….” Hopefully, this will help her see that you are only trying to look out for her (even though it isn’t your job).


For example, if you notice that she often comes home sad after her dates, point this out to her. Say something like, “Mom, I’m trying my best to be understanding of this new chapter in your life, but every time you come home from a date, you seem less happy than when you left. I just want to make sure that you are doing what makes you happy.”
Point out any changes you might like to see related to your relationship with her. For example, if you feel like she isn’t spending enough time with you then say, “I understand that going on dates means you won’t be home as often and that’s OK, but I also want to spend time with you. Can we schedule some time where it’s just you and me doing something fun?”
Once you have talked about your concerns related to her dating, leave it be. It is OK to do this once to get it out in the open. After that, you should respect that your mom is an adult.

, It is just as important to give your mom a chance to express her own feelings. Try to hear what is going on in your mom’s life, and why she wanted to start dating. You may find, for example, that your mom has felt very lonely for a long time, and that dating has made her feel happy and cared for.


If you are able to listen, your mom will see that you aren’t just trying to make everything difficult. Listening to your mom’s feelings will also help make her feel like you care, which will hopefully bring you closer together.

, If you feel as though talking to your mom will only end in a fight, or that she won’t listen to you, try writing down all of your feelings in a letter. As you would when talking to her, try to be respectful, and avoid accusing her of one thing or another. Just explain how you’re feeling.


The advantage here is that it will give her plenty of time to read and re-read your thoughts, and will give her a chance to think about the best way to react to your feelings., If you feel like your mom is spending too much time with her new love interest, try asking her if you can spend some time alone together. She may simply not realize that you want to spend time with her too; she may have thought you’d like to have your alone time. Ask if you guys can go see a movie together, or make dinner together.If she tells you that it is a great idea, and that she will invite the new boyfriend along, explain to her that you’d really like to spend some time with just her.
If she asks why you want to spend time together in the first place, just tell her that it’s because you love her, and you want to stay close with her.

, It can be easy to notice how her new partner is not as good as your other parent. Keep in mind, though, that they’re not there to replace your other parent, so it doesn’t matter if they’re the same or different.Instead, try to notice the things that you really like about your mom’s new partner. Maybe they like going outside and playing catch with you, or maybe they treat your mom really well, and it’s apparent how happy they make your mom. It’s always a good plan to look for the qualities in other people, rather than their flaws.

, This is a tough one, but if you are constantly fighting with your mom about her dating, and telling her she shouldn’t do it, then there will be a lot of tension in your relationship. If you can, try to remind her that you love her very much, and that you want her to be happy, but that you also want to have your own time with her too.


If you like someone that she is dating, tell her! If you don’t like them, then just try to be polite. You don’t have to be best friends.

, Remember that this person isn’t there to replace your dad. They are there because they care about your mom too. You don’t have to treat this person as you would your parent, but treat them as you would any other adult that you have no reason to disrespect. Greet them when you see them and remember to say “please” and “thank you” when necessary.If you give them a chance, you might find that you like them more than you thought you would.
This can be scary, and you might feel angry or resentful when you meet this person. If you need to, go to your room for a while to reflect on your encounter with the new person, but try not to be rude.

, This can be tempting, but try not to do it. It isn’t fair to your mom or the person she is dating, and it may even be painful for your other parent to hear about it. It may create even more tension between your parents as your dad may question your mom’s ability to make her own decisions.If you feel like you need to vent bad feelings about the person your mom is dating, try writing all of it down in a journal or talking to someone, such as a friend, who is not involved in the situation.

For young skin, a BB cream works best because it moisturizes, protects and covers blemishes without looking thick and cakey. If you don't have naturally rosy cheeks, apply a small amount of blush (not a shimmery blush). For your eyes, use a primer (or concealer) on your lids to make your eye makeup last longer.

End your routine with a yogi pose.",How to Do Kids Yoga3," Greeting the sun is a good way to start a morning yoga routine. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and put the palms of your hands together. Hold your hands in front of your heart and then bow.


As you bow, you can also think or say, ""I welcome the sun.""

, After you have greeted the sun, it is good to do a big upward stretch. Raise your arms to the sky and stand on your tiptoes. Take a deep breath in as you reach your hands up.

Make a game of it.,
Keep it easy.,
Praise your kids for doing yoga.",How to Do Kids Yoga4," Kids might not feel motivated by a serious and highly controlled yoga session. They will be more likely to enjoy it if the session is fun. Otherwise, they might get bored and lose interest. There are lots of different ways to make yoga fun for kids.Tell kids the names of different yoga postures. These are often animals or elements of nature. Children may enjoy doing poses based on the interesting names.
Try to invent different stories to go along with the actions. For example: Tell a story about a dog, using the “Downward Dog” posture as a focal point. Make believe you are the sun waking up in the morning for the “Sun Salutation” posture.
Talk about how silly and fun some of the yoga movements are. By using funny noises or words, you can make the motions more fun.

, If you push your kids too hard, they may not see yoga as fun. Try to be patient and keep yoga sessions short. Make sure that your lesson is suited to your kids’ individual needs. For example, if you know that your child has a short attention span, then try doing one or two yoga poses at a time throughout the course of the day.


Encourage kids in their posture and don’t scold them for not doing a pose the right way. Just keep encouraging your kids and modeling good posture for them.
Try to keep position holds on the shorter end. This will keep kids from getting bored., Everyone needs support, especially kids. When you praise your kids’ efforts, you will motivate them to keep doing yoga. Kids like to hear that their teachers approve, so make sure to let them know they're doing a good job.Try saying something like, “You are so flexible!” Or, “Your downward dog pose is fantastic!”

Place your alarm away from you.",How to Develop a Morning Routine (Teens)," Everyone’s morning routine will be different and personal. A lot depends on what you would like to accomplish in the morning.


Ask yourself questions. Do you want to shower in the morning or at night? If you’re going to shower in the morning, will you need to blow dry your hair?
Do you want to put on a full face of make up in the mornings or just wash your face and go?;
, Think you are doing yourself good by not eating breakfast, then you are wrong. It helps prevent a crash later on in the afternoon.


Know how long your breakfasts take. Would you rather make a big breakfast of eggs and bacon or have a bowl of cereal?
Give yourself a generous amount of time so that you won’t have to rush through breakfast and in that generous time, eat a generous amount of food like yogurt, egg, bacon, bread, fruits or any other home-made snacks. Don’t forget to add an extra three minutes to brush your teeth afterwards.

, It can be nice to schedule in a few minutes to read a chapter in a book, check text messages, or scroll through Instagram. Break is important as it helps process the things learned, tried and done after a period of time.


This can help you ease into your day, and scheduling it into your routine will ensure that you don’t fall behind when getting ready.
Make sure you do this out of bed. Sit at your desk or kitchen table, so you don’t risk falling back asleep without an alarm to wake you up.

, An important part of the routine is the order that you complete the steps. Think about what will be easiest and most efficient for you personally. Make a timetable and stick to it, no matter what. It will keep things more organized and smooth.


For example, put on your outfit for the day before you eat breakfast. That way you’ll already feel like you’ve made progress getting ready, and you won’t feel rushed while eating.
Make your leisure time the ending of your routine. This will help motivate you and give you something to look forward to.

, Consider what time your school starts and how long it takes you to get there.


Think about all the steps you’ve decided to try to complete each morning, and estimate the time each will take. It can help to jot this down as you think through it. Subtract the total from the time you need to leave your house.
Add in a few extra minutes to just wake up.

, Setting your alarm as soon as you decide upon your new routine will help you to stick to it.


Of course, don’t set your alarm too late. However, also make sure you’re not setting your alarm too early just to give yourself an excuse to hit the snooze button.
You should set your alarm for the time that you plan on getting out of bed based on how long your routine will take., Once you’ve determined the steps in your morning routine, write them down in a list. Make the list not just in the order of the steps but include accompanying times and other notes or remainders if you want.


For example, your list might tell you to take a shower at 6:00 and eat breakfast at 6:30.
Writing down your routine makes it concrete. Write down everything. Even though you’ve brushed your teeth your whole life, write it down so you can get used to it within your new routine.
Put the list somewhere that you can see it like on your bathroom mirror. This will help you get comfortable with your routine until it becomes a habit.

, As tempting as it may be sometimes, try to do your routine every day, even if you’re not going to school.


On the weekends, try to wake up at the same time as you would on a school day. This will help your body create a sleep pattern and sync its circadian rhythms. It will also ensure that your usual routine is not messed up. Sleep and wake up according to your routine.
You might not do your routine the same way. For example, you might stay in your pajamas and watch TV, but even just waking up at a similar time can help you build the routine.

, If your alarm allows it, don’t reset it every night before you go to sleep, as this might tempt you to make that time a little later or turn it off on a Saturday. Set it so that it automatically goes off at the same time each day.

, Negative self-talk is one of the main things that make it so difficult to get out of bed in the morning. Replace thoughts like “I’m so tired” with a pre-decided upon mantra like “I’m excited for the day.” Even when it sounds silly, it will help you change your thought pattern and make you think positive. Remember, optimism is the key to organization of your mornings.

,


Making your bed can give you a small sense of accomplishment in the morning and make your environment feel more organized and soothing as sometimes cluttered spaces can cause distraction or overwhelm you.

, When you wake up, let the sunlight stream in. This will help signal to your body that it’s time to wake up.

, If you get yourself excited for your morning routine, you’ll be more likely to stick with it.


Buy a breakfast treat. Get yourself a doughnut, some crusty sourdough bread, a special juice, or nice coffee.
Make a playlist. Create your own morning playlist full of songs that you love. Rock or pop tunes to help you wake up in the morning and slow, steady tunes to help sleep at night but mostly the choice is yours. Experiment around until you find what's best for you.
Allow yourself some time to watch a TV show, or work it into your existing routine. You could watch Netflix while putting on your make up.

, When you create a new routine, you’re going to need for it to be flexible. Commit to trying it exactly as you write it down for a month. At the end of the month, reevaluate and change the steps that haven’t been working and start over and try again until you succeed.

, No, bedtimes aren’t just for little kids. Great morning routines begin with your sleep schedule. Going to bed at a regular time can help you find a healthy sleep pattern.As a teenager, your natural circadian rhythm shifts. A healthy bedtime is around 10 or 11 at night.Try to schedule your homework around your extra curricular activities during the week so you aren’t struggling to finish it at the last minute each night.

, Staring at the blue light from devices like your phone or laptop screen before you go to bed can disrupt your sleep as it sends a message to the brain that it is still day. If you want to use the devices lower their brightness to the minimum level.Try to turn your devices off at least an hour before you go to bed. Read a book to wind down, instead.
If you just can’t give up using your technology before bed, try a free application like fl.ux, which is designed to soften the light from your screen and adjusts automatically according to the time of day.,

, Eating well can help you feel more rested. Especially try to eat snacks before bed that will help you sleep rather than hinder the process but watch out some foods aren't good to eat before sleep at night:


Carbohydrates are heavy foods, like a bowl of healthy cereal, are great before bed because they can increase the level of tryptophan in your blood, which induces sleep. Avoid too much protein right before sleep, as it’s harder for your body to digest., Cleaning up your room and bathroom can help you relax and go to sleep more easily. In the morning, your clean environment will make you feel more prepared for the day ahead.

, Even if it’s your phone, plug it in to charge on the opposite side of your room that your bed is on. Force yourself to get up to turn it off and avoid the dangers of the snooze button or if you have trouble waking up just put your phone in a glass cup or mug of any material to amplify the sound than its usual volume.

Acknowledge your emotions.,
Avoid thinking negatively.,
Support your siblings and let them support you too.,
Try as much as possible to get along with the family.,
Ask questions to understand the routines of the home.,
Use your parents for support.,
Understand that this won't be forever.,
Know that this doesn't limit you.",How to Deal With Living in Foster Care," You may have a lot of different feelings about foster care - you might be scared, you might be upset, or you might be okay with the situation. However you're feeling, it's important to acknowledge those emotions and let yourself feel them rather than trying to bury them or hide them. Know that your emotions are completely valid, and letting them out know will help you move on later.


If needed, try to find someone you can talk to about your feelings. It could be a sibling, an adult you trust, or a mental health professional. Don't be afraid to seek out professional help if you feel like your emotions are out of control, or if you feel anxious or depressed.;
, First of all, don't think negatively about yourself - you aren't a bad person and you've done nothing wrong. Never think that the situation is your fault, because it's not. Don't beat yourself up thinking that you need to change or do something more. Know that being a foster child isn't a bad thing, and doesn't make you a bad person. Secondly, avoid coming into the situation with any negative preconceived notions about your foster family. Not all foster families are bad - many are loving, caring people that want to make you feel at home, and have undergone a lengthy application and training process to be able to foster you. Try to think positively about yourself and to go into the situation with an open mind.

, If you have a sibling with you, try to lean on and support each other. This may be a scary time for both of you, and you could each be feeling differently about the situation, but remember that you're both in this together.


If you have a younger sibling, comfort them and let them know you're always there for them. If they're upset, let them cry on your shoulder. It's your job to be their supporter, and to be brave for them and for yourself.
If you have an older sibling, allow them to support you, but remember to support them as well. They might be hurting too, so it's important for you to be strong and comfort them if necessary.

, You may not like your foster family at first, but try to give them a chance. It may be awkward and uncomfortable at the beginning, but things will likely improve once you get to know each other better. Remember that many foster families are good people that truly want to welcome you into their family, so allow them to do that. You can help smooth the transition into their home by being willing to compromise from time to time, by going in with an open mind, and by helping out around the house and doing the chores they assign you. Understand that for now, these people are your family, and even if they're not perfect, it's important to try to get along with them.

, Being a foster child involves lots of changes which you have to learn to deal with, and many of these changes involve new household routines. Your foster family may do things differently than your family did, and it may be hard to adjust to and remember these routines. If you're unsure of something, don't be afraid to ask your foster parents to clarify. Your foster parents should understand that it may take a while for you to get used to the new routines, and should be willing to explain anything you forgot or don't understand.

, If you're allowed to have visitations with your parents, you can use this time to talk to your parents about your experience and about how you feel. You don't necessarily have to talk about your foster family if you don't want to, but sometimes it can be helpful to talk to your parents about the situation. Even if you're adjusting well to foster care, it can be comforting to be able to talk to your parents about things that are going on in your life.

, Remember that foster care is intended to be temporary, so it's highly unlikely that you'll be spending years with your foster family. About half of foster kids are eventually reunited with their parents, while others go on to be adopted by other families. Even if you don't enjoy being in foster care, take comfort in knowing that your situation is temporary and you won't be here forever.

, Sometimes living in foster care can feel like a setback, but it's important not to let this situation limit you. Being a foster child doesn't mean that you can't do great things in life - many foster children have gone on to live happy lives with families that care about them, and have fulfilling careers as well. You may be facing some challenges as a foster child, but these challenges may help you grow as a person and give you the resilience to accomplish great things in your life.

Don't attempt to try to train any bird unless you have been on a course and have access to a mentor.,
Before doing anything, look into the falconry laws in your area.,
Make sure you read every book you can, and buy all the equipment you need, before you get your bird.,
Find a sponsor (mentor) to guide you.,
As an apprentice falconer in the United States, you only have the options of a Red-Tailed Hawk or an American Kestrel for a bird (unless state laws state otherwise).,
Keep the bird in the house during its first weeks with you.,
First, teach the falcon to hop or fly to the glove on your fist.,
When adding the lure to your training, begin with letting the bird eat off of it so that this too will become a recognised source of food.,
Once you feel confident that the Falcon is keen to the lure, you can begin swinging it.,
Man the falcon to the hood early and even after the hooding goes well, continue to do hood exercises every day.,
Keep everything clean and neat - all the time.",How to Train Your First Falcon," Too many birds are lost and killed by inexperience. You also must have a license to do falconry. In the United States, you must have state and federal permits along with a hunting license. DO NOT capture a falcon and fly it until you have obtained your falconry license.;
, If you live in the USA, contact the state fish and game department and request a Falconry Packet.

, Telemetry is an absolute must - you only lose your bird once. For a complete list of items you may need for trapping click here

, This sponsor must already have done falconry for at least two years, and be willing to take the time and have patience to teach you.

, It is advisable to start with a Red-Tailed, as they are more forgiving when it comes to mistakes. If you are not an apprentice, but a general, consider a Harris hawk for your first bird, as they are intelligent and capable of catching game. A female Lanner makes an ideal first falcon. Do not get a Peregrine falcon, or a Gyrfalcon hybrid as a first bird, any more than you'd buy a Porsche as your first car.

, The more it sees of the family, the more 'manned' it will become. The bird should be well manned before the real training starts. To learn more about manning see http://www.themodernapprentice.com/training.htm

, Do this by placing tidbits of food between your fingers and whistling or using a designated signal noise. The Falcon will soon recognise your glove as a food source and will begin to expect food when they hear your signal noise. Before moving on to the lure, try increasing the distance between you and the bird when asking them to come to the glove.

, Your first goal is to get the Falcon to make a short flight to the lure. In the beginning, do not swing the lure, but place it food side up to attract the bird. Do not forget you use your signal noise as this will reinforce the idea that food is only a short distance away. If the bird won't come immediately, then put the lure away for a few minutes. The bird should wait for you; you must never wait for the bird. It will try to train you. You must actually train it.

, When flying to the lure, let the bird catch it quickly sometimes. That way, it will always try hard and think it has a chance. If it catches it, let it have it. A bored bird is a lost bird.

, There's no excuse for keeping a bird hooded if it's not traveling or in close, enforced company with other people's birds.

, Dirt breeds disease and is a disgrace to the sport. A bird living in an unclean environment is also much more susceptible to infections, parasites and diseases than one kept in a clean living space.


Feed a good quality, varied diet. Many falconers use quail as the main food source for their birds, but make sure to add variety with foods such as mice, day old chicks (DOCs), etc...

Never let anyone who's not a falconer care for your bird, even for a day.

, Choose a charity with your parents and then hold a bake sale outside your house to raise money for it. If you think you are a terrible cook, substitute lemonade.

, This may seem ridiculous and simple, but it is also a kind act. When you walk out of a store, look for someone who needs help with their groceries. This could be an older person or a mom with kids. Politely carry the bags to their car(make sure an adult you know is supervising). And don't worry if they don't take you up on it. It's the offer that counts.

, Find out about charitable activities at your school, church, or any organization you belong to, and join up. You will do good deeds and make new friends!

Create a safe and comfortable environment.,
Prepare a special treat as a reward for your bird.,
Familiarize the bird with your hand.,
Offer your hand to the bird.,
Slowly and gently push your finger against the bird's lower chest, right above his legs.,
Encourage the bird to “step up.” Use the bird’s name when you say “step up,” and be generous with praise.,
Repeat the training with the other hand.,
Stick train your bird.,
Be persistent, but patient.",How to Train a Bird to Step on Your Finger," Birds are creatures of habit, and have a short attention span, so short, consistent training sessions are the best approach., Birds have short attention spans, so it is important to create a space with few distractions.


Confident or acclimatized birds may not require a cage for training. If the bird is nervous or unaccustomed to your home, keeping the bird in the cage as you train it may be necessary., Close all doors and windows, turn off ceiling fans and other devices that may harm the bird, and keep other animals out of the room.


Make sure that you are calm and gentle when training your bird; if you are frustrated, angry or nervous the bird will likely become agitated., As you calm the bird, accustom it to your hand, and teach it the step-up command, it is important to reward the bird’s accomplishments. Rewards (such as fruit and nuts) should be reserved specifically for teaching your bird to step-up and be a food the bird does not usually eat.


Smaller, quickly edible rewards can be given to your bird to calm and encourage it as you teach the command.
Saying soothing words and being generous in praise will calm and encourage your bird., Slowly place your hand in the cage (but not too close), until the bird is comfortable. Shy or nervous birds may require several sessions before they are comfortable with your hand. Be persistent, and always make sure to move slowly to avoid startling the bird.


Stand just above the bird’s eye level in order to establish dominance. Standing too tall can frighten the bird, and crouching too low may display submission on your part. , Make sure to move your hand slowly, and to hold your hand steady and with confidence. Birds will become nervous if their handler is nervous, and will become reluctant or scared to step onto your finger if your hand wobbles or you drop the bird during these early sessions., Apply gentle pressure so that the bird is put slightly off balance. The bird should lift a leg when it feels off-balance. When this occurs, place your finger under its foot and lift gently – the bird should step up on to your finger or hand.


If the bird is nervous or bites, you may have to begin training with a wood dowel until it becomes more comfortable.
A bird may use its beak to steady itself, or even bite your finger or hand. If this occurs do not suddenly pull away or show fear, as the bird may be frightened or read this as a sign of submission. , Many birds, particularly if they are young, will step onto your finger with a little encouragement, as a finger resembles a perch.


When your bird steps-up, praise it and give it a special treat you prepared before beginning. Even if the bird only raises one foot to your hand you should praise and reward it.
With repetition and encouragement the bird will learn to associate the command ""step up"" with perching on your hand or arm., Following the same steps, accustom the bird to your weaker hand. Animals of habit, birds may refuse to perch on your opposite hand unless you take the time to train them during this initial period.As your bird becomes comfortable, you can begin taking it out of the cage before repeating the step-up training., If your bird is shy or nervous and refuses to step on to your finger or hand, use a wooden dowel instead.


Once the bird steps up on to the dowel, move on to the ""laddering"" technique. Place your finger beside and slightly higher than the perched bird and encourage it to move to the new perch.
Accompany each step with the ""step up"" command, and be generous with praise when the bird follows your command.
Have the bird continue moving from dowel to finger and finger to dowel until the training session is over., Birds have unique temperaments and may be shy or nervous, and thus it is important to exercise patience as you train your bird every day.


Make a routine of the training sessions. Your bird will learn to anticipate your training sessions together.
Reward even small amounts of progress with praise and treats. Encouragement is the best way to make your bird comfortable and teach it to follow your commands."

Check your finch types.,
Select the number of finches you want to keep in the same space.,
Inventory the amount of space you have for multiple cages.",How to Keep Multiple Finches1," Not all finches get along, so it’s important to look at what types of finches you want to keep. Check a compatibility guide or consult with your local avian vet to see if your finch species are known for their patterns of aggression.A single pair of zebra finches, for example, will get along well, but will fight with a second pair or with finches of another species. If you want to keep two pairs, you would likely need multiple cages. Zebra finches can be kept in larger colonies, though, provided you have the space.
Likewise, blue-faced parrot finches, cordon bleu finches, and green singing finches may do well in a single pair, but should not be mixed with other birds, including other finches of the same species.;
, The more finches you have in a single cage or aviary, the more space they will need. A single pair of finches needs a cage that is at least 24” long x 18” high x 18” wide (61 x 46 x 46 cm). This needs to be doubled for a second pair of finches.If you are going to keep a large aviary, talk with the manufacturer as well as your avian vet about how many finches they recommend for housing of that size.

, If you are keeping multiple finch cages, remember that a cage of same-sex finches should not be kept in the same room as another cage of finches of the opposite sex. Make sure you have room to keep multiple finch cages spread out throughout your house to avoid territorial aggression.If finches can hear the song of a finch of the opposite sex, they may fight with their cage mates to try to establish dominance.

To clean your bird bath, start by removing all the water and discarding it. You will need to replace it with new water when you're done., You will need a small scrub brush to clean out your bird bath. In most cases, it is unnecessary to use cleaner. However, if your birdbath is very soiled or dirty, use a mild detergent.Clean the bottom of the bird bath and the sides, scrubbing off any dirt, debris, or visible algae.

, It's best to use a hose to rinse off your birdbath, especially if you used detergent. Hose down the inside of your bird bath until all soap residue is gone.It is very important to be thorough about rinsing a bird bath. Birds are very vulnerable to detergents and it can be harmful for birds if there's detergent left in the bird bath.

, Once you're done, you can refill your birdbath. Use fresh, clean water to refill the bath."

Keep the bird bath in shade.,
Change the water daily.,
Use running water, if possible.",How to Keep Algae from Growing in Bird Bath3," Algae spores transfer to your birdbath from objects that fall out of nearby trees and will grow at a faster rate when exposed to direct sunlight. To prevent the build up of algae, it's best to store your bird bath in a shaded area of your hard.You should also keep the bird bath away from shrubs and bird feeders to prevent contamination.

, This will help keep the water fresh and prevent algae growth from spreading within the birdbath. If you have the time to do so, add fresh water every day. Remove any visible algae when changing water in your birdbath., Pumps, drippers, and heaters that run on solar power or electric batteries are a good idea for a birdbath. Running water is less likely to become contaminated with algae. If your birdbath is not already equipped with such a device, purchase one at a local hardware store and follow package instructions for set up."

Care for your finches individually.",How to Keep Multiple Finches2," Finches like to nest, but they are generally territorial and will fight and a same-sex pair or multiple pairs of finches will often fight over who controls the nest. Unless you are housing a mixed-sex pair of finches that you want to breed, it is best to remove all nests from your finches’ home., Finches are territorial, and too few perches or perches that are too close together could cause fighting. Install perches throughout the cage on different walls and at different heights. Ideally, you want at least one more perch than you have finches., If you plan on keeping multiple finches in the same cage or aviary, try to bring them all into the habitat at the same time. Introducing finches into an already-established social group could cause your current finches to pick on the new ones.If you are getting your finches from different breeders or over a period of time, keep them in separate cages until you have all of the finches you plan on keeping together.

, Make sure that you have a food dish or bird feeder that can accommodate more than one bird. This may mean buying multiple dishes, or getting a feeder built for multiple birds.

If you are keeping a larger aviary, you may be able to place hanging feeders and waterers in the habitat without causing too much obstruction.

, Finches are smart and active birds, and toys are an important part of keeping them both physically and mentally healthy. Make sure you have at least as many toys as you do finches in your cage.Even with ample toys, you should monitor your finches closely for fighting, as they may become possessive of their favorites.

, Finches love natural light, but they also need shade to keep them from getting overheated. Make sure you provide your finches with enough sunlight so that they don’t have to compete, and enough shaded area so that they can all escape the heat when necessary., While your finches may live in pairs or in a colony, they will still need individual care. If your finches are in a cage, they will each need time out to fly and stretch their wings every day. They will also need individual baths every few days."
"
Split them up by their biological sex.,
Keep the cages separate.,
Keep a steady routine.",How to Keep Multiple Finches3," Mixed-sex pairs of finches sometimes breed. Unless you are actively looking to keep breeding pairs, the best way to prevent this is to keep your finches divided by their sex. Have one cage with a pair or group of female finches, and a separate cage for your male finches.Same-sex finch pairs can form strong bonds, so try to keep your finches in groups that you will be able to maintain throughout their lifetime. Don’t plan on moving them into or out of a bonded pair.
Alternatively, you can consider keeping just one sex at a time.

, Cages of just male and just female finches should never be kept in the same room, as hearing finches of the opposite sex could spark territorial fighting within the cage. Even mixed-sex pairs may come to fight, though, if they find finches in another cage more appealing. That’s why it is best to keep different cages of finches well-separated.You may try placing the cages in separate rooms, or on opposite ends of large rooms such as a living room.
Try to avoid multiple unit cages, as while the finches will be physically separated, they can still see and hear each other, which can cause fighting within a pair or group.

, Finches in the same cage will largely be on the same schedule. You may need to work a little harder to keep finches in different cages on similar schedules. Make a routine, and make sure you do it for all your finches cages at as close to the same time as possible.If, for example, you decide that one cage will get fly time at 1pm, make sure you have time immediately after for your other cage to fly, as well. Otherwise, your finches may get noisy and rowdy.

Close off any doors to the room that lead to another area of the house.,
Remove any household pets (especially cats and dogs) from the room.,
Create a single light source near the exit.,
Remain calm.,
Create a clear exit for the bird.,
Leave it alone.,
Coax it out.,
Do not touch or harm the bird.,
Call a professional.,
Inspect your home for possible points of entry.,
Stop a potential nesting crisis in your home.,
Contact a professional for help in deterring birds.",How to Chase a Bird out of an Enclosed Porch or a House," When the bird sees you enter the space, it will be tempted to move away as quickly as it can, even if that means flying deeper into your home. Close all doors to the room so the bird cannot fly into all corners of your house. It will also be easier for the bird to find an exit once it realizes it can't leave that particular room..


If the bird is in a room that does not have a clear exit, then hold up a large sheet with both arms and attempt to herd the bird into a better room of the house. Do not touch the bird with a broom or any other long-handled object.;
, This will certainly disappoint your cat, but having additional animals in the room will only increase the bird's level of panic. You also don't want to risk the spread of disease to your household pet should they attack the bird.

, Close all window curtains and turn off all lights except where you want the bird to exit (such as an open door or window). The bird will naturally avoid darkened spaces and will treat the light near the exit as a beacon to guide it out., The bird might seem very intimidating to you; if it is panicked and beating its wings while flying in an erratic fashion, you might be tempted to yell, scream or immediately strike it. But this will only increase the bird's fear and potential damage to your home. Remember that you are in your natural habitat whereas the bird is scared and disoriented. Remain calm while you close off additional lights and entrances to the room.

, Depending on the room the bird is trapped in, you should select the easiest, largest exit available for the bird. This might be the largest window or, ideally, a door that leads to the outside. It will easiest if you just select one clear exit so the bird will notice it from the light.

, Once you have sealed off the doors to the room, turned off additional lights, and have clearly opened a door or window so it can exit, leave it alone. There is a good chance the bird will eventually fly out on its own. Birds are very sensitive creatures and they can die due to complications from stress; the least traumatic solution for the bird is to let it attempt to leave on its own., If the bird has not left on its own, you can attempt to 'herd' it toward the exit. Take a large sheet and hold it up with both hands; slowly walk behind the bird, steering it toward the exit so it can fly outside.

, Some sources suggest that you should throw a towel or sheet on top of the bird to ground it and then pick it up and manually remove it from your home. This method, however, should be avoided except as an absolute last resort, as this could easily injure the bird, even if we can't tell that it is hurt.Birds are biologically designed to be sensitive to pressure; they can feel very subtle changes in air pressure, so being engulfed by a large towel or sheet can be incredibly painful to them. Their bones are also very fragile so even a gentle human touch could cause significant injury to the bird Do not use a broom or other object to hit the bird; this will only injure the bird and further prevent it from flying back outside.

, If you have tried all of these steps and still cannot successfully remove the bird, then you should call a local professional who works in bird removal. They will have a better sense of the bird's behaviors and the best way to remove it safely from your home.

, Sometimes, a bird will simply fly into your home through an open door or window by mistake; there will be very little you can do to prevent this from happening. But you should still consider adding sturdier screens onto your windows and avoid keeping large entrance ways (like sliding glass doors) open to the outside.

, When a bird randomly flies into your home, you can view that as just a single, strange incident; but having a nest of pigeons or other birds move into your attic is another crisis that requires a very different approach. Birds that like to nest in homes tend to prefer areas such as chimneys, gutters, eaves, and laundry vents; you should make sure that these areas are properly sealed so they cannot enter your home.If you have a woodpecker who continues to bore into the side of your house, hang a shiny object -- like an old CD or DVD -- near the site; this will deter the bird from remaining in that spot. Wind chimes are also helpful in discouraging woodpeckers., Many wildlife removal experts specialize in using objects that will prevent birds from nesting on or in your home, such as bird spikes, avian sound machines, tape, glass and other materials. If you sense that birds could become a problem for your home, go ahead and contact a professional to help you prevent this from happening.

Weigh your bird daily.,
Check its droppings.,
Pay attention to how much food your bird eats.",How to Know if Your Bird Is Sick1," Weigh your bird at the same time every day so that its weight will fluctuate less due to meal times. Declining weight is a significant sign of illness. If your bird’s weight drops by 10% or more, you should immediately take your pet to the doctor.While this might seem like too much work, changes in weight are one of the earliest signs of illness, so monitoring weight is often the only way to effectively catch health problems in time for intervention.
Alternatively, feel your bird’s breast bone. Its chest should be well-rounded and muscular. If you can feel the bone (the keel), your bird has lost too much weight and should be taken to the doctor immediately.;
, Put plain paper on the bottom of the cage to make it easier to see and monitor droppings. Watch droppings for any change in frequency, color, texture, or quantity. Take your bird to the veterinarian if any change in the nature of your bird’s droppings persists for 12 hours or more.


Feces naturally varies somewhat in color. However, you should watch for bright red, bright black, and bright green feces.
Undigested food in the droppings or hard feces can be a sign of illness. Diarrhea is a sign of bacterial and fungal infections.
The bird’s feces should have white parts called urates. If the white part is missing from the feces you should take your bird to the vet immediately.
Unusually large amounts of urine can indicate an issue with digestion. Be mindful if this continues for an extended period of time.It is also a bad sign when feces is stuck to the tail feathers after your bird goes to the bathroom.Matting of the feathers in the area suggestions diarrhea., If your bird begins to eat less, this could indicate a health issue. Monitor how much food you give you bird and how much is left after a feeding.A sick bird might try to disguise its lack of appetite by picking up food, only to drop it on the floor of the cage. Be mindful of scattered food.Be especially mindful if your bird isn’t eating its favorite food. If you believe that it is sick, test its health by feeding it a favorite treat. See how it responds."

Look for unhealthy feathers.,
Watch for puffed-up feathers.,
Notice its posture.,
Check its ears.,
Watch for growth in the beak.,
Be attentive to normal signs of illness.",How to Know if Your Bird Is Sick2," A bird’s feathers should look bright and colorful. Young birds might exhibit some issues with feather care. But mature birds should not have feathers that are torn, misshapen, or discolored. If feathers are torn up, exposing the skin underneath where it is normally hidden, your bird might well have an infection.It is common for the feathers of a sick bird to look duller in color than they otherwise would., Birds will often puff up their feathers to look bigger when they are cold or asleep. This behavior is normal. However, if your bird has its feathers puffed up through much of the day, something might be wrong. If it is sick, it might also bob its tail up and down as it puffs up its feathers.This could be a sign of nearly anything, birds will puff up their feathers in response to most varieties of illness. Birds puff up their feathers because they are cold. This is likely because their energy is being diverted toward fighting of illness or stress. Puffed-up feathers then, are something like the bird equivalent of a fever. They are the first sign of any illness in your flying friend., A sick bird will often lean over, instead of sitting up. A healthy bird might not sit up all the way, but will at least sit up partially. Often a bird that is having difficulty sitting up because of poor health with also puff up its feathers., The ears of a healthy bird should not be red or swollen. They should also not produce any liquid discharges or show signs of blockage.A bird's ears are generally not very easily visible, but can be found under its feathers on either side of its head.
These symptoms can be a sign of an ear infection, like Otitis externa, A beak that grows rapidly is indicative of some sort of metabolic problem. Similarly, it is an issue if the beak is changing shape or becoming asymmetrical. The tissue inside the beak should have a light pink color., Just as with humans, sneezing and vomiting are generally signs of an underlying illness. Take your bird to the vet if it exhibits these symptoms."
"
Play with your bird daily.,
Be mindful if your bird spends a lot of time at the bottom of the cage.,
Watch for changes in personality.,
Watch for increased sleepiness.,
Listen to your bird.",How to Know if Your Bird Is Sick3," Birds are social animals that enjoy time outside. Furthermore, one important sign of illness is lethargy. To monitor whether your bird is sick, you need to see how it responds to physical activity. If you bird seems lethargic or does not respond to stimuli, there might be an underlying issue.When you do play with your bird, make sure that it does not breath heavily afterward. Breathing should appear effortless. It should not be breathing through an open mouth, or exhibit tail bobbing when it inhales.Sometimes your bird will be lethargic because it has not gotten enough rest. If you see that it gets sleep and is still tired afterward, you should be concerned., A bird that sits on the bottom of the cage might have balance issues. Watch to see if it seems to mostly be leaning on one of its legs to the exclusion of the other.These can be signs of injury., Any change in personality could reflect an underlying issue. Watch to see if an otherwise friendly bird no longer wants to socialize, if an active bird seems lethargic, or if a calm bird seems agitated.It is particularly common for a sick bird to become more aggressive with other birds., One sign of dangerous lethargy is increased sleepiness. Be mindful if your bird is sleeping at unusual hours or has its eyes partially closed.How much and when a bird sleeps can vary significantly even within a species. Pet parrots, for example, have very different schedules from one household to another. However, schedules should be consistent. If your bird has begun sleeping during a time of day in which it is normally awake, that is a cause for concern., A bird that is sick will be less likely to vocalize or sing than a bird that is healthy. If your bird isn’t as talkative as normal, be attentive to its other behavior, because something might be wrong.It is also possible that your bird’s voice might begin to sound different if it is sick."

Types of Plants.,
Placement of Plants.,
Planting.",How to Plant Bushes That Attract Birds," This is an important part of picking out the bushes and plants. Native species are much more likely to survive, because they have gotten used to extreme conditions. They are also ones that would not be foreign to the birds.;
, Having food for the birds is essential. Berries are a great natural way to supply them with food. They will eat the berries, and will always have a source of food nearby.

, A variety of sizes is a great way to create a beautiful environment. The birds will probably nest in the bigger bushes. So, if you want even more birds, you might get many big and full bushes. If you are attracting birds near your house, you may want to put the smaller plants toward your home.

, When you are buying plants, buy different kinds. You should always have at least one with thorns. Birds are more apt to nest in a thorny plant. You can also buy different types of trees, such as evergreens. Evergreens will act as a shelter for the birds in difficult conditions.

, When you plant the chosen plants, think about the best places to put each of them. You might want to plant several of one species next to each other. Planting evergreens close together is a good idea, because it will provide more shelter. Also, think about what you think would look nice. You will like this attraction more if it looks good to you.

, Remember to plant each species of plant the way it is supposed to be planted. If you are given instructions by an expert, follow them. Be sure not to plant them too high or deep in the ground. If you plant a species the incorrect way, it may die.

Make your bird comfortable during transit.,
Interact with the vet to promote your bird's safety and comfort.,
Stay calm throughout the process.",How to Help Your Pet Bird Through a Vet Visit,"


Take a warm travel cage and put towels on the bottom.
Talk to your pet in soothing voices, and explain what is going on. It may seem silly, but birds are intelligent creatures. Even if your companion doesn't understand what you're saying, it will recognize and find comfort in your voice.
Make sure your bird can see what is going on at all times, so it isn't afraid of predators, and make sure the bird is able to see you at all times. If the bird sees something familiar and comforting (you, for instance), it will be less likely to panic. Stroke your bird often and never leave its side.;
,


This shows the bird that this is a nice person (because you are interacting with him/her), and it helps you gain more information about what is going on. How can you help your pet if you are not informed? Knowledge is key. If you know what is happening, it will put you at ease, and your bird will sense that emotion and be more comfortable, too.
You can even explain to your pet what is happening, if it makes you feel better. Talking about the situation aloud will also help you remember it for future reference.

,


If the vet has to preform something on your bird that the bird has not been exposed to before, it will most likely panic and thrash, which may alarm you. Stay calm.
Remember that a bird is a prey animal, and its first instinct is to get away from the cause of the panic.
After the procedure is over, ask if you can hold your pet bird. Holding, stroking, and interacting with your pet will put it at ease and tell it that everything is okay now. Speak calmly to your pet in soothing tones, and stroke it in a way that is familiar.

Determine how much time you can put into daily care.,
Calculate your budget.,
Inspect your living space to see if it is large enough.,
Consider the noise level.",How to Know if a Cockatiel Is Right for You1," Cockatiels do not need as much upkeep as other pets, but they are very social. Be aware of the daily needs of a cockatiel so you can understand how they will fit into your life.The cockatiel will need food and fresh water at least once a day.
You will need to clean the food and water bowl at least once a day. You will need to wash and disinfect the cage at least once a week.
Cockatiels need at least an hour of free flight around your home a day. You should be able to supervise them during these exercise periods.
You may need to have two or three ten minute training sessions a day to help tame your cockatiel.;
, Caring for an exotic bird like a cockatiel can get pricy. Before you buy a cockatiel, make sure that you afford a cage, toys, food, and veterinary care.You may spend between $250 to $650 on a cage. You will also have to factor in the cost of toys, perches, and food bowls.
A veterinary visit for a bird can cost between $50 and $200. Tests and bloodwork may cost more.The cockatiel itself may cost between $40 and $130., Cockatiels like plenty of room to roam. They will need a large metal cage that is at least 36 inches (91 cm) long, 18 inches (46 cm) wide, and 24 inches (61 cm) high. Before you buy a cockatiel, measure a space in your home where you can put this cage.Cockatiels are very social, so you should find an area where there is plenty of activity. For example, a living room is a great place to put the cage.Cockatiels like to spend time outside of the cage. When they roam around your home, make sure that windows are shut, ceiling fans are turned off, and electrical wires are not exposed.Do not get a wooden cage because the cockatiel may chew the bars.

, Cockatiels are generally quiet birds, but they still like to sing and talk. If you are out of the room, the cockatiel may try to loudly call to you. If you prefer a quiet home, a cockatiel may not be the right pet for you.While cockatiels can learn to talk, most will prefer to whistle instead. If you want a talking bird, look into a different type of parrot.

There are many types of birds, and not all birds react to toxins and foreign substances in the same way. Ask the avian specialist how to protect your pet bird. For example, if you have a parrot, ask the avian specialist, “How can I protect my parrot when spraying my house for fleas?”If you have a cockatoo, ask the avian specialist, “How can I protect my cockatoo when spraying my house for fleas?”
Listen carefully to the avian specialist. Take notes using a pen and paper.
Put your newfound knowledge about how to protect your pet birds when spraying for fleas into action.
Ask your vet to recommend an avian specialist.;
, When spraying your house for fleas, the flea spray product will have a set of instructions on its label. This label is typically on the side of the product spray bottle. Read this label for information about how to protect pet birds when spraying your house for fleas.For instance, your flea spray bottle might read, “Before spraying, vacuum your entire house.” In this case, you should vacuum your entire home before using the flea spray.
If the directions say, “Apply a light, even layer of flea spray to your carpet,” apply a light, even layer of flea spray to the carpet and avoid applying a heavy layer of flea spray.

, If the weather is nice, move your pet bird to the garage. If it is not so nice, move the bird to a neighbor’s residence. Once your pet bird arrives in its temporary residence, you can remove the cover from the bird cage.If some areas of your house are free of fleas, you could remove your pet bird to the untreated area. For instance, if you have fleas downstairs but not upstairs, you might remove the pet bird to the upstairs area. If you choose to keep your pet bird in an unaffected room in the residence, keep the window open, door closed, and central air and heat off.
Keep your pet birds out of the residence until the flea spray is completely dry. Open your windows so the spray ventilates completely.
Typically, you and your family – including your pet birds – will need to be out of the house for about three hours until the spray settles and dissipates., If your pet birds live in bird cages, you should remove the cages along with the birds. Remove all bird toys, water dishes, and food bowls, too.Replace them in the pet bird’s cage while it is staying in its temporary location outside your residence.Seal your bird’s food bag and place it in a cabinet.
If you later realize that you forgot to remove your bird’s water bowl or a similar bird-related item, wash it thoroughly before replacing it in your pet bird’s cage.

Determine if you can commit to twenty years of ownership.,
Learn to live with a cockatiel’s picky eating habits.,
Think about whether you can deal with night frights.,
Recognize that cockatiels are messy birds.,
Consider what your family wants.",How to Know if a Cockatiel Is Right for You2," The average lifespan of a cockatiel is around fifteen to twenty-five years. If you are unsure about caring for a bird for that long, you may want to choose a shorter lived variety of bird., Cockatiels need a varied diet that includes pellets, vegetables like carrots, leafy greens such as dandelion leaves and watercress, and fruit such as apples and bananas. Cockatiels are known as picky eaters, so you may spend some time finding the perfect diet for them.If you do decide to get a cockatiel, try to feed them the same diet as they had at the store or breeder for the first few weeks. This will help them adjust to their new home., Cockatiels tend to get night frights. These are episodes where the bird is startled awake at night. The cockatiel may panic by thrashing against the bars of the cage or screaming. Carefully consider if this will bother you at night.Usually, night frights are caused by another animal or person walking around the home. Creating a still and calm environment at night can reduce night frights.

, Like all parrots, cockatiels can create a mess when they eat. You may find food scattered over their cage, in their water bowl, and outside of their cage. Regular cleaning will help, but if you’re looking for a tidy pet, a cockatiel may not be the right choice.You can buy a cage skirt to help clean up any feed or seed that has fallen out of the cage. Simply wrap up the skirt, and dump out the food in the trash.
Cockatiels love to chew. You will need to make sure that they have plenty of chew toys so that they do not destroy items in your home., If you live with other people, consider their needs as well. Make sure that others in your household are as thrilled about owning a cockatiel as you are.Cockatiels are good with children. Just make sure to show children how to approach the bird, how to hold them on their finger, and when to leave the bird alone.
Cockatiels may make great pets for households with dog or cat allergies.

Ask if the bird is weaned.,
Handle the bird to learn if they are social.,
Examine their body to determine if they are healthy.,
Take the bird to an avian vet.",How to Know if a Cockatiel Is Right for You3," Some pet stores sell young birds that do not eat adult food yet. This can be a problem. An unweaned bird may beg you for food, and you may have to hand-feed them for several weeks. Before purchasing a bird, make sure that it has been fully weaned.If you’re uncertain, you can put a deposit on the bird, and ask to return in two or three weeks to pick it up. If the bird is still healthy, you can take them home.

, Cockatiels are typically very social birds. Before buying, ask to hold the cockatiel. While any bird can bite if they are surprised, an ideal cockatiel should not be afraid of you. Give the bird a few minutes to get used to you before you make any judgments.Hold out a finger, and see if the bird hops onto it. If so, they have already been tamed.
Even if they do not hop onto your finger right away, a social cockatiel will probably come up to you when you approach the cage.
If the bird hisses, backs away, or hides from you, they may have a bad temperament.

, A healthy cockatiel will have clear open eyes and smooth clean feathers. They should be alert and energetic. Give the bird a quick inspection to make sure they are generally healthy.The feathers over the body should lie flat. If the feathers are ruffled or patchy, the bird may be stressed or ill.
If the cockatiel is sitting with the feathers puffed up and the eyes half-closed, it may mean that the bird is sick.
Check the beak to make sure that there are no cracks, flakes, or crookedness.
Lift up the bird, and examine their underside. If it is wet or dirty, it may mean that the bird has diarrhea.

, Within three days of purchase, you should take your cockatiel to an avian vet for a full health exam. Birds don’t always show signs of sickness, so this visit will be important in identifying if there are any problems.An avian veterinarian is a vet that specializes in birds. You can look up a local avian vet at the Association of Avian Vet’s website.

Urates and urine are produced in the kidneys, while feces is produced in the intestinal tract. In healthy birds, dropping should contain mostly beige/white, semi-solidified feces with a small amount of liquid urine. If your bird has more liquid in their droppings, but the fecal matter appears solid, this is a condition called “polyuric” that is sometimes mistaken for diarrhea. If your bird’s beige/white feces is watery or runny, this is true diarrhea.Some causes of diarrhea in love birds include:

Bacterial infections
Viral infections
Fungal infections
Changes to diet
Non-food items lodged in the intestinal tract
Ingestion of chemicals, toxins, or spoiled food;
, If diarrhea is the source of a medical problem, often it will be accompanied by additional symptoms. Pay close attention to your bird, and look for changes in their behavior. It can be helpful to jot down a few notes about your bird’s symptoms. This kind of record can be very helpful for your vet.Some symptoms to watch for include:

Ruffled feathers
Tucking the head beneath the wing
General lethargy
Loss of appetite or refusal to eat
Vomiting
Blood in the stool (which may appear black or dark green)

, Occasional diarrhea is perfectly normal. However, if your bird’s diarrhea lasts longer than 24 hours, returns frequently, or is accompanied by additional symptoms, you should seek the advice of your vet immediately.Birds tend to hide their illnesses as long as possible. As a result, when you notice symptoms in your bird, they may already be quite ill.
It is a good idea to look for a vet before your bird becomes sick. If possible, look for an aviary specialist.

, In order for your vet to make an accurate diagnosis, they will need as much detailed history about the condition as you can provide.Be prepared to discuss:

When the diarrhea began
How often it has occurred
Any additional symptoms and how they have progressed
A detailed description of their diet and how they have been eating
Whether or not they have been exposed to other birds and when
Any other medical conditions your bird has been diagnosed with
Any medications your bird is taking
Your vet may also ask you to bring in a stool sample.

, Diarrhea in love birds can be caused by a number of different ailments, ranging from serious to benign. As such, your vet will likely need to run a series of diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your bird’s diarrhea, and determine the best course of treatment.Some tests you vet might run include:

A physical examination
A complete blood count (CBC)
A serum biochemistry panel
An endoscopy
Fecal tests
X-rays

, Once your vet has diagnosed the source of your bird’s diarrhea, they can offer you some treatment options. Be aware that diagnostic testing and treatment for your love bird may be expensive. Speak to your vet about costs and payment options before you proceed. Some treatment options for diarrhea-related conditions include:

Hospitalization to provide fluids
Antibiotic or antifungal medications
Endoscopy or surgery to remove obstructions
Medications to protect and help heal the intestinal tract

, When your bird is experiencing diarrhea, it is important to offer a mild diet and plenty of fresh water. Provide your bird with the pellets they normally eat, but do not offer fresh fruit, vegetables, or other treats until they have been diarrhea-free for 24 hours. Also, be sure they to change their water regularly.If the diarrhea seems to have subsided, you may begin offering small amounts of fresh produce.
If your bird will not drink water, contact your vet immediately.

, Clean out your bird’s cage and remove any litter from the floor. Instead of adding litter to the clean cage, place paper across the bottom. Keep an eye on this paper, and change it daily, in order to monitor the status of your bird’s droppings.

Be aware that some conditions in birds can be spread to humans (such as Psittacosis). It is a good idea to wear rubber gloves and a mask while cleaning your bird’s cage and handling the bird while it is sick., Depending on your bird’s diagnosis, your vet may prescribe antibiotic or antifungal medication for you to give your bird at home. Usually this will come in a liquid form that can be added to your bird’s water.Follow all instructions from your vet.
Even if your bird’s condition has improved, continue to give your bird the medication for as long as your vet has advised.

Give the canary dry oatmeal or cooked brown rice.,
Feed the canary poppy seeds.,
Do not feed the canary vegetables, fruits, or eggs.,
Give the canary bottled water.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Canaries1," Feed the canary one to two tablespoons of dry, uncooked oatmeal at mealtime. You can also give it one to two tablespoons of cooked brown rice. These foods can help to firm up its stool and improve its digestion., Add ½ teaspoon poppy seeds to their regular seed mix. Give the canary the seed mix at meal time. The poppy seeds should help to stop the diarrhea and ease its stomach.Make sure the seed mix contains healthy seeds like sunflower seeds and saffron seeds. Do not give the canary seed mix that has milo, red millet, or cracked corn, as these are common fillers that are not healthy for birds.

, Avoid feeding the canary lettuce and other vegetables. Skip the fruit and eggs. These foods can make their diarrhea worse. Lettuce in particular can cause diarrhea in canaries, as it has a high water content and low nutritional value., Sometimes canaries develop diarrhea due to tap water, which contains substances like chlorine that irritate their bowels. Switch the canary to bottled water to help its stomach recover. Give the canary fresh bottled water throughout the day.You can also try adding apple cider vinegar to the canary’s water to help ease its stomach. Put a few drops of apple cider vinegar in its water.

Recognizing symptoms.,
Visit your vet.,
Administer medication.,
Perform surgery.,
Diagnose and treat underlying conditions.",How to Treat Respiratory Infections in African Grey Parrots1," The most common respiratory problem experienced by African Grey parrots is called aspergillosis. This condition is caused by a common fungus, and by can be brought on by poor ventilation, poor sanitation, or an over-crowded environment.This condition can be either acute or chronic. Symptoms of aspergillosis include:

Acute aspergillosis:

Trouble breathing
Loss of appetite
Frequent drinking and/or urination
A bluish tint to the parrot's mucous membranes and skin (known as cyanosis)


Chronic aspergillosis:

Very rapid breathing
Difficulty breathing
Inability/loss of desire to exercise
Voice changes
Reluctance to speak
A clicking sound when inhaling

;
, If you notice any of these symptoms in your parrot, it is crucial for you to see your vet as soon as possible. Aspergillosis can be quite serious if not treated right away. Be prepared to tell the vet:

What symptoms you have noticed
When the symptoms began
Any other health problems your parrot may have
Any medication your parrot is taking
An accurate and detailed description of their diet
Whether or not your parrot has been in contact with other birds (and when)

, Aspergillosis is treated using a variety of antifungal medications, such as itraconazole and amphotericin B. Treatment will likely go on for a series of months, and over that time a mix of medications might be used.These medications may be administered by way of injection (by your vet) or orally at home. In some cases, they may even be applied topically.

, If the condition has caused lesions that are accessible, your vet may wish to remove them. This will involve a minor surgery. Your parrot will be placed under anesthesia, and the lesions will be carefully removed., It is possible for your bird to come down with aspergillosis as the result of a weakened immune system. Your vet may wish to test for additional underlying conditions. Such conditions will also need to be treated in order for your parrot to recover."

Keep him warm.,
Keep the cage meticulously clean.,
Make sure that the bird's food and water bowls are within easy reach.,
Reduce stress for the bird.,
Keep its perch low to reduce falling.,
Keep your bird in sunlight if possible.,
Prevent dehydration.,
As soon as your bird becomes sick, remove all food from the cage.,
If all else fails, visit your vet.",How to Care for a Sick Pet Bird at Home," Keeping your sick bird warm is essential. Unless your bird has a fever (if this applies, then it's not good to raise your bird's temperature even more, which could be lethal) you should keep your bird at a warm temperature. Remember, an overheated bird will raise its wings away from its body and may pant, and a cold bird will fluff itself up.


Try putting a heat lamp in your birds cage (these can be purchased from any pet store, and are normally used for lizards- a 40-60 watt green bulb works best, avoid white bulbs) and turn it off at night, or put a hot water bottle on the bottom of its cage, with a towel or a blanket to cover it. Whatever works best for you and your bird.;
, This prevents the spreading of germs and prevents the bird from getting sicker. Remember to clean the fruit and seed that your bird has dropped on the floor of its cage as soon as it appears.

, Your bird needs rest when it is sick and a long trek to its food and water bowls is not what it needs.

, Try not to knock its cage, put it in a new environment (except if it's unavoidable, eg. going to the vet's) or touch it too much. Do not wake it up while it's sleeping and keep the volume low if you keep it in a family room, because a sick bird needs 12 hours sleep each day.

, A bird has an increased chance of falling when its sick, and stress and possible injury is not good for your bird.

, Don't move your bird's cage to another room just to achieve this (see step 4) but sunlight can be very beneficial for your bird, particularly if it is suffering from a lack of vitamin D. Vitamin D from sunlight can lift your birds mood and help your bird recover from its illness.


Make sure that this doesn't overheat your bird and if it's not comfortable, make sure there is some shade for him to go in to.

, A symptom of dehydration is crinkly skin around the eyes. This is the biggest problem a bird can face when sick. Keep fresh, clean water nearby at all times, and sweeten it with a tiny bit of honey to encourage drinking if needed. However, you must clean the water out regularly if you do this, because bacteria grows more quickly in sweetened water.

, This includes millet sprays, seed, fruit, and dropped food at the bottom of the cage. One of the most common causes of bird illness is poor food.

, If your bird is displaying alarming symptoms or the illness is getting worse, it's best to seek a professional opinion, or it could be fatal. Your vet can also give you medicine and supplements for your bird if its not feeding well or its dehydrated.

Disinfect the cage.,
Clean water and food dishes with a soap and bleach solution.,
Clean the canary’s cage regularly.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Canaries2," Canaries with diarrhea may have intestinal issues due to a dirty cage. Take the canary out of the cage as well as any accessories like perches and swings. Vacuum the bottom of the cage to remove any stray food. Remove any droppings in the cage. Use hot soapy water to wash the entire cage.Allow the cage to air dry in the sun.
Make sure you also vacuum and wash any accessories in the cage so they are clean.

, Canaries can contract intestinal bugs due to dirty water and food dishes. To make sure the canary’s diarrhea does not get worse, remove the water and food dishes from the cage. Mix dish soap with one part bleach and nine parts water. Clean the water and food dishes well in the solution.Make sure you rinse all of the bleach solution off the dishes well with running water.
Let the water and food dishes air dry before putting them back in the cage.

, Get in the habit of cleaning the canary’s cage once a week or several times a week. Cleaning the cage, as well as the cage accessories and the dishes, will ensure the canary does not contract any intestinal bugs or digestive issues. It can prevent the canary from getting diarrhea again.

You may set up a cleaning schedule for the cage so you clean it regularly.

Ask your vet about antibiotics.,
Talk to the vet about electrolyte solutions.,
Have the vet examine the canary for intestinal issues.",How to Treat Diarrhea in Canaries3," Your vet can recommend oral antibiotics for the canary to help treat the diarrhea. The canary may have to be on the antibiotics for several days to a week. Follow the vet’s dosage instructions and never give the canary more than recommended., Canaries who have diarrhea will be dehydrated and require electrolytes to recover. Your vet can recommend powdered electrolyte solutions made for birds that you can give the canary. These solutions are usually dissolved in your bird’s water.Ask your vet for the proper dosage of the electrolyte solution for your canary. Do not give the canary more than the recommended dose.

, If your canary displays other symptoms of an intestinal issue, like lack of appetite, prolonged loose stools, and fatigue, your vet will do a physical exam. They may also ask you to bring in a sample of the bird’s stool for analysis. They will do tests on the canary to determine if it has an intestinal issue, and if so, what type they have.Depending the diagnosis, your vet will likely recommend antibiotics and dietary changes for your canary.

Track general symptoms.,
Visit your vet immediately.,
Provide antibiotics.,
Offer mild food.,
Ensure adequate rest.,
Stay up to date with vaccinations.,
Maintain good health and hygiene.",How to Treat Respiratory Infections in African Grey Parrots2," Although the aspergillosis is most common form of respiratory trouble in African Greys, it is not the only potential problem. African Greys can also experience bacterial respiratory infections (like psittacosis) and respiratory viruses (like infectious bronchitis virus ). Additionally, respiratory symptoms could be indicative of food allergies.Some signs that something is wrong can include:

Open mouth breathing
Ruffled feathers
Tail bobbing up and down when breathing
Rapid breathing
A change in breathing sounds
Wheezing or clicking when inhaling

, Parrots are known for hiding any pain or illness for as long as possible, and unfortunately, respiratory problems in African Grey parrots can be quite serious. If you notice one or more of these symptoms (or if symptoms persist for more than one day), get your parrot to the vet right away.

If you are not sure about particular symptom, you can always call your vet and ask.
If possible, visit an aviary vet, or a vet who specializes in exotic birds.

, Many respiratory infections are bacterial, and as such, require the use of antibiotics to treat them. Even in cases of viral infections (such as infectious bronchitis virus ), your vet may encourage the use of antibiotics to treat or prevent secondary infections.Antibiotics can be administered to parrots by way injection in your vet's office, or liquid antibiotics can be added to your parrot's water at home.
Follow all instructions provided by your vet.

, Depending on the source of your parrot’s respiratory problems, they may also experience some digestive discomfort. Speak to your vet about whether or not you should alter your parrot’s diet as they recover. You may want to stick to a mild pellet diet and avoid fresh produce until your parrot’s digestive problems (such as diarrhea) are resolved.Make sure your parrot also has access to plenty of water.

, As your parrot is recovering, they will need plenty of rest. During this period, provide your parrot with 10-12 hours of darkness per night to allow for adequate sleep., Some respiratory infections are preventable. You can best protect your African Grey parrot from certain infections (like infectious bronchitis virus) by making sure their vaccinations are all up to date.If you are not sure about the status of your pet's vaccinations, call your vet and find out.

, A clean, well-ventilated cage can reduce the instance of respiratory infections. Furthermore, poor diet, over-crowding, lack of exercise, and stress can weaken your parrot’s immune system.To keep your parrot in good health, be sure to:

Clean the cage regularly
Provide out-of-cage-time daily
Ensure regular exercise by providing toys
Provide a healthy diet

Avoid over-crowding your birds

Visit your vet every 6 to 12 months.,
Perform blood tests.,
Have a fecal exam.",How to Treat Respiratory Infections in African Grey Parrots3," Parrots are known to hide any pain or discomfort they may be feeling. As a result, you may not become aware of a problem until it is quite advanced. The best way to prevent disease and keep your parrot healthy is to visit your vet every 6 to 12 months for a routine check-up.At this visit, your vet will:

Examine your African Grey
Weigh your parrot
Provide any necessary vaccinations
Perform a series of tests

, When you go in for your visit, your vet should draw blood from your parrot and perform a series of tests. Blood tests can screen for a number of diseases, as well as any problems with organ function (which can occur as a result of chronic aspergillosis)., During your routine well-care visit, you should also make sure your vet performs a fecal exam. These exams can screen for any yeast or bacterial infections, which can cause respiratory problems.Your vet may ask you to bring in a stool sample.

Notice if your bird stops sitting on their perches.,
Monitor for balance problems.,
Check for any irregular body positioning.,
Monitor for decreased activity.,
Watch for signs of decreased eating.,
Notice changes in sleeping habits.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in Lories and Lorikeets1," Healthy birds spend their time on perches and being active around their cage. A sick bird will sit on the bottom of the cage, often in mess. If your lory or lorikeet is on the bottom of the cage, it probably is ill., Birds have excellent balance and are always steady on their feet. They place their weight on both of their legs. If a bird is off balance, stumbling, or shifts their balance to a different leg, there is something wrong., Healthy birds will keep their wings at even levels close to their body. Birds that are unhealthy may tuck their head under their wing or sit with their head drooping down. They may have their wings at uneven angles, such as one being higher or lower than the other., Lories and lorikeets should be active and alert. If they stop playing, it could indicate a problem. Ignoring grooming tasks, like taking care of their toenails or beak, can also be a sign. Unhealthy birds will also stop talking. Lethargic or calm lories and lorikeets may mean they are ill., A decrease in appetite is a major indicator that something is wrong with your bird. Your bird may start eating less or have no appetite. Monitor how much food and water they consume each day.Make sure you don’t get fooled by a bird that appears to be eating. Some birds will look like they are eating, but drop a lot of the food.

, Lories and lorikeets should have a regular sleep schedule. During the day, they should be active and alert. However, if they start sleeping more during the day, it could be a symptom that the bird is ill."

Treat all birds in the household for mites.,
Avoid using mite protectors.,
Consider hiring an exterminator to remove mites from your home.",How to Tell if Your Bird Has Mites," Mites affect your bird by burrowing into their skin, often in the area around their eyes and beak. This is known as an infestation of Knemidokoptes pilae, or burrowing face mites. In the early stages of this infestation, the mites are barely visible and will not affect the overall condition of your bird. But you may notice crusty plaques in the corners of your bird’s beak or on your bird’s beak.These bright white deposits will become thicker and more crusty as the mites continue to burrow. The upper area of your bird’s face will appear to have deep burrows or holes, as the mites will dig tunnels or paths in your bird’s skin. The skin around your bird’s eyes and beak will eventually appear cavernous or full of thick, deep tunnels that appear crusty and irritated.;
, Mites can also affect your bird’s legs, known as scaly leg mites or Knemidokoptes mutans. The mites will burrow into the skin of your bird’s legs and lay eggs inside your bird’s skin. As a result, your bird’s legs may appear very dry, scaly, and show white deposits that may turn crusty. The mites release metabolites that severely irritate your bird’s skin, resulting in swelling and scaly skin, or rashes., Mites come out to feed at night, so your bird may be very restless or irritated during the night as a result of bites from the mites. Your bird may also be restless or appear to try to itch his skin against his cage during the day as the mites continue to burrow. In an attempt to remove the mites, your bird may also groom or preen himself excessively, though the mites cannot be removed by grooming or preening., Mites can also burrow and infest your bird’s trachea, air sacs, bronchi or sinuses, resulting in symptoms like coughing, sneezing, or difficulty breathing. Your bird may also start to open-mouth breathe, almost as if he is gasping for air. Watch him when he breathes in his cage for any signs of difficulty breathing or breathing with an open mouth.Your bird may also experience weight loss due to the mite infestation, and he may make clicking sounds or have a change in vocal sounds a result of mites burrowed in his respiratory system.

, Your bird may have noticeable feather damage, with missing patches of feathers or piles of feathers in his cage. This is as a result of excessive preening or cleaning by your bird in an attempt to remove the mites from his skin.

, Since mites are nocturnal, they will reproduce during the day and feed at night. Use a flashlight to check your bird’s head and legs for any crawling mites during the night. They may appear as small, red or black spots or specks that move and burrow close to your bird’s skin., Mites are very small, about 1mm in length and are semi transparent until they ingest blood. They then turn bright red or black. One way to identify a mite infestation is to check your bird’s cage for clusters of small red or black spots. Watch them to see if they move after five minutes, as mites are mobile and tend to crawl around looking for their host., Your bird can transfer mites to you very easily, and you may experience symptoms of a mite infestation as you care and live with your bird. You may have raised or reddish bites on your body, especially around your mouth and nose.

, You may also experience crawling sensations on your skin at night, as this is when mites come out to feed.


Keep in mind mites can feed on humans, but they will not live on humans, as they cannot complete their life cycle via a human host. They also do not transmit any infectious diseases to humans or birds, but you may develop a secondary infection due to scratching and skin irritation.

, Mites will not be visible on your bird during the daytime, but your vet can check the cage to confirm there is a mite infestation.


Keep in mind mites live on your bird, not in your bird’s cage. But depending on the extent of the infestation, you may need to also treat your bird’s cage to remove the mites., The most effective medications for mite will need to be dosed specifically for your bird’s body weight and breed, so always use a prescribed medication to treat mites. Over the counter mite medications will not provide long term treatment of the infestation and may not be effective for your bird. Your vet will prescribe a topical treatment or possibly injections to help treat the mite infestation on your bird.You will also need to schedule follow-up appointments with your vet to ensure the mites have been eradicated from your bird.

, Scaly mites in birds are not very contagious, but it is still important to treat all your birds if one bird is diagnosed with mites. This is a good precaution in the event the infected bird somehow contaminates the other birds in the household., Mite protectors are often found in pet stores and online, and claim to prevent or control mite infestations. But they are not always helpful at preventing an infestation and many of these products contain paradichlorobenzene, or mothballs, with can be harmful to your bird and can cause liver damage. Exposing your bird to these fumes can be dangerous, so avoid them., Some pest control companies are qualified to treat bird mites in your home. If the infestation is extensive, consider hiring an exterminator sooner than later so the infestation does not get any worse.


Some companies will inspect your home free of charge and give you an estimate of the extermination. Try to find a pest control company that specializes in bird mites as they will use the correct chemicals to remove the mites and prevent another infestation. You can access a database of qualified exterminators here.

Keep a close eye on your bird’s weight.,
Check for any respiratory problems.,
Look at the bird’s eyes and ears for problems.,
Check the beak and mouth.,
Notice any irregularities with the feathers.,
Watch for problems in the vent region.,
Monitor the bird’s droppings.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in Lories and Lorikeets2," Changes in your bird’s weight can let you know that something is wrong. You should weigh your bird regularly. Do this once each month. Weigh them at the same time every day so the weight will be consistent.If your bird loses more than 10 percent of their body weight and you haven’t put them a diet, you should take them to the vet.

, Lories and lorikeets should have no respiratory problems. They should breath easily and smoothly, with no body movements as they breathe. If your bird bobs their tail as they breathe, or they keep their mouth open after activity, there may be something wrong., Your lory or lorikeet’s eyes and ears should be clear and normal colored. Redness or discharge may indicate a problem. There should also be no swelling around the eye tissues, ear tissues, eyelids, or conjunctival tissues. Any irritation can point to a problem.The ears and eyes should not be blocked by anything.

, The beak should be normal shape for a lory or lorikeet. Overgrown beaks can point to a nutrition problem. Reddened or swollen mouth tissues are also a sign of problems. The bird may also experience a discharge from the mouth or beak.If the bird starts sneezing a lot, this could point to a problem.

, Your lory or lorikeet’s feathers should bright, colorful, and smooth. They should not be torn or tattered, and they shouldn’t lose their color. Bald patches where feathers should be can indicate a problem. If your bird is pulling feathers out of a certain area, there may be a problem there.Abnormally shaped feathers may also indicate illness.
Black spots on the feathers may mean a problem with their diet or be a sign of illness.

, Lories and lorikeets should have a clean vent region. If there is fecal matter or matted feathers, the bird may have diarrhea or other problems. Any discharge, bleeding, or swelling in this area indicates there is a problem., Any changes in your bird’s droppings may be a symptom of a problem. No feces, black feces, or liquid feces may point to digestive problems. Color changes may mean your bird has an illness or infection. Blood in the droppings is not normal.Increased urine in droppings may be a symptom of an illness that causes increased water consumption.

Take the bird to the vet.,
Have the vet run tests.,
Keep the bird away from your other birds.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in Lories and Lorikeets3," Symptoms can get worse quickly in birds, so if you believe your bird is sick, take them to an avian vet immediately. They should be checked out and treated promptly. Untreated illnesses can severely affect your bird.When you’re at the vet, make sure that you share any symptoms. Even if it seems small, tell your vet. This helps them get the complete picture.

, Your vet will probably perform various exams on your lory or lorikeet. This may include getting bloodwork, taking a fecal sample, or testing for bacteria, viruses, or fungi. They may also do x-rays or disease-specific tests., Remove the sick lory or lorikeet from other birds until you know exactly what is wrong with them. You don’t want them to spread their illness to your other birds. Ask your vet how long you should keep your bird separate from the other birds.Place them in a separate cage and in a separate room, just to be on the safe side.

Keep your parakeet away from infected birds.",How to Treat Chlamydiosis in Parakeets," Chlamydiosis frequently produces respiratory problems in parakeets. Infected parakeets may suffer from sinus infection. Infected birds will also show a general shortness of breath accompanied by strained or labored breathing.Parakeets with Chlamydiosis may also display a “runny” nose, in which case a thin liquid will drip from their nostrils.;
, Chlamydiosis commonly attacks parakeets’ digestive systems, and moderate diarrhea is a common side effect. Note if your parakeet is eliminating waste more frequently than usual. Also note if the parakeet’s feces are an odd color: yellow, grayish, or green excrement can be a sign of Chlamydiosis., If you suspect your parakeet has contracted Chlamydiosis, watch to see if it produces excessive amounts of urine. Birds with Chlamydiosis often urinate an excessive amount.This condition, known as polyuria, can be a symptom of various types of bacterial infection, and does not by itself indicate a case of Chlamydiosis.

, Parakeets that have become infected from Chlamydiosis often feel poorly in general and act unwell. Infected birds may display lethargy, and are likely to listlessly sit around their cage. Infected parakeets may also lose their appetites (which may lead to weight loss) and their feathers may become unkempt and ruffled.Parakeets with Chlamydiosis may also produce discharge around one or both of their eyes. One or more of their eye-lids may also swell.

, Chlamydiosis can be a serious bacterial infection, and is not an illness that bird owners can cure at home. A veterinarian will be able to correctly diagnose your parakeet with Chlamydiosis by performing a fecal analysis or blood analysis, as well as possible oral swab testing.The vet will be able to prescribe the necessary medication in order to cure your bird. Never give a parakeet—or any other animal—an antibiotic or other medication without first receiving a diagnosis from a licensed veterinarian.

, Many cases of Chlamydiosis are treated with the antibiotic tetracycline. Medications that contain tetracycline include Vibramycin and Oxytetracycline.Doxycycline is another antibiotic which is commonly used in the treatment of Chlamydiosis.
While a parakeet—or any other bird—is being given tetracycline, do not give the bird any food or supplements containing calcium. Calcium will diminish the effectiveness of the antibiotic.

, Talk with the veterinarian and decide how the tetracycline (or other prescribed antibiotic) should be given to your sick parakeet. Depending on your and your veterinarian’s preferences, the tetracycline can be administered through an intramuscular or intravenous injection. Tetracycline can also be administered orally, or mixed into the parakeet’s food.Whichever treatment method you and your vet decide on, the antibiotic will likely need to be administered over the course of 45 days.

, Delivering an antibiotic via injection or force-feeding can be difficult for the owner and stressful for the infected parakeet. To avoid this problem, various companies manufacture medicated water, which your parakeet can drink to treat its Chlamydiosis. Ask your veterinarian if they recommend this course of treatment.Medicated water is used most often to treat mass outbreaks of Chlamydiosis, such as in an aviary.

, This is a common-sense rule, but your parakeet will have a much lower risk of illness (including Chlamydiosis) if its cage is kept clean. Remove all fecal matter, and make sure that your bird is kept in a well-ventilated environment.If your parakeet is being treated for a case of Chlamydiosis, it can re-catch the illness from bacteria within its cage. Fully clean the bird’s cage to prevent a second case of the disease.

, If you own or manage a pet store (specializing in birds) or an aviary, a Chlamydiosis outbreak presents a serious threat. To prevent this—and to keep your current birds safe—quarantine all new, incoming birds. Observe them for signs of Chlamydiosis, and ask a veterinarian or bird specialist to test the birds for the bacteria as well.Once a new bird has been diagnosed as free from Chlamydiosis, you can release it into the general bird-containment area.

, Birds already infected with Chlamydiosis will excrete the bacteria in their feces and liquid nasal discharge. The bacteria will then enter the air, at which point uninfected birds can inhale the bacteria and contract the illness.If your parakeet is kept away from infected birds, it will have a much lower likelihood of catching the disease.

Chlamydiosis can also be transmitted directly by beak-to-beak contact between two birds.

Identify the symptoms of lovebird pox.,
Get a veterinary diagnosis.,
Treat secondary infections.,
Give supportive care.,
Keep infected birds isolated.,
Sterilize all supplies.,
Eliminate mosquito breeding grounds.",How to Treat Lovebird Pox," There are two different types of lovebird pox and they cause two different types of pox. Dry lovebird pox affect the exterior of the bird's body and wet lovebird pox affects the inside of the lovebird's body.


Dry avian pox causes wart-like scaly growths on the featherless areas of the surface of a bird's body. They can show up around the eyes, the beak, or on the legs and feet.Avian pox that appear on the eyes can be mistaken for conjunctivitis. ""Growths"" on the actual eyes are usually avian pox.
Wet avian pox causes lesions in the mucus membranes of the bird, specifically in the oral and nasal cavities of the lovebird. These lesions are harder to spot than the dry version but they can be even more serious, as they can interfere with the breathing and eating of the bird.;
, Take your lovebird to a veterinarian if you suspect avian pox. When you call for an appointment, let the veterinary office know that you suspect pox, so that they can keep your bird isolated and avoid spreading the infection.The symptoms of lovebird pox may look a lot like tumors, abscesses, or a bacterial or viral infection. This is why a veterinary diagnosis is necessary.
Diagnosis of avian pox is done by biopsying the pox and looking at the it under a microscope., Additional infections, such as candidiasis, can establish themselves in the open wounds caused by the pox.Your veterinarian is likely to prescribe an antibiotic to help eliminate this type of additional infection.For example, your veterinarian may prescribe an eye ointment to treat eye infections caused by the pox.

, There is no specific treatment for the virus that causes lovebird pox. However, there are a variety of things that can be done to make your bird more comfortable and to support its immune system. These include:Give your bird vitamin A to increase the health of the birds skin.
Tube feed the bird if it is having difficulty eating.
Moisten scabs that are causing the bird discomfort.

, Lovebird pox can be spread by feather dust or the feces of an infected bird. If another lovebird comes into contact with the feather dust and feces of an infected bird, then it can easily become infected.


Do not allow direct contact between a lovebird that you know to be infected and one that does not show symptoms. This means that they should be kept in completely different rooms

, If you have multiple lovebirds, and one is infected, then you need to sterilize all supplies to avoid cross contamination after the sick bird is isolated. All supplies should be disinfected with bleach before being used between a bird that is infected and birds that are not.It takes some work to eliminate the lovebird pox virus because it does not die when it is dried out. Use chlorine bleach on all surfaces of all bird supplies and cages to kill the virus.

, Lovebird pox can be spread by mosquitoes. If your bird can come into contact with mosquitoes, whether it spends time outdoors or you allow fresh air in your house, then you need to minimize mosquitoes in the area.


Get rid of standing water near your home. These can become mosquito breeding grounds.
Transmission via mosquitoes occurs when a mosquito bites a bird with lesions and then bites another bird."

Wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap for 20 seconds.,
Have the medication ready.,
Ask for some assistance if someone is around.,
Place your parrot on the ground.,
Cover your parrot from its neck to its tail from behind swiftly.,
Gently grab it from the belly and flip it over on its back.,
Clean around your parrot’s eye with a tissue or cotton ball before applying the medication.,
Gently hold the parrot’s chin upward with the non-dominant hand when applying the medication if it doesn't bite.,
Position the eye drop 1 cm from the cornea and apply a drop of the medication into the parrot’s eye.,
Repeat the process if you need to.,
Give your parrot a treat.,
Return the parrot to its perch when finished.,
Close all medications and place them somewhere secure.",How to Apply Eye Drops in a Parrot's Eye," Rinse your hands for 10 seconds.Before applying the medication, it's always a good idea to perform this step. You don’t want bacteria on your parrot’s eye because it can worsen its vision.;
, It can be difficult to open the bottle when holding your parrot. You want this to be fast as possible, so your bird won’t be irritated.

, Your parrot may be moving around when applying the treatment, so having someone around is helpful., The reason why not to cover the parrot and pick it up from the perch is because your parrot will grip the perch with its nails which can harm it. The parrot will resist.

, Ensure your parrot’s head is out of the towel.


Your parrot will escape if it knows you are approaching with a towel because it is intrusive, so try to do this silently.

, You should be holding the parrot like you are holding a taco.


The towel on the bird should be snug, holding its wings. Don't place your hand on its chest.

, You want to make sure the area is clean.


If discharge is present, clean eye with sterile eye wash solution.
Place tissue aside and dispose later because you don't want to deal with reinfection.

, However, birds will typically bite on the towel, so for some birds you don't need to hold chin. This ensures that the medication will be applied precisely in the eye.

, Don't touch the tip of the bottle or the birds eye to minimize contamination and blinking. Allow ten seconds for the drop to disperse in the parrot’s eye.


If your parrot continues to blink, you can apply a drop in the nostril and some will travel to the eye.

, You should follow your vets instructions. If you aren't sure, the frequency is printed on the side of the prescription.


Some eye drops for specific infections or swelling need to be applied every two hours, once a day, or twice a day. In that case, it's imperative to check the label on the prescription.

, Your parrot will gain a positive experience and would be easier to apply eye drops when needed.

, Ensure the parrot's water bowl is full because it was probably struggling to escape when applying the medication.

, Reseal medication to ensure its effectiveness.

Apply strips of tape to the windows on the outside surface.,
Put bird decals on the outside surface of window glass.,
Apply soap or window paint to the outside of the windows.,
Put a film on the outside of your windows.,
Add window screens or a net.,
Install exterior shutters or sun shades.,
Switch out the glass for ultraviolet, patterned glass.",How to Prevent Birds From Flying Into Windows1," Use white tape that can withstand wind and rain. Place the tape 4” apart vertically on your windows. This will signal to birds that the glass is there and prevent them from flying into it.You can also use black tape. If you use black tape, space the strips 1” apart.
There is specialty tape available at pet stores to prevent birds from hitting windows.;
, Bird decals or bird stickers can be a quick and easy way to bird proof your windows. Always place decals very close together, about one hand’s distance away from each other. You will need to cover the windows with a pattern of decals, as one to two bird decals on the window will not deter birds.You can find bird decals at bird-feeding stores and pet stores. You can often find bird decals in different bird silhouettes, such as hawk or robin silhouettes. Look for decals that are colored in an ultraviolet spectrum, as they will be transparent to our eyes but visible to birds.

, Another way to deter birds from hitting your windows is to put a layer of soap on the outside of windows, creating a film that will be visible to birds. Keep in mind with this method, you may have to soap the windows several times a week to maintain the film.Another option is to apply window paint or tempera paints to the windows. You can make this a fun art project and create bold, bright patterns with the window paint. Make sure you cover most to all of the surface area of the windows with paint so there are no clear or transparent areas that birds can fly into.

, There are window films available that are transparent on the inside but opaque on the outside. Use a film that covers the entire surface of the glass on the outside. Most window films are made to allow light inside while still appearing opaque and reflective to birds.Some films also come in patterns, such as stripes or blocks, that can help to deter birds from flying into the glass. Applying patterned films can create an interesting look to your windows while also safeguarding them for birds.

, There are several bird screens and nets available that can help to prevent birds from flying into your windows. Look for a bird screen that is made of dark mesh that you can hang over your windows. You can customize the mesh so it covers your windows properly.You can use buy bird netting to hang two inches from your windows. Look for netting that is made of durable, lightweight polypropylene.

, If you do not already have exterior shutters on your windows, consider installing them. You can then close the shutters when you are out for the day to prevent birds from hitting the glass. Exterior shutters can also be a good way to conserve energy and keep your house warm without turning up the heat.You can also install sun shades or awnings. They will block the reflection of sunlight and create shade over the windows, making it easier for birds to spot the glass and avoid flying into it.

, For a permanent solution, you can switch out your window glass for ultraviolet, patterned glass. This glass has crisscross patterns that are not noticeable to humans but are visible to birds from the outside. Though this may be the most expensive option, it is also the most permanent one.You can find ultraviolet, patterned window glass online or in specialty home and furniture stores.
If you are planning to install windows in your home, you should go for slightly tilted windows. Ask the contractor to position the windows so they are slightly vertical, facing downward. This will allow the window surface to reflect the ground rather than the sky and the trees. Positioning your windows this way will help to deter birds from hitting the glass without obstructing your view."

Sit and wait for a bird to fly into a mist-net.,
Approach the net.,
Once you have put the feet in 'photographs grip', either pluck the net or blow on the feathers.,
Once you have fully removed the bird, be sure to change your grip to the 'bander's grip'.,
Quickly walk to the nearest banding tent.",How to Safely Extract a Bird from a Mist Net,"


Be sure to use binoculars while waiting for a bird to fly in.
Note which direction the bird flew in. If you do not see which direction the bird flew in, make sure to look for exposed tail-feathers (rectrices) that are not covered in net.;
, Disentangle the feet first while keeping the legs in 'photographs grip'.


Do this while using your dominant hand to extract and hold the bird.
When putting the bird into a 'photographers grip', you want the legs of the bird in between your fore finger and middle finger while pushing your thumb on the bend of the leg.
Don't cradle the bird while it's tangled inside the shed of the net because it could tangle the bird even more.

, This will reveal where the net is on the bird and the easiest way to remove it.


Blowing on the feathers can help the extractor see the net when it is wrapped around the bend of the wings, although plucking the net can help expose portions of still-tangled threads. Slipping the net over the neck will help the extraction go a lot faster if the bird seems stressed or uncomfortable.
Note if a bird is extremely tangled (ex. Wrens or larges bird such as Robins) cutting the net is a good solution but usually the last resort.

,


While changing your grip without letting the bird go, you want to use your fore finger and middle finger and place them around the neck of the bird. The palm of your hand will be against the back of the bird and your thumb and other fingers will be wrapped around the body with slight pressure on the bird.
Note that the 'bander's grip' is used in the banding process and makes the bird easily accessible, while it also provides a more calming hold.

, Place a band on the bird in a quick and efficient fashion without releasing the bird until finished.

Move indoor plants away from the windows.,
Close curtains and blinds as often as possible.,
Turn off all lights inside when they are not in use.",How to Prevent Birds From Flying Into Windows2," If your home contains a lot of houseplants close to your windows, move them several feet away from the windows. Birds may spot them through the windows and view them as refuges. They may then fly into the window in an attempt to perch on the plants., Try to keep your curtains and blinds closed throughout the day, as this will help to deter birds from flying into the windows. Closed curtains or blinds will help to indicate that the windows are there.If you have vertical blinds in your home, you should try to keep them halfway closed or completely closed during the day.

, Keep your house dark at night by turning off any lights in rooms you are not using. This will prevent birds from being drawn to the lights in your home and flying into the windows."
"
Move feeders and baths at least three feet away from the window.,
Hang wind chimes in front of the window.,
Suspend tree branches in front of the window.",How to Prevent Birds From Flying Into Windows3," You can move any bird feeders or baths further from the windows so they have to stop at the feeder or the bath first, rather than flying straight into the windows.Keep in mind moving bird feeders in your yard will not deter non-feeder birds, such as migrant thrushes or warblers, from flying into the glass.

, Break out the wind chimes and place them outside above your windows. Look for wind chimes that contain shiny objects and make noise when they are hit by the wind.You can also make a wind chime by hanging compact discs or long strips of shiny, reflective plastic in front of windows. Another option is to hang old aluminum pie plates in front of the windows to deter birds.

, For a more natural look, you can suspend tree branches in front of the windows. Tie the branches to string and dangle them a few inches in front of your window in rows. This will allow you to still have a view out your window and deter birds from flying into the windows."

Close doors, windows, and vents.,
Watch out for curtains.,
Move poisonous plants.,
Look for bedroom dangers.,
Navigate the kitchen with caution.,
Make the bathroom safe.,
Let birds interact with other pets—with caution.",How to Protect Birds from Household Dangers," A bird, like many animals, needs a space to rest and relax. Because birds are social, they love attention and being in a space where they can see and interact with you. Select a room that provides stimulation without exposing your bird to other animals, dangerous fumes, or extreme changes in temperature.Place the cage against a wall so your bird feels secure. An ideal space is in a corner, where there are two walls that can help a bird feel like it has a place to hide if it feels in danger.
Avoid putting the cage directly in front of a window. The sight of dogs, hawks and storms can scare them. In addition, windows may expose the bird to extreme shifts in temperature, which can be dangerous for winged friends. Partial views of a window are fine.
Put the cage away from drafty areas, fans, open windows and heat registers. Extreme heat and cold can be dangerous to your bird.;
, Recognize that the kitchen and bathroom present dangers for your bird. In the kitchen, fumes from non-stick cooking surfaces, self-cleaning ovens, open flames and sharp knives can harm your bird.Changes in temperature and exposure to toxic chemicals such as hairspray can harm or poison your bird in a bathroom.If possible, place the cage in a room that doesn’t pose these hazards.

, Many people put their birds in cages while they are away. Some birds—and other animals—are clever and can open cage doors or sneak through the bars. Checking the locks and bars of your bird’s cage can keep it safe from escape and from curious other animals such as snakes or cats.Check that cage bars aren’t bent or damaged. These can encourage a curious bird to stick its head out of the cage, which may allow it to escape or wedge its body in between the bars. Bent or damaged bars may encourage other animals to poke their head into the cage. Make sure bar spacing is narrow enough to prevent the bird from sticking any of its body outside of the cage.
Inspect latches and locks to make sure mechanically inclined birds and other animals can’t open them. Replace any potentially problematic pieces with new security features., Birds need about 10 hours of rest every night without interruption. Placing a cover over its cage can ensure the bird feels safe and isn’t interrupted. It also prevents sleep deprivation, which can harm of the health of your bird.Purchase a cover specifically for the bird cage or fashion one out of sheets and/ or pillow cases. Use a breathable fabric such as cotton to minimize the risk of suffocation.

, Birds are very sensitive animals. Items that may not harm larger animals, such as dogs or cats, can kill a bird, so avoid using these near your bird. Knowing the most hazardous items in your home can minimize the risk of harm or death to your bird. They include:Air fresheners
Scented candles
Teflon and non-stick cookware
Paint flakesOverhead fans
Houseplants
Other animals

, You likely plan on allowing your bird out of its cage when you are supervising it. Even in these situations, it’s important to be aware that birds will chew anything in sight. Recognizing what items may attract your bird to nibble can remind you to be on the lookout for potentially dangerous situations in your home. Birds like to chew:Wires
Cords
Walls—most paints are hazardous to birds
Furniture

, Birds love attention from their human and you may spend a lot of time with your pet in the living or dining room. Scan and remove potentially dangerous items such as including electrical wires and cords, toys, and curtains. This may prevent injury and even death.Check for dangling wires or cords from electronics including TVs, stereos, DVD players, telephones and lamps. Hide them to deter chewing by your bird. Consider covering electrical outlets to prevent electrocution through chewing. Get rid of frayed wires, which can also electrocute your bird.

, Birds are very sensitive to temperature shifts, which can shock and/ or kill a bird. Before letting your bird out of its cage, make sure all windows and doors are closed to decrease drafts. Cover heating and air vents to minimize the risk of your bird burning itself or being exposed to extreme temperatures.Recognize that closing windows, doors, and vents may prevent your bird from escaping.

, A bird’s claws can get caught in curtains. The cords can also entangle your bird. Keeping your bird’s claws clipped or using blinds instead of curtains can minimize the risk of harm., Many people keep colorful plants to decorate their homes. But many plants are poisonous for birds. Move any potentially poisonous plants to areas your bird can’t access.Some common house plants that are poisonous to birds include:


Oleander
Azalea
Poinsettia
Philodendron.Honeysuckle
Hyacinth bulbs
Iris ivy
Hydrangea
Jonquil
Lily
Lily of the valley
Tulips
Zamioculcas., Birds like to hide or nest in small spaces. Even seemingly non-hazardous items such as shoes can expose your bird to harm. Covering potentially comfy hiding and nesting spots can prevent you or other animals from accidentally harming your bird.Make sure laundry is in a covered basket or container. Hang and store clothing in closets and dressers so your bird can’t access them as easily. Clothing may have threads or embellishments that can entangle your bird.Store shoes in containers, a closet, or on a shoe rack to prevent chewing and hiding in them.
Cover or hide any wires as you would in other rooms.
Make sure your bird can’t access perfumes, sprays or lotions that can access and which may harm your bird.
Make sure you haven’t accidentally closed your bird in a closet or drawer when you leave the room. Avoid sleeping with your bird because you can easily roll over and crush it.

, The kitchen can present your bird with a host of potential dangers including boiling water, fumes, toxic foods and drowning in the sink. Consider keeping your bird out of the kitchen to minimize the risk of injury or death. If your bird enjoys the kitchen, keep it in a space away from stoves, ovens, sinks, and appliances.Recognize that smoke fumes from overheated foods and oils can harm your bird.
Be careful using pump or aerosol sprays around birds, even from cooking products.Keep your bird away from non-stick cookware and appliances such as pots, waffle irons, slow cookers, and drip pans. These can expose your bird to toxic fumes that can kill it.Make sure your garbage can is secured with a lid so that your bird can’t hide. An open garbage can also expose your bird to harmful substances including butter and grease, chocolate, salt, alcohol, garlic, coffee, onion, and yeast dough.
Store food in airtight containers and in cabinets so your bird can’t access it. Keep wrapped food in cabinets as well.
Make sure any cleaners, medications, or other chemicals are securely closed and stored in a cabinet you’re your bird can’t access.Keep sharp objects such as knives in a drawer or cabinet.
Cover and unplug any kitchen appliances that you are not using.

, The bathroom can present your bird a variety of hazards just like the kitchen. Remove or securely store chemicals or potentially harmful items such as hairsprays, lotions, and even old towels. This minimizes the risk of injury or death.Store any cleaners, medications and personal items in cabinets that your bird can’t access. Things such as toilet cleaner, vitamins, supplements, shaving creams, and hair dyes can harm or kill your bird.
Recognize that heat curling irons can give off toxic fumes.
Close the toilet lid at all times to minimize the risk of your bird drowning., You may have cats, dogs, or other animals you have as pets in addition to your bird. Familiarizing your pets with one another and supervising them can minimize the risk of harm to your bird.Make sure you are always present when your animals are together. Even if they are used to one another, there is no guarantee that an excited dog or cat won’t pounce on a bird.
Introduce your birds and other pets gradually. Consider using a training program to help other animals interact with your bird.

Avoid Teflon fumes.,
Use air purifiers.,
Add fresh air and sunlight.,
Avoid perfume and artificial air fresheners.,
Do not smoke indoors.,
Keep candles away.,
Keep cooking gas checked.",How to Provide Healthy Air for Your Birds," Avoid non-stick cookware all together as they cause cancer in people and kills birds. Teflon fumes are highly toxic to birds and causes death. Teflon fumes are toxic to everyone including us; excessive exposure might result in fever and/or nausea. Birds on the other hand are not that lucky. When non-stick pans are heated beyond 350’F they start emitting fumes, this is causes the birds lungs to bleed internally and prolonged exposure causes lungs to be filled with blood and the birds dies due to lack of oxygen. There are many reported incidences where pet owners lost their healthy birds and later when probed by the vet admitted to having cooked a big dinner almost always involving non-stick cookware. The autopsy confirms the cause of death.;
, The average indoor air is 6 times more polluted than the outdoor air. It’s a great reason to have an air purifier in the family room that benefits everyone. If your birds don’t live in your family room like mine do, you might want to add an air purifier to your birds room. Make sure you select a traditional air purifier that has a filter to trap the dust. The latest ionic air purifiers release ozone (three atoms of oxygen) that is an oxidant and not good for all of us.

, Open the windows and let the fresh air pass through your home. Of course, we can’t do much about winter months but do take full advantage of the rest of the year. Fresh air and sunlight are always good and healthy, just like us birds need exposure to sunlight to metabolize Vitamin D.

, Spray perfume away from your bird’s room, it’s a good idea to turn your exhaust fan and use the perfume in the bathroom. Air fresheners have chemicals that cause irritation in your bird’s respiratory system and most birds are allergic to such products.

, If you’re a smoker, you must be familiar with the term passive smoking. When it comes to your bird, if you have one cigarette it’s equal of your bird having one pack of cigarettes and just look how tiny your bird is. It’s a battle your bird will lose.

, When burning candles make sure the place is well ventilated to avoid Carbon monoxide poisoning

, Methane is very poisonous to the birds and often causes respiratory failure and death. If your home has gas cooking having a regular maintenance to avoid gas leakage and taking extra caution while cooking can be very effective to prevent accidents.

Avoid feeding your bird toxic foods.,
Keep your bird away from toxic plants.,
Use the right wood for your bird.,
Avoid feeding your bird fruit seeds.",How to Avoid Poisoning Your Pet Bird1," There are many foods that are safe for birds, but many that are unsafe. Before you feed your bird any food from the table, you should discuss it with your vet or research it online. If you are unsure whether the food is safe or not, do not feed it to your bird. Examples of unsafe foods include:Salty, sugary, or fatty foods
Avocado
Asparagus
Dried beans
Caffeine
Chocolate
Dried fruits that contain sulfides or sulfates
Eggplant
Dairy products, like butter or milk
Mushrooms
Olives
Onions
Peanuts
Rhubarb
Tomatoes;
, Many house plants and fresh flowers are poisonous for birds. If you have a bird in your home, you may consider removing all house plants or fresh-cut flowers from your home so your bird won’t accidentally eat them.For example, lilies, azaleas, sago palms, kalanchoes, hydrangeas, lupine, and rhododendrons are toxic.

, If you put wood in your bird’s cage, you need to make sure the wood is safe. Some wood is toxic to birds and can cause health problems. Talk to your vet before choosing a wood, or research the wood online.Examples of toxic wood include alder, elder, cedar, holly, juniper, oak, mistletoe, pine, red maple, redwood, or yew.
Non-toxic woods include bamboo, aspen, ash, birch, beech, elm, dogwood, hickory, poplar, and spruce.

, Fruit seeds, especially apple seeds, are extremely poisonous to birds. Feeding your bird an apple is fine, but avoid giving your bird sliced apple seeds or any pieces of the core that have touched the seeds. The core can have trace amounts of a type of cyanide on them that can poison your bird.You should also not feed your bird any pits from fruits, like peaches, cherries, or plums.

Keep your bird away from medicine.,
Put all cosmetics and cleaning supplies away.,
Refrain from burning candles around your bird.,
Reduce the toxic fumes in your house.",How to Avoid Poisoning Your Pet Bird2," Common over-the-counter medications can poison your bird. These products can cause stomach problems and liver failure. If your bird roams your home freely, make sure all medications are stored away properly so the bird can’t accidentally eat one thinking it is food.For example, NSAIDs (like Aleve), birth control, and vitamins can poison birds.

, Cosmetics and cleaning supplies are also toxic to your bird. You should make sure to keep all these items safely put away. When using the products, move your bird to a different, well-ventilated room. The following items are poisonous and should not be used in the same room as your bird:Shaving cream
Lotion
Laundry detergent and softeners
Toilet bowl cleaners
Strong cleaning supplies, like bleach or ammonia
Aerosol sprays

, Scented candles can be very toxic to your bird because they release carbon monoxide, smoke, and essential oils. Reconsider using scented candles if you have birds. If you want to burn them, make sure to do it in a different room or ventilate your home well to get out any harmful chemicals.Burning candles release minimal amounts of carbon dioxide. This is harmless to humans, but even a small amount of carbon monoxide can kill birds. Place carbon monoxide detectors in your home, especially in the room where your bird is located, to monitor the carbon dioxide levels.

, There are many different gases that can be emitted in your house that can poison your bird. You should be aware of these gases and how to limit them in your home. Take caution in any room where your bird lives to make sure no toxic fumes are building up and causing them harm.Burning cooking oil, fats, or butter may produce harmful gases. Try to cook all oils, fats, butters, and margarine cooked at a temperature below 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Refrain from cooking oil or butter on high.
The “self clean” option on your oven may put harmful gases into the air.
Natural gas can kill your bird. If you have a gas stove, water heater, or other appliance, keep an eye on the pilot light to make sure it doesn’t go out or leak. Keep your bird in a different area than these appliances, preferably in a ventilated area.
Avoid using solvents in the same room or near your bird. This includes nail polish remover, gasoline, glue, or paint.
Smoke, including tobacco smoke, can poison your bird.

Eliminate the use of teflon in your home.,
Use caution when cooking with Teflon.,
Recognize symptoms of Teflon poisoning.,
Take appropriate action if you suspect your bird has Teflon poisoning.",How to Avoid Poisoning Your Pet Bird3," Teflon, the material used in making nonstick pans, can lead to fatal poisoning in birds. When Teflon is overheated, it emits a gas that is deadly to birds. When a bird gets Teflon poisoning, their lungs fill with fluid that moves to the airwaves, causing death.Teflon poisoning is extremely quick. It only takes a minimal amount of gas in the air to kill a small bird and damage a larger bird.
To protect your bird, refrain from using Teflon or nonstick cookware in your home.

, If you don’t want to get rid of your Teflon cookware, then you should be careful and smart when cooking with it to protect your bird. Always stay with your nonstick pots and pans when cooking with it. Cook at the appropriate temperatures and make sure the pans don’t get overheated, which is the main cause of gas emissions.Get rid of any Teflon or nonstick drip pans in your oven because they can heat to extremely high temperatures that will release poisonous gas.
When you cook or bake with nonstick cookware, move your bird to a different part of the house, as far away from the kitchen as possible. You may want to put your bird in a well-ventilated area so no harmful gases get trapped.
Make sure to get rid of any Teflon or nonstick cookware if it is scratched or messed up in anyway.

, With early detection of Teflon poisoning and a quick response, you might be able to save your bird. The main symptom is respiratory distress. Your bird may breathe through their mouth, gasp for air, or experience wheezy, raspy breaths.The bird may act uncoordinated or weak. The tail may bob or move around.
If the bird has experienced poisoning for an extended amount of time, the bird may fall off the perch.
Teflon poisoning affects birds very quickly. Your bird can die before you realize the bird is poisoned. However, by being cautious with poisonous fumes from nonstick cookware around your bird and acting fast when your bird shows any negative symptoms, you can keep your bird safe.

, If you believe your bird has Teflon poisoning, you should act quickly so you can try to save your bird. Your bird can die within few minutes of Teflon poisoning, especially if they continue to breathe the gas.First, you should immediately move the nonstick cookware out of the house and cut off the stove or oven.
Open the windows to help let out the gas, and turn on all exhaust and house fans. This helps increase the ventilation in the house so your bird won’t breathe in any more of the noxious fumes.
Call your veterinarian and tell them you are immediately bringing your bird with possible Teflon poisoning into the office.

Look both up and down.,
Stay cool.,
Make the cage inviting.,
Don’t make the outside too inviting.",How to Catch a Bird1," Birds can be hard to find because they’re small enough to hide under a lot of household items, but they can also fly up out of your line of vision. Finding them could require that you do some extensive searching. Start by verifying that they are not any place dangerous.


Dangerous hideouts include water glasses, bathrooms, doorways, window, stoves, and sofas.
Hard to find hideouts include curtain rods, plants, lamps, mantels, ceiling fans, picture frames, and underneath furniture. They can also hide inside objects like laundry baskets, boxes, and drawers.;
, Birds understand body language so screaming or frantic movement will cause them to be as anxious as you are. To ease their nerves you should speak softly and move at a normal pace., Your bird will be more likely to fly back to its cage if it likes being there. The cage should be someplace near where people congregate, so that it stays interested, but should also be away from windows, which birds believe leave them susceptible to danger. Have a variety of toys in the cage to make it interesting. Finally, give your bird a special treat whenever it goes into the cage.


Do not give the bird the same treat on any occasion other than returning to the cage, else it might find going back to the cage less special.Never use time in the cage as punishment; this will create negative associations with the cage., It is a bad idea to give your bird food outside of the cage, because this encourages it to believe that it will never need to go back to the cage for anything. Similarly, reserve the bird’s favorite toys for inside the cage. Finally, don’t build up the expectation that your bird can be outside all the time. Instead of letting it out all day once a week, try to establish a consistent amount of daily time out of the cage to manage expectations.


While you don’t want to make the outside too inviting, you should make sure that your bird gets a good amount of exercise out of the cage. It’s good for its health and a tired bird will be easier to put back in the cage.It can also help to time your birds outside time up with a regular sleeping schedule. That means, put it back in the cage every night before returning to bed. As the lights begin to go off it will understand that it is time to rest."
"
Figure out if the bird is a nestling or a fledgling.A fledgling is a young bird that has all of its feathers, has left its nest of its own will, but its parents still feed and care for it.,
Leave the bird alone, unless the bird is in immediate danger, for instance if it is exposed to predators or traffic.,
Don't touch a fledgling unless you are positive that it needs help.Leave the bird alone and watch it for awhile from a distance.",How to Care for a Fledgling if the Mom Leaves1," This is a normal phase of bird life that humans often misunderstand, as most fledglings that humans come across don't actually need our help.


A nestling, on the other hand, should not be out of the nest yet. A nestling does not have all of its feathers and can't stand up or perch yet. If you have found a nestling, instead of a fledgling, it is more likely to need your help.;
, It's normal for fledglings to be out of the nest and on the ground. In fact, the parents will still feed it when it is on the ground. If the bird is in danger on the ground, however, place it in a tree and out of harms way. At the fledgling developmental stage it should be able to perch, so place it on the branch of a bush a bit off the ground.


If the bird is in your backyard, keep your cats or dogs inside.
Be aware that if the bird is very young and has no feathers, it is a nestling and it probably won't survive out of the nest.

, Pay attention to bird noises and other birds around. Chances are that the fledglings parents will return to it within the hour."
"
Call to your bird as he is flying away.,
Keep your eyes on your bird.,
Go to where you last saw it in the air.,
Bring another pet bird with you.,
Call out for your bird.,
Keep your search to a one-mile radius at first.,
Bring your bird’s cage to the area where you found him.,
Bring your bird’s favorite toys with you.,
Call your bird.,
Capture it.,
Hold the bird gently to prevent harm.",How to Catch a Bird2," If you are there when your bird flies away, call after him using a calm but loud voice. If he realizes he is suddenly in the wild and doesn’t want to be, he will be able to immediately make his way home following the sound of your voice. Seeing his cage might inspire your bird to fly down to you right away, as this is a familiar object in a very unfamiliar world., Chances are your bird will not fly terribly far away, as birds that spend most of their times in their cages tend to not be such strong flyers. Keep your eyes on it until it is out of sight. Pay attention to how low it was flying and how tired it looked; these indicate that it may have landed just out of your line of vision.

, Ask some friends or family members to go with you, as a group of people searching for a bird will be more effective. When you get to the area where you last saw your bird, spread out and circle around the area.

, If you have another pet bird that your escaped bird gets along with, bring this bird with you in her cage. Place the cage where you can see it. The bird in the cage will most likely start calling out to you which in turn might inspire your lost bird to start calling. Listen for your escaped bird’s call., If you don’t have another pet bird, you should try to call to your escaped bird with your voice. Use words and tones that your bird knows or mimics to let him know that it is you. He might call back to you if he is in the area., Pet birds will generally not go far once they have escaped your home. Look in trees, on lawns, and in bushes. Note that during your search, your bird might see you before you see him. Sometimes, birds will get quiet when their owner is near because they feel more comfortable., Once you have located your bird, you should coax it to you. Do not try to grab your bird, no matter how excited you are to see him. You must remain calm or else you could startle your bird into flying again.

, To lure your bird into the cage, you should bring its favorite toys and treats. If the bird is particularly fond of one person, try to have them present as well. All of these items can be used to lure your bird back to you., If you have trained your bird to step up on to your index finger, call out “up.” If well trained, it should come to you on its own.

, If a hose is readily available, spray the bird with large amounts of water in a short period of time. This will make it heavy so that it cannot fly off. Grab it in a way that will secure it in your hands, without applying too much pressure; birds are delicate. If you or your friends lack experience holding a bird, try throwing a pillow case around it instead.It is important not to be too gentle with the hose. If you don’t get the bird sufficiently wet quick enough, it will only be frightened off.
Have friends scattered around to watch what direction the bird flies if it escapes. If they can find a high perch for a good view, even better.
Nighttime can be a good time to catch a bird. They often are tired. Furthermore, if you shine a high powered flashlight in their face, they might be blinded long enough for another person to grab them.

, If the bird resists capture begin by throwing a towel or a pillow case over it to prevent it from flying off. Once the bird is in your hands, you will want to secure its heads, feet, and head without pushing them into awkward positions or slowing the bird's breathing.


A towel can help you secure the bird without applying too much pressure. Covering its face will also reduce the threat that the bird will see something that causes stress. However, you should be sure that it is a breathable cloth towel that does not obstruct the flow of oxygen to the bird."
"
Leave your other birds in their cages by an open window.,
Place a trap.,
Visit a veterinarian after recapture.",How to Catch a Bird3," Birds that don’t spend much time outside probably will not recognize their home.However, your bird may be drawn back home by the sound of their bird calls. You can also try leaving your bird’s cage along with lots of your bird’s favorite food on your front lawn or doorstep. Your bird will be drawn to the familiar cage (and his favorite food)., If you can purchase a trap at a pet store and place it outside with food. This will draw them in. Otherwise, you can try placing an extra cage on your roof with some food and watch for signs of your bird. Either way, it should be placed as high as possible, because birds prefer to be in the air.Check frequently, because your bird will likely panic when captured.
You will want to use what is called a ""live trap,"" which traps the bird without causing physical harm to it. Typically, this will be a cage trap, which, like it sounds, is a cage that will trap any bird that steps inside., It is extremely probable that a domesticated bird left in the wild for an extended period of time will contract some sort of illness or suffer from malnutrition. Take your bird to a vet as soon as possible to check for any problems.


Don’t be disheartened if your bird doesn’t reappear immediately though. Some birds can live for years in the wild."
"
Keep calm.,
Corral your pets away from the bird.,
Close all doors to other rooms.,
Lower your blinds and turn off lights.,
Open one window.,
Use a sheet to encourage the bird to fly out.,
Call a professional.",How to Catch a Bird4," It is important to remember that while you are probably upset that there is a bird in your house, that bird is most likely terrified. The worst thing you could do would be to start screaming and throwing things at the bird--this will only cause it to panic and flutter around your house in a frenzy. Stay calm and remember that the bird is much more scared than you are., If a bird does get into your house, you should put your pets in a room and shut the door so that the bird cannot get in (and your pets can’t get out). In particular, cats love to chase birds., You want to contain the movement of the bird by forcing it to stay in one room. To do this, you should shut all of the doors leading to other rooms so that the bird has no choice but to stay in the room it is in.


If the doorways leading into the room don’t have doors, you can hang towels or blankets in them so that they are blocked. Use push pins to hold the towel or blanket up.

, Closing blinds will reduce the likelihood that the bird will accidentally fly into a closed window thinking that it is an exit. Moreover, if you shut off all light sources, aside from one open window, the bird will be drawn to the window and ultimately should try to fly out., If you leave one open window and eliminate all other light sources, the bird should generally be drawn to it. Stay calm or else you will attract the bird’s attention. Give the bird approximately thirty minutes before trying a new course of action.

, Take a large sheet and hold it with your hands extended as far upward and outward as possible, so as to cover your person. Walk toward the bird shaking the sheet, to scare it in the direction of the window.


Be careful not to touch the bird roughly. Birds are gentle and susceptible to damage from even relatively light contact., Ultimately, some birds are going to want to stay in your house despite all encouragement and certain large predatory birds are too dangerous to engage with. If you are having trouble, research local wildlife removal online and call a professional for assistance."
"
Make sure to wash your hands before and after you handle the bird.,
Move a fledgling, or nestling, out of harms way.If you find a fledgling on a path or near a predator, you can move it a small distance from the danger.,
Place a nestling back in its nest.",How to Care for a Fledgling if the Mom Leaves2," Not doing so could result in transmission of H5N1, or bird flu, as well as spreading germs or bacteria to the baby bird. Of course, if the bird is in dire danger, pick up the bird with a towel or with a light touch and then wash your hands thoroughly after.

, Use a paper towel or rag to lightly grab the bird and move it. Just make sure to be gentle and to make contact as quick as possible.

, Because a nestling is not supposed to be out of a nest, it's important to get it back into that warm, safe place. Look around the area you found the bird before picking it up. Look for bird parents or other babies to get an idea of where the nest might be.


If you can't find the nestlings nest, make it a new one.Get a small basket or box, fill it with soft bedding, such as paper towels, and place it, with the nestling in it, near where you found the bird, except above the ground for safety. You want the parents to easily find the bird but predators not to.
Birds have a very limited sense of smell, so a parent bird will most likely continue to feed a baby bird even if you pick it up and your smell get on it a little bit."
"
Contact a local wildlife rehab or forestry center as quickly as possible.,
Obtain a cage or container to put the bird in.,
Figure out what type of bird the fledgling is.,
Figure out what to feed the bird.,
Feed the bird.,
Prepare to release the bird.",How to Care for a Fledgling if the Mom Leaves3," The goal is to get the bird into the hands of experts as soon as possible. See if they are willing to take in the bird. While organizations like this may not have room for every common species, they may have the facilities to raise orphaned fledglings of rare or endangered species.


If no wildlife rehabilitator is available in your area and you are on your own, you may be able to contact a national or state level organization that can give you help., Make sure the fledgling cannot escape or injure itself in the cage. The bird should have plenty of room and should be placed in a warm and safe room away from predators.


Cover the bottom of the cage with soft padding. Make sure it is in a warm and calm space.
Do NOT put a dish a water in the cage. Baby birds get all the water they need from the food they eat. A bowl of water is just a hazard that the bird might drown in.

, Before you care for the bird you will need to know what kind of bird it is and what it needs to survive. Different types of birds have different diets, so you should find out what the bird eats before you feed it. Note that feeding the incorrect food can cause the bird serious illness.


If you can't identify the bird off the top of your head, look at a book of birds that live in your area.
Look up the bird type online to identify the bird and to see how to take care of it properly.

, It is incredibly important to feed a baby bird the right food. Some species eat mainly fruit and insects whilst others can be fed only special formula. This depends highly on what kind of bird you have and how old it is.


Once you've identified your bird, protein eating birds can be fed a mixture of baby bird food blended with meal or earth worms. Fruit eaters can be fed crushed fresh native berries like blueberries, blackberries,and raspberries in addition to baby bird formula.
Most pet stores carry baby bird formula mix.

, Once you figure out the fledglings nutritional needs, you can use a small baby spoon or straw with the end cut like a scoop and gently feed the bird the mashed up mixture. If you have a needle-less syringe that can be used instead of the spoon, but only small amounts allowing the bird to swallow well.


Taking on the responsibility of feeding the bird is a big one. You will need to feed the bird very often, even throughout the night.In some locations, you even need an ok from local wildlife authorities to raise a wild bird yourself.
Keep in mind that pet and bird stores can help you find a local wildlife rehabilitator and can help you figure out how to properly feed a fledgling.
You can gently massage the birds throat (crop) when it's swallowing the mixture and keep it warm.
Don't force feed the bird, this will result in getting bitten and the bird being overfed. Only force feed if the bird is a fledgling and doesn't accept you as a source of food yet.
Don't try to open it's mouth, it will bite. If you do, wear thin gloves so that no skin tissue is damaged.

, Keep handling to a minimum if you wish to release the bird one day. If the bird imprints on you, or sees you as its species, it will not fear humans and will not survive in the wild.

Visit your veterinarian.,
Complete your bird’s paperwork.,
Help your bird adjust to new carriers.,
Pack non-essential supplies separately.,
Get your bird into the carrier.,
Consider an animal transport company.",How to Pack and Move Your Bird1," Before you make any arrangements to move with your bird, you will need to have it checked out by a veterinarian. This will help you determine if it is healthy enough to travel. Your vet will evaluate your bird and likely provide you with tips to help it stay healthy during the move.Your doctor may suggest that you begin giving your bird immunity and digestion-boosting supplements a month before you move.;
, If you are moving internationally or to another state, you will likely have to get certain health certifications. You will need to visit your vet as well as a local government official to complete the proper paperwork. Make sure you visit your vet and have all necessary paperwork completed ahead of time to ensure that your bird can move with you.If you are moving from the U.S. to another country, you will need to complete the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) form 7001. It will need to be signed by both the vet and a representative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which can take ten days to obtain.
You will also need a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) permit. This can take three weeks to obtain and you will need it for any return visits.
If you are moving abroad or bringing pet birds to the United States, be sure to check with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make sure you have met all of its requirements., If you are using new carriers for transporting your bird, have it spend some time getting used to the new environment before moving day. At least a month before you move, let your bird walk around inside of the new carrier and spend some time exploring it. This will help it be less anxious about being in the container when it comes time to move.Make sure the carrier is big enough to accommodate your bird.
This should also help your bird go into the carrier when it is time to move.

, When you are packing your bird’s toys and supplies, try to only bring the essentials like its food. Many of your bird’s favorite toys, perches, and other items will need to be packed away in another box for safety reasons. Plus, if you are using a carrier, there will be much less space, so you will have to pack strategically.Avoid putting any toys, bowls or perches in the carrier that might fly around during turbulence or an accident.

, If you have introduced your bird to the carrier and allowed it to spend some time in it, getting your animal ready to move should be much easier. If your bird is not trained to hand-perch, place the carrier in its cage with some food inside of it to coax the bird in. If your bird is able to hand-perch, simply carry it over to the carrier and place it in when it is time to go., If you are moving a long distance and do not want to have to worry about your bird, you may want to hire someone to transport it for you. Some moving companies offer this service. If yours does not, they may be able to refer you to a transport service. Depending on how far you are moving, the animal movers will fly or drive your bird to your new home.The moving company may require that you ship your bird in a specific carrier.
Depending on the service, they may also feed your bird or ask you to put some feed in the carrier for the trip.

Contact local wildlife authorities.,
Install bird repellents.,
Construct physical obstructions.",How to Catch a Bird5," Regulations strictly limit what you can do in response to a nuisance bird. However, there are steps that can be taken if birds are destroying your property, their droppings are becoming a health hazard, or they are obstructing the use of gutters. Wildlife authorities might be able to give you a special permit to trap the bird, or provide suggestions about how to drive them off.


Remember, migratory birds will only be around temporarily; it might be best to wait them out., There are a number or devices that can legally be used to drive off birds. These sound emitting devices that scare birds off when they approach an area. Products like the Prowler Owl are designed to trick birds into believing that predators are around.Chemical Polybutylene repellents can also be applied to surfaces that birds are attracted to.


Before installing any of these, you should clean bird droppings from the surface.
Ultrasonic emitters have not been found to be effective. Devices intended to scare birds with loud sounds and bright visuals are also less effective in urban areas, where birds have often acclimated to such distractions., If you know where the birds like to nest, you can build obstructions that will prevent them from settling there. Install a block of wood on ledges at a 45 degree angle so that they can't settle there. Net meshes can be constructed over exterior surfaces."
"
Train your bird.,
Hold your bird so that it can’t fly off.,
Ask your veterinarian about trimming your bird’s wings.",How to Catch a Bird6," You should train your bird to step up on your index finger. Place your index finger in front of it, say “up,” and give it a treat every time it steps up. Practice this even when you aren’t putting it back in the cage, so it doesn’t assume that step up practice will translate into going back into the cage. In fact, sometimes you should put it in the cage and let it come back out, so that it does not know for sure that returning to the cage translates into a prolonged period of enclosure.You can try practicing with things other than your finger, includes sticks. Ladders can be particularly useful because birds naturally like to walk up them. Training your bird to do this can be an easy way to get them back into the cage.
Because birds like to move upward, your bird will often grow fonder of this trick if you begin to lift your finger slowly after it steps up.Some people recommend that you perform this procedure every time you return your bird to its cage. The idea is that, if you allow it to fly back on its own volition it might come to believe that it sets its own schedule for outside time., Once you have it on your index finger, you need to secure your bird so that it can’t fly off, but also so that it is still comfortable. One way to do this is to press your thumb lightly against your index finger, securing the birds feet to your finger. Alternatively, you can hold your other hand over its back gently, so that it will not be able to extend its wings out.You should practice these positions during regular training, so that your bird becomes accustomed to them and does not anticipate that it means a return to the cage. Also, if it becomes second nature, you will be less likely to forget to secure it and allow it to fly off when it is someplace foreign or dangerous., If you are having trouble controlling your bird, you can have its wings trimmed, permitting it to fly only a little or not at all, depending on how short they are clipped.This can, however, be counterproductive, because your bird will not tire itself outside of the cage and might be less willing to return."

Avoid nonstick cookware.,
Use air purifiers.,
Open the windows to let the fresh air pass through your home.,
Temporarily take the cage outside.,
Avoid perfume and air freshener.,
Do not smoke indoors.,
Burn candles in a well ventilated area.,
Use care with methane as it is very poisonous to the birds and often causes respiratory failure and death.",How to Avoid Harming Your Bird with Indoor Air Pollutants," Teflon fumes are highly toxic to birds and causes death. Teflon fumes may be toxic to everyone including us; excessive exposure might result in fever and/or nausea. Birds on the other hand are not that lucky. When non-stick pans are heated beyond 350F they start emitting fumes; this causes the bird's lungs to bleed internally and prolonged exposure causes lungs to be filled with blood and the bird dies due to lack of oxygen.


There are many reported incidences where pet owners lost their healthy birds and later when probed by the Vet admitted to having cooked a big dinner almost always involving non-stick cookware. The autopsy confirms the cause of death.





;
, The average indoor air is six times more polluted than the outdoor air. It’s a great reason to have an air purifier in the family room that benefits everyone.


Make sure you select a traditional air purifier that has a filter to trap the dust. The latest ionic air purifiers release ozone (three atoms of oxygen) that is an oxidant and not good for all of us.

, Of course, we can’t do much about winter months but do take full advantage of the rest of the year. Fresh air and sunlight are always good and healthy, just like us birds need exposure to sunlight to metabolize Vitamin D.


Avoid leaving windows open in winter for your birds, as the cold drafts can easily make small pet birds become uncomfortable.

, Birds love outdoor sounds, smell and air. The environment is very healthy for your bird and the air is clean.


Avoid taking your birds out in winter as they can become too cold and the weather can be too windy. However, you can take advantage of the warm summer months.

, Spray perfume away from your bird’s room, it’s a good idea to turn your exhaust fan and use the perfume in the bathroom. Air fresheners have chemicals that cause irritation in your bird’s respiratory system and most birds are allergic to such products.

, If you’re a smoker, you must be familiar with the term passive smoking. When it comes to your bird, if you have one cigarette it’s equal of your bird having one pack of cigarettes and just look how tiny your bird is. It’s a battle your bird will lose.

, When burning candles make sure the place is well ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

, If your home has gas cooking having a regular maintenance to avoid gas leakage and taking extra caution while cooking can be very effective to prevent accidents.

Release the raptor.",How to Catch a Hawk," Hawks are wild predatory birds and do not make good pets. It costs thousands of dollars a year to properly care for and house a hawk. Additionally, in some countries you need a permit to catch hawks. When you obtain this permit, you will be asked to provide your reasons for catching a hawk. If you catch a hawk without a permit, you may face severe legal consequences.


For example, in the U.S. you can get six months in jail and a $15,000 fine for catching a hawk without a permit.;
, There are strict rules surrounding the capture and release of hawks for falconry. Only experienced, licensed falconers can catch hawks for this purpose. These falconers have completed a year-long apprenticeship and obtained several permits in order to catch falcons.If you’re interested in becoming a falconer, look for local falconry groups in your area. These groups will help you find an apprenticeship with an experienced falconer.
Once you have an apprenticeship, the falconer will help you catch, house, and train hawks.

, Many free-range chicken and rabbit farms have trouble with hawks. However, instead of catching these hawks, use alternative methods of pest control to protect your animals. For example, bring your animals into a barn at night to protect them while they sleep. Other pest control options include:


Installing speakers that play loud noises to scare away hawks
Removing any perching areas, such as poles and isolated trees
Setting up a scarecrow and moving it frequently, If you’ve exhausted all of your pest control options, consider relocating the hawk. You can either call your local wildlife service or try to relocate the hawk yourself. Keep in mind that relocating a hawk is expensive, time intensive, and potentially dangerous.


Always relocate problem hawks instead of killing them. Hawks are an important part of the ecosystem that prevent overpopulation of rabbits, mice, and smaller birds.

, Many countries require permits to trap and relocate hawks. These permits can be expensive and often take a lot of time to obtain. However, if you don’t get a permit before catching a hawk, you may face severe fines or jail time. To obtain a permit, contact your local wildlife service.For example, if you catch a hawk without a permit in the US, you can face six months of jail time and a $15,000 fine., There are many kinds of hawk traps available for use. However, the Swedish goshawk trap is the best option for inexperienced hawk trappers. This trap allows you to humanely capture a hawk without injuring it or tangling its legs up in a noose.Additionally, you only need to check these traps a few times a day.


Other kinds of traps need to be constantly monitored. A bird that is left in any other kind of trap is easy prey for another predator.
These traps can be purchased online or built under the supervision of an experienced falconer.

, Assemble the trap according to the manufacturer instructions. Next, place the trap in an area that the hawk frequents. Make sure the trap can be viewed by a bird in flight. If you place it under a tree or shrub, the hawk may not see it.


Make sure the trap is easily accessible. You will need to check the trap often.
Plan to relocate the bird as soon as it’s caught. If you won’t have time, don’t set out the trap.

, Use pigeons, starlings, sparrows, zebra finches, or mice to attract hawks. If necessary, you can use grasshoppers. However, grasshoppers are not very tempting to larger birds.Refer to the manufacturer instructions to find out how to place the bait in your trap.
Most goshawk traps have “bait boxes” that protect the bait from the hawk. After catching the hawk, you can release the bait if you’d like.

, The trap needs to be checked at least twice a day. The Swedish goshawk trap will protect the hawk from other predators. However, the bird can still become dehydrated or overheated if it’s left alone for too long.

, There are many raptor rehabilitation facilities that will happily pick up and release any hawks you catch. Do an internet search to find one in your area. Even if they’re too far away to come get the bird, they will be able to give you valuable tips on where to release it., First, cover the trap with a blanket to block out any light. This will help keep the bird calm as you move it.Next, carefully lift the trap and place it securely in the trunk of your car. Turn on the air-conditioning as hawks can overheat easily in small spaces.


If your trunk isn’t big enough for the trap, place it on a seat. Use a seatbelt to secure it.
Lay a thick towel down under the trap to protect your car from bird droppings.

, When you relocate a hawk, you give it a new place to hunt and build nests. However, you need to drive at least 20 miles (32 kilometers) away from your home before releasing the bird. Otherwise, it will return to its old hunting grounds.


If the hawk is injured, immediately take it to a raptor rehabilitation center., Set the trap in a secluded area. Remove the cloth from the top of the trap and carefully open one of the doors. Stand away from the trap to allow the bird to leave at its own pace. Don’t leave until the bird has left the trap.


Wear thick gloves to protect your hands while you open the trap.
If the hawk refuses to leave the trap, it may be dehydrated or sick. Call your local raptor rehabilitation center for advice.

Plan to stay at pet-friendly locations.,
Take your bird on short rides.,
Secure the carrier or cage.,
Keep the car temperate.,
Cover the cage or carrier.,
Maintain the bird’s routine.,
Reassure the bird.",How to Pack and Move Your Bird2," As you plan the route to your new home, make reservations to stay at hotels that accommodate pets. You will not want to leave your bird unattended in the vehicle overnight. If you are staying with friends or family, make sure that they are aware of your bird’s needs. Avoid staying in loud, smoky or busy places that might impair your bird’s health.Be sure to bring cloth or newspaper to place under your bird’s cage to protect your room’s carpet.

, Before you leave, put your bird in its carrier or cage and drive it around in your car. This will help it get comfortable with riding in a car and limit its anxiety during your road trip. Try to make it as similar to the actual moving experience as you can. You may even want to include some boxes in your car to help your bird adjust to being hemmed in., On moving day, be sure to place the bird cage or carrier in the backseat of your car. If you are moving the bird in its cage, be sure to remove all perches and toys to avoid injuring your bird during the move. If your bird is particularly anxious, you may want to pad the inside of its cage to prevent it from hurting itself.If you are using a moving truck, do not pack the bird with your other items. The contents of the truck may shift and crush your bird. Instead, have someone drive your car and place the bird in the backseat. If that is not an option, hire a pet transport company to move your animal.
Never place it in the front seat where it can be smashed by the airbags during an accident.

, Because birds are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment, you will want to keep your car at a comfortable temperature. Do not let it get too hot or too cold. You will also want to keep your bird out of direct sunlight.Consider using a glare guard to keep your bird cool and out of the sun.

, If your bird is particularly anxious, you may want to consider covering its cage with a blanket. However, this may be dangerous for your bird if it stumbles and hurts itself in the dark. If you do cover your bird’s cage, make sure that the space is free of any toys or perches that the bird could fall on., The most important thing to consider while moving your bird is how to maintain its routine. The more you are able to simulate your bird’s normal activities, the less anxious it will be. One of the easiest ways to do this is by maintaining its diet. Feed your bird its normal foods and follow its typical feeding schedule. Maintaining a consistent diet will limit your bird’s anxiety and keep it from getting sick during the move.Bring a water purifier or bottled water for your bird. Do not give it tap water.
Consider giving the bird fresh fruit regularly. This will limit the bird’s need for drinking water.

, During the move, it is important that you talk to the bird. This will help it relax. If your bird is okay with not being covered, you may also want to position it so that it can see you. Your mood will also dictate the bird’s attitude. If you get angry or frustrated, the bird will get anxious. Try to stay calm for you and the bird’s sake."

Put your bird in an avian harness or have its wings trimmed.,
Care for the bird.",How to Pack and Move Your Bird3," The rules about flying with pet birds vary by airline. Some require certain types of bird carriers, while others limit the numbers of birds in the cabin. Before you make your arrangements, research which airline will be the best for transporting your bird or birds. Depending on the airline, your pets may have to travel in the pressurized and climate controlled cargo hold.Loud birds are not allowed in the cabin of any airline.
Birds are not allowed in the cabin on international flights.
If it is stored in the cargo hold, certain airlines require that you cover the bird’s cage in a wire mesh or a heavy cloth.
If your bird is traveling in the cargo hold, you may also be required to cover the bottom of its cage or carrier with newspaper to prevent a mess.

, Making connecting flights can be a stressful event for a human. The experience is even worse for a bird that can be easily overstimulated by the cacophony of an airport terminal. This can be particularly problematic if your connecting flight is in another country and your bird has to go through customs. In order to make things more relaxing for your bird, book a one way flight so that it only has to deal with the anxieties of an airport twice., TSA agents may ask you to remove your bird from its carrier when you pass through security. If your bird gets startled, placing it in a harness or having its wings trimmed will keep it from flying around the airport. This will also keep your bird from hurting itself if it happens to get out of its carrier at any other point in your journey., If your bird has to travel in the cargo hold, you will need to provide it with enough seeds and fresh fruit to sustain it during the trip. The fruit will help feed it and keep it hydrated on a long trip. If the bird is able to travel with you in the cabin, plan ahead and bring enough snacks for your bird.Do not put toys in the cage or carrier with your bird. They could become dangerous projectiles if the plane hits any turbulence.

"
Transfer your bird to a regular cage.,
Place the bird in a quiet room initially.,
Continue feeding it normally.,
Visit your new veterinarian.",How to Pack and Move Your Bird4," If you moved your bird in a carrier, return it to its regular cage when you get to your destination. The familiarity of the cage will help it adapt to its new surroundings and limit its anxiety about being in a new place. Unpack your bird’s toys and place them in the cage as soon as you can., While you unpack and set up the house, place your bird in a quiet room away from the commotion of moving in. The chaos of unpacking will likely stress out your bird. If you can, place the bird in the location where its cage will normally be so that it can adjust to its new home., If you were able to continue your bird’s feeding habits during the move, continue feeding it normally. If you got off of the eating schedule during the move, try to get your bird back on its routine. Recreating its routine will help it acclimate to its new home., If your bird still seems particularly agitated after you have been in your new home for a while, consider taking it to a vet. It may be ill or experiencing some kind of complication from the move. It is also a good idea to introduce your bird to the new veterinarian as soon as possible."

Be vigilant.,
Inform others.,
Never harass magpies.,
Take evasive action.,
Do not return after an encounter.,
Improvise solutions.,
Attach a steel nut to the end of a piece of string.,
Be aware that very aggressive magpies can attack from the ground, aiming for the face and eyes.,
Have a heart.,
Start an online magpie database for your area.",How to Keep Safe from Swooping Australian Magpies," Pay attention to nesting areas of magpies. If you see magpie nesting activity occurring in an area where you walk or cycle, it is time to plot a new route for the nesting season. Magpies occur in both urban, country and rural settings, so don't be complacent if you live in Concreteville, you are just as likely to have gum trees in your area that attract nesting magpies.;
, Tell the local council of magpie nesting in your area. This will permit the council to leave warning notices out that will alert everyone in the area to take care. In the meantime, make your own temporary sign to help alert others.

, A magpie who has experienced harassment will cease to trust humans. Do not throw rocks or other projectiles at a nest, do not climb a tree and try to remove magpie chicks from the nest and do not provoke the magpies in any way, such as swinging clothes around in the air near them or similar fast-moving and threatening actions. Remember that the magpies are fiercely family protective and will react if they feel the chicks are threatened.

, If you find yourself walking or cycling through magpie swooping territory and it is simply too late to back out, take evasive measures to protect yourself:



Keep calm. This is the most important thing - do not yell, flap your arms about and run off screaming. This is a panicked reaction and is the worst thing that you can do. Unfortunately, it is something children often do, so train them early to keep calm.
Walk quickly but do not run. Be careful, keep your eyes out for magpies and if you are really concerned, place your folded arms above your head to protect your head and eye area.
Try to keep your eye on the magpie. Magpies usually swoop from behind and it is known that magpies are much less likely to swoop if they are being watched directly. This means the magpie must be able to see your eyes looking towards him. As you walk away, try to maintain this eye contact. You can also try walking backwards but only if the path is clear or you may injure yourself by tripping over something.
If you are on your bicycle or horse, dismount. Bicycles irritate magpies the most and this includes the local postie delivering the mail. The major cause of accidents following a magpie swoop is from a bicycle. Your helmet will protect you and you will not be distracted while riding by a bird swooping in your face. Walk the bike quickly out of the vicinity of the magpie.

, Australian magpies have an incredible memory and will attack the same people again and again. It is also too bad if you happen to look like someone they attacked before...

, If you have no choice but to continue using the magpie's area (for example, farmers rarely have a choice to leave an area alone for 6 weeks), then it is time to use some techniques to protect yourself. Some suggestions include:


Wear eyes in the back of your head. No, this is not a joke! For the reason provided above, it is following the reasoning that magpies are less likely to attack if you are looking at them. To this end, add fake eyes to your headgear to make the magpie think you are watching it from either side of your head. Craft store bought eyes are ideal - stick them on and remove them when not needed. Another trick is to wear your sunglasses back to front.
If you are riding a bike the helmet can be used to mount a number of bright zip-ties. By not cutting the excess length you create a bright distracting display that many people find more effective than fake eyes, or use them in combination with fake eyes.
Convert an ice cream container into a hat. Staple some elastic to the sides to make a chinstrap and pop it on your head. If the magpie swoops, it hits plastic and does less damage (hopefully none).
Wear a solid hat.
Use an umbrella or stick. If you have an umbrella, open it up and walk with it. The added bonus is that it keeps off the sun too! If you have a stick, simply hold it up to make yourself look larger. If the magpie attacks, it will likely go for the highest point - your stick or umbrella. Under no circumstances should you wave objects at the magpie or he may feel provoked and will attack you. A branch with leaves can be good as the movement of the leaves in the wind might be discouraging to the would-be swooper.

, Swing it above your head. You look like a helicopter wannabe but the magpie doesn't want to get caught in that action!


Be unpredictable. Magpies can tell the time if you are regular. Be irregular and don't follow a routine. That way, the magpie is less likely to be ready for you.

, These are problem birds and you should alert the Parks or Environment Department in your State or Territory immediately. If you encounter a bird in this situation, cover and protect your eyes no matter what else and move yourself out of the situation.

, These birds are highly intelligent and family-loving. Their birdsong is uplifting and this is not even mentioning how elegant a bird they are. Sure, swooping can be a bother for 4 to 6 weeks of your life each year but it is a small price to pay for helping to sustain a beautiful part of the Australian wildlife. Co-existing with magpies is easy to do once you understand how and when you are prepared. It is only a small proportion of magpies who see humans as a threat and resort to swooping and even then, only within a limited territorial area.

, Cyclists, horse riders, joggers and pedestrians could all benefit from an online magpie database that services your area. You could even make it a wiki! Leave times, places and incident reports to alert others to be prudent.

For a list of suggested cage sizes by bird, see bird-cage.com. In general:The minimum height should be 3 times the length from head to tail of the bird.
There should be at least 2 wing beats between perches.
Your bird should be able to turn around on his perch without his tail feathers hitting the cage.
Even small birds require large cages. Two finches, for instance, require 3-4 square feet of space, so they will have room to fly around.;
, Your bird should not be able to put its head between the bars. Appropriate bar widths are:Under ½” – For small birds such as finches, canaries, parrotlets, parakeets, and lovebirds
1/2” to 3/4” – For medium birds such as cockatiels, conures, lories, and senegals
3/4” to 1-1/4” – For large birds such as African greys, Amazons, macaws, and cockatoos

, Adding more corners decreases the flight area and makes the cage less safe.A long low cage is better than a narrow high one (such as a parrot cage) because it allows the birds to fly and glide.

, Your bird will spend most of its time standing, so having an adequate number of perches is vital to your bird’s health and happiness. For most birds, you will want to provide a natural branch perch and a manmade perch, one near the food and water and another near the toys, as well as a concrete perch elsewhere in the cage. Be sure to avoid plastic perches, which can cause problems if eaten, and sandpaper perches, which can scratch your bird’s feet.Concrete perch – These solid perches provide a good place for birds to groom. They should be set away from food, water and toys.
Natural branch perch – These are better than wooden dowels because their uneven shape means the bird will put pressure on different parts of its feet each time it perches. Choose branches from orchard wood trees such as apple, plum, pear, but not cherry. Cut the branch to fit the cage, scrub and clean it with detergent, and let it dry in the sun. Next, heat the branch for 45 minutes in a 200°F oven to kill any insects. Allow to cool before placing it in your bird’s cage.
Manmade perch – Untreated cotton rope makes for a good perch, as it is toxin free and can be easily washed.

, Your bird will spend countless hours trying to open the door to its cage, so the door had better be escape-proof. If you are worried that your bird might escape, you can use a padlock, clip, or small carabiner to secure the door., Double-check your bird’s seed and water supply daily, especially if a child is in charge of caring for the bird. If using a water bottle, check to be sure that it is unclogged and working properly. Three days without water is enough to kill most birds., Birds need to bathe regularly to keep their feathers and skin healthy. Always use room temperature water, as hot water will strip essential oils from your bird’s feathers. If you put a birdbath in your bird’s cage, make sure to clean it and change the water daily. Alternately, you can mist your bird with a spray bottle once or twice a week. Some birds like to wash in the sink or even in the shower., Your bird will chew on its toys, so make sure they are not made from wood treated with toxic chemicals or soft plastic that you bird can swallow. Be sure to rotate toys at least once a week to keep your bird stimulated, as boredom can lead to health problems in your bird., You can use a cover designed for the cage, though an old sheet or pillowcase also works fine. Covering your bird’s cage keeps out drafts and allows the bird to sleep even when you are up late with the lights on. Birds need at least 10 hours of sleep a night, so providing a dark, quiet area for your bird at night is important to prevent sleep deprivation., Wood shavings and chips are dusty and can irritate your bird’s respiratory system. Use newspaper and be sure to change it daily., To prevent the spread of germs and disease, you need to make sure your bird’s cage is cleaned and disinfected regularly. This means changing the liner, cleaning the dishes, and rinsing and refilling the birdbath daily for all birds. An additional deep clean is needed weekly for large birds or groups of small birds, and monthly for single smaller birds. For the deep clean:Clean the cage – Remove the bird and all toys and perches. Clean up all seeds and droppings from the cage and scrub it with hot soapy water, and then spray with a disinfectant. Rinse and let air dry completely before replacing toys and perches.
Clean the perches and toys – Remove droppings with dishwashing detergent. Use sandpaper if necessary to clean dropping off of wooden perches and toys. Wash and rinse by hand or in dishwasher, and then spray with disinfectant. Rinse thoroughly and air dry or oven dry (250° for 10-15 minutes) before returning items to the cage.
Save time by having two sets of toys and perches and even two cages, so that your bird can be comfortable in one while you clean the other.

, You can buy one at your pet shop, or make your own, following one of these recipes:


Mix 3 cups of hot water, 3 tablespoons of baking soda, and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice in a spray bottle.Mix 1 cup of distilled vinegar and 1 gallon of water., Your bird’s dishes should be cleaned daily with hot soapy water or in the dishwasher. Do not locate them under perches, where they will be contaminated with bird droppings.Be sure food dishes are completely dry before returning them to the cage, as wet food pellets can mold quickly.

, The temperature fluctuates too much in kitchens, and cooking can produce fumes toxic to birds. Bathrooms also feature dangerous heat fluctuations, particularly during showers, as well as toxic chemicals from hairsprays and other grooming products., For all birds, you’ll want to avoid areas with a lot of traffic and noise, as this can make your bird anxious.Beyond that, you’ll need to select an area that fits your bird. If your bird loves attention, then place it in an area with more activity. Less social birds will be happier in quiet areas of your home.More social birds: Amazon parrots, lovebirds, lorikeets, conures, African greys, cockatoos, macaws
Medium social birds: budgies, parakeets, cockatiels, pionus, quaker parakeets
Less social birds: finches, canaries, doves

, The ideal place to put your bird’s cage is in a corner, but having at least one side of your bird’s cage against a wall will give it a sense of security. Don’t put your bird’s cage in front of a window, as this produces dangerous temperature fluctuations, and dogs, hawks, and storms outside the window can frighten your bird., Birds become anxious when placed too low. Placing them too high can lead to behavior problems, as height is associated with superiority for birds., Birds are sensitive to sudden temperature changes, so keep your home at a constant temperature and be sure your bird’s cage is not in the draft of a heat or air conditioning vent., Plants like oleanders, azaleas, poinsettias, philodendron, ivy, African violets, tulips, daffodils, and hydrangeas are all naturally toxic to birds and should be kept far from your bird’s cage.For a complete list of safe and toxic plants, see here.

, If you have a cat or dog, be sure that your bird has a very sturdy cage that cannot be toppled. Also be certain that your cat cannot fit its paw through the bars.Even if your bird is safe, you should know that living with a cat can be stressful for birds.

, Bird’s lungs are designed to be extremely efficient at absorbing oxygen, which unfortunately means they also quickly absorb toxins. Combined with their small size and high metabolism, this means that only a small amount of toxin can kill a bird. The coating in non-stick cookware contains polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a compound that can be deadly to birds. At normal cooking temperatures (250°F to 450°F), with a vent fan on, PTFE-coated pans are safe. But they can release toxic fumes when:A PTFE-coated pan boils dry or is heated while empty. Never boil water in a PTFE coated pan.
Used as a drip pan under burners. PTFE releases toxic chemicals starting at 536°F, and drip pans can easily reach 600°F or hotter.
Scratched. Scratched or otherwise damaged non-stick pans can release toxic chemicals at lower temperatures. Throw them out.

, PTFE is not just used in cookware, but also in many products that must withstand high temperatures. Consider replacing any of the following, or call the manufacturer to see if the product is safe for use around your bird:Stain repellants like StainMaster and Scotchguard
Space heaters and heat lamp covers
Non-stick irons and ironing board covers
Hair dryers
Non-stick cooking devices like griddles, waffle makers, electric skillets, bread makers, and popcorn poppers
Non-stick slow cookers
Ceramic cooking stoves

, PTFE coated products are the most common source of toxicity for birds, but far from the only one. The following can prove fatal to your bird:Carbon monoxide – Invisible, tasteless, and odorless, carbon monoxide is produced by fires, automobile exhaust, and central heating units. Even if you don’t have a bird, you should have a carbon monoxide detector in your home to protect you and your family.
Natural gas – If you use gas for heat or cooking, a leak in the line or an unlit pilot light can result in high levels of natural gas that can prove fatal for birds (and deadly for people). Check your pilots regularly, and position your bird’s cage far from sources of natural gas like fireplaces or heaters.Overheated cooking surfaces. Don’t heat oil or butter on high, as this can produce dangerous fumes. And take your bird out of the house if using the “self clean” mode on your oven.
Hair sprays, perfumes, spray-on cooking oil. Basically, anything that sprays, particularly aerosols, can release chemicals that are dangerous to your bird. Move your bird to a separate, well-ventilated room before using these products.Pesticides like bug bombs or insect sprays.
Organic solvents found in nail polish remover, gasoline, glue, paint, or mothballs.

, Ammonia is found in many household cleaners, particularly glass cleaners, and can cause respiratory difficulty in birds. When combined with bleach in cleaning products, it produces chloramine gas, which is highly toxic.Try using these cleaners instead:Dishwashing soap and water
White vinegar and water (1 cup vinegar per 2 gallons of water)
Steam from a handheld steamer
Laundry detergent for fabrics (but don’t use fabric softener on fabrics your bird will touch)
Grapefruit seed extract (about 35 drops ber 32oz. of water), makes for an effective disinfectantBaking soda (1/4 cup per gallon of water)

, Your bird should be taken outside or to another, well-ventilated room when using plug-in or spray air fresheners, as they contain essential oils that are toxic to birds. Many scented candles are also dangerous, as they contain essential oils and often have zinc alloy wicks. If you are going to burn candles, make sure they are 100% beeswax with all cotton wicks., Exposure to second hand smoke has been shown to cause respiratory and circulatory problems in birds, as well as eye and skin problems.If you are going to smoke, do so outside to protect your bird.

, Most particleboard, plywood, and drywall use formaldehyde in the glue that holds them together. The glue that holds down carpets can also contain formaldehyde. New construction, new carpeting, and many types of furniture need time to “off-gas” before they cease releasing formaldehyde, so do not place your bird in a newly constructed room, a newly-carpeted room, or in a room with new furniture built with particle board or plywood., It is important to your bird’s health that it has some time each day to fly outside its cage. You must be sure to create a safe environment for it to do so., Even cats that have grown up around birds will often try to kill them if given the chance. Many types of dogs will also do their best to kill birds. To be on the safe side, you should not let your bird out when other pets are in the room. If you do, make sure you are there as well to keep your bird safe., Birds love to chew on things, so make sure you remove all toxic plants before letting your bird out of its cage. For a list of toxic plants, see here.

, If it’s out, your bird will probably give it a try, and many human foods are toxic to birds, including:Alcohol
Chocolate
Caffeine
Avocado
Raw meat
Raw dairy
Seeds from apples
Pits from stone fruits (apricots, cherries, peaches, and plums)
Peanuts
Raw onions
Cassava root
Raw mushrooms
Rhubarb

, Birds can drown in a glass of water, uncovered aquarium, or open toilet. If you are not going to keep a careful eye on your bird the entire time it is out of its cage, you’ll need to be sure to remove all access to open water to prevent drowning., Again, birds like to chew on anything they can get their beaks on. Hide electrical cords and wires to avoid electrocution, and put away antiques, which may be coated with heavy-metal based paints that can cause led-poisoning., First off, you’ll want to make sure doors and windows to the outside are closed to keep your pet from flying away. Secondly, you’ll need to always make sure your bird is not on the hinge area or the top of a door or cupboard you are closing, or you could accidently crush the legs of your pet., Birds can get their heads tangled in the strings and strangle themselves., Standing fans and ceiling fans can both cause serious injury or death to your bird. Always check to be sure they are off before letting your bird out of its cage., Your bird does not understand glass. It may injure itself by flying into a mirror or closed window. To prevent this, you can put decals on them so your bird knows they are solid, or simply lower the shades or cover your mirrors."

Examine any spurs.",How to Sex Turkeys," Male turkeys are larger than female turkeys. If you're watching a group of turkeys, any adult male turkey should appear notably larger than any nearby females.


Adult males usually weigh between 16 and 24 pounds (7.2 and 10.8 kg), but adult females usually weigh between 8 and 10 pounds (3.6 and 4.5 kg).
The size of a turkey can be difficult to judge from a distance, though, especially if the turkey is by itself or if the group is scattered across uneven ground. As such, this is rarely an attribute that can be used to sex turkeys by itself, but it can still be good to know as a method of confirmation when other characteristics are identified first.;
, Adult male turkeys have a beard of modified feathers running down the chest. Female turkeys do not have a beard.Turkey beards look as though they're made of hair, but in actuality, the beards consist of unique feathers that form a stiff bristle.
Note that 10 to 20 percent of female turkeys also grow beards, so this method of sexing is not always accurate when used by itself.
Do not confuse the beard with the caruncle or snood. Caruncles are fleshy growths on top of the head and snoods are fleshy growths hanging over the bill of the bird. Both sexes have these growths, even though the snood of an adult male is usually somewhat larger than that of a female turkey.

, Female turkeys have small feathers that extend over the top of their heads, but most male turkeys have completely featherless heads.


Additionally, a male turkey's head will change in color depending on his current level of excitement, especially during mating season. The head can switch from red to blue to white, and this chance can happen within seconds.
Note that female turkeys generally have gray-blue flesh that might be visible beneath the small feathers on their heads.

, Male turkeys have more brightly colored feathers. Females, on the other hand, have a duller, drabber appearance.


More specifically, males can have feathers that have an iridescent red, green, copper, bronze, or gold sheen. Males use these brightly colored feathers to attract females during breeding season, and more brightly colored males generally have the greatest success.
Females have brown or gray feathers that lack iridescence. The task of attracting a mate falls to the male turkey, which is why brightly colored feathers are not a necessity for females. Moreover, the drab colors help females blend into their surroundings, making it safer for them to sit and guard their nests.

, Male turkeys frequently raise their tails into the shape of a fan. On the other hand, a female turkey will keep her tail down and won't fan it out.


Fanning the tail is an act of dominance. Males generally perform this act when attempting to attract a mate or when trying to scare off potential threats.

, The legs of a male turkey will have spurs or small spike-shaped bumps that should be visible from a moderate distance. Female turkeys have smooth, spur-free legs.


Spurs are used for the purposes of defense and dominance. Male turkeys will use them to attack predators and rivals during mating season.
Aside from the presence and absence of leg spurs, the appearance of the female and male turkey leg is the same. Both genders have reddish-orange legs with four toes on each foot.

, Only male turkeys make the well-known ""gobble"" noise. Female turkeys will softly cluck or yelp, but they generally don't gobble.


Like fanning the tail, gobbling is an act of dominance. Males gobble to scare predators and potential rivals.

, The lower breast feathers of an adult male turkey will have black tips. Female turkeys have breast feathers that are tipped in either white, brown, or bronze.When checking breast feathers, only look at the lower two-thirds of the breast.
Note that this is only accurate when dealing with adult turkeys, however. All juvenile turkeys have buff-tipped feathers, so the coloration may look like a female feather even when the turkey is male.

, In addition to being bigger overall, male turkeys also have longer legs than female turkeys have.Most males have legs roughly 6 inches (15 cm) long, but female legs are usually only 4.5 inches (11.5 cm).

, The beard of an adult male turkey is longer than that of an immature male. Typically, immature male turkeys have beards measuring 6 inches (15 cm) or shorter.


At the age of two, most turkeys will have a beard between 9 and 10 inches (23 and 25 cm). Turkeys with beard beyond 10 inches (25 cm) are usually older than three years, but most beards do not exceed 11 inches (28 cm).

, More precisely, look at tips of the wing feathers. The white striping that decorates the rest of each feather should extend all the way to the tip of the feather if the turkey is an adult male, but juvenile males have undecorated tips.


The tip of an adult feather is usually rounded, too, but juvenile feathers are more pointed.
For best results, spread the wing out until it is in a fully fanned position and check the outermost feather. The coloration and shape of the other wing feathers can change at different paces, so the outermost wing feather will give you the most accurate results.

, Fan out the tail feathers of the turkey or wait for him to do so himself. The central tail feathers of an immature male are longer than the rest, but all tail feathers arch evenly on an adult male.


Both adults and juvenile turkeys will have banding across the tail. The color of the band will vary based on subspecies and does not typically reflect a difference in age.
Note that adult tail feathers are usually 12 to 15 inches (30.5 and 38 cm) long, while juvenile tail feathers are usually shorter. The exact length of juvenile tail feathers will vary depending on the exact age and overall growth of the bird, though.

, All juvenile turkeys have buff-tipped feathers on the lower two-thirds of the breast, regardless of sex.


Note that juvenile breast feathers also tend to be more slender, and the tips are generally rounded. Adult breast feathers have squared tips.

, Both juvenile and adult male turkeys have leg spurs, but the spurs on a young male will look more like stubs since they are still developing.Immature males will have spurs that are less than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) long.
At the age of two, adult males have spurs between 1/2 and 7/8 inch (1.25 and 2.2 cm). At the age of three, this increases to a size between 7/8 and 1 inch (2.2 and 2.5 cm). Male turkeys over the age of four can have spurs measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) or longer.

Wait until the guinea fowls are older.,
Listen for the call of a male guinea fowl.,
Listen for the call for a female guinea fowl.",How to Tell the Sex of Guinea Fowl1," The sex of a guinea fowl can be determined most reliably by its vocalizations. Guinea fowls do not begin to vocalize until they are about 8 weeks old.If you have young guinea fowls, known as keets, wait until they are around 2 months old before listening for their vocalizations.Female guinea fowls may not start vocalizing until much later in life, so you may have to wait even longer to determine the sex of your guinea fowls.;
, Male guinea fowls make a 1-syllable call that sounds like ‘chek.’The male’s vocalization will either be a chirp or a yelp repeated at varying intervals.The vocalization has also been compared to the sound of a machine gun., This is where things can get a little tricky, since female guinea fowls also make the 1-syllable ‘chek’ sound. However, females also make a 2-syllable call that can sound like a variety of words, like ‘buckwheat,’ ‘put-rock,’ or ‘qua-track.’Typically, the first syllable will be short and the second syllable will be longer and rising in tone."

Set up your incubator at least 24 hours before you put the eggs in.,
Fill the lower channel with water to ensure adequate humidity.

,
Place two thermometers in the incubator.,
Attach a fabric extension to the bulb of one thermometer and make sure that the other end is in the water channel underneath.,
Make sure the temperature is stable at or around 99 degrees Fahrenheit (~37 degrees Celsius), and the wet-bulb temperature stays between 85 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (~29 and 37.5 degrees Celsius).

,
Mark the eggs with a regular pencil.,
Place the eggs gently in the incubator.,
On the 25th day, stop turning the eggs.",How to Hatch Turkey Eggs in an Incubator,";
,, Make sure they are elevated to half the height of the eggs (usually about 1 inch). You can get disposable plastic cups and cut them to the desired height to act as platforms for the thermometers.

, This thermometer, called a wet-bulb thermometer, will give you a rough idea of the humidity in the incubator, but only if the fabric is wet.

,, Put an ""X"" on one side and an ""O"" on the other (when the eggs are laying flat on their sides). This is so that when you turn them, you'll be able to turn them exactly 180 degrees. Do not use a colored pencil, a pen, or a marker - these contain chemicals that will harm the turkey through the shell.

, Have them all with the same letter facing up. For 25 Days: Turn all the eggs three to five times every 24 hours. This prevents the turkey inside from sticking to the shell.

, This is so the turkey can get into hatching position. In approx three days, on the 28th day, they will hatch. When turkeys hatch out, they may roll over the others' eggs, use the turning marks to keep the same side up.

They are not as tame as chickens, and they are hard to catch if you let them roam.;
, Make sure you have a fully enclosed coop ready before you bring your new guinea fowl home. They can fly, so they will escape if they are not kept in an enclosed coop.Even if you plan to let your guineas roam freely, you will need the coop to get started.
Your coop should provide at least three to four square feet of space per bird. You should provide more space if you do not plan on allowing them to roam freely after the training period.Be sure to provide food and water in the coop, as well as clean bedding on the floor and perches for your birds to roost on.

, Once your guineas are free-roaming, you do not need to provide them with a shelter, but doing so can help protect them against predators like foxes and owls. If you don't provide a shelter, your guineas will roost in the trees at night. A shelter is different from a coop in that it allows the guineas to come and go as they please.Your shelter can be as simple as a three-sided shed with a wire front. Be sure to put a perch near the back of the shelter that is long enough so that each bird has several inches of space to roost.
Make sure the space is dry and has clean bedding on the floor.Provide a light in the shelter, as guineas don't like entering dark buildingsIt's best for your shelter to have two entries to prevent more dominant guineas from blocking the entrance.If you want to provide even more protection, you can keep your guineas in a coop at night. To keep them inside, cover the top with wire. If they are not free-roaming guineas, you can clip their wings to prevent them from flying away.

, Once you have a space designated for your guineas, it's time to choose your birds. You can buy them from local breeders, feed stores, or online sellers.You can choose to buy adult guineas if you want, but they will be easier to tame if you raise them from keets.
Guinea fowl are available in a variety of ""pure-bred"" colors, but many of the birds are cross-bred, resulting in multicolored feathers. The feather color is the only difference between the different varieties.
Guineas are monogamous creatures, so it's best buy them in male-female pairs. It's very tricky to tell male and female guineas apart, but it is possible if you look for these three things:

Males have larger wattles than females.
Males make a single-syllable sound, while females make a two-syllable sound.
Males have a narrower opening between their pelvic bones than females. If you hold the guinea under one arm and use your free hand to feel the bones, you should notice a distance of about two fingers on males and three fingers on females.



, Your guineas will need a little time to get used to their new home before you allow them to roam free. Keep them in the coop for at least one week. Once they've acclimated, they will most likely return to their home, so you can let them roam.Even if your guineas fly away at first, they will more than likely return home to roost at night.
To help get your guineas accustomed to returning home at night, feed them in their shelter in the evenings., Guinea fowl are very easy to feed, although their dietary needs will depend upon whether you keep them penned or allow them to roam and forage.When allowed to roam, guinea fowl will eat all sorts of critters in your yard, including ticks, grasshoppers, spiders, and small snakes. You don't need to provide them with any additional food, except some mixed grains in their shelter at night if you want to encourage them to spend the night there.
If you keep your guineas penned, feed them store-bought chicken feed (one pound per day for every six guineas). To increase egg production, switch them to a higher protein feed formulated for turkeys and wild fowl in February, which is just before the beginning of egg laying season.
Your guineas will also rely on you to provide a constant source of fresh water. You can buy a waterer for poultry, which holds a large amount of water and dispenses it little by little into a small dish. Keep in mind that it will need to be heated to keep the water from freezing if you live in a cold climate., Because guineas roam free, they can build their nests and lay their eggs almost anywhere. In order to find them, follow them at a distance during the mid-morning to early afternoon hours, when they are most likely to lay eggs. Once you've identified a nest, wait for the bird to leave and gather some eggs.Unlike chickens, guineas lay eggs seasonally, so you'll only have them between March and May.
Guineas make their nests on the ground, but they like to try to conceal them with tall grasses. They also share their nests with other guineas frequently.Taking all of the eggs may discourage the hen from laying more in that nest, so always leave a few behind.

, Guinea fowl are not very good at taking care of their delicate little keets, so you will have to put in some work to raise them.If you notice that a nest has been abandoned, move the eggs to an incubator right away. You can use a store-bought incubator, following the instructions for incubating turkey or pheasant eggs if no specific instructions are provided for guinea eggs. The incubation period is between 26 and 28 days.Once the keets hatch, you will need to care for them until they have fully developed feathers and can be released with the rest of the flock.
If you also raise chickens, a broody hen can be used to hatch the eggs and raise the keets.
Turkeys can also make suitable replacement mothers.When you release the keets, keep them confined to their outdoor coop for at least a week so they will get used to their new home.

, You will need to keep the keets contained in a box for the first six to eight weeks. A 16"" x 28"" box will provide enough space for about 15 keets. Keets are very delicate, so be sure to provide adequate space for them to prevent trampling. If they appear to be overcrowded, move them to a larger box.
Keets can escape through very fine wire mesh, so it's best to keep them in a container with solid sides, like a sturdy cardboard box.
They will be jumping in no time, so make sure you cover the box with a screen.
Keep the box lined with clean paper towels for the first few days, and then switch to wood shavings. They need a textured surface to prevent them from slipping and injuring their legs, so don't line the box with newspaper.

, Keets need to be kept nice and toasty, so use a heating lamp to maintain a constant temperature in their container. It should be 95 degrees Fahrenheit for the first week. You can then lower the temperature by 5 degrees each week until the temperature in their box is the same as the temperature outside., Feed your keets a store bought food containing 24% to 26% protein for the first five weeks, and then switch to a mixture containing 18% to 20% protein for the next three weeks. You can use food that is formulated for other types of poultry, such as chickens and turkeys, as long as it has the correct protein content.Hand feed the keets to get them used to you., Be sure to provide your keets with a steady source of fresh, warm water. They don't tolerate cold water well.Providing a jar of water with a watering base is a great way to make sure they always have enough water to drink and that they never have enough water to drown in., Keets may get dried feces stuck to their feet or bottoms. This can cause a variety of complications, so be sure to clean them right away. To do so, wipe the area with a moist cotton ball or soak the area in warm soapy water.Be very gentle. Scraping or picking the feces off of the keets may cause injury.
To prevent this from happening in the first place, make sure to change the lining in the box frequently.

Choose a breed that is suitable for your needs and interests.,
Keep the brooding facility clean.,
Decide how many birds you want to raise.,
Use bedding only if needed.,
Ensure that the conditions are appropriate to the birds' needs.,Place a brooder guard around the brooder, one that prevents drafts and that does not restrict gentle air flow.,
Keep the temperatures appropriate.,
Learn to heat properly.,
Be aware that chicks cannot regulate their own body temperature until they are fully feathered.,
Provide sufficient water.,
Choose the right feed and fodder.,
Gently dip each bird's beak into the water.,
Monitor the baby chicks for at least 2 hours.,
Observe the needs of the chick flock.,Sprinkle feed (similar to peppering) onto a white paper plate.,Confirm the feed is fresh (if it is old and stale it may not be palatable),Confirm the temperatures in the brooding area are ideal.,Inspect for drafts.,Inspect for predators or invasive insects.,
Hard boil some eggs (how many?,
Understand that birds have one vent for the excretion of both solids and liquid waste.,Inspect every baby chick daily for pasty butt.,
Gently remove the hardened droppings from the surface of the vent or use a soft, damp towel.,
Provide a free-range environment.",How to Raise Cornish Game Hens (Birds)," Heritage, standard and old fashioned true breeds will grow slower than the commercial, fast growing breeds.

Option 1: Contact a hatchery that sells English or Indian Game Birds (heriitage/standard/old fashioned).
Option 2: Contact a breeder directly and buy good stock from a reputable, disease-free breeder.
Option 3: Purchase the fast-growing commercial Cornish Cross varieties which are genetically designed to grow to market Game Hen weight within 2.5 weeks (under ideal conditions).;
, When using a stackable battery style brooder be sure to clean out the poultry litter trays daily. Most stackable, battery style brooders are equipped with an automatic thermostat which regulates the temperature that you set.,

Allow at least 1/4 square foot of floor space per bird during the first 2 weeks.
Increase square footage by 1/4 square foot for each bird, every additional week until they are fully feathered.
Grown chickens on open range need at least 4 square feet per bird.

, Stackable battery brooders do not require bedding since they are equipped with fall-through droppings trays.

When floor brooding, provide soft, dry and non-toxic bedding such as pine shavings or rice hulls.
Apply the shavings or hulls at least 6"" deep.

, Drafts and cold air can cause day old chicks to chill and die.

,, It is very important to keep the brooder heat at the correct temperature and it should be stable at least 24 hours before the chicks arrive. When using stackable battery style brooders, set the automatic thermostat to ideal temperature and check the temperature daily. All brooding methods require that you visually inspect the temperature and adjust as needed by using a thermometer.

Option 1: Heat brooder with a red 250 watt heat lamp (1 bulb for every 50 chicks).
Option 2: Heat brooder using a gas or propane hover brooder. Large hover brooders can brood about 75 day old chicks for up to 16 days at which time the chicks need more room.
Option 3: Heat stackable battery brooder using the automatic thermostatically controlled regulator.
To adjust the temperature using a heat lamp, move the heat source away from the floor to decrease the temperature and move the heat lamp closer to the floor to increase temperature.
To adjust the temperature of a gas or propane hover brooder, dial the regulator to the left to decrease heat-flame and dial the regulator to the right to increase heat-flame.

,


Pre-Heat: Proper temperatures in the brooder make the difference between life or death of the chicks. Day old baby chicks are very delicate and require monitoring.
Pre-heat brooder to 100 degrees (F) for at least 24 hours prior to the arrival of the day old baby chicks.
Place a thermometer at the floor level to ensure proper temperature and adjust as needed.

,

For the first week, maintain the floor of the brooder at 100 degrees (f).
Lower the temperature in the brooder by 3-4 degrees (f) every 8 days until ambient temperature is reached.
If using a heat lamp, adjust the height until it reaches ideal temperature.
If using a gas or propane hover brooder, lower the heat-flame at the regulator.

, Shallow water trough lined with pebbles, marbles or stones will help prevent drowning, dunking and soaking. It takes a few days for the chicks to understand how to drink water without getting too excited. *Wet, cold baby chicks = dead chicks.

Using a very shallow dish, add a few large marbles and then fill with clean, fresh water.
Most stackable battery brooders are equipped with a shallow water trough.

, Game birds require high protein levels in their food and they need taurine. Taurine is present in most organic meat (liver, kidney, heart). Game birds are not vegetarians and when they are provided a vegetarian blend, it must be 100% complete to meet all the necessary requirements of game birds.

Provide fresh, clean, well balanced high protein, baby chick fodder at all times.
Allow the chicks (heritage, standard and old fashioned true breeds) to eat as much as they desire.
Fodder can be soaked with fresh, cool water to aid in proper digestion.
Provide chicks with access to grit, sand or crushed shell to aid in crop grinding.
When raising fast growing, commercial varieties, withdraw feed every night at 6:00 P.M. (otherwise they may eat until they over-eat (to death).

, This will help them understand where the water supply is., Or, until they are comfortable and stop chirping loudly., Attend to their needs as required, until they settle down. At this point, it is far more critical that the chicks consume water, more so important than consuming food. If you do not see them eating within 24 hours take the following steps,,,,,, one egg for every 5 chicks). Let them cool. Crush the entire egg, including egg shells until it is mush and offer to the baby chicks., Pasty butt is a common condition in baby chicks where hardened droppings are stuck to the vent of the baby chick and will block the vent. If pasty butt is left untreated, the baby chick may die.,,

Do not rub or irritate the vent.

, When the game hens (heritage, standard and old fashioned true breeds) reach ideal weight and size, they:


1. Can go into an open free range.

2. Can be processed for poultry meat.

Start by purchasing a goose and a gander.,
Choose your goose.,
Care for your goose.,
Keep the geese shelter clean so that the geese will feel comfortable in their home and will lay eggs.,
Provide a water source.",How to Keep Geese," If you want the geese for meat, buy two geese and a gander.;
, Geese are grouped in three types: light, medium, and heavy.


The heavy breeds lay fewer eggs while the light and medium lay more and are more practical to keep.
The Toulouse and White Emden are examples of heavy geese, they can be up to 24 pounds and are good for butchering! There are about 4 different breeds that are best for first-timers.
The Saddleback is okay at egg-laying and is tasty meat-wise. They are docile and are good in smaller flocks.
The American Buff is a medium breed. They are better for meat than eggs, and are delicious roasted. They are calm and docile and are good in small flocks and with the Saddleback.
The Chinese goose is a light but very intelligent breed. They are fiercely loyal to their owners and lay about 60 eggs per year.
The Pilgrim is a light, practical bird that is good for someone who has a knack for bird-caring. They lay about 20 eggs per year.

, Geese like to roam freely. As long as they have fresh water, corn, grit, and grass, they won't make a fuss. When the geese first arrive at their new home, make sure to keep them locked up in their shelter with a small mesh-enclosed space to run in for a while. This will teach them that they must stay in their space. If you don't have a vermin-proof enclosure, keep the geese locked up at night.

, Most geese will forage, so that will be their natural diet, but keep corn and grit there for extra. If your geese or a goose is not foraging, chop up greens for them to eat. If you want to fatten up your geese for butchering, feed them barley and wheat as an extra.

, Geese need constant access to a water source. They also need a pond for them to swim in, and it must be clean. In the summer, geese also need shade, so the pond should be near a shady area.

Observe the wattles.,
Look at the size of the helmet.,
Do not rely on visual differences.",How to Tell the Sex of Guinea Fowl2," Wattles are flaps of skin that hang from a bird’s head or neck. Although male and female guinea fowls look very similar, it is possible to tell the sex by looking at the wattles. In adult male guinea fowls, the wattle is usually large, elongated, and folds upward toward the upper jaw. A female guinea fowl’s wattle will look fairly flat.


The female guinea fowl’s wattle is usually smaller than that of a male guinea fowl., A guinea fowl’s helmet, also known as a casque, is a prominent horn-like structure on the top of its head.The helmet is larger on males than females.The helmet on female guinea fowls tends to be short and narrow.Be aware that helmets can look very similar between males and females.

, Because male and female guinea fowls look similar, you should not use only physical characteristics to differentiate between the sexes. In fact, keets look nearly identical, making it that much more difficult to know the difference between males and females."
"
Turn the guinea fowl upside down.,
Expose the cloaca.,
Examine the phallus.",How to Tell the Sex of Guinea Fowl3," Another way to tell the sex of a guinea fowl is to examine the vent, which is the genital area of a bird that controls the elimination of bodily fluids.To perform vent sexing, use one of your hands to turn the guinea fowl upside down and push its tail towards its head. Consider having a friend help you with the procedure.It would help to be seated and rest the guinea fowl's back along the length of your leg.
Vent sexing can be difficult to perform and may injure a bird. If you are not comfortable performing the procedure, have a bird expert do so.
Vent sexing is usually performed in keets that are at least a few weeks old.

, The cloaca is the circular opening where reproductive, urinary, and digestive fluids exit a bird’s body.With your other hand (or the hand of your friend), place an index finger and thumb on either side of the vent. Gently separate those fingers to stretch and push out the cloaca. Use gentle, yet firm pressure when exposing the cloaca., Typically, it is very difficult to differentiate between the sexual organs of male and female birds. A male guinea fowl’s phallus is longer and thicker than that of a female guinea fowl. The phallus becomes more distinguishable between the sexes at around 8 weeks of age."

Before you get turkeys, ask yourself if turkeys are right for you.,
Buy a tom and a hen.,
Feed and water your birds every day and check frequently to be sure both containers are full.,
Let mature birds run around outside together.,
Leave your hens alone when they are laying.",How to Breed Turkeys1," If you don't really like them, it is best off not to get turkeys because you will be less apt to care for them, and if you don't care for them, what's their use?


Be sure your town doesn't have anything against keeping turkeys. Do your research and you'll avoid some unexpected and rather unwanted surprises.
Consider your neighbors, too. Although turkeys tend to not be as smelly as chickens and toms don't make nearly as much noise as roosters, you may have some picky neighbors and either tell you to get rid of them, or worse, report you to the neighborhood staff.
Think about any financial trouble you may be having. Don't get turkeys if it will do damage to your budget, for both you and your potential turkeys. Coops, food, water, space, feeders, waterers, incubators- what's next? All together, these can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars that you might not have.;
, If you are going to pick them out as chicks (Turkey babies are called 'poults') to raise and subsequently breed, be sure they are correctly sexed. Sexing is commonly incorrectly done in small birds, due to their small nature. Larger birds are recommended for food purposes, but recently hatched ones are recommended for show and friendship purposes because you can bond with smaller birds easier.

, Resist your instinctive urge to water young turkeys that are not drinking water with a syringe for safety purposes (see warnings). Young turkeys need to be checked on 6 times a day at a minimum, so do not keep them if you cannot check on them this frequently. Older birds only need to be checked on about 1 or 2 times a day, for they tend to forage for insects, weeds, worms, and other tidbits they find in the yard throughout the day. However, like chicks, older birds may occasionally do naughty things like poop in their food and water, so be sure to clean out this stinky water as soon as possible!

, Free range is recommended, however be sure that they are safe from most predators. If you must keep them confined, be sure they have at least 10 square feet for living area per bird for best results.

, Right now, she needs some peace and quiet. She will not want to get up and get food and water, so be sure to leave some ""easy access"" water food and water nearby. She will eventually come out for food and water, and as I have told you before, I'll tell you again: resist your instinctive urge to water broody hens with a syringe. See warnings for details.

Let the eggs hatch completely.",How to Hatch a Goose Egg," In the Northern Hemisphere, most geese breeds begin laying their eggs in March or April. Chinese breeds begin in winter, though, around January or February.


Note that these months will change if you life in the Southern Hemisphere. Most breeds lay eggs in August or September, with Chinese breeds laying eggs in June and July.;
, Geese generally lay their eggs in the morning, so you should collect them late in the morning.


You should also collect eggs at least four times throughout the day to catch any that arrive at unusual times.
Do not give your geese access to swimming facilities until later in the morning, after you have collected the first batch of eggs. Otherwise, the eggs could break.

, Line each box with soft nesting material, like shavings or straw.


The use of nest boxes can prevent more egg breaks.
Provide one 20 inch (50 cm) nest box for every three geese in your flock.
If you want to speed up the production of your eggs, you can also shine artificial light on the nest boxes throughout the day and evening.

, As a general rule, fertility is 15 percent higher and hatchability is 20 percent higher when eggs are collected from a mature female geese, rather than a geese who is only a year old and in her first season of laying.


Of course, your odds will also improve when you select eggs from healthy, well-fed geese.
Geese that are allowed to swim generally tend to be cleaner, which keeps the eggs cleaner, as well.

, Dirty eggs should be lightly cleaned with a brush, a piece of sandpaper, or a piece of steel wool. Avoid using water to clean the eggs.


If you must use moisture, wipe the eggs down lightly with a clean, damp cloth. The temperature of the water should be about 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius), since it must remain warmer than the temperature of the egg. Warm water causes the egg to ""sweat"" dirt out of its pores.
Never soak the egg in water since bacteria is likely to grow if you do.
Dry the eggs thoroughly before storing them.

, You can technically skip this step, but following it will reduce the likelihood of bacteria finding its way into the egg through the shell.


Place the eggs in a small room or chamber that can be tightly sealed off.
Release formaldehyde gas directly into the chamber. You can usually purchase it in a 40 percent water solution known as ""formalin,"" or in powder form, called ""paraformaldehyde."" Closely follow the manufacturer's instructions concerning the manner in which you must release the formaldehyde gas. Since formaldehyde gas is toxic, do not breath it in.
If you cannot use a chemical fumigant, place the eggs in single layers and lay them out in direct sunlight for the morning and afternoon. The solar radiation should act as a disinfectant.

, Place them in a styrofoam carton and store the eggs for seven days in a cooled area. The temperature should be kept between 55 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (13 and 16 degrees Celsius), with 70 to 75 percent humidity.


Never store the eggs in temperatures above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) or in humidity below 40 percent.
Slant or turn the eggs as you store them. The small end should be pointed down.
After 14 days of storage, hatchability dramatically declines.

, You can use geese to hatch their own eggs, but doing so can be expensive and difficult since geese do not lay while sitting on their eggs. Muscovy ducks provide the ideal conditions.Turkeys and chicken hens can work well, too.
Natural incubation is believed to produce the best results overall, but if you cannot use natural incubation, artificial means will also work.
Make sure that the hens you use are already broody. In other words, they need to have laid enough eggs of their own for their natural instincts to kick in and demand a period of brooding.

, For a Muscovy duck, place six to eight eggs underneath her. For a chicken hen, you can only fit about four to six eggs.


If you do use a goose to hatch her own eggs, you can place 10 to 15 eggs under her.

, If using ducks or chicken hens, the eggs will be too large for the birds to turn naturally. You'll need to turn the eggs by hand on a daily basis.


Wait until the bird leaves the nest to eat and drink.
After 15 days, sprinkle the eggs with lukewarm water when you turn them.

, After the tenth day, pass the eggs under a bright light to look inside. Infertile eggs should be discarded and fertile eggs should be returned to the nest.

, Incubation can take 28 to 35 days, and hatching can take as long as three days.


Keep the conditions of the nest clean throughout this entire period and continue turning the eggs each day during the entire process.

, Typically speaking, you can choose between forced-air incubators and still-air incubators.Incubators that can be set for slow air movement maintain a more even distribution of air, temperature, and humidity throughout the incubator, so you'll be able to hatch more eggs with this type of machine.
As a general rule, though, still-air incubators are the most difficult machine to manage air flow in, so a rapid forced-air incubator is still a better option.

, The exact conditions will vary based on the type of incubator you use.


Set the temperature of a forced-air incubator between 99 and 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 and 37.5 degrees Celsius) with a relative humidity of 60 to 65 percent. A wet bulb thermometer should read from 83 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (28.3 to 31.1 degrees Celsius).
For a still-air incubator, set the temperature between 100 and 101 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 and 38.3 degrees Celsius) at egg height, noting that there can be a full 5 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) difference between the top and bottom of the incubator. The humidity should be between 60 and 65 percent, for a wet bulb reading of 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) during incubation.

, Lay the eggs in your incubator, spacing them apart evenly and in single layers.


For best results, lay the eggs horizontally. Doing so can increase hatchability.
Try to keep the machine at least 60 percent full. If the incubator is emptier than this, adjust the temperature so that it is warmer by 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius).

, You should turn the egg by 180 degrees each time.


Turning the eggs by 90 degrees could decrease the number of viable eggs.

, Once a day, you should sprinkle the eggs with a little warm water. Goose eggs require a high humidity, and this water can help maintain that ideal humidity.


After 15 days pass, you should submerge the eggs every other day for one minute. Make sure that the water is 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius).

, You'll need to transfer the eggs from the main body of the incubator to a separate hatcher compartment when they are just about ready to hatch. Most eggs hatch between 28 and 35 days.


If past experience indicates that your geese eggs hatch at less than 30 days of age, you should transfer the eggs to the hatcher earlier. Try to give the eggs at least three days to hatch.

, The temperature in the hatcher should remain at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) with a relative humidity of 80 percent.


Once the visible hatching process starts, reduce the temperature to 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit (36.5 degrees Celsius) and the humidity to 70 percent.
Before placing the eggs in the hatcher, you should dip or sprinkle them with warm water. The water should be about 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius).

, The eggs usually take up to three days before hatching.


Allow the goslings to remain in the hatcher for two to four hours before moving them to brooders.

You may desire geese for pets, guard animals, meat, and more. It is important to get the correct breed of goose for your life and meet their needs. Do not be afraid to ask questions, as questions produce answers.;
, You will find the article How to Care for a Pet Duck very helpful, as much of the information is true for both ducks and geese. Storey's publishing also has good books on the care of chickens, ducks, etc. (See Recommended Reading.)

, Some geese are considered aggressive, some good guard animals (they can really make a racket!), and others make great pets. It all depends on the breed and how you raise them. Ask friends who have the birds, farmers, vets, whoever you can find. Get their advice on what goose breed is right for you.

, You should get at least a pair and more if you so choose. For calmer breeds, it is fine to acquire them as adults or as goslings. If you have chosen a more aggressive breed, it may be best to acquire them as goslings. It's best for a goose to always have a mate. If it does not, you should acquire more geese or even several ducks so your bird will not get lonely and distressed. If you choose to buy the geese, check out the breeder. The cages should be clean, the water fresh, and the smell shouldn't be too overpowering. The animals should look relatively clean, healthy, and alert. Stick your hands in the pen. If they react, whether running away or coming closer out of curiosity, this is usually a sign that they are healthy. It is not, however, hard at all to find free geese (and ducks). Just ask your friends if anything comes up. Often people have animals they can't care for anymore.

, They should be brought home in a relatively large dog carrier that they cannot break free from. You will most likely need to hose the carrier off when you get home. The geese will be very upset from their capture and ride.

, You will save a lot of time and energy if you do this before releasing them. This is a 2-3 person job. Gently hold the neck (don't let it peck your face) and firmly (without squeezing) hold its body close to you. Male geese are very strong, so be prepared. Have one person gently take the wing and unfold it, cutting the shorter feathers at the base of the wing. Do not over cut and be extremely careful, because the animals will be struggling while you do this. You do not want to make them bleed; if you do, they may die.

, It is best if you have a pond. Birds are safer in the water than in the middle of a pasture. Usher them to the pond in the morning. You can use a rake to guide them, but do not hurt them. This should be a pleasant experience. If you are able, usher them back to their pen/shed/barn before it gets dark. The next day, you should be able to simply let them out and leave them to find the pond on their own. You shouldn't have to bring them back to their pen again.

, Geese will spend much time eating around their pond, as well as grazing on pasture grass. At the same time, just like humans, they need a balanced diet that satisfies their need for vitamins and minerals. Their food should be specifically designed for poultry (geese, ducks, etc.) and should come from your local clean feed store or Tractor Supply. You can add oats and grains to your goose's diet in the winter. If it is a gosling, feed gosling or duck mash to it.

, It may take a week or even two, but if you fed your geese while they were in the pen, they should learn that when they come back to the pen, they get food. Whenever you see the geese walking back to their pen, encourage them closer and feed them. Don't scare them off; try to watch at a good distance. After about a week of them coming to the pen to be fed, change their schedule. Now you should only feed them once a day, when it isn't dark outside. If they come up to the pen at random hours, resist the urge to feed them and only feed them at the time you determined. Stick to that schedule like a rule of life and they will learn quickly. It helps if there are other geese or ducks that come to the pen to be fed at the same time. Make sure there is enough food for them. If they are hanging around after they've finished, or if they are very thin and sickly, it likely means they are still hungry, so try feeding slightly larger rations until you are satisfied. If they look fat or are not eating all the food you set out, slightly reduce the rations until you are satisfied.

, This is often overlooked, considering the animals have a pond. However, this water can be quite dirty and should not be the birds' only source of fresh water. It's best if there can be running water, such as a stream, but this is often not possible. Instead, you should set out containers of clean water near their food. These should be refilled daily, regardless of how much water is left. Failing to dump them out can result in disgusting water, unhealthy living conditions, foul odors, and mosquito larvae. When the geese are young, they should be offered water in shallow troughs, as they cannot get wet until their mature feathers come in. If they do get wet, towel dry them and keep them warm. Failing to do so will result in chilling and even death in extreme cases.

, Ducks and geese alike require shelter from storms, wind, and direct sunlight. They receive some shelter from the sun by sitting under large trees. However, it is recommended that you supply a small 3-sided shed, open hutch/pen, large awning over your barn, or even tarp stretched between two trees. They must have an area that is dry and free of drafts. Clean straw or bedding should be placed on the ground during cold weather or storms. The RSPCA recommends at least 1 square meter of ground area per goose. They should be able to come and go freely and be able to move around comfortably.

, This is perhaps the most difficult step, because most of this is out of your hands. Some things are just out of your control. However, there are ways you can protect your geese and other poultry from predators. If you have the time, consider locking your geese in the adequate shelter described in Step 11 at night and letting them out during the day. Be aware that the shelter will be a mess and you will have to do a bit of cleaning. Simply scrape up droppings with a shovel and toss them outside, away from the shelter. Supply clean hay, bedding, or straw, dump waters outside and refill them. Clean food containers if necessary. Predators include bobcats, coyotes, dogs, and more. It is strongly advised that you do not shoot the predators, as you could accidentally shoot a goose, a neighbor's pet, or a harmless animal.

Supervise children.,
Ensure the geese are calm.,
Look for signs of aggression.,
Do not feed geese food by hand.",How to Feed Geese Safely1," Geese attack anything -- or anyone -- that makes them nervous or invades their personal space. They are also aggressive around creatures who show fear, including small children.Do not let babies, toddlers, or young children near geese. They are liable to get too curious and wander to within pecking range of a skittish goose. In the best case scenario, such an encounter may result in a painful nip; more serious damage is a very real possibility.


Children ages 10 and up are the demographic most likely to understand the habits and behavior of geese, and the reasoning behind the many protocols that the act of feeding geese requires. These children should be invited to feed geese with adult supervision when they show interest in doing so.
Children in secondary school may be allowed to feed geese on their own. Take them out to feed geese a few times with parental supervision. After they understand the process and have shown respect for the animals, they can be permitted to feed geese on their own.
While children of a young age should be welcome to watch, do not give them free reign when around geese.;
, Geese should be wandering peacefully across the meadow or field. Look for geese who are relaxed and meandering casually about. If they are alert and active, they might be interested in a snack. Feed geese who approach with a friendly warble and show some interest in your presence.


If the geese are very skittish or alarmed, or are standoffish and do not immediately wander up to you, you might be in a known predator area. In this case, try to move closer to the flock in order to feed geese safely.

, An angry goose will extend its neck and head toward a potential threat. It will open its mouth and hiss threateningly. It may also honk, squawk, flap its wings to look bigger, or run at you. Do not approach a goose that indicates anger or is tending its eggs or young.

, Do not draw geese to you and have them eat directly from your palm, you’re likely to get bitten. If there are several geese in the vicinity and all are clamoring to eat from your hand, they may start to push and attack one another in order to get to the food in your hand, putting you in the center of the conflict. Avoid this by watching them dine from afar.

Look up your specific pheasant species to find a more accurate start date. For best results, you should move the pheasants into their breeding pen about a month before the season begins., Pheasants thrive in large environments with plenty of brush cover. A space with an irregular shape works better than rectangular or round areas, as it provides more nooks and crannies for nesting hens. These factors are especially important if you plan to have the mother brood the eggs, but they are important even if you're only concerned about egg production.The ideal environment includes fully grown trees and shrubs. If this is not feasible, provide stacks of cornstalks or other brush for hiding and nesting spots., A breeding pen typically has a ratio of seven or eight hens per rooster.Males will often fight during the breeding season, so lowering this ratio may be dangerous. If you have the space, dividing the pen into multiple breeding groups will reduce violence and broken eggs.


If a males dies or has to be removed, do not attempt to replace it during the breeding season. The remaining males may kill the intruder., All egg-laying birds require a calcium source to produce strong eggs. Oyster shells, limestone grit, and other options are available at farming supply stores. Pheasants are able to manage their own calcium levels when provided with enough of the source, so the exact amount is not critical., If you are running a commercial farm, artificial lights are recommended to increase egg production. Set these to an automatic timer to produce 15-hour days. Add the artificial light starting at sunset; sudden light before dawn may startle the pheasants., There are three ways to incubate the eggs:



Incubators: These machines are almost always used in commercial operations, as they can incubate many more eggs at once.They also allow precise control over the environment, which can greatly increase hatching percentage — at least once you've had some practice.

Pheasant hens: This is the cheaper option, and may be more fun for a backyard breeder who wants to watch pheasant behavior. However, as described below, this requires plenty of space and vegetation. Brooding halts egg production, so you will end up with fewer fertilized eggs than the incubation method.
Hens of other species: Even in good conditions, some pheasant species or individual hens will fail to raise the eggs. You may use domestic fowl to brood their eggs, but there is a risk of disease transfer or poor mothering once hatched.

Note — One efficient way to handle this is to allow the pheasant hen to brood for 7–10 days. Take the eggs to the incubator, then allow the hen to lay a second clutch and raise it herself., There are a wide range of incubators available, costing anywhere from one hundred to several thousand US dollars. Choosing a model is beyond the scope of this guide, but these basics can inform your decision:


Forced-draught incubators have better ventilation systems and are generally easier to manage. However, some studies suggest that the more labor-intensive still air incubators get better results for pheasant eggs.Read the manual before buying if possible. If installed incorrectly or in the wrong environment, the incubator may overheat.

, If you've never used an incubator before, read our detailed guide to the general process. This includes important setup and sanitation information before you get started. Return to this guide to find information specific to pheasant incubation.


Start this at least a week in advance. Leaving incubator on this long will allow it to reach a steady temp and humidity before eggs are introduced., If the pheasant hens are not sitting on the eggs, collect them every morning, and perhaps again later in the day. Eggs left out are vulnerable to heat damage and predation., If your incubator is not ready yet, store the eggs in a tray of clean sand, with the pointed end tilted downward at a 45º angle Measure humidity and temperature daily, keeping the area as close to 55ºF (12.7ºC) and 65–70% relative humidity as possible. Even a change of 5ºF (change of 2.8ºC) can make an additional 10% of the eggs unviable.Rotate each egg once a day. Mark two opposite sides of the egg with an X and an O to help you keep track, using a pencil or felt-tipped pen.
Move on to incubation as soon as you can, and always within 11 days of collection.

, A bright light can reveal signs of healthy development or failure. If you have limited space in your incubator, perform this test to determine which eggs you can discard. Place the remaining eggs inside the incubator.


Do not expose eggs to the light for too long, as the heat can cause damage.You may perform this test periodically while the eggs are being incubated, but try to minimize handling.

, For pheasants, a forced-draught incubator should be kept as close as possible to 100ºF (37.8ºC), and still air incubators at 102–103ºF (38.9–39.4ºC).Place the thermometer ½ inch (1.2cm) above the top of the eggs, and check it daily.The right temperature is vital to the eggs' development. Keep a master thermometer (accurate within 0.18ºF / 0.1ºC) in a cool place where it will not be jarred. At least once a year, compare your daily thermometer to the master and replace the daily thermometer if it is not accurate within 0.9ºF / 0.5ºC.Incubators can easily overheat on a hot day, or if there is not enough ventilation in the room. In an emergency where the correct temperature is not feasible, a few hours at a low temperature (90ºF / 32.2ºC) is safer than a high temperature (105ºF / 40.6ºC).)

, If the machine does not turn the eggs automatically, turn them by hand at least three times a day, and preferably five or seven times a day.To ensure the eggs are rotated 180º, mark the opposite sides with an X and an O, using a pencil or felt-tipped pen.


Turn an odd number of times each day so the two sides alternate positions each night., Use a wet bulb thermometer to test humidity daily. Most incubator manufacturers recommend a relative humidity of 55%, which is equivalent to an 85ºF (29.4ºC) wet bulb reading at air temperatures of 100ºF (37.8ºC).If you have a different air temperature, refer to a psychrometric chart to find the desired wet bulb reading at 55% relative humidity.


The wrong humidity can cause serious developmental problems. The effects are less immediate than a mistake in temperature or egg turning, but the humidity should never be more than 10% off these recommended levels for more than a day or twoTo increase humidity, keep the incubator's moisture trays full of warm water. Many incubators have automatic controls to adjust humidity as well.
At the correct humidity levels, the egg should lose weight at a steady pace, down to about 85% of its original weight by the time it hatches. For more accuracy, weigh the egg regularly and draw a chart of its progress. If it is on pace to lose too much or too little weight, consult an expert or an in-depth incubation guide for information on adjusting humidity., Forced-draught incubators should ventilate on their own, while still-air incubators only have small air holes and should be placed in a well-ventilated room. Since models vary greatly, refer to your incubator manual for instructions on adjusting ventilation.Ventilation can be adjusted to change humidity, but this is not its only purpose. Do not reduce ventilation too far in an attempt to increase humidity, or the chicks may be cut off from oxygen.

, ""True pheasant"" species (also called typical pheasants) tend to hatch after 24 or 25 days of incubation. Other species range from 20 to 29 days, so look yours up so you know what to expect., About three days before the expected hatch date, make the following adjustments:


Move the eggs to a hatcher (optional). A hatcher is essentially a simple incubator with no turning mechanisms. Turning is not required during the final stages, and newly hatched chicks can get caught in the moving parts. Hatched chicks also introduce disease, so their presence in the incubator requires a new round of disinfecting.Increase relative humidity to 65%.This will help soften the egg membrane, allowing chicks to push through. If necessary, hang wet hessian or install automatic misters to increase humidity.Increase ventilation. Open the air vents wider during this period. Never keep the vents narrow in an effort to increase humidity during this time., Some basic info in pen setup is covered in the section below. This guide does not go into the broader topic of pheasant chick care, but breeding associations and university extensions have excellent resources available online and by mail order., As described in the section on breeding, pheasants require plenty of space, hidden nooks, and vegetation. Even then, many species are notoriously reluctant to brood. Check daily to see whether any of your hens have become broody. If they have, you can leave the incubation process to the mothers.


If the pheasants refuse to brood, you can give the eggs to other poultry species. Because the possible transfer of disease is specific to species and region, speak to a local pheasant breeder or veterinarian before you try this.

, If the females do not have space to hide from males, the males may become aggressive or destroy the eggs. The risk is greater after the chicks have hatched, so consider moving the males out of the pen once your hens are brooding.


Occasionally, a male will help the female brood. If you're a backyard breeder who's not too invested in the outcome, you can try keeping in the rooster for the first season and seeing what happens.

, Newly hatched chicks cannot fly and may die if the pop hole (the entrance to the roost) is too high to reach. A ramp allows the chick to follow the mother up and down. Sand ramps are best, as solid ramps usually leave crevices that chicks can get lost or stuck in.Also provide ramps between any ""steps"" in the pen.

, Chicks easily drown even in small bodies of water. Empty these or surround them with chick-proof barriers., Birds in adjacent pens can catch chicks through the mesh. If two pens share a wall, block the area low to the ground with a solid barrier.


Also make sure you are using a mesh fine enough to prevent chicks from walking through the holes.

Chicks (Poults) hatch after about 21 to 28 days, so you'll finally get an excellent gift for all that work!",How to Breed Turkeys2," You'll have some living, breathing turkey chicks. Congratulations! You have just successfully bred and hatched turkeys. Don't neglect the hens or the tom, feed and water them regularly. Don't separate the chicks from their mother yet. You need a brooder kit now, a medium box where the chicks live with all their needs. The brooder box should be big enough to keep the chicks in, but small enough for the hen to come out at her own will. Put some shavings and a heat lamp (optional) in the brooder box. Don't put the food and water in for 2 days (see warnings.)

Feed geese leafy greens.,
Feed geese other acceptable foods.,
Do not feed geese processed foods.,
Do not feed geese dairy products.,
Feed geese bite-sized portions.Do not give food to geese in portions too large for them to swallow.",How to Feed Geese Safely2," The goose’s natural diet is heavy in tender grasses plants.In winter months, especially, the vegetation geese need for a healthy diet is rare. Giving them spinach, lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and chard will keep them happy and healthy. Geese may find other vegetables like carrots, green beans, and celery amenable as well.


Veggies like broccoli and potatoes make geese happy too, but may need to be steamed and fed in a warm (not hot) state before the geese can digest them., Whole grain breads, whole oats, lentils, brown rice, small seeds, and split peas are some of the foods geese enjoy. Additionally, unprocessed popcorn (free of additives, salt, and butter) and small seeds like sunflower seeds make good snacks for geese.You can also feed geese foods that occur naturally in their environment such as small fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. Assorted vegetable/fruit scraps are also welcome.Geese do not like alfalfa and cannot eat raw potato peelings.

, If we, as humans, shouldn’t eat it, geese definitely shouldn’t eat it. Things like white bread, candy, junk food, fast food, chips, and anything with high levels of salt, sugar, and fat should not be fed to geese.Young geese (less than 6 weeks old) who are given high-protein or carb-heavy foods regularly may develop angel wing, a condition which causes their wings to develop in an unnatural way and inhibits their ability to fly., Avoid feeding geese milk, yogurt, or baked goods containing milk. Geese are lactose intolerant. Consumption of dairy may lead to diarrhea and dehydration, which could in turn lead to death., Their throats are much smaller than ours and they have no teeth with which to chew their food, so it is important that you provide food in bits no bigger than one to two square inches.

"
"
Throw food near the geese.,
When feeding a flock, provide an adequate amount for all the birds.,
Don’t feed geese often.,
Do not feed geese in high-traffic areas.When geese gather near roads, rail tracks, or parking lots, the chances of a goose being struck increases.,
Don’t leave food lying about.When you toss food out to geese, if they wander away without picking it up, you need to gather it before leaving the area.",How to Feed Geese Safely3," Large bits of popcorn or whole wheat bread which will float can be thrown into water. The brief submersion will help break the foods down and make them more digestible.Most food, though, should be tossed a meter or so in front of the geese on land.


Do not distribute more food than the geese will eat. If you see their consumption slowing, stop feeding.

, Place several small accumulations of cracked corn, oats, or green veggies in the area of the flock. Space each pile about 10-15 feet apart. Ensure there is enough feed, and enough space between each pile of feed, to allow all the geese to eat some in peace.Concentrating food in one location might cause a feed frenzy as all the birds scramble to get their portion.

, Wild geese may become dependent on humans feeding them if they continue to receive food from you or others on a daily basis. Check the area in which you’re feeding for notices prohibiting feeding.

, Plus, if geese become accustomed to being fed in these areas, they will learn to congregate there, waiting for food. This will bother people who do not have anything for the geese. Always feed geese at least fifty meters from any roads, trains, and cars.

, Otherwise, the food may attract rats and leads to the accumulation of poisonous blue-green algae in the water. Moldy food might be eaten by geese later and infect them with a deadly lung fungus."
"
Make sure you have the land and environment suitable for breeding geese.,
Purchase your initial stock of geese; possibly even goslings that are ready to be on their own.,
Remember that some breeds have but one mate and they mate for life.,
Plan on having about one gander to three breeders of the heavier species.",How to Breed Geese," Theoretically, you could have them locked up in small cages and let out only for a daily mating session, but that is pretty cruel. Unless you are starting your own commercial down and feather producing company for a pillow manufacturer, there really is no need for this kind of setup. The following are some required features for breeding geese:


Water Source. Depending upon the quantity of geese you plan on breeding, you need a substantial source of water for them to swim and enjoy. This also provides them a natural food source.
Shelter. During the harsh weather seasons, you will need a small shelter source for each breeding pair for both safety and comfort. They should be cozy with plenty of straw and soft material for bedding.
Predator Protection. Make sure your entire breeding land is surrounded by a fence of some sort to help keep the predators out and your geese safe. These birds are your investment after all; take the necessary steps to protect them.;
, Most species of geese are ready to breed at about a year of age. If you can get goslings for cheaper and can wait it out, they will be used to their new home by then and you will maximize their productive breeding years. The females, or breeders, are productive from 1 -10 years of age. The male, or gander, is good for only 1 - 6 years of age.

, These should be segregated from the rest of the community if you plan on having such a diverse population. If you are planning on having but a single or a couple of species that are not like this, you should not have to worry too much about keeping them separated to be productive.

, For the smaller, lighter birds, you can increase this ratio to one gander for every five geese or so. Depending upon the space you have, you might be able to adjust these ratios to get more birds; however, be always vigilant about overcrowding, which can rapidly spread disease and decimate your investment.

Their distinguishing feature are their rainbow-colored feathers that include reds, greens, violets, yellows, and oranges., While still somewhat large at 9 inches in length (23 cm), scaly-breasted lorikeets are smaller than rainbow lorikeets. They’re mostly green in color, but their beaks are red and will have some yellow and red on their wings, chests, and neck., These lorikeets are on the smaller side and measure about 7 inches in length (18 cm). The bird is mostly different shades of green and yellow, with red on their wings. However, it may have a blue belly. Its distinguishing feature is a purple crown, which might appear black. Its ear and forehead may also be orange or yellow.This bird is ideal for people who want a smaller lorikeet.

, The little lorikeet is a similar size to the purple-crownded lorikeet (7 inches/18 cm). It is mostly bright green, has a red face, and a black bill. The area under its tail may be yellow and have some red., If you’re looking for a bird you can train and cultivate a life-long relationship with, you should consider a younger bird. This is important, as lories and lorikeets can live to 30 years or more. As a result, if you choose a young bird, you will necessarily be committing to many years of companionship and responsibility.While the longevity of different size, species, and subspecies of lories and lorikeets may differ, they can all live for decades.

, Novice bird owners or people who are less sure about lorikeet ownership may want to consider mature birds. The upside of owning a mature bird is that they will likely already have been trained, housebroken, and may be easier to manage than a very young bird.If you don’t think you have the time to ability to train a young bird, but still want a lory, consider a mature bird that has already been trained and housebroken.

, Older pet owners, foster pet owners, or other people who are unsure about the time commitment associated with lorikeet ownership should consider adopting older birds. Birds that are already 15 to 20 years old will likely be trained, housebroken, and may only have a limited time in which they can offer companionship.Older birds can be just as active and exciting to own as younger birds, but simply have a shorter life expectancy.

, Pet stores are perhaps the easiest place you can find a lorikeet to adopt. Depending on where you live, local pet stores may have few or many individuals for sale. Ultimately, by buying from a pet store, you are making several choices about the lory you’re going to bring home.Pet stores may have smaller lorikeets for sale.
They will have young or juvenile birds for sale – this means they won’t be trained or housebroken.

, If you buy a lorikeet from a breeder, you’ll have more information about the breeding stock, species, and history of the individual you’re going to bring home. The breeder may also offer you advice on training, housebreaking, and caring for your lorikeet.

Ask your veterinarian or a local bird organization about reputable breeders near you.
Check www.birdbreeders.com to read reviews about bird breeders near you., Just like with other types of animals, many lorikeets are available to adopt from bird rescue organizations. In fact, because of their longevity, many lorikeets need new homes. As a result, if you adopt from a bird rescue, you may be able to get a bird that has been trained, housebroken, and loved. In addition, the rescue may be able to provide you with advice and resources about how to care for your new roommate.Depending on your country or region, there may be a parrot or lorikeet rescue near you.

Don't expect your bird to be a social butterfly.",How to Buy a Bird," Getting a big bird means you have to spend more time with it. Large birds can make great companions, but they are usually a bit louder, messier, and need more care than smaller species. Because of this, it's recommended that if you are a beginner to birds, that you start with a small bird. The size of the bird is the first step in deciding which bird is right for you. Before choosing a bird, you should definitely take size into consideration.

, Decide if you want a really active bird that will constantly be talking and flying, or whether you want a beautiful, quiet bird just to give you company. Your bird should match you, as if you had something in common, so that the ownership could be more pleasant. It is also important to know that each specie is very different. For example, a huge, talking African Grey Parrot will behave quite differently from a small, singing Canary. If you're looking for a bird, concentrate on acknowledging the type of bird.

, Some birds need specific diets or other special care. Lories, for example, are beautiful medium-sized birds admired around the world for their striking colors. Despite their beautiful feathers and wonderful personality, they have highly specialized digestive systems, however, which require them to be fed a diet of pollen, nectar, and fruit. This causes them to produce lots of liquid droppings, making it necessary to clean their cages a lot more than those of other species. While there are good reasons to buy a pet bird, issues like this are why it is so important for potential owners to learn as much as they can about their favorite species before bringing one home.

, Keeping a bird can be expensive, and much of that expense can be related to the type of bird involved. Larger birds sometimes have an initial purchase price of thousands of dollars, and these species generally require costly cages and accessories that boost the bill even higher. Even smaller birds, while often initially less expensive, still present their owners with various financial obligations. Some birds can live a very long time, and those that own them are responsible for feeding, housing, and providing them with veterinary care throughout their lives. All of these factors should be considered when choosing a bird so that you end up with a pet whose upkeep you can afford.

, Some bird species, like hookbills, require daily exercise, interaction, and time out of their cages. Are you able to spare at least two hours a day to socialize with your bird and supervise his out of cage activities? If not, a Finch, Canary, or other more independent species may be best for you. To ensure that your pet stays healthy and happy, you should consider how much time you have available to spend with your bird when deciding which kind you would like to own.

, With a breeder, make sure you agree on the cost of the bird. The breeder will give you all sorts of information on the bird; health, activity, etc. The pet store will help you choose a healthy bird, too. Whatever happens, make sure your bird is happy, healthy and safe with you.

, You may need new cookware. Non-stick cookware can be deathly to parrots and other pet birds. The coating gives off an odorless fume when heated that can kill a bird within minutes. This means that any non-stick cookware you may own will have to go, and you will need to invest in pots and pans made of stainless steel or another safe substance.;
, Scented candles, scented oils, and air fresheners pose a health hazard when you use them around your pet. Birds have extremely sensitive respiratory systems and are easily overcome by chemicals and fumes.

, Period. Cigarette smoke is just as bad for your bird as it is for you. If you do choose to use tobacco products, use them outside away from your bird to keep him safe and healthy. And don't forget to wash your hands before handling your bird if you've recently smoked!

, Birds wake up with the Sun each morning, and they are ready to start their days bright and early. They will expect you to do the same. Be prepared to adjust your sleep schedule as needed to accommodate your feathered friend. Your bird will need his breakfast soon after waking, and you'll have to be there to serve it.

, Birds are quite messy, to put it lightly. In many cases, you will need to sweep or vacuum daily to keep up with the constant flow of seed hulls and other debris that will accumulate around your pet's cage. Be sure that you are up to this task before bringing a bird into your home.

, Many commonly kept houseplants are toxic to birds and could kill your bird if he ingests them. You will need to find new homes for them before you adopt your feathered friend.

, Birds are naturally attracted to shiny objects, which makes things like jewelry and sequins great targets. You will need to take these off before handling your bird, to protect yourself, your pet, and your items. Also, you should be prepared to lose many buttons to your feathered friend. It's a good idea to have some spares and a small sewing kit on hand.

, Sure, some birds can talk, but all of them can scream, chirp, cackle, screech, tweet, or coo, amongst other things. Your bird will probably make a variety of these noises, and it may not always be at a time when you want to hear them. If you want to own a bird, you'll have to figure out a way to cope.

, You may well end up with a bird that is completely tame when you deal with him, but refuses to tolerate other people. While there are certain species that are more prone to becoming ""one person birds"" than others, it can happen to any bird, particularly if only one person cares for and interacts with it. If you are buying a bird for your family, it's imperative that everyone learns as much as they can about the bird, and participates in its care and maintenance. Otherwise, your pet may decide to play favorites, which can lead to sore fingers and hurt feelings.

Purchase a feature that ripples the water or drips it into the bath.Make a feature by punching a small hole in the bottom of a bucket or plastic container. Hang it above the birdbath so that it can drip into the basin.Change out the water in the feature whenever you clean or refill the birdbath.

, Birds will travel long distances for a stable and fresh source of water.Keep a steady and clean source water in your birdbath by refilling it regularly.Be sure to not overfill the birdbath. You want it to mimic a puddle.Put enough water in so that the birds can walk and flap their wings.
Make sure the water is cool and fresh.
Consider rinsing the birdbath before refilling it., If you notice anything like algae or dead leaves in the birdbath, take them out. This can keep the water fresh and protects the health of your birds.Scoop out any solid material like leaves, food, or bird droppings. Consider a more thorough cleaning if you find bird droppings since feces can carry parasites.
Wipe away any algae you see.Take out ice in the winter or use a heater to keep water from freezing., It’s important to birds’ health to have access to clean water.At least once a week, dump out the water and clean the birdbath. This can prevent parasites like small worms.Dump the water in a gutter so that it doesn’t attract mosquitoes or other insects.
Mix one part chlorine bleach and nine parts water to make a cleaning solution.Scrub the birdbath with the mixture to loosen any debris and kill parasites.Rinse the birdbath completely. Consider drying it in the sun before refilling it., Check your birdbath every day. This can help you recognize any small worms, which are often mosquito larvae, before they become a problem.


Check the worms’ color. Small worms or larvae can be dark brown, grey, or black. They may be up to ½ inch in length.Changing the water weekly can disrupt the insect breeding cycle., If you detect any worms, empty the water into a gutter or someplace where it can’t sit. Use the chlorine mixture to scrub down every surface of the birdbath.


Use hot water. This may help kill the worms.
Consider scrubbing the birdbath twice to ensure that you kill and remove the worms.
Allow the birdbath to dry completely in the sun before refilling it.
Reinspect the bath before you refill it to make sure that you’ve removed all of the worms.

, Treatments called larvicides can kill small worms or other parasites.Place one of these products in your birdbath if you detect any worms.


Buy larvicides at home or pet stores.
Use either Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis or methoprene to kill the worms. These are often sold under the names Mosquito Dunks, Mosquito Quick Kill Granules, or PreStrike Granules.Follow package instructions on how to use larvicides.Use no more than 12 granules of larvicide in the birdbath., If you can see the worms, remove them with a long-handled dipper.This can get rid of and prevent further worms without chemical treatments.


Avoid leaning over the birdbath when using the dipper. Changes in light make the worms dive deeper into the water.Make sure to use a dipper or net that has small openings so that the worms can’t escape.

Choose the species.,
Find a breeder.,
Choose the right bird.,
After you bring your bird home, take it in for a wellness checkup to an AVIAN vet.",How to Purchase the Perfect Pet Bird for You," Choosing the species of bird that is perfect for you can depend on many factors (such as time, and money). There are many species within each group of parrots, so if a group sounds right for you...do research and find the right species.


Smaller birds (parakeets, lovebirds, finches) are good for those who don't have as much time to spend with the bird, or money to spend on it. These are good birds for new bird owners.
Conures and Caiques are good birds for people who have owned birds in the past. First-time bird owners may have trouble handling a conure or Caique, as they are rowdy clowns who are LOUD.
Medium-large birds (Amazons, African Greys, etc) are good for experienced owners who have owned conures. First time owners may have trouble discouraging their bird from biting, and properly stimulating the bird. These birds are intelligent, and if their mind isn't properly stimulated, it can lead to self-mutilation or other behavioral problems. However, these birds are fun talkers, they have long lives, and it's fun to bond and watch them amaze you.
Large birds (cockatoos, macaws) are for experienced bird owners that know what they're doing. These birds are intelligent and fun, but they are known for their large beaks, screaming, and biting. First time owners will have trouble with their larger bird, but large birds are extremely fun, lifelong companions.;
, Since birds are not domesticated, they aren't born friendly and loving. Choosing the right breeder is extremely important. If the breeder is good, it will bring you a receptive companion that will, with the right love and care, bring you a friendly companion. Choose the wrong breeder and your bird won't be as receptive to you, and will most likely behave like a jungle animal, but with a lot of love things can be turned around.


Good breeders can be found on numerous websites.
Some birds will be easy to locate and others will be harder to find.
When you get in touch with the breeder, you'll need to know:

Do they have any of these babies available now? (They'll tell you if they do or not.)
How much is the baby?
What diet are they raised on? (If they're raised on seeds, don't bother buying, seeds are unhealthy. Pellets and fruits/veggies is the way to go.)
How long will I have to wait for a baby to come my way?


Once you've found the right breeder and contacted him/her, it's time to place a deposit on the bird. This will secure it until it is weaned and ready to come, in most cases. This is for serious inquiries, however, as once you put the money down you cannot get it back, in most cases. Ask the breeder if you have any questions.

, Everyone has a different experience with choosing the right pet bird. Sometimes people choose a bird that has a distinct personality trait (""the angry one in the corner""), or one that has a unique affection for them. However you choose your bird is your business, but there are some things to remember.


Pick a bird that is alert and active (sleepy can indicate sickness).
Look for clean eyes, nostrils, and an overall healthy, clean look (disheveled can also indicate sickness, birds are normally obsessed with their appearance).
Listen for clicking, abnormal sounds when the bird breathes (respiratory infections are common, and can be deadly).
Pick a bird that eats, drinks, and poops normally.
Pick a bird that perches correctly and interacts with its cage mates.
Ask your breeder about a health guarantee (usually guarantees health between 72 hrs and 30 days).

, This is good for three reasons. One, it shows if your bird is sick. Two, it provides baseline information in case your new pet ever gets sick (this is important). Three, it establishes a relationship with a vet, between your bird and the vet, and you and the vet.

Find large level stones.,
Stack stones.,
Build the stone pillar at least a few inches off the ground.,
Place a trashcan lid on top.,
Secure the lid with a large stone.,
Fill the lid with water.",How to Make a Bird Bath1," You will need to be able to stack these stones so that they will provide a sturdy base for your bath. Look for stones that are large and relatively flat., Take the stones you have found and stack them, one on top of the other. Try to arrange them so that they are level. It will be a bit like a puzzle, as you try to match the jutting edges in some rocks with the gaps in others., Birds sometimes use bowls lying directly on the ground as birdbaths. They prefer, however, for their birdbaths to be at least a few inches off the ground, but it is not absolutely necessary that they be very high up., Once the stones are relatively level, place a trashcan lid on top of them. You do need to pile the stones very high. Your priority should be creating a level surface for the lid. The lid should be deep enough for you to fill it with 1-2 inches (2-5 cm) of water and wide enough that there is enough room for you to put a large stone in the center and still have space for birds to get inside. It is counterproductive to have more than 2 inches of water in a birdbath.

, Place a heavy stone in the center of the trashcan lid to hold it in place on top of the other stones. Be sure the stone is centered or it will throw the lid off balance. , Once the lid is secure, fill it with water. The birds should show up in no time!

Make sure you have a wide open space that you can put it in. Bird baths can be very big and take up room. If you do not have a good space to place the bird bath in, you may not be able to buy one because you won't be able to put it anywhere, since you will not have a space to put it in.;
, If you don't have enough room, you may not be able to buy a bird bath.

, Decide which one you will want to buy.

, Bird baths may be expensive, so it's a good idea to have enough money before buying a bird bath. If you have enough money, you can buy a bird bath.

, If possible, you can buy more than one bird bath, but make sure you have enough money, especially if you're buying more than one.

, This will make it easier to take the bird bath home.

Purchase the necessary materials.,
Sand the pots and saucer.,
Apply a coat of polyurethane sealer.,
Paint the pots.,
Find a level, dry spot to place your birdbath.,
Stack the pots upside down.,
Glue the saucer to the pot.,
Fill the saucer with water.",How to Make a Bird Bath2," You'll need three terracotta flower pots and a clay saucer. They should be the following sizes: 12 inch (30.48 cm), 14 inch (35.56 cm), and 16 inch (40.64 cm). In addition, purchase a clay saucer with a diameter of 20 inches (50.8 cm).Purchase constructional adhesive as well. You will need it to glue the saucer on top of the terracotta pots.Purchase polyurethane sealer and paint, if you choose to decorate your birdbath. Polyurethane sealer can give your birdbath a nice shine and help protect it from the elements. With paint, you can give your birdbath a beautiful design of your own making., Use cardboard to sand away rough edges on the outside of the pot. Rub jagged edges until they are smooth., Do this to give the surface a protective shine. Stir the polyurethane and then apply it to a paint brush. Run the brush over the pot to apply a light coat of sealer, with no clumps or dripping sealant. Allow it to dry in the sun and then sand off any imperfections in the coat.This step Is not absolutely necessary, but will add to the visual appeal and longevity of the bath.

, You can paint the pots with original designs to make the bath look more appealing. While the pots are stacked, draw a line where the pots meet with a pencil, so you know what will be visible and what won’t. Apply polyurethane sealant afterward to protect your paint job.


Once you draw the line, you will know what isn’t visible and can save yourself the time of painting areas that will be covered up. You can paint the pots different colors or the same. With the lines, you will know where they meet, so you can even paint designs that cross over from one pot to the other.

, The bath will hold up longer if it is not placed directly on the dirt. A wooden patio or level piece of stone is ideal., Place the largest pot on the bottom, with the opening on the ground. Place the other pots on top of it, largest to smallest., Apply construction adhesive to the area where the saucer would rest on top of the smallest pot. Allow it to dry for 24 hours and then check if is secure.You do not need to glue the pots together. They should be secure without applying glue. If you don’t glue them together, you can deconstruct and move the birdbath easier.

, Once the lid is secure, fill it with water to bring the birds over. Consider placing one or two small rocks in the saucer so that the birds have a sense for the depth of the water. This will make them more likely to make use of their new amenity.

Find four sturdy branches.,
Hammer the branches into the ground.,
Place a bowl on top of the stakes.,
Fill the bowl up with water.",How to Make a Bird Bath3," For this birdbath, you will need four long, straight, and relatively thick branches. Consider taking some off a tree, that way they will be relatively fresh, without any rot.The branches should be about 2 feet (.6 m) long, so that they are large enough to be staked in the ground and still elevate the bowl a few inches from the ground. The branches should also be at least 2 inches (5 cm) wide to be sturdy enough to support a bowl.

, The branches should be in a square pattern, equidistant from each other. Push them into the ground, approximately a foot, so that they are securely staked into the dirt. You might want to dig up the dirt a little, to help place them underground, and then fill the holes in around the stakes.To get the distance right, try balancing the bowl on the stakes ahead of time. See how far they need to be from each other to obtain optimal balance. When, you have found a good placement, mark the ground and begin hammering your branches in at that location., Place the bowl on top of the four stakes. Check to see if it well-balanced between the four branches. Any bowl will work, but it is best to use one that isn’t valuable and won’t break. A wooden bowl is an excellent choice., It will generally be easier to balance a deep bowl on top of the stakes, but do not fill these bowls up all the way. 1-2 (2-5 cm) inches of water is ideal for a bird bath."

Using the wire snips, cut off the top (hook section) of the coat hangers.,
Take the wire and wire the straight (or long ends) of the hooked coat hangers together.,
Take the other ends of the coat hangers, and create large hooks which are fitted to the underside of the wreath.,
Cut the leaves off the fresh grapevine, and wrap the coat hangers with the fresh grapevine.,
Place the rocks in the pottery bowl.,
Add water to about one inch or one half inch from the top.",How to Make a Bird Bath from Coat Hangers," Use your hands to straighten them out, or set them on the driveway or a sidewalk and use a hammer to straighten them. Once you have straightened the clothes hangers, bend one end of each of them to form a small hook about the size of a cup hook. You will probably need to use pliers to do this.;
, You will eventually use another wire through the three hooks or loops to affix to a tree or other object from which you will be hanging your bird bath.

, Hook the wreath to the three coat hangers so that the wreath is on the bottom, with the three coat hangers forming a conical or tripod shape, which comes to an apex above the center of the wreathe (where you have previously wired the three coat hangers together and made the small cup hook shapes). Then, wire each of the larger hooks which support the wreath to the wreath itself, so as to safeguard against them coming off.

, This will disguise or cover the coat hangers and give the bird bath a look of aesthetic continuity. Other options would include covering the coat hangers with leafy silk vines, silk flowers, or holiday lights.

, It is a good idea to use river rocks which can be purchased from craft stores and come in various colors. Fill the bowl to about two inches from the top with the rocks. Place the bowl inside the center of the wreath.

, Place your new bird bath in an ideal spot for watching its new customers. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!

Plant a hummingbird garden.,
Plant on a continuous blooming schedule.,
Don’t use pesticides around your hummingbird plants.,
Provide places for hummingbirds to perch, like trees and plant hangers.,
Make your own nectar.,
Hang multiple red hummingbird feeders when it gets warm.To really catch the hummingbirds’ eyes and to keep competition at a minimum, get multiple feeders, all of which should have red on them (their favorite color).,
Choose different spots to keep the birds from fighting.,
Buy an ant guard if necessary.,
Change the nectar every 3-4 days.,
Decorate your yard in red.,
Use orange or red reflective surveyor’s tape.,
Install a shallow fountain with an upward spray or a fine mist.",How to Attract Hummingbirds," To get hummingbirds the natural way, plant a garden specifically geared toward what attracts them. That means a garden full of azaleas, bee balm, butterfly bushes, columbine, foxglove, hostas and morning glories (all of these are full of delicious nectar and are bright and colorful). Choose varieties that have very little smell, but have a high visibility and nectar production.


You can use trees, vines, shrubs, and flowers, both perennials and annuals – these suggestions are just the beginning of the list. Other ideas include honeysuckle, cypress vine, coral bells, and impatiens.
Tubular flowers hold the most nectar; therefore, these types of flowers are the most appealing to these little buzzing birds.;
, Different plants and flowers bloom at different times during the spring and summer. To make sure there are always blooms in your hummingbird garden, plant some flowers that bloom early, some that bloom mid-season, and some that bloom late.


Deadhead your flowers, too, to keep them blooming longer. This means that after blossoms have just wilted, you cut off their seed heads, tricking them into thinking they still need to bloom.They'll bloom once more healthily and heavily.

, The birds could ingest the pesticides, harming or even killing themselves in the process. What’s more, the birds eat the insects that the spray kills, so you would be killing their source of protein, too. In short, skip the pesticides. The hummingbirds may take care of some of the bugs for you.


To be safe, always go all-natural, whether that means no pesticides or no artificial sugars in your nectar. Hummingbirds have delicate systems and should only ingest what is natural and safe.

, Hummingbirds need breaks, too! When they're not flitting about at super high speeds, they need a place to perch. Keep branches or hangers nearby for when they need a rest.


The male hummingbird is territorial, and guards both his space and food source. Typically, he will choose a perching spot that allows him to watch the source and keep the competition away.

, Many believe that hummingbirds respond quickly and more consistently with homemade nectar. Make enough for each feeder to be ½ full (otherwise the nectar gets old and molds too quickly). Here’s how:


Combine 1 part sugar with 4 parts water
Boil 1-2 minutes
Cool and store the liquid in a resealable container in the refrigerator

Do not use red food coloring, honey, or sugar sweetener. All of these are bad for hummingbirds., Not enough red? Tie a ribbon on them to make spotting them even easier.


As for “when it gets warm,” that all depends on your location. Some locations get warm in January, some in May. Whenever that is for you, make sure to hang them up at the very beginning of the season (5-10 days before you expect them) so your hummingbirds stay a while!
Don’t take your feeders down at the end of the season! Even when your hummingbirds leave for the winter, you may get new hummingbirds that are en route somewhere that could use your feeders as a convenient pit-stop.

, Your feeders should be spaced far apart and around corners where one male hummingbird can't guard them all – male hummingbirds are very territorial. This will increase hummingbird numbers by giving other males, females, and juveniles a chance to feed without being chased away by a dominate male.


Nestle one or two in your garden, hang one up in a tree, and even consider putting one or two in your front yard, where it’s a sure thing they won’t be seen around back!
Try to pick areas that are in the shade, at least most of the day. This will deter mold growth, which hummingbirds are not fond of.Some people prefer to hang all their feeders together. This one no bird can be dominant, unable to fight off the wards of other birds., Most of the feeders have them built in, but if yours doesn’t, you can buy one separately. You can also rub a little petroleum jelly on the edges to keep them away from the nectar, but this does require cleaning every couple of days.Bees are a little harder to get rid of. A bee-proof feeder is your best shot, but even that won’t work 100% of the time. If you see nectar on the ridges of your feeder (as dripped by the birds), wipe it up to reduce temptation to the bees.

, Even if all the nectar isn’t gone, change the nectar. If you don’t, it’ll likely mold – this happens even more quickly in hotter climates. This is largely why you should only fill your feeders 1/2 full.


With each changing of the nectar, rinse out the feeder with hot water; don’t use dish soap. If there’s mold (you'll see black spots), scrub it off or use sand and shake it until the mold comes loose.
Hummingbirds prefer clean feeders, and actually will abandon a feeder that is neglected. To keep your hummingbirds happy, keep your feeders clean., That means red gazing balls, red garden flags and red lawn furniture, in addition to more natural touches, like flowers. In their constant search for nectar-producing flowers, hungry hummingbirds are attracted to the color red more than any other. You can also turn your yard into a hummingbird magnet by hanging red bows, ribbons and decorations.


If anything is becoming faded, dull, or the paint has rubbed off, repaint it! And if it’s just a small area that needs a touch up, red nail polish is cheap and works wonders.

, Not only is the tape useful because it’s brightly colored, it is thought that hummingbirds are sensitive to ultraviolet rays, which these fluorescent tapes reflect in abundance. You can find surveyor’s tape in most hardware stores and it's inexpensive, too.

, Because they are so small, hummingbirds usually get enough water by drinking the dew that gathers on leaves. However, they have a strong need to bathe because of the sticky nectar they eat. They love a fine mist or spray to stay cool and clean.


Place this within sight of your feeders – as hummingbirds best sense is sight, the easier it is to see, the easier it is for them to find.
Keep the water flowing! If the fountain is in the sun, the water may evaporate quicker than you realize. Check it every other day or so to make sure the water is running at the right level and no other animals have tainted the water.

Understand bird behavior.,
Don't reward squawking.,
Teach your bird to speak softly.,
Reward good behavior.",How to Keep a Pet Bird Quiet1," Most birds tend to make some noise, either by singing or squawking. Birds tend to be most vocal during waking hours in the morning and before going to sleep in the evening. Some birds are more prone to making noise than others, but understand before bringing home a bird that some noise will be inevitable.Cockatoos are considered one of the most vocal species of birds. Though their vocalizations are typically limited to morning and evening time, they are widely held to be the loudest birds one can own as a pet.Macaws also tend to be very loud, but their vocalizations are usually most prominent in the morning and evening, much like cockatoos.Conures are prone to loud, piercing calls, but typically are most vocal when making ""contact"" calls to owners, rather than being ""chatty"" throughout the day.
Cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, and parrotlets are known to be vocal throughout the entire day. If you're interested in getting a bird that won't make too much noise, consider avoiding these birds.;
, Every time you react to a bird's incessant squawking, regardless of species, it reinforces in your bird's mind that his annoying behavior will help him attain the attention he desires. Bird owners reward squawking by showering a vocal bird with affection, or even by running into the room and yelling for him to stop. It will be hard at first, but over time, ignoring your bird's squawking will train him out of this attention-seeking behavior.Leave the room when your bird begins to act out.
Do not return to the room until he has stopped squawking or screaming.
Return once your bird has been silent for at least ten seconds.
Give him praise and reward him with a treat to show him that not making noise will earn him your affection.

, Praise your bird when he whistles or whispers, instead of squawking or yelling. This may be especially useful for parrots, as it will be easier to teach soft-spoken words rather than sounds.Do not raise your voice in response to your bird's volume or tone.
Speak softly whenever you address your bird, and whenever you're around him.
Praise your bird every time he lowers his voice to match yours.

, If your bird currently has a vocal range that is an acceptable volume, offer your bird food or toys as a reward whenever he uses that vocal range. Over time, he will come to associate that vocal range with whatever you choose to reward him with.Always praise good behavior immediately. If any time passes between his action and your reaction, he may not associate the two.
Any time your bird yells or speaks loudly, you should temporarily stop showing him affection and leave the room immediately.
Use a distinct ""reward"" treat. Find out what your bird really likes, and save those treats for training purposes. It may give your bird the extra motivation he needs to follow your lead.

"
"
Turn out the lights.,
Keep the noise down.,
Avoid quick movements.,
Take note of his reactions.",How to Keep a Pet Bird Quiet2," Some birds feel over-stimulated when exposed to too much sunlight. As a general rule, birds exposed to more than 12 hours of light each day can have elevated hormone levels, aggressive behavior, and increased noise output.Close the curtains in the afternoon to limit sunlight exposure, and put a sheet or cover over your bird's cage when you go to bed.
Make sure there's enough air flow coming in under the sheet you use.
Do not use polyester, as this fabric does not breathe well.
For best light-blocking abilities, use a black cloth.

, Some birds respond to environmental sound with their own sound. If you're watching television or listening to music at home, keep it at a relatively low volume. Once your bird becomes accustomed to a quieter home environment, he may become a calmer, quieter bird.Talk quietly. Birds will often quiet down to hear what you are saying.
Never yell at your bird. Try to avoid talking loudly or excitedly around him as well.

, It's possible that you or someone in your household is moving too quickly around your bird, causing him to feel anxious or over-stimulated. Move slowly around your bird, and encourage everyone else in your household to do the same.If you have children living at home, teach them not to run through the room your bird is in.
Never let children handle your bird without strict supervision.
Teach everyone in your household to handle the bird gently, and to avoid quick or jarring movements around him.

, A bird will notice subtle differences in how his owner looks and acts. It's possible that your bird is distressed by the sight of certain new physical characteristics of you or your family.Seemingly minor changes like wearing a hat, wearing certain types of eyewear, or even wearing certain colors can upset your bird.
Avoid wearing whatever upsets your bird, or expose him to it slowly and gradually so he becomes used to it.

Rule out health problems.,
Give your bird playtime and exercise.,
Change up your bird's toys.,
Calm your bird when he's anxious.,
Give your bird reassurance.",How to Keep a Pet Bird Quiet3," If your bird is feeling ill or in pain, he may be squawking to let you know about his ailment. This is especially pertinent if your bird has started screaming or squawking recently, but doesn't normally behave that way. Take your bird in to the vet for a proper examination, and be sure to check that your bird has enough food and water when he gets noisy.Other common signs of a serious health problem include:


Sudden changes in appetiteDifficulty standing or maintaining balanceChanges in stool color or consistencyA disheveled, ruffled appearance., Some birds squawk and scream when they're bored or feeling neglected. While you don't want to reward negative behavior with attention, your bird may just need other outlets for his energy.Try giving your bird a jungle gym for his cage. This will allow him to exercise and play whenever he wants to.Leave toys in his cage. Birds like to feel stimulated, and may respond well to having toys, especially those that have food hidden inside and require your bird to figure out how to get the food., If your bird is prone to boredom but responds well to toys, it's possible your bird needs new stimuli on a regular basis. Changing up his toys every few weeks may provide your bird with the stimulation he needs.Birds love colorful toys. If the toy makes sounds, it will be even more desirable to your bird.Give your bird some sort of puzzle-based toy. Birds love mental and physical challenges, and odds are your bird will appreciate having something to stimulate his creativity., Try cradling your bird underneath your shirt, if he is small enough to fit. Having added warmth and physical contact can often help calm a loud, upset bird.

, Birds in the wild participate in ""flock calls"" as a way of communicating with other birds and ensuring the safety of the flock. If your bird is prone to squawking when you leave the room, it could be his attempt at sending you a flock call. Try squawking back at him from the other room to let him know where you are and reassure him that you're safe."

Choose the pieces of wood.,
Sand the wood smooth.,
Nail or glue the four rim pieces to the top side of the table top.,
Attach the base pieces to the post piece.,
Attach support pieces to the base pieces.,
Attach the table top to the pole.,
Place the finished wooden bird table in the garden.,
Make sure it is sitting firmly and won't fall over when the birds land on it.",How to Build a Bird Table1," You can use recycled or new wood, provided the pieces are good for outdoor use and are not painted with anything that might be toxic to birds. Decide on the size of the table top; this shouldn't be too small, or the birds might squabble to get to the food. For this simple wooden bird table, you'll need:


1 piece of wood about 30 x 50cm (12 x 20 inches) (just a suggested size), approximately 0.5 to 1cm/ 1/2 inch thick (table top piece)
Four slim pieces of wood about 1cm/2 inches high to form a rim on the table top piece
One thick long piece of wood for the post (the height should be determined by the height you can reach comfortably for adding birdseed)
Four pieces of wood for the base, all of the same length, width and height
Four wooden support pieces that go from the base pieces and attach to the post piece
Four metal angle brackets to attach the table top to the post
See ""Things You'll Need"" below for a complete list.;
, This is vital for the table top piece and the ridges added to it as it will prevent any build-up of old food in crevices, which could also harbor disease.


Do not coat the wood on the feeding part of this table unless you know the product is absolutely safe for birds. It is better to reattach new tabletops after weathering than to poison your feathered friends.

, Leave a small gap between each end or at two opposite ends, so that sweeping out old birdseed is made easier and rainwater can drip out with ease.


If using glue, ensure that it is not toxic and will survive outdoors.

, Nail or glue the four base pieces to the bottom of the post; each one should be facing outward to form a cross shape around the post base, creating a stand.


These base pieces need to be long enough to support the weight of the bird table. They should also be substantial, so that they sit solidly.

, Nail or glue short wooden support pieces to both the base pieces and the post, at an angle.

, Do this using the brackets, nailing both the post and the tabletop where the bracket holes indicate. As you're adding the brackets, keep checking the levelness and sturdiness of the tabletop and make adjustments as needed.

, The base can be affixed safely to the ground by using wooden wedges each side of a base piece, held in place by a strong rubber strap.

, If you would like, you can add a birdhouse to the top, or screw in hooks for hanging bird feeder chains from the sides of the table (just be sure to balance these evenly).

Decide where to place your bird bath.,
Place a wooden post in the ground.,
Secure the bird bath on the post.",How to Build a Bird Bath," Birds must be able to easily access the bath while feeling safe.


Do not place the bird bath too close to brush. Cats are natural predators of birds, and because they can easily hide in nearby brush, birds are likely to avoid proximity to these plantings.
Keep the bird bath out of wide-open areas, because hawks can swoop down from a high-glide and capture birds out in the open, birds will not frequent a bath without access to protected areas.
Place your bird bath in a location that gets midday shade (around 1:00 p.m.). Some sun is important; seek a balance of lighting to ensure you build a bird bath the birds want to visit.;
, For this simple bird bath design, a mailbox post (or comparable) will do.


Dig a hole where you want to place your bird bath using a shovel. The hole should be large enough to seat the post.
Seat the post (you can seat it in concrete or the dirt). Fill in the dirt around the base of the post. Build up a mound of dirt at its base for additional stability. Pack the dirt down with the shovel or your hands, or by stepping on it, to ensure that the post continues to stand straight.

, You can use anything that will hold water: a terracotta pan, a garbage bin lid or a concave stone. Something with a lid or edge is best, as it will provide the birds somewhere to stand.


Some might advise you to screw the bird bath to the post permanently, but securing the pan so it can't be removed prevents proper cleaning. You need to be able to remove the pan to change water and clean the pan. This is important for the health of the birds. If you don't keep the bath scrupulously clean daily, you could be getting birds very sick, and even killing them.
Place a rock in the pan for added stability. This will be especially important for lighter-weight pans, such as an aluminium garbage pan lid. It also provides birds another place to stand other than the edge of the pan. The rock is important for small birds like sparrows who can't reach from the edge, and are afraid to jump into the water. But place the rock close to the edge not in the middle. Because large birds, like robins love to flap their wings, and the rock will impede this if it is in the middle.

Feeling like a planning a birding trip?",How to Attract Woodpeckers to Your Yard," There are many species of woodpecker found throughout North America. Knowing which ones you may encounter based on your location can help you sort out the feed and placement of feeders and other things that attract woodpeckers.


The Downy Woodpecker is checkered with black and white and is found all over the United States and parts of Canada. This woodpecker enjoys suet feeders and loves the challenge of an upside-down feeder.
The Hairy Woodpecker is similar in appearance to the Downy Woodpecker, though it has a much longer beak and is fairly shy in comparison with its look-alike. These woodpeckers are also found through the United States and in parts of Canada, and have been spotted in areas as far south as Mexico. This bird does not typically eat from feeders.
The Northern Flicker is a polka-dotted woodpecker that is found all over North America--even down to Central America. When in flight, you can see spots of yellow and red and are typically covered in unique black markings. These birds tend to feed on insects on or near the ground, though they will eat from feeders on occasion.
Pileated, Red-headed, and Red Bellied Woodpeckers are found primarily in the Eastern United States. Pileated Woodpeckers are large crow-sized birds that are mostly black with a red crest and white lines near the throat. These birds rarely eat from feeders. The Red-Headed Woodpecker is a rare bird whose population may be encouraged with bird houses. This bird's diet includes fruit, seeds, nuts, other small birds, and small rodents. The Red Bellied Woodpecker is medium sized and displays a bright red head and belly on a mostly black body. This bird is known to eat at suet and nut feeders.
Lewis's Woodpecker and the Red-Naped Sapsucker are two rarer species that are located primarily in the western United States. Lewis's Woodpeckers are medium-sized birds with gray chests, a dark red face, and a pinkish belly. They are insect eaters who glean their meals from the surfaces of trees. Red-Naped Sap Suckers are found in the lower regions near the Rocky Mountains. They tend to favor sap from the willow trees, but are known to eat from other trees as well.;
, Woodpeckers love nuts, insects, seeds, and are attracted to feeders offering them what they would love to munch on in the wilds. By offering the right food selection, you can attract a broad range of species into your yard.


Suet is hard fat located around the organs in beef and mutton. It is also well-loved by most woodpeckers. Suet comes in cakes and can be placed in special upside-down feeders that discourage starlings--an invasive bird species--while still allowing chickadees and woodpeckers to feed.It is not recommended that you feed birds suet during warm summer months as the suet can melts and get on bird wings. This is dangerous because summer months coincide with egg incubation and suet on eggs shells clogs poor, preventing oxygen from getting to the embryo.Nuts and seeds, specifically peanuts and black oil sunflower seeds, are well-loved by woodpeckers and are relatively cheap feed options.
Fruit is another food happily consumed by most woodpeckers. Cut up oranges and apples are especially attractive and contain a lot of nutrients important for this active bird's health.
Meal worms are the larvae of the the beetle Tenebrio molitor. They should be placed in feeders that are deep enough to prevent them from wriggling free. Meal worms can last for weeks from the purchase date if maintained at 40–50 °F (4–10 °C)., Though woodpeckers spend a majority of their time looking for natural food sources like beetle larvae, spiders, ants and other insects, you can attract these tough-beaked birds to your yard by making wise choices about your feeder station.


Upright feeders will support the birds' eating positions comfortably.
Position feeders to mimic birds' natural feeding preferences. Suet stations, for example, will be far more effective and popular near a tree.
Place your feeders in more quiet locations to make the birds feel secure. Well-lit, sunny areas are also preferable as this aids visibility for always-vigilant woodpeckers.

, Woodpeckers will visit bird baths to drink and bathe. They prefer a quieter, more private bath close to the ground. Make sure the bath is fairly shallow--1½""-2"".


Try placing a small fountain with a running water pump in a shady area away from the center of the yard. To encourage the woodpeckers to use the bath, you might place low perches around the bath.
During cold winter months, you must be vigilant about ice forming in fountains. The easiest and most ecologically efficient way to provide water to birds during these months is to set out a plastic bowl of water at the same time every day. Retrieve this bowl any time you see ice forming.

, As with most birds, woodpeckers love privacy and the ability to hide. Coniferous and deciduous trees both provide shelter and act as a food source for woodpeckers. Planting a number of those types of trees in a small area will allow the woodpeckers to feel secure.


Planting scrubby shrubs at the base of these trees will provide additional security for woodpeckers, and can also provide them with additional food sources.
Some woodpeckers, like the pileated, love dead trees. Instead of having them removed, try keeping them on your property to encourage roosting and even nesting.
Consider placing a roosting box in your backyard during winter months. Choosing the right location for the nesting box is very important. Try to place the box close to vegetation the woodpeckers frequent. Placing the boxes higher off the ground and on poles can protect against predators. You can purchase these boxes, or make your own. They should have drainage and ventilation holes, be easy to clean and built sturdily., Take some first steps towards becoming a backyard blue birder.

Choose the wood pieces for the project.,
If not already done, cut the pieces of wood.,
Nail the edge pieces to the top side of the tabletop piece.,
Attach the post to the tabletop.,
If using hooks to hang feeders from, attach these to the side of the tabletop.,
Dig a small hole into the ground.,
Add birdseed to the bird table.",How to Build a Bird Table2," You'll need:


1 piece of marine plywood measuring 300mm x 300mm x 12mm (11.8 inches x 11.8 inches x 0.472 inches) thickness for the tabletop
Four strips of wood measuring 50mm x 275mm x 12mm (1.9 inches x 10.8 inches x 0.472 inches) thickness for the tabletop edge pieces
1 post or pole approximately 1.5m (4.92 feet) long
See the ""Things You'll Need"" list for the remaining items.

, Sand the tabletop and edge pieces to ensure that there are no crevices in the wood that might harbor uneaten food that can encourage bacteria.

, Leave small gaps at each end to make it easy to sweep out uneaten birdseed and to allow for water run-off.

, Use the angle brackets to screw the post and tabletop together, following the guidance of the angle bracket holes. As you add the brackets, keep checking that the tabletop is level and that the brackets are sitting properly.

, Be sure to place them for even hanging.

, Push the post in firmly. The bird table is now ready for use.

, Watch the birds as they come to eat.

Glue the saucer base to the top of the pole or spindle.,
Fill with birdseed.",How to Build a Bird Table3," You'll also need a post or a spindle from a chair or other furniture item (or purchase one from the hardware store).

, Use caulking to do this. Allow to set properly before proceeding.

, You won't be able to do this once the cup and saucer are attached, although the alternative is to dig the hole first, then simply insert the pole or spindle (which you'll need to do if you want to move this object around).

, Do this so as to center the teacup and saucer evenly on the pole or spindle. Allow to dry completely.

, Let the birds come.


Note: When it rains, this item will fill up with rainwater. That will make a nice bath for the birds but you should remove soggy birdseed from it.

Find some beautiful old glass dishes that can be transformed into a bird table.,
Try the pieces together before gluing in place.,
Glue the pieces together in the order outlined in the previous step.,
Place the bird feeder on an outdoor table or other object lifted up off the ground.,
Wait for the birds.",How to Build a Bird Table4," This is a great opportunity to hunt through the thrift or antique stores, or flea markets and car boot sales, looking for old dishes. For this tutorial, you'll need two old glass cake stands and a middle piece, such as a strong vase or a high-sided small bowl.


Be sure to wash and thoroughly dry the pieces before gluing together.

, Turn one cake stand downward, so that the plate section is flat on the work surface. Balance the centerpiece (vase or bowl) on the stand base of this upturned cake stand. It should sit fairly firmly. Then place the other glass cake stand carefully on top of the vase or bowl, keeping a good hold on it in case it wobbles and falls. If the whole display appears balanced and firm, then it's good to glue. If not, try with a different centerpiece until you find a good fit.

, Allow the glue to dry firmly between each glued object before proceeding to the next gluing stage.

, Sprinkle birdseed on top.

, The feeder will soon attract their interest.

Note the bird's behavior and energy.,
Make sure the bird is eating.,
Ask about the bird's age.,
How are the shop owners treating the animals?,
Scan the bird's eyes.,
Avoid any birds that have trouble breathing.,
Ask if you are able to hold the bird before buying it!",How to Choose a Healthy Bird," Does this bird just mope around or is it tweeting happily? A healthy bird looks wide awake and moves around. A bird that looks strangely sleepy is definitely way too ill to be taken home and will cost lots of money to help cure.;
, If you haven't yet seen the bird eat, make sure you do. This is important because birds generally eat quite a lot. It's best to look around and choose the bird that seems to have the best appetite. This may include waiting for several minutes to examine the birds.

, If you select a bird that has not yet been fully weaned then this could lead to many health risks when bringing it home. And if you cannot determine the age then just make sure the bird has all its feathers. This is an important role in the health of the bird.

, Especially the birds. If the bird cages are unclean, smelly, and don't have enough/appropriate food and lining on the bottom, then most likely all the birds are sick.

, Is there any fluids or discharge dripping from them? Does it have trouble fully opening it's eyes? These are definite signs that the bird is not healthy. Inspect how clean the feathers are. Dirty feathers mean that the bird probably can't preen itself.

, The birds shouldn't be making any odd noises while breathing, so be sure to ask the salespeople about the breathing.

, Let it perch on your finger and stroke it gently. If it reacts well, then you're in luck!

Position the box properly.,
Place wood shavings in the bottom of the box.,
Add a stick or a small board on the outside of the box.,
Create a water source.,
Attract rodents.,
Avoid using pesticides or poisons around your property.",How to Attract Owls," The easiest way to find out what type of owls live around you is to listen to their calls at night time. Night time is the best time since owls do the majority of their hunting at night. You can hear the calls of common owls at https://www.allaboutbirds.org/., In addition to listening to the calls of owls at night, spend some time trying to visually spot the owls that live near you. The best way to visually identify owls is to get a bird book for the region you live in.

Check out the All About Birds website for pictures of owls common to North America.
You may have the best luck spotting an owl early in the morning or at dusk.

, In addition to listening and looking for owls around your home, consider talking to a local wildlife expert or someone of a similar profession. Local experts will know what owls live near you and may be able to give you advice about how to attract them to your property. To find a wildlife expert, consider calling:

The local Humane Society.
A local zoo.
The biology department of a nearby college or university., Depending on the types of owls that inhabit your region, you’ll need a box that is suited to those specific owls. This is important, as owls vary greatly in size and behavior. If you don’t have the right box, you won’t be able to attract owls to your property.Use this chart to determine the appropriate size of box for the type of owl in your area: http://www.audubon.org/sites/default/files/documents/nest_box_chart_0.pdf


, Look for a location near a field, meadow, or another open area. In addition, choose a location that does not have much man-made noise. An area far from a road will work well.Avoid placing owl boxes above cars, tractors, or farm equipment.
Don’t put boxes too close together. Although owls aren’t very territorial, putting boxes nearby could discourage multiple owls from nesting there.
If you’re trying to attract barn owls, you can attach the box to the inside of a barn or the outside of your home.

, Attach the box to a tree, pole, or structure that is at least 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground. In addition, the entrance must face any direction but north. If the box is too low, it might make an easy target for predators trying to eat owl chicks. If the box faces north, it will be exposed to cold northerly winds.Use 2 or 3 2-inch wood screws (5 cm) to secure the box to the tree or structure. The box should be able to support up to 5 lbs (2.25 kg).
Make sure the box entrance is clear and faces an open area.

, Fill the box with 2 or 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of untreated wood shavings. The wood shavings will serve as nesting material for owl chicks during the spring time. It will also provide warmth for more mature owls during the winter., Use several wood screws to secure a stick or small board to the outside of the box. This will allow the owl to perch in front of the box. It will make the box a much more attractive home site., Provide a somewhat large and deep bird bath. This is important, as small bird baths that may work for other birds aren’t large enough to accommodate most owls. Ultimately, without a clean water source, you won’t be able to attract owls.If you have a nearby pond, stream, or similar source of natural water, you won’t need to provide water.
The larger the source of water, the farther from the box it can be. If the only source is a small bird bath, try to position it within several hundred feet of the box.

, While it may seem like something you don’t want to do, by providing food for rodents (like grain and corn), you’ll help attract owls. This is because owls rely heavily on rodents as a source of food. Without a proper food source, owls won’t move onto your property., By using pesticides or other poisons to kill rodents or insects, you’ll inadvertently poison owls around your home. This is because rodents will feed on poisoned insects and then be eaten by owls – poisoning them, too. By using poison on your property, you’ll make a huge – and devastating – impact on the owl population in the area."

Acclimate your bird to your hand.,
Place a treat in your hand.,
Hold your index finger like a perch.,
Take your bird from his cage.,
Use your hands like a ladder.,
Command your bird to step down.",How to Train Your Bird1," Training your bird to step up has many benefits, including decreasing his fear towards you, establishing your authority, and decreasing his territorial behavior.Your bird may not be immediately comfortable with stepping up on your hand, so he will need to first get used to your hand. Begin by placing your hand near the outside of his cage for about a week, and talking to him in a gentle voice.Once your bird is comfortable with the sight of your hand, place your hand in his cage in a slow and non-threatening manner. It may take another week before he is comfortable with your hand inside his cage.;
, Your bird may be comfortable with your hand inside his cage, but he still may not want to step on it. Entice him to come closer with a treat. Reward him with the treat when he steps closer, even if he does not actually touch your hand at first.It may take several tries before your bird is ready to take the treat from your hand.Be patient with him.
Spray millet is a great bird treat., Once your bird is at ease with your hand being inside his cage, position your index finger like a perch (finger pointed out). Slowly move your hand closer to your bird. Next, gently press your finger against your bird’s lower chest to encourage him to step up onto your finger.Use a verbal cue (‘step up’ or ‘up’) as you press your finger against his chest.Reward your bird immediately with verbal praise (‘good bird’) and a treat when he steps up onto your finger.Your bird may not initially understand that he is supposed to step up onto your hand. If he runs away from your hand, entice him to your finger with some spray millet rather than following him around his cage with your hand., Slowly take him out of his cage when he is perched on your finger. Be careful to avoid any toys or perches as you move your hand outside of his cage.Do not be surprised if your bird suddenly panics and flies off your finger. If he does so, calmly walk to him and encourage him to step up again. Repeat this each time he flies off your finger.If your bird seems distressed or exhausted, stop your training session and return him to his cage.Hold your bird at your chest level when you have him outside of his cage. This will establish your authority over him., To add a challenge to this trick, encourage your bird to step up multiple times. Position your free hand above the hand on which he is perched. With the index finger of your free hand positioned like a perch, gently press against his chest and say your verbal cue.Repeat this several times, rewarding your bird each time that he steps up.You can also gently lift and stroke his toes to increase his comfort level of being perched on your finger., Slowly move your bird back into his cage with him still perched on your finger. Position him such that he will be facing forward in his cage. If you will be placing him on a perch, make sure that your finger is below the perch.Use a verbal cue (‘step down’ or ‘down’) as he steps down, even though he will be stepping up onto his perch.Reward your bird when he steps off your finger.

Clear your yard of things that might scare crows away.,
Place decoys.,
Use crow calls.,
Create a roosting place.,
Spread food.,
Once you have started spreading food, create a regular feeding schedule.,
Have water available.,
Be patient.",How to Attract Crows," Crows are easily spooked by random noises, so items like bells, wind chimes, and even squeaky loose gates can keep them away.Additionally, crows are frightened by reflective surfaces that move in the breeze, creating random flashes of light. Figures like scarecrows or owl decoys can be frightening to crows at first, but they are intelligent birds, and will not be fooled for long., If it looks like one crow is in your yard, others will want to follow. It should appear natural and alive, and figures hung upside-down, or otherwise appearing dead, like some Halloween decorations, will scare them off.

, You can either purchase an electronic caller, or attempt using a hand caller yourself. There are a variety of different calls used by crows, many of which will draw a nearby group. Some popular calls are the Attention Call, the Rally Call, and the Distress Call, all of which will draw curious crows to your location.


Hand calling is difficult, but can give you greater flexibility in calling and communication with the birds. Place the call between your thumb and index finger, making a cup around the end with your hands. Rather than blow through, you will want to make a growling noise into the call, as if you were clearing your throat., Crows like horizontal places to rest, like fences and tree branches. They are sociable birds, so you will need many places for them to sit and stay. Crows are large birds, so any roosting place should be very sturdy. Old fashioned concrete birdbaths can be very useful.You can also create an artificial structure if you do not have enough natural spaces. Drive or set poles into the ground, then place a cross-bar between them for more roosting room., Crows will eat just about anything, so you are pretty safe regardless of the food you put out for them. To first attract crows, you will want some noticeable, like peanuts in the shell. Once they become regulars in your yard, you can use a wider variety of foods, including kibbled pet food or meat scraps. Crows can eat a lot of food, so don't be afraid to spread more if they eat it all.

, Crows are intelligent, and will quickly learn if you provide food regularly, and a regular source of food is very attractive to any wild animal.

, Keep it in small, shallow containers for the crows and other birds to drink. You will want it to be sturdy, so that cats looking for a drink, or a bird, will not knock it over easily. Make sure the water stays ice free during the winter.

, You may not get crows right away, as your food supplies may attract squirrels, blue jays, and other small birds. You may need to spread food for several days before crows follow the blue jays to your food supplies.

Avoid pesticides.,
Plant native berry-bearing plants.,
Offer meal worms.,
Add fruit to the feeder.",How to Attract Eastern Bluebirds," Providing a secure nesting location is one of the best ways to attract bluebirds to your property. Whether you purchase or build your nesting boxes, its important to make sure that they are good quality so they will last a long time.They should be constructed of rot-resistant wood, such as cedar.
They should be easy to open for cleaning at the end of the season.
They can be painted on the outside, but the inside should be untreated wood.
The roof of the box should be water-tight, but the floor should have drainage holes.;
, Bluebirds prefer nesting boxes that are five to six feet off of the ground. Ideally, your nest boxes should be on posts in wide open areas, as bluebirds often do not like nesting in wooded areas.Be aware that a bluebird will typically not nest within 100 yards of another bluebird. If you want to attract multiple bluebird families, make sure your nesting boxes are far enough apart from each other.

, Eastern bluebirds compete for nesting space with non-native species like house sparrows and starlings. In order to make sure you attract bluebirds, it's important to make your nesting boxes unappealing to their competitors.Do not use nesting boxes with attached perches.
Make sure the opening to the nesting box is no bigger than 1-1/2 inches, which is too small for starlings.
Make sure the interior nesting space is no bigger than 4 x 4 inches, which is too small for house sparrows.
If you have consistent problems with other bird species inhabiting your bluebird houses, you may need more bird houses. While bluebirds do not like to nest close to one another, they often do not have a problem nesting within close proximity of other species., Bluebirds start nesting in the spring, so it's important to have your nesting boxes up and ready for them by then. Depending on your longitude, bluebirds may start nesting in your area anytime between February and April.Bluebirds don't always leave their northern habitats in the wintertime. In fact, many stay in the same area all year round, roosting with other bluebirds in the cold weather. If you want to encourage your bluebirds to stay on your property during the winter, leave your nest boxes up so that they have access to them all year round., Just as important as attracting the bluebirds to your nesting boxes is keeping dangerous predators out. If you want your bluebird families to live long lives and come back to the nesting location again and again, it's best to provide some kind of barrier to predators.You can buy or make a Noel guard for your nesting box, which is mesh barrier that attaches to the front of the box, surrounding the entrance hole. Birds may be deterred by this device, so consider waiting until the bluebirds have laid eggs to install it.
You can also mount your bird house using a wobbling baffle, which is a sleeve that fits around the pole and moves to prevent predators from climbing up.

, To encourage bluebirds to keep coming back to your nesting boxes, you should be sure to clean them each year before nesting season. In addition, remove the nesting material and clean out the box after each brood of babies has left the nest. This will encourage the parents to have more babies!While cleaning the nesting boxes, inspect them carefully to ensure that they are still safe. Perform any repairs as needed.

, Bluebirds prefer to live in areas that are wide open with lots of short grass, as well as a few shrubs and trees. If possible, find a spot on your property that offers bluebirds the open space they desire. Orchards, meadows, and large lawns provide the optimal habitats for bluebirds.
If you live in the woods or in the center of a city, you may have a harder time attracting bluebirds.

, Bluebirds need water both for drinking and for bathing, so providing a convenient sources of fresh water near the nesting area may help attract them. Moving water is preferable, although a standard bird bath may be just fine.Change the water frequently to keep it fresh.
The birdbath should be no more than three inches deep, and should have gently sloping sides with a rough texture to keep the birds from slipping.
Ponds attract tree swallows, so try not to put your bluebird habitat near one.
A heated birdbath may provide extra incentive for bluebirds to stay on your property during the winter., Bluebirds like to perch up high to look for insects to feed on. To make your yard a convenient place for both nesting and foraging, make sure they have plenty of different locations to perch.If there's nowhere for bluebirds to perch in your yard, consider installing perches in various locations. These can be as simple as stake in the lawn with a horizontal piece near the top for the bird to perch on.
Bluebirds will use things like trees and fence posts for perches, so you may not need to install anything new if you already have lots of existing perches.
Ideally, you should provide a perch 10-20 yards in front of the nesting box.

, Cats are predators that may kill Eastern Bluebirds and other species of birds in your yard. If you have cats, try to keep them indoors (or at least away from your bluebirds habitat) in order to keep the space safe., Bluebirds eat insects, so they will be more likely to inhabit your yard if there are lots of insects to eat. Make sure there is plenty of food for them by avoiding the use of chemical pesticides.Because they eat insects, bluebirds are excellent at providing pest control for organic gardeners.

, In addition to insects, bluebirds also eat berries. To help give them a varied diet, try planting indigenous plants that bear berries around your property.Good examples of plants include holly, American elderberry, eastern red cedar, pokeweed, and flowering dogwood.

, Bluebirds absolutely love to eat mealworms. If you want to attract bluebirds, try putting some mealworms out in your yard. To get started, you can simply put a few mealworms in a dish in the area that you have prepared for bluebirds.You can also buy special bluebird feeders for feeding mealworms. This may make it much more convenient to offer mealworms to bluebirds, as other animals will have a harder time accessing them.
Live mealworms are the best for attracting bluebirds, but offering these may not be practical, especially if you haven't seen any bluebirds in your yard yet. If you can't offer live mealworms, consider offering canned or roasted mealworms, which will last for longer., Along with mealworms, you can add some enticing fruits to your bluebird feeder to help attract the birds. If you know there are bluebirds in the area, consider putting out some berries that have been chopped into small pieces. If you need the food to stay fresh for longer, offer dried fruits like raisins, blueberries, and cherries.Bluebirds do not eat seed, so they will not be attracted by traditional bird feeders.

Use a white or light-colored towel.,
Encourage your bird to step onto the towel.,
Wrap your bird in the towel.,
Unwrap your bird.",How to Train Your Bird2," Towel training your bird is useful if you need to groom him, administer medication, or handle him when he is injured. Bright-colored towels may be alarming to your bird, so lighter-colored towels are preferable.Place the towel on the bottom of his cage.
It may be helpful to first leave the towel in your bird’s cage for several days to allow him to get used to its presence.

, Similar to your hand, your bird may not be immediately comfortable with the towel. Place a treat on the towel to entice your bird to step on it., When your bird is standing on the towel, gently wrap him up in it from behind. It is very important that you wrap him up in such a way that he cannot bite you, but is still able to breathe comfortably. To begin, gently place your thumb and middle finger of the hand holding the towel on each side of his neck.Do not put any pressure on your bird’s neck with the thumb and middle finger.Place the index finger of the hand holding the towel on top his head to keep him still.Wrap your bird's wings inside the towel to prevent him from struggling and flapping his wings.Make sure that the towel is not rubbing your bird’s eyes.Do not put any pressure on his chest. Pressure on his chest could cause him to suffocate.Try to rest your bird in the palm of the hand holding the towel.You may need to use both hands if you have a larger bird.

, Ensure that your bird’s feet are touching the bottom of his cage. With him stabilized on a solid surface, gently release your fingers from the sides of his neck and release him from the towel. He will probably ruffle his feathers and might even vocalize when you release him.Allow your bird to relax and get comfortable again.Reward him with a treat if he was still and did not try to bite you when you held him in a towel.

Choose a command.,
Select where you want your bird to defecate.,
Observe your bird’s body language.,
Move your bird to the ‘bathroom’ location.",How to Train Your Bird3," You may not have realized it, but you can house train a bird! Other than the benefit of cleaning up fewer messes, house training your bird will enhance your bond with him and allow you to have a better understanding of his body language. The command you choose should be short, such as ‘go potty’ or ‘go poop.’Each person in your household should use the same command., Your bird’s cage probably seems like an obvious place for your bird to defecate. However, if you have him outside of his cage often, you may want to choose another object, such as newspaper or a wastebasket, where he can relieve himself.Whichever location/object you choose, use it consistently as you are house training your bird.

, Your bird will let you know when he has to go to the bathroom. For example, he may crouch his body. He may also move his tail, fluff his feathers, or step backward.Being able to recognize this body language will let you be one step ahead of him and give him the command before he defecates.It would also be helpful to make a note of when he usually goes to the bathroom. Most birds will defecate first thing in the morning, after meals, and when they are taken out of and placed back into their cages.Smaller birds tend to go the bathroom more frequently than larger birds., As soon as you see your bird making motions to relieve himself, command him to step up on your finger and move him to the area where he should defecate. Give him the verbal command and reward him immediately after he relieves himself.Practice this each time your bird needs to defecate so that he forms the association between defecating in the right location and being rewarded for it.Do not punish him if he defecates in the wrong location. Doing this may backfire—he might defecate in the wrong place just to get your attention."
"
Show your bird you love him.,
Say a word with its corresponding action.,
Listen to your bird.,
Monitor how you speak around your bird.,
Respond to your bird as he speaks to you.",How to Train Your Bird4," Teaching your bird to talk enhances your ability to communicate with him and vice versa. Before encouraging him to speak, though, it is important to communicate your love to him. Scratching your bird behind his neck while saying ‘I love you’ will let him know you love him.You can also kiss his beak and say the word ‘kiss.’You can add his name to the ‘I love you’ statement so that your bird learns his name., It will be easier for your bird to learn words if he is able to link the words with a specific action. For example, say ‘scratch’ when you scratch your bird’s neck. You can also say ‘good morning’ and ‘good night’ as you respectively greet him in the morning and go to bed at night.When you feed him, say the name of the food as you are giving it to him.In time, you may notice your bird responding to your words with his body language (e.g., lifting his wing when you say ‘scratch’).

, Initially, your bird’s words will probably not sound very clear. He may make a mumbling or whispering noise. Even if you cannot make out the words, eagerly encourage him and repeat the words back to him to get him excited about saying them.Reward him with verbal praise and a treat when he attempts to say the words you are teaching him., Birds are more likely to learn words that are spoken enthusiastically. If there is a word or phrase that you don’t want your bird to repeat, do not say it in an enthusiastic voice around him—he will probably pick up on it and repeat it when it is socially inappropriate for him to do so.The words you want your bird to learn should be the only ones spoken in an enthusiastic voice when you are around him.

, Your bird may forget the words or phrases you teach him if you do not react to him when he says them. He may also forget them if you do not continue to say them to him.Your positive reaction to him will encourage him to continue talking to you. If there is a word or phrase that you do not want your bird to say anymore, do not react to him when he says it."

Get your bird to be comfortable with you.,
Pick a good location to train your bird.,
Keep the training sessions short.,
Acclimate your bird to your training props.,
Give your bird treats.,
Be consistent when using commands.,
Be patient.,
Do not punish your bird.,
Discourage biting and screaming behavior.,
Discourage biting and chewing on furniture.",How to Train Your Bird5," This can be particularly important for older or re-homed birds who have previously been mistreated or improperly trained. Doing quiet activities around your bird, such as reading or watching TV, will allow him to get comfortable with your presence without having to interact with you.It may take your bird several weeks before he is comfortable with you. If that is the case, be patient with him and move at his pace.
Quietly talking to him can also help your bird feel more at ease with you.

, The area where you train your bird should be quiet and free of distractions.In the training area, make sure to close all windows and doors and turn off any fans.Your bird’s cage could be one of your bird’s distractions.Ideally, the cage should be out of sight. However, a bird who is insecure or easily frightened may benefit from having his cage where he can see it., As with other pets, long training sessions can lead to exhaustion or even boredom in birds. Training sessions with your bird should last for 10 minutes, two to three times a day.Your bird may also become aggressive during his training sessions. He may show his aggression by vocalizing, flapping his wings, or biting you.End the training session if he is displaying aggressive behavior.
You should always end the training session on a good note, such as giving your bird verbal praise or a treat., Depending on which command you are teaching him, you may need props during the training session. Allowing your bird to become comfortable with the props first should make the training sessions go more smoothly. Placing the props in his cage for a few days will help your bird acclimate to them.Playing with the props yourself may pique your bird’s interest in them., Positive reinforcement is very helpful when training a bird. Treats are a great way to reinforce your bird’s positive behavior. To keep from being bitten, hold your fingers to the side of the treat when you give it to him.Your bird may mistake your fingers as a nut and bite them on accident.Examples of healthy snacks for birds are strawberries, mangoes, and peppers.Spray millet is another great treat for birds.
Whichever treat you use, reserve it only for training purposes., Using the same command each time you are teaching your bird a new trick will help him learn the trick more easily.If there are multiple members of your household, it is important for each person to use the same command for the same trick.

, Your bird may take a long time to learn certain tricks. If this is the case, be patient with him as he learns. Be mindful, though, that your bird may take a long time to learn a trick because he does not want to learn it at all.If your bird is getting frustrated or starts acting aggressively, it may be time to consider teaching him another trick.

, Punishment is not effective for birds. In fact, the punishment may seem like attention to your bird, and he will continue to demonstrate the bad behavior.Positive reinforcement, such as verbal praise or treats, is much more effective at training your bird than punishment.

, Biting and screaming are two undesirable behaviors that your bird may demonstrate. If your bird bites you, gently blow a puff of air in his face and firmly say ‘no.’ Do not give your bird a timeout if he bites you—he may learn that biting you is a way to get you to leave him alone.If your bird starts to scream, stand close by and talk to him in quiet and soothing voice until he calms down.Do not give your bird treats if he bites you or screams., Bitter apple spray is an effective way of deterring your bird from inappropriate biting or chewing. Spray it wherever you notice these undesirable behaviors.He will eventually learn the places where he should not bite or chew.


Bitter apple spray is available at your local pet store.

Make sure cardinals are native to your area.,
Buy a bird feeder.,
Provide water.,
Make sure there are places for cardinals to nest in your yard.,
Watch for cardinals in your yard.,
Keep your yard free of predators and harmful chemicals.,
Put sunflower or safflower seeds in your feeder.,
Put a suet feeder out in winter.,
Put food on the ground as well.",How to Attract Cardinals," Northern cardinals are found throughout eastern and central North America from southern Canada into parts of Mexico and Central America. These birds live as far north as Maine or Nova Scotia, Canada down south through Florida and the Gulf Coast. They range as far west as South Dakota, Nebraska, and Texas. Cardinals have also been introduced to California, Hawaii, and Bermuda.
Northern cardinals do not migrate so they live in the same place year-round.;
, Cardinals prefer stationary or platform feeders over a hanging variety. Make sure the feeder is sturdy enough to handle the weight of a cardinal (which is equal to 9 US nickels) and that the perches are long enough for the birds to fit on them.Cardinals also like to have cover near feeders, so place it close to trees or shrubs that the birds can flee to if they are frightened.
Cardinals like areas with dense foliage and high perches but usually stick to the edges of forests. Suburban landscaping and common backyard trees and scrubs are usually attractive habitats to cardinals., Place a bird bath a few meters away. Bird baths do take a bit of upkeep to keep them clean and attractive to birds. Clean the birdbath every week or more often if used heavily.Scrub the bird feeder with a stiff brush, rinse it with cold water, and then refill it. If you have a build up of algae or scum on the birdbath, use a mixture of one part chlorine bleach to nine parts water to clean the bath. Then rinse thoroughly before refilling the bath with fresh water.If you live in an area where it freezes in winter, a heated birdbath will be very popular with your cardinals., Cardinals will not nest in nesting boxes, so you just need to make sure there are natural places for the birds. They like thick trees, thickets, or shrubs, where they can nest between 3 and 20 feet off the ground.Food and water doesn't need to be really close to the potential nesting area, but it should be relatively close. For instance, if the thick shrubs are in the back of your house and the food and water are in the front, it should be ok.

, Cardinals feed most heavily in the morning and evening, so keep track of their daily visits for maximum viewing. They shouldn't be hard to spot, due to their beautiful, brilliant color.


Male and female cardinals look different. Male cardinals are typically bright red overall, with a black ring around the beak. Female cardinals are usually predominately brown, with bright red bills and a red crest on the top of their heads., Keep household pets away from feeders, birdbaths, and nesting areas. Avoid using deadly poisons, such as herbicides, insecticides, or fertilizers, in the vicinity of your feeders and birdbaths. Lawn-care chemicals, for instance, are known to contaminate bird food and water and kill all types of songbirds.You can also help cardinals by eliminating the reflection on your windows near feeding or nesting areas. Cardinals are known to fly into windows, which can seriously injure or kill them. Install bird netting, awnings, window screens, or flash tape on the outside of your windows to help cardinals avoid crashing into your windows., Black Sunflower seeds are a favorite of cardinals. However, cardinals also like safflower seeds and white milo.


If you are concerned about litter from seeds, you can buy hulled sunflower seeds. Just make sure to change these seeds more often, as they don't have the same protection from going bad as whole ones with shells do.
Cardinals like large seeds. They will eat smaller seeds if nothing else is available, but they prefer large seeds, such as sunflower, safflower, peanuts, or cracked corn., In the winter use a suet feeder to provide extra energy for cardinals and other birds. While this will probably not be the primary feeding choice of cardinals in your area, they may come to a suet feeder to find extra food in the winter.


Suet should only be fed in the winter. This is because it is essentially a block of animal fat mixed with seeds. If it gets too hot, it can melt and go rancid.

, Cardinals are actually ground feeders, so they will happily eat off the ground.If you have a patch of ground that is away from low bushes or shrubs, where predators may hide, you can also scatter seed there.


Be warned that ground feeding will also be attractive to squirrels. If you have a lot of squirrels in your area, you may want to avoid ground feeding and use squirrel baffles or squirrel proof feeders."

As far as seed goes, some recommendations include sunflower hearts, black sunflower seeds, and thistle, to attract a wide variety of birds. However, the exact seeds will depend on where you live and what sorts of birds you're trying to attract, so do your research first.;
, Unless you're a skilled woodworker, in which case make a string and sturdy bird feeder. Ensure that any bird feeder used is stable, strong and safe for the birds.

, Do so as quietly and quickly as possible, so as to not disturb the birds.


Put some fruits and berries out too.







, spread peanut butter all over the pine cone. then, if you want, get some seeds and put them on a plate, and roll the pine cone in the seeds to coat it in seeds. tie a piece of yarn or string to the pine cone, and make a loop,then hang it on a post made to hold bird feeders.

, Choose bushes, grasses and nectar-providing plants., Birds are very clean creatures, so they do not go their lives without bathing.

, Make sure they are appropriate for the birds you want to attract. For example, for large birds, you would want a large house, and for small birds, a small house.

, These rats with tails will eat almost anything. If you hang your feeders on poles, you can put butter on the poles to keep the squirrels from getting on.

, Birds don't want filthy water. If you can tell it's filthy, chances are the birds won't exactly want to stop and look twice.

, This is not necessary, but it will be delightful to most, especially young children, about 4-5 years old. Remind young children to be quiet or birds will get scared. Imagine being a bird who is wild, and a huge human walks toward you. What would you do? You would probably fly away. This is why we need to be quiet and respectful to the birds.

, After a while, you will be able to look out your window and see these amazing creatures do their acrobatics through the air.

Build or purchase an open nesting platform.,
Choose a place that’s in the shade and away from predators.,
Install a birdbath.,
Offer the blue jays their favorite foods.,
Keep their perch clear.,
Consider planting an oak tree.,
Keep the food stocked.,
Be aware of the blue jays' mating and nesting habits.,
Know that blue jays are omnivorous.,
Be aware that they can be a bit raucous.,
If they start disrupting your backyard, take action.",How to Attract Blue Jays," Blue jays are attracted to flat spaces on tree branches or surfaces like window sills. For this reason, they will make good use of a flat nesting platform instead of a traditional house.


The floor area should be no less than 8 inches (20 cm) by 8 inches (20 cm). It should be high off the ground, either mounted in a tree or on a pole. Whatever platform location you choose, make sure it is not prone to predators such as raccoons. Blue jays can build their nests anywhere from 5 feet (1.5 meters) to 50 feet (15 meters) above ground.You can also buy hanging feeders, like peanut wreaths, that are especially designed to attract birds like blue jays. You can also try a fun craft if you have kids or make it alone. Take a pinecone and cover it with peanut butter and bird seeds. Birds go crazy for them and you can sometimes find these things right in your very own home.
Hanging feeders are more free-floating, making it harder for other animals like raccoons to get at. However, they are more unstable and larger birds may shy away from them.;
, Have your nesting platform inaccessible to squirrels if at all possible. Since you’ll likely be loading the platform up with nuts and seeds, it could be a squirrel’s heyday – and he could fight off the birds from his new-found treasure.


In the shade is important, too. Sometimes blue jays will eat and eat and then stock up food in their mouths (their gular pocket) to bring back to their home and bury for later. This can take a lot of time, and if they’re in the sun, they’ll heat up. Keep your feeders in the shade so they can stay comfortable.

, A birdbath a good source of water for the jays and a good source of entertainment for you as you watch them bathe. A birdbath will also attract birds of other varieties, too.


Having a birdbath with a light mister or small fountain is double the fun. The birds will be intrigued, and you’ll be intrigued watching the birds’ fascination with their find.

, The best way to attract birds to your area is with food. The blue jay's diet mainly consists of plants, vegetables and nuts, though they also eat some insects. You will draw quite a few blue jays to your area if you offer a variety in a large platform feeder. Some of the blue jay's favorites include:Peanuts (preferably shelled)
Black and striped sunflower seeds
Elder berries
Cherries
Dogwood
Acorns
Suet

, Make sure the feeding area that you offer the jays has plenty of perching available. You want a nice, large, open shelf – not an enclosed area. If you notice it’s covered in food or that part is inaccessible due to an obstacle of sorts (like a branch), adjust the shelf to make it easier for the birds to munch. If you really care about them you can clean off the sides of the house.

You should clean up any left over berries, nut shells, egg shells, feces or dead insects on the bird perch or house to keep it clean.

, Blue jays prefer oak woodlands, though they can be found just about anywhere.However, if you want the best odds of getting blue jays, oak is the way to go.


Beech trees are a solid second as they too have nuts blue jays love feasting on.
What’s more, having trees around will provide the blue jays shelter should they need it from inclement weather (which is especially important in winter). It’s good for nesting, too.

, Blue jays are some of the most intelligent birds out there and, in general, have great memories. If you only stock food intermittently, they'll likely find somewhere else to go that's more reliable. Keep the peanuts coming and you'll be logged into their brains as a good, consistent food source.Blue jays are generally quick to move. If the food disappears, they won't likely wait for it to show up. To keep the same ones around, you'll need to be on top of your blue jay game.

, Blue jays mate from March to July and this must be taken into consideration when building or installing your nesting platform. You should anticipate when the mating pair needs the nesting platform so you can have it up and ready to go. Blue jays are monogamous and will normally stay together until one dies.


It might also help if you offer a pile of sticks and twigs nearby to help them with building their nest. The efforts to build a nest can take hundreds of trips back and forth bringing in the needed materials. Providing them these items encourages them to remain in the area.

, For the most part, blue jays eat nuts and seeds, yes. But they have been known to harvest on eggs or even small frogs, baby birds, and invertebrates from time to time. You may catch a bird in the act of something you’d rather not see. It’s important to know this before you go about hoping for blue jays in your area.


Because of this, many people are actually in the market to get rid of the blue jays in their yard, believing the blue jays are wreaking havoc on the other animals that are more peaceful. It's important to consider this side before you have a yard full of them.

, They tend to move around in groups, especially in the autumn, and their social behavior can be quite dynamic.They can be obnoxious, too, scaring away other birds and even imitating hawks to do so. They’re highly territorial – but if they’re outnumbered, they’ll back off. Because of their antics, some people don’t like them in the garden or backyard, but they are quite the sight to see!


Blue jays are sort of a give and take. You may have to bequeath your yard unto them, but they will grace you with their beautiful colors. If you do decide to go this route, be ready for other birds and small animals to be more scarce. They know fighting a blue jay for territory isn't worth it.

, Blue jays are commonly referred to as bully birds, keeping other birds at bay. Sometimes they even eat their young. If you've got too many blue jays, consider constructing a ""blue jays only"" feeding area and put other feeders and birdbaths out of sight. Alternatively, keep their food source minimal so they only come around once in a while.Blue jays are fairly big birds. If you want other, smaller birds around, put up a few bird houses and feeders that the jays cannot fit into. They'll abandon the fight once they realize it's fruitless.

Learn to remain calm and not respond immediately.",How to Deal With an Annoying Situation," Breathe deeply, and if need be, walk away and return later when you don't feel so ballistic about the situation.;
, Remind yourself that there are more important battles to be won, and this isn't one of them. Put it into the big picture perspective of being a passing inconvenience, not a total derailment of your day or life.

, Find an interesting part of a tree or shrub, maybe even your hand, and play with it. You will find that while you are concentrating on that, your anger will fizz away like bubbles in a glass of pop.

, If you ended up screaming, cursing or stomping your foot, the embarrassment is probably riling you. Let it go. Many people have bad moments, including letting the annoyance show. Remind yourself that it's over now, and that you won't repeat the performance again. Store the memory away to remind you of how it feels to you and looks to others when you do lose it, so that you can recall it when needed again.

, This is only an immediate reaction to try to quell an annoying situation where you feel ready to explode. To stay sane and not continue to find situations so annoying that you're apoplectic, you'll need to take a longer term view about why you're finding any situation annoying, so that you can deal with it in future. The rest of this article tackles the longer term solving of coming across an annoying situation.

, Before tackling any problem, you need to be able to identify the real source of your frustration. It's easy enough to huff that the situation is annoying, but what is it really about other people's actions or behavior that bothers you so much? Assess what is bothering you.


For example: Are your co-workers being noisy? Is your property being inappropriately used? Is something preventing you from getting somewhere on time? Are you being forced to wait for someone else's input before you can complete what you're doing?
Whatever the reason, pinpoint the frustration you're experiencing.

, Complaining to the person in question (or to anyone who will listen) that they are annoying won't fix anything. Try to be specific as you identify the problem to yourself: “It bothers me when Dad treats me like I'm five when I visit and won't let me watch “The Walking Dead,” even though I'm twenty-five”.

, Write them down and consider them in detail, to try to find what you might be doing to make the situation worse or to see where you might be making something out of nothing.

, When dealing with any sort of interpersonal conflict, it's important to try to sympathetically identify with the other person. This means that you need to try to put yourself in their shoes and attempt to understand their perspective.


Try to figure out why the other person is acting as they do. You may eventually need to have a direct conversation with the person in which you air your grievances, but you'll be better prepared for this if you first make some educated guesses on your own.
Do you think that maybe the behavior has its source in the other person finding certain things too hard, uncomfortable or unpleasant for themselves? Perhaps they are trying to avoid something by making their life a little easier, without realizing the toll their actions takes on other people around them.
Could it be that the annoying situation has arisen because the other person cares about or misses you and is trying to be helpful or get to see you more often?

, You have your own unique take on the situation. However, you may not have a wider contextual understanding of it. It is important to try to gather as much information as possible about the situation and those involved in it, to gain a better understanding of what is motivating any problem behaviors, comments, attitudes or actions. It is only when you really understand the wider picture and motivations that you can tackle the annoying aspects fruitfully. Once you do this, you may be able to identify ways to begin to improve the situation and any future recurrences of it.


Ask questions of others. Why do you see it this way? Why do you do it this way? What outcome were you hoping for? How would you rather we did this? Do you see my input as helping?
Ask questions of yourself. Should I have been more patient? Could I have come at a different time? Do I treat people reasonably? Were my expectations reasonable? Am I trying to control the uncontrollable?
Ask questions of the system. Is the system set up to handle this well? Is the system capable of fixing this? Is the system a part of the problem? How can the system be tweaked to improve things? What is different about the system this time from previous times?

, It's rare for problems to be one-sided, so you do need to work out how you're contributing to the situation.


Perhaps you're impatient with yourself and with others. This is a fault, and an attempt to gain a form of control over the often uncontrollable. Being patient is a way of self-calming and showing self-possession despite what is going on. It's a sign of maturity.
Perhaps you dislike the person or people involved in the situation. This isn't an excuse to be annoyed; it's a reason to rise above the dislike and to prove that you can handle what is happening in a responsible and neutral manner. You don't have to like people in order to get along with them and make things work; rely on being respectful and courteous instead of being emotional about it.
Perhaps you're sending mixed messages to other people. On the one hand you want your hot coffee with triple flavoring right now, on the other hand, you expect the blend to be perfect and not messed up. Good things in life come to those prepared to accept that good quality takes more than a snap of the fingers and you certainly can't demand that you have your cake and eat it too.
Perhaps you're transferring your own traits that you don't like into the situation and feel irritated because you're seeing your own negativity reflected. In this case, you'll need to extricate your own issues from those of the situation. Perhaps it's nowhere near as bad as you think, it's just your dour overlay from prior experience that is dampening things. Is your own track record at dealing with such situations spotty?
Check your language. The use of hostile, arrogant, snide, sarcastic, irritable or snappy language will make situations worse. The more annoyed you are, the more your body language displays this annoyance, disarming others and potentially making things worse. Be calm and thoughtful, accepting that remedying things requires kind words and a good level of patience.
Knowing that you're someone who gets frustrated easily can cause others to produce the annoying situation out of fear or anxiety to try to do the right thing. Ball right in your selfish court on this one.

, Practice counting to 10 and considering the words you use with care. Remember that it is often best to say nothing than to let out a string of invective that stirs up the situation and makes it worse. Try to see the positive side of the situation––what have you learned about yourself and the situation? Will you know what to avoid or change next time? Are other people always going to behave this way, and if so, how can you react in a more constructive way that manages the behavior instead of responds to it with irritation? You get the drift.

Give yourself some space.,
Analyze the problem.,
Write out all possible solutions on paper and rank them.,
Let go of what you can’t change.,
Asking for help.",How to Deal with Being a Moody and Eccentric Teen1," You are the most important person in your life. Above all, you need to be happy. Take some time to yourself to decide where your moodiness stems from and make a list of things that you want changed.


Are you unhappy with your friends?
Are you annoyed by your family?
Do you dislike yourself?
Are the hormones just hitting you hard?;
, Now that you have identified the source of your unhappiness, you can start making the necessary changes to improve the situation. Start brainstorming ideas on how you can fix your problems so that they become smaller, if not completely gone. While you are brainstorming, just keep in mind that:


Not all of the problems you will face in life are an easy fix.
You can't always fix all of your problems--some of things are just out of your control.
Sometimes, the improvement of your problems may depend on the participation of others--don't let this discourage you.
Don't be afraid to ask other's for help if you are struggling to fix an issue.

, Take a step back and observe the situation in front of you--as if you are looking through an open window. If you want your situation to change, you have to take the first steps.


When looking for a solution, search inward at your role and what you personally can do to change the situation--but remember, you can only change your role in the situation.
Keep a calm mind. Try to refrain from thinking emotionally. When coming up with solutions, it is best to have logic on your side.
Learn as much about your situation as you can.The more you know about the situation you're in, the better able you will be to come up with possible solutions. Also, knowing what your facing relieves some of the anxiety from the uncertainty.
Take note of any and all resources you have available to you--these could be money, time, family, friends, or personal traits.

, Remember, not everything is in your control. When you start to feel overwhelmed by more issues than seems humanly possible, it's time to start letting go of things that you can't change. We often find ourselves clinging to situations from the past, willing the clock to rewind. Focusing all your energy on this will take away from the problems that we can fix. Don't dwell in the past--instead focus on the here and now.


Let go of the past. Let go of your mistakes. Focus on resolving your current problems and work on making the rest of your life and actions as good as they can be.
The problems from the past will often seem smaller if you focus on bettering yourself for a brighter future...even if that means coming to terms with the fact that your mistakes don't define you.
Stop focusing on your faults. Everybody has them--- and chances are, you've been unable to see that because you've been so focused on finding your own.

, Not all the problems you face in life can be solved alone. You should never feel like you're facing you're problems all on your own.


Remember that you have a support system--you are surrounded by people that care about you and will want to help you.
Asking for help doesn't mean that you are weak. Dealing with several problems all at once or even one large problem, will leave you feeling drained.

Choose appropriate feeders.,
Provide a variety of bird food.,
Install feeders in a safe location.,
Maintain your feeders.,
Add a water feature to your garden.",How to Attract Birds to Your Garden1," In order to decide on suitable feeders, you should research the types of birds in your area. This way, you can purchase a feeder that is appropriate for local birds. Regardless of the type of feeder you choose, make sure that you clean it regularly and replace the seeds every 2 to 3 days to prevent the development of harmful fungi and bacteria. Here are the most common types of feeders and some of the types of birds they will attract to your garden:Tray feeders: Attract pigeons, starlings, and sparrows. Use a tray feeder that has a screened, rather than solid, bottom in order to allow for drainage. Water build up after rain can cause seeds to rot and facilitate the development of bacteria. Also bird droppings can contaminate the food.
House feeders: Attract finches, blue jays, cardinals, buntings, grosbeaks, sparrows, chickadees, and titmice. The feeders are covered and, therefore, the seeds are protected from water and droppings. You can mount hopper feeders on a pole or suspend them from a tree.
Tube feeders: Are cylindrical feeders with tiny feeding holes to allow for smaller seeds, such as Nyjer. These feeders often have small perches and attract smaller birds such as finches, sparrows, titmice, chickadees, and grosbeaks.
Suet feeders: Are constructed of wire or plastic mesh and can be nailed or tied to a tree trunk, suspended, or attached to a hopper feeder. These feeders attract woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees, blue jays, and starlings.;
, Different types of birds eat different types of food. If you want to attract a variety of birds to your yard, you will need to put out multiple feeders with different types of seeds. For instance, try sunflower seeds, nyger seeds, seed mixes, suet, and nectar. Use these helpful tips in order to choose the food that is best for the birds within your local area:Sunflower seeds: Are the most popular seeds and will attract a large variety of birds to your garden including blue jays, cardinals, finches, chickadees, nuthatches, and sparrows. You can also purchase sunflower seeds that have already been removed from their shells in order to avoid a large mess beneath your feeder.Nyjer seeds: Are very small, high quality seeds that attract a variety of finches, indigo buntings, pine siskins, and common redpolls. Because these seeds are so small, they require a special feeder with smaller holes, such as a tube feeder.Seed mixes: Are popular among new birders because they offer a variety of seeds and attract a range of bird species. They can be quite messy, though, because birds will pick through the seeds to find what they like. This behaviour will attract ground feeders such as doves, juncos, sparrows, and even squirrels.Suet: Is a great source of protein for birds, especially during the winter months. It consists of a cake of animal fat that is sometimes covered in seeds. In order to provide birds with suet, you will need to use a special suet feeder. Suet will attract woodpeckers, nuthatches, wrens, and jays, and starlings.
Nectar: Is a combination of sugar and water and requires a special feeder. Typically, nectar is used to feed hummingbirds. To make hummingbird nectar you will need to dissolve one part sugar into four parts hot water. Let the mixture cool to room temperature before putting it into the feeder., You should install your feeder in a safe space in order to avoid window collisions and predators. Feeders should be installed either within 1 meter (3 feet) of a window or more than 9 meters (30 feet) away from a window in order to prevent death from collision.You should also situate feeders relatively close to natural shelter such as trees or shrubs in order to provide both a resting place and quick shelter if a hawk or predator bird is in the area.
That being said, don’t place the feeder too close to the bushes because they can also provide a hiding place for other predators such as cats. A distance of about 3 meters (10 feet) is ideal.

, It is important to change bird seed regularly (typically every 2 to 3 days) and wash the feeder with soap and water every few weeks. This will help remove any harmful bacteria and fungi that can develop as a result of stagnant water and bird droppings. It is especially important to clean feeders regularly during periods of rainy or wet weather.

, Birds need a fresh, clean source of water for drinking and bathing. Setting up a water source will help to attract birds to your garden. Use a bird bath that is 2.5-10cm (1-4 inches) deep in order to attract a variety of different species. Alternatively, a pond or large fountain will also attract birds to your garden.Add rocks or twigs to the bird bath in order to provide a spot for birds to perch.Birds are attracted to the sound of running water, so a fountain may help get more birds into your garden.Change water in a bird bath every 2-3 days and place the baths 3 meters (10 feet) from dense cover that predators may use for hiding."

Pick a hobby.,
Use it to your advantage.,
Give yourself some time.",How to Deal with Being a Moody and Eccentric Teen2," Everyone has something in their life that interests them, whether it be sports, reading, music, video games, writing, or some form of art. Finding that interest is a key tool in dealing with your emotions. If you are uncertain of what interests you, start exploring!


Start searching online for different hobbies or topics of interest--you can start by selecting a base or broad topic like the outdoors. Once you have selected that, you can examine all the hobbies related to that topic.
Place yourself in new situations. You'll meet plenty of new people and possibly discover a potential interest.
Join some clubs--schools and community centers offer countless organizations with a broad variety of interests.
Ask your friends. Most people become friends based on a common interest--ask your friends what they like to do for fun. You can even ask if you can tag along the next time they perform their hobby.

, Whenever you start to feel upset with life or a problem your facing, use your hobby or interest to your advantage.


Your hobby is a creative outlet for your emotions. Use it to make peace with your feelings. Whatever you are feeling, it's legitimate -- otherwise you wouldn't be feeling them.
Keeping yourself busy will leave little time to dwell on your problems.

, Much like emotions, problems don't go away overnight. Slowly but surely, though, they'll fade.


Keep a journal. Writing your feelings will help you come to terms with them and hopefully bring some closure. Keeping your emotions bottled up is not healthy and will lead to frustration and stress.
Try thought switching. When you start to think about what is upsetting you, stop! Divert your thoughts to anything else -- what was that funny thing Sasha said in class? Who's that cute new student in third period? Will they start serving cookies with lunch? Is global warming real and if so will it destroy the world as I know it?
Count your blessings. I know that you are probably fed up with this by now but I swear it works. There are people in the world who have it much worse than you do, chances are you may even know some of them. Focus on the positives in your life--you have food to eat whenever you are hungry. You have a roof over your head. Clothes and shoes are not something you have to worry about. You have indoor plumbing which a good portion of the worlds doesn't have. Often, there are much bigger issues at hand.
Above all, Remember that You are your own worst enemy. Only you have the power to let problems impact your emotions.

Hang a nest box.,
Install the nest box in a safe and quiet location.,
Provide birds with nesting materials.",How to Attract Birds to Your Garden2," You can help attract birds to your garden and encourage them to stay and nest by hanging up nest boxes. Nest boxes can be purchased at local pet supply stores. These boxes come in multiple different varieties and some boxes are more suitable to nesting than others. Take these tips into consideration when shopping for a nest box for your garden:Choose a box made with insulating material. Look for a nest box made from thick wood (15-19mm thick) such as cedar, oak, or beech. Thinner woods, such as pine will not last as long. A nest box made out of ceramic will likely be too hot or too cold for chicks to survive.
Choose a box that is the right size for the bird you want to attract. Different birds will need different sized nest boxes.Do not get a box with a perch. Perches are not necessary for nest boxes and can actually provide a way for predators such as squirrels, cats, and weasels to access eggs and chicks living in the nest box.You can also make your own nesting box.

, Nest boxes should be hung up early in the spring before birds begin to nest. It is very important that you choose a safe location so that birds will feel safe and remain nesting in your garden each year. Situate your nest box at least 3 meters off the ground and in an area that is sheltered from the weather.Make sure that nest boxes are not positioned too close to bird feeders or other nest boxes because this may lead to competition, and too much activity in the area could disrupt a nesting pair.
Clean out the nest box once a year to encourage occupancy., Help birds with nest-making by putting out materials they can use to build their nests. You can purchase nesting materials such as wool and string or you can gather your own nesting material and place it in the garden for the birds. For example, you can provide birds with pet hair, lint, or grass clippings. Just place the materials into the hollow of a tree or attach them to a pile of twigs."

Plant native trees and shrubs.,
Keep dead trees in your garden.,
Create a brush pile.,
Remove invasive plant species from your garden.,
Reduce the lawn area in your yard.",How to Attract Birds to Your Garden3," Local birds love native plants because they provide a great food source. Habitat loss is one of the leading causes of population declines among birds, and as a result, it is very important to grow native plant species. Select a variety of native plants that will offer birds year round food in the form of berries, nuts, and nectar. The best way to create a plentiful garden year round, is to mimic the plant ecosystem native to the area. Plants will also give birds shelter from potential predators, and natural nesting sites. Here are a few plant suggestions:Black-eyed Susans and Sunflowers: Are an excellent source of food for some birds because their seeds and flowers are edible.
Ferns, thistles, and sumacs: Are great for producing materials that birds use while constructing nests.
Crabapples, Dogwoods, and Serviceberries: Are a great source of food and provide birds with small edible fruits and berries.
Coniferous trees: Pines and Spruce trees, for example, provide birds with cover and protection from predator species as well as sap and seeds for eating. They also make great nesting sites for many birds.
Deciduous trees: Oak, Cherry, and Hickory trees, to name a few, provide birds with nesting sites as well as multiple food sources. For instance, these trees often produce edible nuts and are home to a variety of insects.

, Dead trees can provide birds with a source of shelter and food. For example, dead trees will often contain hollow areas and alcoves that birds can use for nesting or to seek shelter from the weather. Insects are also often found on dead trees and can provide birds with a great source of food., Brush piles can provide birds with an area to hunt, roost, and even nest. Begin by putting down a few large logs, then add some smaller branches and leaves. This is relatively easy and can be a great way to make use of garden clippings after you have pruned the trees, hedges, and shrubs in your garden.Brush piles also contain many insects and will provide ground feeders with an excellent food source. For instance, some bird species will never land on, or use, a bird feeder because they like to eat insects off the ground. Robins, Towhees, and Thrashers, for example, will use these piles as a food source., Invasive plants will compete with native plants for space, water, and sunlight. They can often out-compete the plants that are preferred by local bird and insect populations. As a result, you should minimize and remove the number of invasive species that are planted within your garden., Large areas of manicured lawn provides very little of substance for bird populations. If you want to attract birds to your garden, you should reduce the lawn area and ensure that the garden is filled with local plants, water sources, and feeders. Manicured grass is essentially wasted space and requires more maintenance in the form of mowing, watering, and fertilizing."

Ensure you’re on the right type of land.,
Use native plants.,
Imitate a downy woodpecker call.Downies attract one another by calling for mates.",How to Attract Downy Woodpeckers1," Downies avoid open spaces and love trees. To attract downy woodpeckers, you must first locate yourself in a wooded area of at least two to three acres. The area should sport deciduous trees, or an equal mix of deciduous and coniferous trees.


Land that has been cleared for agriculture or logging, or land in most urban areas, will not support downy woodpeckers.You will therefore be unable to attract them to these areas.
Rural areas are best for attracting downies, though they might be found in certain suburban areas if there is an adequate population of trees.Deciduous trees that are known to attract woodpeckers include beech, maple, oak, and hickory.;
, Downies primarily eat beetles, ants, spiders, aphids, caterpillars and other bugs.These species thrive in native plants and trees.If you want downies on your property, you should install native plants and trees, rather than non-native shrubs, grasses, and plants.


Botanists at your local arboretum should be able to help you identify species native to your area.
You could also check the University of Texas’ Native Plant Database at https://www.wildflower.org/plants/ for help identifying native species in your area.
The bugs downy woodpeckers like might also be present in non-native trees and foliage, but their populations will probably be smaller.

, If you have a recording of a downy woodpecker call, you could play it if you suspect woodpeckers are nearby. There are many recordings of downy woodpeckers available online. Play these imitation calls through your smartphone or tablet in order to attract downies.


Check online for clips of woodpecker calls."

Doing something you enjoy will take your mind off of your age and will make you feel much better. It's also something anybody of any age can get involved in. If possible, join a club or group up with a bunch of friends who enjoy the same things as you.;
, Yes, study. When you get into secondary school, you want to keep your grades high. The only way to do this is to start studying now. Studying will also improve your memory and make you better at whatever hobby you enjoy. Understanding how tension affects the guitar and how sound is made will improve your understanding of the instrument, making you a better player.

, Keeping fit will help you live a longer and happier life. Buy a bike and ride it around, play a sport or visit a running track. Don't get so caught up in losing weight that you forget to study and have fun. If possible, do some research about fitness. Understand how smoking and drugs affect the body and how keeping fit improves the performance and strength of your heart.

,


Brush your teeth. Your teeth will look much better if you brush your teeth. Your breath will also smell nice. Don't forget to floss.
Take a shower every day. Wash your hair and body. This will stop you from smelling and will make you feel fresher. If you smell nice, people are more likely to be around you. Don't think that just because you are young that you don't need to keep clean.







, No, drugs and alcohol do not make you cool. Smoking makes you stink and is illegal for anyone under 18. The law is in place for a reason, don't break it to try to act cool or like somebody older than you. People who need alcohol to look cool have some serious issues and need help. Don't be one of those people, they're responsible for all the bad stereotypes about teenagers.

Find a good time to talk.,
Ask for a cell phone.,
Talk about the benefits.,
Be ready to compromise.,
Accept their answer.",How to Cope With Not Having a Cell Phone2," Choose a time when your parents are not busy and are in a good mood. This will increase your chances of getting what you want. A long car ride, sitting at the dinner table, or going for a walk are all good times to approach your parents.You can say, “Hey do you have a minute? I wanted to talk to you about something?” or “Let me know when you have some time. I wanted to talk to you about something.”

, Plainly tell your parents that you would like to have a cell phone and the reasons that you want a cell phone. If you are nervous about talking to them, write a letter that explains your reasons.


You could say, “I really would like a cell phone, and I wanted to tell you why this is a good idea.”
You could also say, “I would love to have a cell phone. What do you think about this?”

, Try to make the cell phone appealing to your parents. Talk about all of the positive things about having a phone. Some benefits you can highlight are:A phone is good in case there is an emergency when your parents are not around.
It will help you keep in touch with your family that lives out of town, or they will always be able to reach you when you are not at home.
Having a cell phone can teach you to be responsible.
Never tell your parents that you want a cell phone because all of your friends have one.

, Remember that your goal is to have a cell phone. It may not be the exact phone that you want, or you may not be able to talk and text as much as you would like. At the end of the day, having any cell phone is better than not having a phone at all. Some compromises you can suggest are:To help pay for the phone.
Get a flip phone instead of a smart phone.
Get a pre-paid phone instead of a phone with a contract.
Agree to any rules or limitations your parents have.

, Be respectful of any answer that your parents give you. Do not whine, beg, or have a bad attitude if they say no. Show your parents how mature you are by the way you handle their response. If you get upset because your parents said no, they will not want to get you a phone.


Ask your parents about getting a phone again in a couple of months. In the meantime, do all of your chores, do well in school, and show how responsible you are

Do activities you enjoy.,
Become a volunteer.,
Spend time with friends and family.,
Spend time outdoors.",How to Cope With Not Having a Cell Phone3," Find some hobbies that occupy your mind and that you find fun. Reading, drawing, writing, listening to music, cooking, or watching movies. Activities that require you to think or use your hands are best. Your mind will be occupied, and you will not miss having a phone.


You may join an after school club or some sort of extracurricular activity that you find fun. This is a great way to socialize with other people who have your same interests.

, Volunteering is a good way to show your parents that you are responsible and reliable. This is also an opportunity to give back to your community and help other people. Try to find volunteer opportunities that match with your interests.For example, if you enjoy reading, you may volunteer at a local library. If you were interested in health care, you could volunteer at a local hospital or nursing home.

, Cell phones often get in the way of making connections with other people. You can be so wrapped up in your phone that you spend less time developing relationships with the important people in your life. Instead of worrying about getting a phone, spend time with your family and friends.


When you are spending time with people, tell them that it is a no phone zone. This will keep everybody engaged, and you will not feel left out because you are the only one without a phone.

, Get outside and explore nature. You will have a more positive attitude and feel less stressed. Go for a walk, a hike, or exercise outside. Sit at the park and read or hang out with a friend. Take the time to really absorb the sights and sounds of nature while you are out there."

Provide shelter.While downy woodpeckers (like all woodpeckers) prefer nesting in the hollows of trees, they might also be interested in living in an appropriately-sized birdhouse.,
Put out their favorite foods.Downy Woodpeckers adore suet.,
Provide a drumming site.In order to attract mates and claim territory, woodpeckers of both sexes will make a rapid tapping against wood with their beaks.If you want to provide an artificial drumming site, you can nail a board firmly to a tree about ten to twenty feet up, then attach another board to the first, nailing it only at the top edge.You should locate the site well away from your house, since the noise of woodpeckers drumming can be quite loud.,
Provide a birdbath.",How to Attract Downy Woodpeckers2," You can buy a birdhouse at most home and garden stores.


The birdhouse should have a 4’’ x 4’’ base and sides at least 10’’ high. The hole should be located in the center of one of the sides about 7’’ from the base, and be 1.25’’ in diameter.
Attach the birdhouse to a sturdy tree between eight and twenty feet off the ground. If the birdhouse is in the midst of a woody area, the woodpecker will find it more attractive.
Fill the birdhouse with about four inches of wood shavings. The woodpecker can use these for nesting material.You could also simply leave a dead tree standing in your yard if you don’t want to invest in a birdhouse., Placing some suet balls or suet cakes in the backyard will bring the local downy woodpeckers to you. They also like fruit, sunflower seeds, cracked corn, and doughnuts.


Break any doughnuts you might give to woodpeckers up in small bits before putting them out.
Downies favor suet with peanut butter, millet, or nuts.You can buy premade suet cakes or balls at your local home and garden store.

,
Covering the second board with a thin layer of sheet metal might make the drumming site more attractive to the woodpeckers.
Drumming is a unique behavior that gives woodpeckers their name.

, While downies are rarely seen at birdbaths, they will use them from time to time.They might also drink from the birdbath.Downies might be more inclined to visit a birdbath during winter when liquid water is scarce.


Instead of drinking from birdbaths, downies tend to drink from puddles, ponds, or places where water collects on horizontal tree limbs.

"
"
Check the size and shape.,
Look for the right colors.,
Don’t confuse downies with other woodpeckers.",How to Attract Downy Woodpeckers3," Downies are about 15 centimeters (7 inches) long.They are black and white, with a white stripe down their backs. The downy woodpecker’s black bill is straighter and narrower than that of other birds, allowing it to chisel hard wood.


Males have a red cap on their heads. It first appears on the forehead and moves toward the back of the head as they age.
A small tuft of white fur is present at the base of the bill between the eyes.

, Downies have black wings with flecks of white. A white stripe runs down the center of the back, and their chests are also white or grayish. Their eyes are contained within a large black splotch of fine feathers surrounded by white feathers., Downies are easy to confuse with their close relative, the hairy woodpecker.There are several distinct differences that separate the two species:


Hairy woodpeckers are quite a bit larger -- around nine inches long from head to tail -- and have longer bills than downies.
The outer edges of their tail feathers are white, whereas downy woodpeckers have black spots on their outer tail feathers.
Hairy woodpeckers have a slim black mark on their shoulders that arcs downward toward the chest. In downies, this mark is relatively short and far less prominent."

Learn about your team.,
Find power hitters.,
Determine your contact hitters.,
Find your speedsters.,
Figure out who is a sacrifice specialist.",How to Construct a Youth League Baseball Line Up1," The first step to putting together a batting order and defense lineup is to know who your players are, and what they do or don’t do well. This discovery process is a crucial first step to balancing your lineup and improving your baseball team’s offense. There are a few major categories that every offensive player will fall into, and some of the batters in your lineup might fall into more than one category.


If a player on your team does more than one thing well, it is important to determine which of those strengths will benefit the team the most.Conduct a series of scrimmages to determine each player's strengths and weaknesses.;
, Power hitters generally have higher strikeout totals or at least more swings and misses. They have the ability to hit the ball a long ways but it doesn’t always equate to speed which can turn into a liability., Contact hitters typically have very low strikeout counts along with low power hits. Contact hitters are very good at putting the bat to the ball. Their lack of strikeouts is a benefit in some regards, but putting a contact hitter in the wrong spot could have a negative effect on your team’s offense., There is typically a lot of overlap between a speedsters and the contact hitters. There is enough distinction between the two to treat them separately. Speedsters are important to have on the bases. They pose as a threat to steal a base which can distract opposing pitchers. Again, speedsters must be strategically placed in your team’s lineup or they will have little to no effect., There are some players who are in the lineup because they have a defensive skill that you need. These players, when they come up to bat, can be a risk. They can be used properly and a useful asset to scoring more runs."

Maybe you’re a hands-on kid, spending your free time building forts and horsing around with your friends. You might be the strongest and fastest person in your school! Believe it or not, these fun, physical things that you love could all become a career.


Professional athletes make money playing their favorite sports, and people like coaches, referees, and sports medicine doctors all build their careers around sports too. Construction workers and mechanics get to work all day with their hands, building and fixing things from the ground up. The possibilities are endless.
”Having a job” doesn’t always mean sitting at a desk all day! There are plenty of fun and active jobs for people who like to be on their feet.;
, This might sound boring, but these classes in school can help you find your future job. Some kids love math class, and they can do the hardest problems in their head. Other students can’t wait to experiment and learn about the world around them in science class. Do you especially enjoy learning about and using logic and fact? Take note! Math and science skills are amazing skills to carry into a career.


Inventors, scientists, economists, engineers, and computer programmers were all once students just like you, who now work with numbers, facts, and logic in their careers. Even if your adult job isn’t based in math or science, these skills can help in all sorts of professions!

, Draw, write, paint, entertain, and create. If you’d rather daydream, do crafts, tell stories, or make music than learn facts and figures, that’s OK! Embrace your dreams and work hard on the things you do enjoy. There are so many careers for people just like you.


Artists, authors, actors, musicians, and designers are all professions that require creativity, among hundreds of others. Being a daydreamer and an artist are qualities that can get you an amazing job one day!

, If you want to spend all of your free time cooking with your parents in the kitchen, playing with the family dog outside, or watching over your younger siblings, continue doing those things. Your hobbies and your passions are things that can turn into your career one day if you work hard and allow your interests to flourish. Your favorite past-times can be great indicators of what you excel in and love.


Think about why you enjoy the hobbies that you do. If you love playing with your pets, maybe you’re a nurturer who would make a great veterinarian or animal trainer one day. If you enjoy taking care of your younger siblings, you might be a caretaker, a teacher, or a mentor in your career when you grow up.

, The more you see and experience, the more possible paths you’ll find. When you’re young, you have much more freedom with how you spend your time. Use it trying everything you can and learning all about the things that interest you. You never know when you’ll stumble upon something you absolutely love.Don’t be afraid to leave your comfort zone. Sign up for the public speaking class that intimidates you, or apply for the internship you think you’ll never get. An unexpected opportunity could lead you straight to your dream job. The worst thing you can do is to let fear or intimidation stop you from taking the first step. Lea Michelle, the world-famous star of Glee, got her start on Broadway by accident. She accompanied her friend to an audition and then auditioned herself as a joke. She found her life’s work by chance, and you can too if you put yourself out there enough., It’s easy to get wrapped up in the opinions of other people, or follow the plan that others have mapped out for you. There will always be people judging your choices, and there will always be family members, teachers, friends, and even strangers telling you what you should do. However, only you know which career path is right for you.This doesn’t mean you should disregard the advice you receive from the people who care about you. They usually want the best for you and they may have more life experience than you, so it certainly can be helpful. However, at the end of the day only you can determine who and what you become when you grow up. Don’t give up on a dream or shy away from a goal just because others may not believe in it.

, If you find something that you absolutely love but aren’t great at, practice. If you find something that you naturally excel in, practice. Whether you are a complete novice or a prodigy, you have to hone your craft. No one can become an expert in their field unless they devote time and energy to it.No matter what the skill may be, it’s essential that you become the best you can.


When it comes to determining what your skills are, don’t be afraid to think outside the box. It may not be a sport, a subject in school, or something else clear-cut. Are you the person all your friends come to when they need advice? Do you have a soft spot for all animals? Do you love being a project leader in school? All of those things are strengths that can help you in the professional world!

, Dream big and stay optimistic about your future, but remember that only hard work and patience will get you where you want to be. Many people who love their career now may not have loved it when they started out. While it would be great to obtain your dream job on your first try, you often have to figure out which industry you want to be in, and then work your way up the ladder., If you have no idea where to start the process of choosing a career, these tests are perfect for you. There are all different kinds of tests that can measure your skills and interests and point you toward a fitting career.Your results aren’t your only options, but they can be helpful suggestions to get you on the right track.


Some tests examine your natural abilities by asking you questions with right or wrong answers. Other tests have more open-ended questions, and those analyze your personality.Try a few!
You can find a lot of great career assessment tests online with just a quick Google search. If you want more options, ask your school counselor or a teacher for help. There is no shortage of assessments you can take!

, Underneath each one, jot down different jobs or careers that utilize that particular skill. By writing all of this down, you’ll be able to organize your thoughts and better visualize your opportunities. Cross off careers that seem totally unappealing to you, and circle ones that you want to learn more about. Pay attention to jobs that are listed more than once- in other words, jobs that utilize multiple skills or interests that you have.


These things can be general or specific. For example, you may write down “compassionate.” Underneath that trait, you can list things like doctor, teacher, social worker, etc. Next to it, you may write down “Great at science.” Listed underneath that skill may be things like chemist, doctor, computer programmer, etc. Don’t overthink this too much- it’s great to see all the possibilities!
Think about how your strengths can translate into all different jobs. For example, you may be a gifted vocalist, but that doesn't mean your goal has to be to become a famous singer. Think about other related jobs, like producer, music teacher, talent recruiter, and more.

, Do you want a job that requires you to travel seven days a week, or do you want the freedom to work from home? Think about your priorities in a job or career, and don’t feel ashamed of your honest answers.You may be willing to choose a job you aren’t personally interested in if it comes with a great salary. On the other hand, you may prioritize your enjoyment of a job over the money you’ll be making. Everyone is different, and you have to decide what is most important to you.


Your priorities may change over time. Don’t be afraid to explore different paths.

, Learning anything and everything you can about a particular industry can help you decide if that one is right for you. You can determine which specific skills are most important in that field so that you can develop and perfect them. You should also determine the education level or specialized certifications you will need. By investigating deeper, you can even figure out how employable you may be in a particular field or if you may need a back-up plan.

, Once you’ve narrowed down the jobs and careers that interest you most, try to find someone in that field. It is massively helpful to talk to someone who has the job you want, and to ask them all the questions you need to know. Learn how they got to where they are, and what they wish they knew when they were younger. Ask them what their typical day is like, and if possible, shadow them for a day! By walking in the footsteps of someone who has your “dream job,” you can learn more about it and decide if it really seems right for you.Finding a mentor in your chosen field can also offer you a valuable networking opportunity. A common idea about job searching states, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.” While this isn’t always the case, having connections can often put your resume at the top of the stack once it comes time to apply for the job."

Forgo your workout if you have a fever.,
Avoid exercise if you have a deep cough or chest congestion.,
Take a rest day if you're having digestive problems.,
Take it easy.,
Hydrate.,
Read the side effects of your medications.,
Avoid others if you're contagious.,
Allow yourself to recover.",How to Determine if You Are Too Sick to Work Out," Physical signs of fever include sweating and chills, body aches, headache, fatigue or weakness, low appetite, and your skin feeling warm to the touch. Take your temperature at home. Avoid exercise if you have a temperature over 100F (37.8C) or if you have any signs of fever.A fever is your body’s way of fighting infection, and is telling you that you need rest. Fever is technically anything over your normal body temperature of 98.6F (37C), though there is some variation in individual baseline body temperature, so it is helpful to monitor yourself for symptoms.
A high fever is considered anything over 103F (39.4C), and may be cause for concern. Seek medical attention.;
, There is a general rule of thumb called the Neck Rule – if you’re sick above the neck, a little exercise is okay, but if you’re sick below the neck, skip the workout.An Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, or URI, is often what we think of as the Common Cold, though there are many causes. Symptoms include sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, and mild sore throat.Unless you also have a fever, light to moderate exercise can be tolerated.When you’re sick “below the neck,” what some think of as a ""chest cold"" although it differs from the common cold, you may have a deep or hacking cough with chest congestion or tightness. This is often accompanied by a fever.These are more serious illnesses that require rest, and sometimes medical treatment, to get better.

, If you have stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, skip the workout. Drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration.

, Consider exercise alternatives such as yoga, qi gong, t’ai chi, walking or dance. Avoid high-intensity activities like heavy weight or endurance training, sprints, team sports, or exercise in extreme temperatures.Just 20 minutes of walking or light jogging gives you those exercise benefits, and may help clear up your sinuses and alleviate sinus pressure.The stress hormone cortisol depresses your immune system, and relaxing activities like yoga, gentle martial arts, and dance have the bonus of being stress tamers to boost immunity.Your endurance and strength will be lower when you’re sick and fatigued, so you will tire more easily if using weights or doing high-impact exercise. This increases your risk of injury, and uses up energy your body needs to recover., Even if you have a simple cold, be sure to drink lots of fluids before and during exercise. Working out when dehydrated can cause dizziness, light-headedness, elevated heart rate, and even passing out. You might be dehydrated if your lips, tongue or skin feel dry, your urine is darker than usual, or your heart is beating very fast., Many cold and cough medicines make you drowsy or dizzy, which may make it unsafe to use exercise equipment, weights, or go running., Stay home and out of the gym if you are coughing, sneezing, or have any sort of contagious illness such as chicken pox. Germs are spread easily on hard surfaces of exercise machines and in locker rooms.You are generally contagious the first 5-7 days of feeling ill., Once you feel back to your old self, continue to take it easy for 24-48 hours. It’s okay to work out, but ease back into it.


Start at 50-75% of your normal routine, such as running for 15 minutes if you usually run for 30 minutes, and gradually increase back to baseline over about a week.Avoid alcohol, which suppresses the immune system.

Fill the first two slots.,
Cast your third batter.,
Fill the rest of the hitters.",How to Construct a Youth League Baseball Line Up2," You want to bat your most consistent base-hit hitter in the lead-off spot. Don't waste this spot on your biggest power hitter. You ideally want people on base when your power hitter comes up. Second slot should go to your second most-consistent base-hit hitter., This is where your power hitter goes. This is the player who consistently hits doubles, triples or home runs. Some may argue you want this batter to bat fourth, to increase the chance of a grand slam with the bases loaded. This mentality can cost you because:


After the first inning, this set-up no longer applies.
You want to make sure your best hitter bats in the first inning. Saving your strongest hitter for the fourth spot could mean that the first three batters get out, and this batter won't get up to bat until the second inning.You need to start collecting runs as soon as possible, and this is the best way.

, For the fourth batter you should place your second-best power hitter. Then you can descend down the slots and fill the next best batter. The eight slot should go to your worst hitter. Then for your ninth slot you should have a speedster who may not be the best at batting."
"
Fill the catcher.,
Find your bases.,
Fill the left and right fielders.,
Assign a center field.,
Teach pitching.",How to Construct a Youth League Baseball Line Up3," Your catcher needs to be aggressive, assertive, a good listener, show leadership, and be energetic. This teammate should also be a good team player and be able to get along with your pitcher.


The catcher needs to be one of the best catchers in your roster., Having a solid roster of players on the bases is essential for good defense. Your first baseman should be good enough to catch the ball from any player on the field and is good for any lefties. Second base is usually your infielder with the weakest arm or the kid who bobbles the ball a lot. The third base is your kid with the fastest reactions who can handle being the infielder closest to the batter.


Find a shortstop. The shortstop is typically the best athlete on your defense. This player also needs to be exceptionally quick with a good arm., You want your players with strong arms and good at catching in left field. Left fielders see the most outfield hits. Your right outfielder can be one of your weaker players. They should be pretty good at catching the ball, but they won’t do too much damage out there., Center field is a crucial position in the field. They need to be on the same level as your third baseman and left outfielder. This is typically the kid who is anxious to get a catch and can do it well. Don’t assign this position to your timid or shy kids., Depending on what type of youth team you are handling, pitchers typically rotate. Consider getting an assistant coach who specializes in pitching. Eventually you will find your strongest pitcher, but will more than likely unlikely to play her for every inning.

If your skin changes color, make an appointment with your primary care physician or dermatologist. You may also notice more hair growing or itchy skin. If you have moles, you should watch for any changes in their appearance.Another symptom of cancer is an unusual lump or body area that thickens.


Observe any sore that doesn't heal, or white patches in your mouth or or on your tongue.;
, If you have constipation that doesn't seem to go away, diarrhea, or any change in the size of your stool, they may indicate colon cancer. Signs of bladder or prostate cancer can include:Painful urination
Needing to urinate more or less than usual
Unusual bleeding or discharge

, If you've lost weight, but haven't been dieting, you have unexplained weight loss. Losing more than 10 pounds is an early sign of cancer of the pancreas, stomach, esophagus, or lung.You may also have trouble swallowing or might have indigestion after you eat. These are symptoms of esophageal, throat, or stomach cancer.

, Some of the earliest symptoms of cancer might seem like symptoms of the common cold, with some key differences. You may notice cough, fatigue, fever or unexplained pain (like severe headache). Unlike common illnesses, you won't feel better after resting, the cough won't go away, and you may not have any sign of infection despite having a fever.Pain might be one of the earliest symptoms of cancer you experience. Fever is usually a symptom once the cancer has progressed.

, Don't assume that because you've noticed several symptoms, you definitely have cancer. Cancer symptoms can vary a great deal and can be non-specific. This means that many similar symptoms can indicate a number of other health problems ranging in severity.


For example, fatigue can mean many things, only one of which is cancer. Instead, fatigue might just be one symptom of a different condition that you're experiencing. This is why a proper medical diagnosis is important.

, Mammograms are x-rays of the breast that screen for lumps. If you're between the ages of 40 and 44, you can choose if you want to get mammograms every year. Women between the ages of 45 and 54 should get mammograms every year, according to the American Cancer Society. If you're over 55, you can continue yearly screening or get them every two years.All women should do monthly breast self-examinations (BSE). Your doctor or nurse can teach you how to look for any changes in your breast tissue. Women 74 years of age or older do not need mammography screenings unless their life expectancy is greater than 10 years.

, At 50 years old, everyone should be regularly tested. Ask your doctor if you can be screened for cancer and polyps. This screening relies on getting tested every five years (like a flexible sigmoidoscopy, a double-contrast barium enema, or a virtual colonoscopy) or 10 years (if getting a colonoscopy).If your healthcare provider can't test for polyps, get tested for colon and rectal cancer. Every year you should have a blood test (guaiac-based fecal occult blood test) or a fecal immunochemical test (FIT). You could also do a stool DNA test every three years.

, Pap tests are important to diagnose cervical cancer, even if you've been vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). If you're a woman between the ages of 21 and 29, get a Pap test every three years and only get HPV testing if you get an abnormal Pap test result. If you're between 30 and 65, get a Pap test plus an HPV test (called ""co-testing"") every five years. If you don't want to screen for HPV, you can just get a Pap test every three years.If you've had a total hysterectomy that wasn't because of cervical cancer, you don't need regular Pap tests.
If you're over 65 and have had regular testing with normal results for the past 10 years, you don't need testing anymore.
If you have a history of serious cervical pre-cancer, you should be tested for at least 20 years after the diagnosis (even if this means testing past age 65).

, Not everyone needs to be screened for lung cancer. If you're between the ages of 55 and 74, are in good health, and smoke heavily or have a history of smoking heavily, you should have CT scans to look for lung cancer. To decide if you are or were a heavy smoker, determine if you're still smoking and have a 30 ""pack-year"" history.You might also be considered a heavy smoker if you have a 30 pack-year history even if you've quit within the last 15 years.
To determine your pack-per-year amount, multiply the number of packs you smoke a day by the number of years you've smoked. So if you smoked two packs a day for 20 years, your pack-year is 40. You can also use an online calculator to determine pack-years for cigars, pipes, and cigarillos: http://smokingpackyears.com/calculate


, Since several types of cancers have no definite guidelines, you should discuss your risk factors with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend whether or not you need to be screened. For oral cancers, you should ask your dentist for screening recommendations. In general, ask your doctor if you should be screened for:Prostate cancer
Endometrial (uterine) cancer
Thyroid cancer
Lymphoma
Testicular cancer

, Not everyone needs genetic testing to determine their cancer risk. If you feel like you'd benefit from knowing your genetic risk of developing cancer, talk with your doctor and make sure the doctor knows all of your family and personal medical history. Your doctor (and genetic counselor) can help you decide if there's a personal medical risk for cancer and if it's reasonable to get yourself tested for the genes responsible.Many cancers that can be genetically tested for are relatively rare, so it's important to discuss whether or not it makes sense for you to go through the testing.

, Since genetic testing can determine if you're at risk for cancer, it can be helpful in deciding how often to get physical exams and screenings. But, be aware that genetic testing can give few answers, be read incorrectly, and create stress and anxiety.It can also cost thousands of dollars. Many insurance companies aren't required to cover it, so check with your insurance provider to see how much of the bill you'd be responsible for.Experts recommend that you get genetic testing done if:You or your family have an increased risk for a certain cancer
The test can clearly show if a genetic change is present or absent
The results will help you plan future medical care

, Testing is available to identify the genes responsible for over 50 types of inheritable cancer syndromes. Understand that if you do test positive for a gene responsible for a certain type of cancer, it does not mean that you will get that cancer. The following cancer syndromes can be related to screenable genes:Hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer syndrome
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer)
Familial adenomatous polyposis
Retinoblastoma
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Wermer syndrome) and type 2
Cowden syndrome
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome

, Your doctor can request genetic testing if you both believe you'd benefit from it. You'll need to give a small sample of body tissue or fluid (like blood, saliva, cells from inside your mouth, skin cells, or amniotic fluid). This sample is sent to a lab which will analyze your sample and send the results back to your doctor.While it is possible to use an online genetic testing service, it's better to work with your doctor or genetic counselor so you can get detailed and personalized information.

, Your doctor or genetic counselor will consult with you about further screening or preventative options if your genetic screening comes back positive for a specific type of cancer. Genetic counselors have also been trained to offer emotional support and put you in touch with support groups and other resources.If you get a positive screening test back, remember that this does not mean you will get that cancer. It means that your risk of developing that particular cancer is increased. But, whether you actually develop the cancer depends on you, the specific gene, your family history, your lifestyle choices, and your environment.

Determine your basal metabolic rate (metabolism at rest).,
Calculate your total daily calorie needs using a formula known as the Harris-Benedict equation.",How to Decrease Your Metabolism1," You can find an online calculator, or you can use the following formulas, depending on your gender:


Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in year);
, Once you have calculated your BMR, you can estimate your total calorie needs for different levels of activity. Decreasing your metabolism means you are ""turning down"" your body's internal furnaces, which lowers your calorie requirements. Use your BMR to make the following calculations. If you:


Are inactive or exercise rarely: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.2Exercise lightly 1 to 3 days per week: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.375Exercise moderately for 3 to 5 days per week: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.55Exercise actively for 6 to 7 days per week: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.725Exercise intensely every day: Calories to stay the same weight = BMR x 1.9"

Speak with your physician about your PMS symptoms.",How to Deal with PMS when You Have Bipolar Disorder," Being around people who love you can be its own form of medicine. Aim to spend time with people you care about and have fun with. Even if it’s just enjoying dinner or watching a television show together, it can be helpful to have the company and support of friends or family.If you need to talk about how you feel, seek out a trusted friend who’s a good listener. Sometimes just venting can help release the tension and help you move past your difficult feelings.
Stay away from people (even friends) who are dramatic or needy. This can add unnecessary stress.;
, Maybe you have an overly-talkative coworker or someone asks you to do something last minute. If you know you’re dealing with PMS, learn to unplug and say, “No.” Avoid people, events, and situations that you know will cause you stress. Say no to requests that feel stressful and opt to focus on self-care instead.Get in the habit of saying, “I’m sorry, I can’t do that” or, “I’m unavailable at this time.”
If a task can wait until your PMS is gone, put it off.

, Get in the habit of tracking your symptoms of bipolar disorder and PMS through a journal or mood chart. When you know to anticipate your symptoms, you can better deal with them. By journaling your emotions, you can anticipate them and how you might feel or act, then prepare accordingly.For example, if you notice your symptoms spike 3-5 days before your menstrual period, track the ways you respond to your emotions to see what works.

, When your moods and PMS are getting the best of you, practice mindfulness as a way to connect to the here-and-now. Mindfulness has been shown to increase feelings of well-being and help people deal with their symptoms.If you’re having a hard time coping and want to feel more centered, mindfulness is a great way to do that. Start with your breath and focus on each inhale and exhale coming into and leaving your body.


You can also do a sensory exercise by focusing on each sense for one minute at a time. For example, close your eyes and focus only on the sounds around you, however small they might be. Then, focus on what you see and notice the details that you often overlook. Continue with the rest of the senses.

, If you’re feeling irritable and need some time to yourself, take it. Say “No” to that big event with crowds of people and opt to have some quality time alone. If you’re at school or at the office, excuse yourself and take a quick walk or go to the bathroom and splash some water on your face. If you’re at home, take a soothing bath or try a calm activity.Take some alone time if being with others makes you feel irritable, or if you notice that you’re snapping at others.

, Find some healthy outlets for stress, such as relaxation. Practicing every day keeps your stress levels low and can help stabilize your moods. Aim to do a relaxing activity for 30 minutes each day. Keeping a consistent routine can help you manage your bipolar year-round, not just when you have PMS.Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.

, The foods you eat can affect how you feel and can even influence your mood. Be extra careful to nourish your body be eating healthy foods, like whole grains, vegetables, and fruit. Limit your salt and sugar intake, especially at the end of your cycle.Stay away from junk foods like candy, chips, and processed foods. Focus on eating whole meals. Even chocolate can have a negative effect due to the caffeine., Sleep disruptions can affect your mood and your bipolar symptoms. Managing your sleep can be hard yet the consequences tend to be severe, so aim to be consistent. Keep a sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. This helps your body build routine and can help it fall asleep more easily and stay asleep through the night.If you struggle to fall asleep, aim to put your mind and body into a calm state before nodding off. Relax before you go to bed by meditating, drinking a glass of herbal tea, or taking a bath.
Keep bright screens (like the television or your smartphone) off 1-2 hours before bedtime.

, Exercise is great for both your physical and emotional health.While it can be hard to motivate yourself to exercise, especially when you’re dealing with PMS, try to exercise even just a little by taking a quick walk or riding your bike. Try to exercise regularly throughout the month to minimize your experience of symptoms.


If exercise stirs up your manic symptoms, aim to do something less vigorous. Try walking instead of running or yoga instead of an aerobics class.
Lack of exercise can contribute to PMS symptoms., Caffeine and nicotine may provide temporary relief, but they are not effective long-term treatments. If you’re experiencing PMS or bipolar symptoms, think about reaching for something else instead of a latte or cigarette.It’s especially important to avoid caffeine and nicotine if you have trouble sleeping, as both can contribute to sleep problems., Alcohol and drugs can affect the severity of your symptoms and make you feel worse.Especially if you tend to feel depressed, stay away from alcohol. Alcohol or drugs may help you feel better for a few moments, but won’t help you overall.


You don’t have to cut your lifestyle in order to avoid alcohol. For example, if your friends are meeting socially, opt for a seltzer water and lime instead of an alcoholic drink.
If you’re struggling with alcoholism, get treatment.

, If you have bipolar disorder and are not medicated, it is recommended to start medication. A consistent dose of medication can help control your bipolar symptoms and allow you to feel more stable. Feeling in control of your mood can help you with your PMS symptoms and perhaps make them feel less severe.


Depending on your symptoms, they may add an antidepressant to your treatment.Find a psychiatrist by asking your therapist or physician for a recommendation. You can also call your insurance provider.

, A therapist can help you if you feel like you can’t do it on your own or you could use some help. Talk about your bipolar symptoms and how PMS affects them. They can help you explore and understand your feelings as well as give you tools to help you manage your moods, irritability, and other symptoms.Find a therapist by calling a local mental health clinic or your insurance provider. You can obtain a recommendation from your physician or family and friends.

, Tell your physician about your symptoms and ask for their advice on treatment. They may put you on birth control pills as a way to treat your PMS symptoms. Look for pills that have a continuous dose, especially ones that contain drospirenone.Your physician may recommend pain relievers such as aspirin or ibuprofen for symptoms such as headaches, backaches, and cramping, and breast tenderness.
Talk to your physician if you suspect you have Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a more severe form of PMS.

Consult with a doctor and make sure that you reveal all the spinal-related symptoms that are bothering you.,
Avoid neglecting the advice of your physician.,
Avoid arguing with your doctor on this subject and just make a note to yourself that you may try chiropractic treatment before you follow his or her advice and start taking medication or enlist for surgery.,
Search for an experienced physical therapist or chiropractor in your area.,
Stay committed to your spinal therapy until you start noticing the first signs of spinal “healing.” Gradually, your back will become stronger, the vertebrae healthier and the ligaments more flexible and functional.",How to Decide if Spinal Decompression Therapy Is for You," Describe them as detailed as possible. When does the back pain occur? When you lift weights, bend forward or is it present all the time? Listen to your doctor’s recommendations. It is important that serious diseases be excluded as a possible cause of your back pain before any form of chiropractic treatment can be started. Back pain may be a sign of rheumatic disease, a result of a physical trauma or a compressive tumor.;
, After you are certain that you don’t have a severe medical problem, you should ask your doctor how to proceed. If your doctor recommends you to take painkillers or suggests surgery, then ask him or her whether you may benefit from alternative therapies, such as chiropractic treatment. It is important to mention that some doctors are hesitant to suggest alternative therapies because they don’t have enough experience with patients who have been cured by chiropractors.

, Although your doctor may not have experience in non-invasive treatment methods, he or she is very useful in excluding potentially dangerous medical disorders through an X-ray, CT, or MRI scan that may reveal any serious abnormality. If no severe abnormality is found, you can safely proceed with chiropractic treatment.

, Make sure to read reviews on the Internet about a particular medical office or doctor before you start the spinal decompression therapy. This alternative, non-aggressive method involves relieving any signs of compression in the spinal vertebrae through careful manipulations of your spine by a qualified physical therapist. Although this therapy requires a decent amount of time to address any spinal issues, it helps you achieve spinal integrity without “aggressive” maneuvers and side effects.

, Don’t wait for miracles - just be patient and maintain consistency, and you will certainly see wonderful results.

Understand that ""slow metabolisms"" aren't necessarily responsible for weight gain.,
Understand that slowing your metabolism might not be the healthiest way to gain weight.,
Skip meals.,
Eat fewer calories.,
Take naps.,
Replace simple carbohydrates (sugar) with complex carbohydrates (starch and fiber) when possible.,
Include nuts and seeds in the diet.",How to Decrease Your Metabolism2," If you want to gain weight, go here for a discussion of how to do so in a healthy way. Doctors generally agree that other factors are more responsible for weight gain or weight loss than your metabolism.These factors include:


How many calories you consume daily.
How much and how intensely you exercise.
Your genetics and family history.
The medications you may be taking.
Other unhealthy habits such as not getting enough sleep.

, Slowing your metabolism can involve some pretty unpleasant things: skipping meals, eating few calories, etc. Proper, medically-sound weight gain often involves:


Increasing caloric intake. Eating more calories than your body burns in a day.
Addressing any underlying medical issue that might be causing you to lose weight, e.g. thyroid issues, diabetes, anorexia nervosa.

, If you want to decrease your metabolic rate, start skipping meals. This is not a healthy way to lower your metabolism, but it's effective. Skipping meals causes the body to think that it might have to start preparing for famine, causing it to lower its metabolism in an effort to save energy., When you give your body fewer calories, it compensates by lowering your overall metabolic rate.And it makes sense: with fewer overall calories to work with, your body can't expect to use the same amount of energy that it can when it's getting more calories.



Note: When you give your body fewer calories, it might start burning muscles or body tissue in order to compensate for the lack of calories it's getting. If you are already skinny, this isn't a good method for weight gain.

, Every time you sleep, your metabolic rate dips and then remains suppressed for a period after you awaken., Studies show that sugars and fruit are digested and absorbed more rapidly than complex carbohydrates, such as bread, producing a rollercoaster of blood sugar with high peaks and low troughs.It has also been shownthat the total carbohydrate oxidation over a six-hour period is lower with complex carbohydrates (bread and maize starch) than with sugars.Sucrose (table sugar) also contains fructose, while complex carbohydrates are made up exclusively of glucose units. Fructose consumption results in greater thermogenesis (calorie burning) than glucose consumption.Choose high-fiber foods such as grains (especially whole grains) and vegetables. High-fiber meals have been shown to reduce thermogenesis (calorie burning) for six hours after eating., Of all the foods you can eat, nuts and seeds, which contain almost no moisture and provide healthful unsaturated fats, have the highest caloric density, packing in the most calories per ounce. Polyunsaturated fats, such as those in nuts, have been shown to be oxidized more slowly than monounsaturated fats.Nuts and seeds are also rich in the amino acid arginine. Arginine is used by the body to make nitric oxide, a gas that has been shown to reduce the metabolic rate."
"
Dress warmly.,
Huddle with other people if you have company.,
Lie still.,
Do not drink cold water or eat snow.",How to Decrease Your Metabolism3," Heat loss is a major energy drain, so dress warmly to slow down your metabolism. When you are cold, your body increases the levels of uncoupling protein in your cells. Uncoupling proteins interfere with ATP production, resulting in heat instead of useful energy from the food that you eat.


Levels of thyroid hormone also rise in this situation. This may serve to initiate the production of uncoupling proteins. Thyroid hormone is ""the most significant regulator of basal metabolic rate""representing about one-half of the BMR., Move to the warmest area you can find, or build a shelter if you are outdoors.

, Everything that you do burns calories. Even small things like picking up sticks or skipping rocks. After you have been exercising for a while, your metabolism remains elevated for a period of time, even when you are resting.Every mile that you walk burns 100 calories, and that does not account for the increase in metabolism produced by exercise. Try to sleep if possible.

, Your body will expend energy to warm up the water.This is energy that you could be saving for a more life-critical task, such as hunting for food for surveying for escape routes.

Decide to see a Clinical Geneticist or a Genetic Counselor.,
Research the role of the genetic counselor.,
Know what kinds of services to expect.",How to Decide if Genetic Counseling Is Right for You1," Clinical Geneticists are MD physicians who are trained in diagnosing and educating families in genetic conditions. They have spent 4 years in college, 4 years in medical school, at least 1 year doing a general residency in a field like Internal Medicine or Pediatrics, and another 2 years doing a fellowship in Medical Genetics.. Genetic Counselors are trained individuals who help families cope with genetic disorders. They have completed 4 years of college and at least 2 years of masters degree in genetic counseling.
, Genetic counselors are not medical doctors; rather, they hold Master of Science degrees in genetic counseling.Their services are meant to supplement – not take the place of – the advice of your obstetrician or primary care physician. They offer information and support, not direct medical care.


If you do see a genetic counselor and he or she identifies specific potential problems, you will likely be referred to a medical geneticist, a medical doctor with advanced training in genetics.This person will be qualified to offer medical care.

, In general, genetic counselors will help you assess your risk of genetic disorders, weigh the pros and cons of genetic testing, and understand the results of those tests, if you take them. They will also help gather information about your family history of disease. Using whatever information they can gather, they will explain and help you evaluate all of your reproductive options. They will also offer support as you navigate these options.


Genetic counselors will frequently be unable to tell you for certain whether your child will have a genetic disorder or birth defect. They are often able only to give you a better sense of the probability.
Genetic counselors will not tell you which reproductive options you should choose. They will not say, for example, that you should not start a family (or that you should), and they will not tell you to have an abortion (or advise against one). They will simply make sure you have as much information as possible so that you can make those decisions yourself.

Make a doctor’s appointment.,
Get a set of X-Rays.,
Rule out other disorders.,
Pay attention to both knees.",How to Deal With Osgood Schlatter Disease1," Schedule to meet with your primary care physician who may refer you on to an orthopedic specialist. At your initial appointment, expect your doctor to feel around the knee area and ask about your level of activity. They may also request that you do a series of movements, including jumping or walking.OSD usually doesn't cause crippling pain, excessive swelling, or heavy discoloration. If you have any of these symptoms, you may need to get emergency assistance immediately instead of waiting for a doctor's appointment;
, Prepare to get the first of many X-Rays at your initial doctor’s appointment. This will help your doctor to confirm a diagnosis of OSD. It will also be one of the best ways of tracking your healing progress in the future., If your doctor is uncertain about an OSD diagnosis, then they may request that you see a sports medicine physician or orthopedic specialist for an additional examination. This is an important step as the symptoms of OSD can closely mimic some other conditions, such as patellar tendonitis.If at any point during the process you want extra information, feel free to seek out a secondary opinion before agreeing to any treatment plan.

, Even if just one of your knees is currently bothering you, it may be a good idea to ask your doctor to monitor both sides just in case. People affected by OSD actually experience it in both knees about 25% of the time. Regardless, the reduction in your activity level will likely help both knees to heal."

Love and accept yourself.,
Lower your stress.,
Turn to family and friends for support.,
Set goals.,
Make a list of what you’re happy about.,
Consider counseling.,
Exercise.,
Accept setbacks.",How to Deal With Obesity1," You deserve to be happy and content with yourself, no matter what your size or what number you see on the scale. You are worthwhile, and you deserve encouragement, security, and love. Rather than feel badly about yourself, start your journey of dealing with your obesity by accepting yourself and allowing yourself to be loved.Ask yourself questions, such as: Do I want to lose weight? Why? Does being obese serve me in some way? Asking yourself these questions may help you identify any obstacles you may have.;
, The body responds to stress by storing fat and lowering muscle mass, and that stored fat can lead to a variety of other health complications.Some people also react to stress by stress eating, which is consuming foods to soothe emotions and alleviate stress.Unfortunately, any relief gained by stress eating is temporary, meaning you may continue to stress eat. In addition, the long-term health effects of coping with stress with food far outweigh the momentary comfort it may provide. Lowering stress will have immediate mental and metabolic effects and may reduce mindless, high-calorie snacking.


You could take up meditation, learning to calm your mind and control your breathing.
Do you like to do crafts? Crafting has effects similar to meditation, lowering stress while keeping you busy.Take up a relaxing hobby, such as photography or gardening.

Volunteering is a great stress reducer that has wonderful physical and emotional effects.You can volunteer in person, at a retirement home, or online, as a transcriptionist for a museum, for example. You’ll help your community and lower your stress.

, Talk to your friends and family about your goals and turn to them for encouragement, guidance, and reassurance. Face-to-face support systems allow you to look at the people you’re interacting with and they also encourage a certain level of personal accountability. Dealing with obesity is a personal process, but that doesn't mean you should do it alone., If plans and diets seem a bit overwhelming, start with setting small, specific, achievable goals. When we set smaller goals, we tend to be more motivated to meet them, and that the success we feel spurs us on to set and achieve even more goals.Your goals should be forgiving, and don't forget to reward yourself (but not with food). Some examples of small goals include:


Walk for 30 minutes four times per week
Drink eight glasses of water per day — Being hydrated helps with weight loss and sense of satiety
Pack your lunch and snacks every day
Contribute to an online support group three times per week

, Research indicates that those who begin their day focusing on a few positive points in their life have an overall better mood, appear happier to others, and are much more positive thinkers. A simple way to do this is to make a list – jot down five or so things for which you’re grateful each day, which will shift your focus to the positive.Don’t feel committed to the number five. Remember that this list is going to change every day, and you want to keep it relatively short and simple so that you can thoughtfully consider each thing.
In the beginning, this list may be a challenge. You might try listing one thing from each of the following categories: health, family, physical or emotional, living space, professional/academic. Of course that’s not a comprehensive list of categories, but it might give you a starting point from which to begin.

, While obesity definitely has genetic and physiological factors, you can’t forget to consider its emotional components as well. There is evidence of a strong link between depression and obesity, for example. Also, some research also suggests that food addiction, a very real addiction, often serves to mask other emotions that are hard to deal with., In addition to supporting any weight loss efforts, exercise can be extremely beneficial for your mental health. Exercise can be an effective treatment for depression, anxiety, ADHD, and more. It helps reduce stress, improves memory, and can improve your mood.Even modest amounts of exercise can have far-reaching effects. The American Heart Association recommends walking at least 30 minutes daily, or aim cumulatively for 10,000 steps throughout the day. You can use a pedometer to monitor your progress.
If you can't seem to fit it in, try breaking up your exercise into smaller chunks of time. Go for a 10 to 15 minute walk in the morning and then again in the evening.
A little bit of exercise is better than nothing. Commit to doing a little activity each day and slowly start working your way up to longer sessions of exercise.
You don't need to work out vigorously to receive the benefits. Moderate-intensity exercise is just as effective. Moderate exercise means you are warm but not overheated or sweating profusely and that you can still carry on a conversation with someone (though you should be breathing a little heavier than normal).

, You’re a human being living a complicated life, and sometimes things don’t always go according to plan, and dealing with obesity is no exception. No matter what setback you face, accept that it happened, consider reasons why it may have happened, how you might handle the situation next time, and let go. Tomorrow is a new day.If you make a plan to lose weight, for example, and you have a day of less-healthy food choices, cut yourself some slack. Look at the situation as objectively as possible, don’t be derailed, and get back on track right away.
You might decide that you will love yourself no matter what your size, but you have a day that you just feel unattractive and crummy. Think about what has happened to get you thinking that way, reflect on your list of positives, and rely on your support network.

Put love first.,
Acknowledge the situation.,
Support your wife.,
Help with food changes.,
Learn and keep on learning.,
Consider getting more help if needed.,
Do fun things again.",How to Deal with a Wife's Heart Attack," Whatever else is going on, keep your love at the forefront. She will appreciate the support and sense your loving care at all stages.;
, When a person has a heart attack and they're lucky enough to survive what is one of the scariest things a person can experience, the first tip is to not deny or act like the heart attack was not a big deal. Don’t treat this like a common cold.

, Heart attacks leave a person weak and vulnerable and for an active person this can be a nightmare. Think about how it must feel when a person is not able to lift more than 10 pounds for a very long time or finds walking on an incline or up a flight of stairs takes every bit of energy left. Help out around the house to lighten to work load––the last thing a person in recovery needs is a dirty home on top of health issues.

, After the heart attack, your wife will have to make dietary changes. In order for this transition to go smoothly, it helps if you support her food choices and, much like dieting, do not bring unhealthy food into the home. You may not be the one who had the attack but be sensitive to her needs and heat the junk food up at work.

, Educate yourself as much as possible to all the medical research and treatment you can get your hands on, this information is readily available and free. Knowing your wife's medical history, medications and medical treatment plan will help to keep you included and could even save their life one day. Education + application = prevention!

, If the heart attack was major and your wife requires more care than you are ready to handle, then consider getting outside help, with the caveat that you at no point make her feel like she’s been abandoned or neglected by her spouse. It's alright to seek help and support, it’s not okay to pass the buck!

, When your wife is finally on the mend, find activities and restaurants that will allow you both to enjoy your time together while still keeping her heart happy. Never forget that she just wants your love, and if you give her that, her heart will heal.

Evaluate your emotions honestly.,
Talk openly with your doctor.,
Discuss genetic counseling with your partner.If you have a spouse or partner, take the time to have a serious conversation about the possibility of genetic counseling.",How to Decide if Genetic Counseling Is Right for You2," Even if you have one or more of the risk factors for genetic disorders, or if your doctor recommends genetic counseling, you may still feel apprehensive about taking that step. That’s perfectly normal, and it’s worth stopping to examine your feelings. Will more information make you feel more confident or more anxious? Will having more information help you feel more prepared for the most likely outcomes of your pregnancy?


Some pregnant women and their partners are opposed to abortion in all circumstances.They know they would continue with a pregnancy no matter what information they might get from a genetic counselor, so they worry that any “bad news” they do receive would only add unnecessary anxiety. If this is your position, that’s absolutely valid, but understand that genetic counselors will never pressure you to terminate your pregnancy. Further, the information they give you might help you prepare more effectively for the possibility of having a baby with a genetic disorder or birth defect.

, Your doctor should be able to offer you some basic advice about the pros and cons of genetic counseling for someone in your particular situation. Raise any concerns you have with your doctor first, and see what he or she recommends.

, Good communication will help you make a decision together; it will also set the right tone for handling any issues that do come up.

Apply heat or cold.,
Take anti-inflammatory medication.,
Wear padded insoles and knee pads.,
Wear a brace or cast.,
Agree to surgery only in limited cases.,
Expect symptoms to lessen with age.",How to Deal With Osgood Schlatter Disease2," It is best to apply a heat pack or wrap about a half-hour before any physical activity. Then, when you are done, ice the area or apply a cold wrap immediately and keep it going for about 20 minutes. This will reduce swelling and allow your knee to heal.Even during rest days it can be therapeutic to ice your knee for 20 minutes every 3 hours or so. Be careful with putting ice directly on your skin as it can cause burns. Use a wrap or ice pack., Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help to reduce swelling and minimize pain. They may not shorten your period of healing overly much, but they can make your more comfortable during the process. Make sure to follow any dosing directions carefully., If you decide to continue with sports, then you may need to wear shock-absorbent insoles in your shoes. This will minimize the pressure placed on your knees. When playing a sport that requires kneeling or bending, like wrestling, then it’s a good idea to wear fitted pads to protect your knees.Just any insoles or knee pads won’t do. Buy yours at a sporting goods store to make sure that they will hold up will with lots of movement.

, Casts are usually only used in the most severe cases of OSD with adults. Most OSD patients are given a brace, such as a stabilizing knee wrap or patella strap, for optional use during physical activities. Your doctor may ask that you wear this brace off-and-on for up to 8 weeks.Your doctor may also give you a set of crutches if walking causes you pain.
A patella strap works by spreading out shock absorption around the entire knee area, so that they tendon does not do all of the work., Surgery for OSD is quite rare and used only in the most extreme cases. In adolescents, the most common sufferers of OSD, their skeleton is still forming, which makes invasive bone procedures more problematic. If your doctor does recommend surgery, consider seeking out a second opinion., In many cases, the most severe OSD symptoms will entirely disappear by the time that a person completes their adolescent growth spurt. So, at the age of 14 for girls and 16 for boys, you should see some improvement in pain levels and range of motion.While the interior of the knee will improve, be aware that your child may still have a bump present on the front of their effected knee, called a tubercle.

Work with a physical therapist.,
Limit your exercise activity.,
Do body strength exercises.,
Stretch.,
Work on muscle balance.,
Limit sports specialization.",How to Deal With Osgood Schlatter Disease3," Working with a PT specialist is a great way to ease back into exercising and sports. Your primary care doctor will likely give you a PT referral along with your OSD diagnosis. While in PT, the practitioner will show you how to properly stretch before and after exercise to ensure the health of your knee.Your physical therapist might also manually stimulate your knee by moving it around or side-to-side., Rest and relaxation is the one of the best treatment avenues for OSD. Your doctor may request that you avoid any jumping, sprinting, or weight training that puts stress on the knee area. Or, your doctor may ask that you avoid all physical activity for a period of months. Following their orders closely will get you back in action sooner.Even when you feel 100% you may need to modify some of your sports activities. For example, if you are a runner, you may need to start exercising on a soft surface, such as turf., To keep your muscle definition while still resting, rely on exercises that require you to manipulate or lift your own body weight. Dips, rows, chin-ups, and push-ups are all safe exercises to complete while recovering from OSD., Try to stretch for at least five minutes two or three times each day. Aim to hold each stretch for around 30 seconds. Completing stretches for your hamstring and quadriceps can be particularly useful when healing form OSD. These reduce tension in the leg and knee area while improving blood flow. Continuing with a regular pattern of before and after exercise stretching can also help to prevent a reoccurrence of OSD.To complete a lying hamstring stretch, get down with your back on the floor. Place part of a rope under the ball of one foot. Slowly raise your leg by pulling on your end of the rope. Keep your opposite leg against the ground. Hold your raised leg up in the air for 30 seconds before slowly letting it down., Watch to make sure that you are not favoring just one side of your body while minimizing the other. Emphasize balancing out muscular function by switching sides while batting, rotating on all exercises, and not overcompensating for your OSD knee. If you put too much stress on your non-OSD side, then it can develop its own problems., More and more health professionals are suggesting that young athletes, in particular, practice a wide variety of sports instead of devoting all of their time and talents to just one. This will help prevent the overuse of particular muscle groups and bones, such as the knee. Taking a break in between seasons is also helpful."

Keep a food journal.,
Portion your food.,
Plan your meals.,
Cut sugar and saturated fats.",How to Deal With Obesity2," Often we have no idea how many calories we consume in a day, especially if we are prone to snacking or eating larger portions. Research has shown that keeping a food journal — a paper or electronic system in which you record every bit of food and liquid you intake — makes us more aware of and accountable for what we put in our mouths.Keeping a food journal helps you find areas for dietary improvement, such as late-night snacking or skipping breakfast.
A food diary makes you pay attention to portion sizes.
It may also encourage you to bring meals with you rather than eat out.
Research has shown that people who use food journals lose more weight and keep it off longer., Not surprisingly, it’s easy to not have a good grasp on what correct food portions are. Unfortunately, that leads to overeating. Definitely look at the package for the suggested serving size, but also use your best judgement. You can also find more general guidelines from governmental agencies, such as the USDA.Because restaurant portions are usually huge, one trick when you’re eating out is to ask for a to-go box when the server brings your food and box up half of the meal before you begin eating.
One serving of an apple is about the size of a tennis ball.
A serving of chicken or lean hamburger is approximately the same size as 2/3 of a playing card.

, Most nutritionists will tell you that planning your meals is vital to losing weight. Planning your meals has a few benefits: it takes the guesswork out of what you’ll eat during the week, saves you money since you won’t be eating out, encourages you to make consistently better food choices throughout the week, and makes you more aware of what you’re eating at every meal. We are busier than ever and often don’t have time worry about what to eat. Meal planning takes the guesswork out of it since you just refer to your list every day.If you like to write things down, consider putting a magnetic dry erase board on your refrigerator that has space to fill in what you plan for each meal.
There are many free meal-planning templates on the internet. Download and customize one to meet your individual needs.
Make a meal-planning notebook or digital folder in which you store your list and your recipes.

, Saturated fats can raise your cholesterol and increase your chances of heart disease. Sugar can lead to weight gain and diabetes, and lowering your intake of both can have immediate and long-term health effects.Look at labels and choose options lower in sugar and saturated fats. Eat low-glycemic, high-protein foods, which help you to control your blood sugar and decrease cravings that sabotage weight loss. Make healthy substitutions, also, so that you don't sacrifice flavor or texture. Some examples of good substitutions are:


Instead of mayonnaise, try hummus on sandwiches.
Use plain, unflavored yogurt instead of sour cream.
Trade your white bread for whole wheat or sprouted bread.
Instead of white sugar in your coffee or tea, consider using honey.

Ask your medical doctor for advice.,
Find a support group.,
Join online communities.,
Go to your local bookstore or library.,
Look at your insurance benefits.,
Utilize digital tools.",How to Deal With Obesity3," Your doctor may have told you that you're obese or morbidly obese and advised that you need to lose weight. Unfortunately, many doctors end the conversation there, not providing more solutions.Don't be shy — ask your doctor for resources to help you address the physical and emotional parts of obesity, and if necessary, also ask your doctor for referrals.If you are morbidly obese (BMI over 35), consider a bariatric surgery consultation to see if surgery is an option for you. Your insurance may pay for it if you have comorbid disorders such as hypertension and diabetes.

, Research has shown that people are more inclined to stick with a plan if they have a support group, which is different than relying on your friends and family. These support groups meet for a unified reason, such as weight loss or loving yourself at any size, and are a a great resource of like-minded people.Commercial groups are available and usually have several locations, making them easy to get to.
Your local community center may run various emotional, mental, and physical health groups.
Churches often rent spaces to groups as well that may or may not be affiliated with a religious organization.

, Online communities offer a few advantages: you don’t have to commute to reach the group, you have a degree of anonymity of you want it, mobility issues are not an issue, and you have access to unlimited people from around the whole world. A simple search of any major search engine will take you to community forums, which are often run as message boards, although some do have real-time chat features.


Search for more than one set of key words. If you’d like to find a Love Yourself at Any Size (LYAS) group, you might search that term, but also try ""health at any size community"", for example.

, Your local bookstore or library is a goldmine of resources. You have thousands of books at your fingertips that will help you deal with obesity, from making better food choices to nourishing your self image. Bookstores offer the advantage of looking through books before you commit to purchasing them, giving you an opportunity to decide if that’s really the book for you.


Independently-owned bookstores often have bulletin boards with listings for group meetups on a variety of topics that might be a great fit for you.

, Insurance companies want you to be healthy because it saves them money, and often there are perks that you can take advantage of that might not be advertised. Call your insurance company and ask what ancillary perks you might be eligible for or get on their website and look up your specific policy.Some offer fitness trackers which are wearable devices that keep track of how many steps you take in a day.
Some offer gym fee reimbursements.
Many insurance companies can direct you to various support resources.

, It seems that every month a new device, video game, or app is coming out that helps us with our overall health. Consider using a wearable activity monitor, or using applications for your phone or computer that track your activity, your food and beverage intake, or even your blood pressure numbers. These serve as excellent motivators and help you feel proactive.If you have a smart phone or a tablet and a computer, look for applications that will sync to all of your devices so that you have access no matter where you are.

Do yoga.,
Try seated meditation.,
Exercise your jaw.,
Repeat the jaw exercises against the resistance of your hand.,
Consider using the TheraBite System.",How to Cure Lockjaw Naturally1," Stress can worsen or predispose you to lockjaw, and yoga is a great stress-relieving activity. Yoga is an integrated practice, which means it aids the physical and energetic body. When doing yoga you are encouraged to go to the root cause of stress that has caused the muscle spasm of your jaw. Various yoga postures that help in curing lockjaw are as follows:Asanas (yoga postures) such as the ""Adho Mukh Svanasana"" (Downward Facing Dog) improve the blood flow to the head and jaw. In this asana, the person assumes an inverted ‘V’ pose with the hips facing the ceiling while the heels and hands are on the ground.
""Salamba sarvangasana"" (Shoulder stand) is a pose in which the shoulders rest on the mat or blanket and the entire body from below the shoulders is perpendicular to the floor. This inversion also increases blood flow to the head. Learn how to do this posture correctly before trying it on your own to prevent injury.
""‘Viparita Karani"" (Legs-Up-the-Wall-pose) is done by lying on the floor, supporting your lower back with a firm bolster, and stretching your legs upwards using the support of the wall.
""Shavasana"" (Corpse pose) acts as a muscle relaxant and helps in reducing muscle tension. It is a pose of complete relaxation. Lie flat on the floor face up with your arms at your sides palm up, and consciously relax all the muscles of the body from head to toe.;
, Relaxation techniques may improve TMJ.A great pose to start releasing the temporomandibular joint of the jaw is seated meditation.Begin by sitting in a comfortable position for meditation and focus on relaxing your tongue. Often, the tongue will cling to the palate without you even realizing it. Relax your eye, and soften your jaw. Soften the skin at the corners of your mouth.


These instructions are the starting steps of ""pratyahara,"" i.e. internalization of sensory awareness. Decompressing the jaw in this manner takes practice but is very useful.

, Exercises play an important role in the treatment of lockjaw. If done correctly and regularly, they help treat as well as possibly prevent lockjaw. To begin with, relax and lower your shoulders, relax your lower jaw, and relax your tongue. Make sure your teeth are not touching.Warm up the jaw muscles with small up-and-down and side-to-side movement of the jaw. Be sure not to grind your teeth. Open and close your mouth as much as possible without pain or discomfort.
Move your jaw as far as possible forward and then back. Make similar movements towards both sides and then relax.

, Push your fist below your jaw while opening your mouth, and push your thumb against your chin at the time of forward movement and against the right and left side of your chin during side movements. Keep your jaw at the extreme point of movement for a few seconds, holding it there. Open your mouth as wide as possible, then try to close it while resisting this movement by pushing downward against your lower front teeth with your fingers.


While looking in the mirror, try to move your lower jaw straight up and down, avoiding any deviations as well as any movements producing clicking or locking of the jaw.
Each exercise should be performed for at least 10 counts each day.

, TheraBite is a portable system devised to treat lockjaw and provide patients with anatomically correct jaw motion. This system usually provides both stretching and passive motion for jaw rehabilitation.Cancer in the head and neck may cause lockjaw, especially if you have radiation therapy. TheraBite exercises may help in this case."

Acclimate to the heat.,
Save strenuous activities for the cooler parts of the day.,
Wear proper clothing for the local climate.,
Avoid consuming known triggers that can induce sweating.,
Consider switching to a stronger antiperspirant.,
Stay hydrated and replace lost electrolytes.,

Recover from heat cramps.,
Identify and treat heat exhaustion.,
Learn the signs of heat stroke.",How to Deal With Excessive Sweating (Hyperhydrosis) on Holiday," It can take a while for your body to adjust to the new climate when you travel to a region that is hotter than your normal environment. Passive exposure to heat will eventually lead to partial adaptation, but if you plan on being physically active while you travel it's best to actively acclimate to the heat.In order to fully acclimate, you'll need to engage in about one to two hours of exercise in the heat each day.
Full acclimatization will occur within 10 days if you exercise every day.
It's important to take precautions if you plan on exercising in the heat while you're still acclimating. Drink plenty of fluids and replace any electrolytes you lose during the day.;
, One of the best ways to avoid heat sickness is to restrict your physical activity during the hottest parts of the day. In most warm regions, peak heat hours are between 10:00 AM and 2:00 pm.Early morning and late afternoon or evening are usually the coolest times of day.
Depending on where you are traveling to, it may still be warmer than what you're used to at night or in the relatively cool times of day.
Remember to stay hydrated whenever you engage in physical activity, no matter what time of day it is.

, If you're experiencing excessive sweating while you travel, you may need to change your clothing to better adapt to the climate you're in. Tight, thick, dark-colored clothing tends to induce more sweating and increase the risk of skin irritation and overheating in hot climates.Choose lightweight, loose clothing to allow for the circulation of air and the evaporation of sweat.
Opt for light-colored clothes, as light colors absorb less heat than dark colors.
Wear a wide-brimmed hat when you're out in the sun to reduce your radiant heat exposure.

, While you may be tempted to eat and drink the things you normally enjoy, they may be contributing to your excessive sweating. Certain foods and drinks, like alcohol and spicy foods, are notorious for inducing sweating after consumption.Choose water or 100% fruit juice instead of alcohol. Avoid sugary drinks like soda (or juices that are cocktails or not 100% juice), as these can further dehydrate you.
Try to order your food as mild as possible and avoid anything spicy.

, You can speak with your doctor about a prescription-strength antiperspirant (or even medication to temporarily stop the stimulation of sweat glands), or try a clinical-strength antiperspirant, which is available over-the-counter. Apply this at night and in the morning to clean, dry skin (avoid using lotion in this area, as this can interfere with the antiperspirant). Look for a product with a high level of aluminum chloride hexahydrate, which is the ingredient that closes sweat ducts.Brand names of antiperspirants with high levels of aluminum chloride hexahydrate include Certain Dri, Drysol, Hypercare, Xerac.
Though antiperspirant is meant for use on your underarms, you can occasionally apply it to other areas that sweat a lot.

, It's imperative that you stay hydrated to avoid dehydration and heat sickness; however, if you're prone to excessive sweating, water alone may not be enough to keep you safe in the heat. You may want to consider adding electrolytes to ensure that your salt levels are replenished.You can dissolve two salt tablets in one liter of water to help replenish your electrolyte levels.
Some sports beverages also replenish electrolytes, but they also typically contain a lot of sugar, which may dehydrate you further.
Consider carrying a water reservoir, such as a CamelBak, which will ensure you have enough water, even if you are unable to access water for several hours.
If you anticipate being more active on your trip, even if it is not a warmer climate, plan to drink more water and expect to sweat more than usual.

, It takes a while to adjust to being in a hot climate. If you're not used to a lot of heat and sunshine, being out in the sun during peak heat hours could easily lead to sunburn, further sweating, and possibly even dehydration or heat sickness.The hottest time of day is usually between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm. If at all possible, avoid being out in the sun during this window of time.
If you must be out during peak heat hours, try to limit yourself to no more than 30 minutes of sun exposure in a given day.

, If you must be out in the sun, it's important that you protect your skin from UV exposure. Many people traveling to tropical areas do not realize that it is much easier to get sunburned in these parts of the world, especially if you are coming from a cool region that doesn't get a lot of sunshine on a day-to-day basis.Choose sunscreen that is broad- or full-spectrum. This type of sunscreen protects against both UVA and UVB radiation.
Make sure your sunscreen has a high SPF (sun protection factor). Generally an SPF of 30 or higher is good for traveling to hot, sunny regions.

, Sweating helps cool your body down. But excessive sweating — especially if you're in a hot or humid environment — can lead to skin irritations and embarrassing sweat stains. Managing your perspiration can help minimize or avoid these situations as you travel on vacation.Apply antiperspirant instead of a simple deodorant. Deodorant merely masks odors, but antiperspirants can help reduce sweating.
Try applying talc powder to the parts of your body most prone to sweating. Many people use talc powder on the armpits, groin, and feet to help absorb sweat.(If you are a woman, do not use talc powder on your groin, as this may increase risk of ovarian cancer. Use an alternative, such as cornstarch powder.)
Consider wearing armpit shields. These inserts can help absorb sweat in your armpits and protect your clothes from getting wet.
Choose clothing made of natural fibers. Some sports clothing is even designed to absorb moisture when you sweat.
Change your socks and underwear two or more times each day, if possible.

, A heat rash is a rash or irritation of the skin that usually accompanies excessive sweating. If you're prone to sweating, you may experience a heat rash in any climate, though hot and/or humid weather is more likely to cause a heat rash in some individuals. Heat rash typically looks like a cluster of red pimples or a series of small blisters, and it most commonly afflicts the neck, upper chest, groin, the undersides of breasts, and the creases of elbows.Avoid tight-fitting clothing if you believe you might be prone to heat rash. Instead, opt for loose-fitting clothes that are appropriate for the environment you're in.If you experience heat rash, it's important to keep your skin clean and cool.
Bathe or shower in cool or cold water using a soap that won't dry out your skin. When you get out of the bath/shower, let your skin air-dry instead of using a towel.You can treat heat rash with over-the-counter ointments and creams like calamine lotion and anhydrous lanolin. In severe cases, a doctor might recommend topical steroids., Heat cramps are usually marked by sudden pains or spasms in the muscles. Heat cramps typically affect the abdomen, arms, or legs, and they usually affect individuals who are prone to excessive sweating. As soon as you recognize heat cramps coming on, you should discontinue all physical activity and drink cool beverages, preferably in a cool, shaded place.With proper treatment, heat cramps usually subside within an hour. If you experience heat cramps lasting longer than one hour, seek medical help as soon as possible.

, Heat exhaustion occurs when your body loses too much water and salt in the form of sweat. You may not have an abnormal body temperature during heat exhaustion, but it is usually marked by excessive and heavy sweating.Getting to a cool, shaded environment and drinking cool beverages (ideally water with an electrolyte supplement) can usually reduce the symptoms of heat exhaustion; however, you should seek medical assistance if any of the following symptoms worsen or last for over one hour:


Excessive sweating
Pale skin
Muscle cramps
Fast, weak pulse
Fast, shallow breathing
Feeling weak or exhausted
Dizziness
Nausea/vomiting

, Heat stroke is the body's stress response to being unable to regulate internal temperatures in extremely hot weather.Heat stroke can cause permanent disability or even death, and there is no way to effectively treat heat stroke at home. Seek out immediate medical help if you experience any of the following symptoms:


A very high body temperature (over 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit, or 39.4 degrees Celsius)
Red, hot, dry skin and an inability to sweat anymore
Consistently rapid pulse
Headache with throbbing pain
Dizziness
Nausea
Confusion
Possible loss of consciousness

Look into your family history.,
Consider your reproductive history.,
Factor in maternal age.,
Think about risks related to your ethnicity.,
Consider any exposure to potentially harmful substances.,
Note the results of any prenatal tests.",How to Decide if Genetic Counseling Is Right for You3," Most people do not need to seek genetic counseling, but if you have a family history of genetic disorders or birth defects (or your partner does), you should consider it. Some genetic disorders are hereditary, and a genetic counselor can help you understand the likelihood of passing these disorders on to any children you might have.


Some of the more common hereditary genetic disorders include cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. If any of these disorders appear in your family history (or your partner’s), you are an excellent candidate for genetic counseling.

, If you or your partner have a history of multiple miscarriages, a child who died in early infancy, or an existing child with a genetic disorder or birth defect, you might consider seeing a genetic counselor before trying to have another baby., If you are pregnant (or want to become pregnant) after your mid-thirties, you might be a good candidate for genetic counseling. After age 35, the risk of having a baby with a birth defect increases significantly: at age 35, the overall chance is 1 in 178, while by age 48, the chance is 1 in 8.

, Some genetic disorders are more common among particular ethnic groups. For example, sickle cell anemia is more common among people of African descent, thalassemia is more common among people of eastern European and Middle-Eastern descent, and Tay-Sachs disease is more common among Ashkenazi Jews.

, If you’ve had chemotherapy or been exposed to radiation or toxic chemicals, your risk increases. You should discuss the potential consequences with your doctor and consider pursuing genetic counseling.

, If you or your partner are already pregnant, you will probably have a number of routine prenatal tests: every pregnant woman will have blood work, urinalysis, and ultrasounds performed, and some will have additional tests recommended by their doctors.If your doctor thinks the results of any of these tests indicate a higher than normal possibility of genetic disease, he or she may suggest you consider genetic counseling.

Recognize the cause of your jaw tension.,
Try mustard oil and garlic.,
Drink herbal tea.,
Get more magnesium.,
Load up on calcium.,
Get more vitamin D. You need vitamin D in your body in order to properly absorb calcium.",How to Cure Lockjaw Naturally2," Temporomandibular joint disorder, or TMJ, is a common problem with the joint connecting your jaw bone to your skull – and the cause of what many people think of as “lockjaw.”TMJ can cause clicking, tenderness, pain, and aches in the jaw, as well as trouble chewing and a locking sensation.Lockjaw results from toxins made by the tetanus bacteria that cause severe muscle contractions.Infection is caused by a deep wound or one that’s contaminated with dirt or animal feces, and it requires immediate medical attention. Go to the emergency room or call emergency services if you are experiencing lockjaw symptoms.


You are most at risk of a tetanus infection if you have not received a tetanus vaccine.If you are injured by a dirty object, clean the wound thoroughly and see your doctor. You may need a tetanus booster if you haven’t had one in the past 5 years.You should not attempt to treat tetanus lockjaw at home.
Other symptoms of tetanus, which usually occur about 10 days after the injury, are trouble swallowing, tension in your abdominal muscles, painful body spasms, fever, sweating, and a fast heart rate.”Lockjaw” from TMJ may be easily treated at home. If your jaw tightness or pain is persistent, worsens over the course of a day, or makes it impossible to open or close your mouth completely, see your doctor., Mustard oil improves blood flow to the area, and garlic is an anti-inflammatory. Garlic also has anti-microbial properties that help to fight infections that might be worsening the condition. A jaw that's neither infected nor inflamed will be a lot easier to move.Boil 2 cloves of garlic in a teaspoon of mustard oil and then let it cool. Massage this oil onto the area 2-3 times a day.
Be sure to consult with your doctor, dentist or orthodontist before using any natural remedies.

, Herbal tea prepared from the following herbs may assist in the treatment of lockjaw:



Kava kava: reduces anxiety and aids in relaxation.

Passionflower: decreases anxiety, restlessness and discomfort caused by muscle tension and emotional turmoil.

Feverfew: diminishes pain and muscle soreness.

Chamomile: has a calming effect in adults, and helps reduce muscle pain caused by stress.Peppermint: is calming and reduces pain.

Echinacea: decreases pain and swelling., Magnesium can aid in relaxing muscles and it calms the firing of the nervous system, which may minimize muscle spasms in your jaw.Add foods rich in magnesium to your diet to help reduce the stress and inflammation of muscles that leads to lockjaw.


Good sources of magnesium include almonds, cashews, bananas, avocados, dried apricots, peas, beans, soy, and whole grains like millet and brown rice.The daily requirement for magnesium is 310 to 320mg for women and 400 to 420mg for men.Talk to your doctor about your diet, and consider taking a magnesium supplement if you are not getting your daily requirement from your foods.

, Calcium helps to strengthen your bones, and calcium deficiency leads to spasms of the muscles known as tetany.Consume foods rich in calcium to strengthen the jaw bones and regulate the movement of jaw muscles, preventing spasms that might lead to lockjaw.


Rich sources of calcium are milk, yogurt, cheese, green leafy vegetables like kale, fish such as salmon and sardinesAdults should get 1000mg of calcium daily., A deficiency of vitamin D leads to weakening of the bones and possibly pain in the bones, so being low in vitamin D may cause an increased risk of TMJ dysfunction and increase your risk of lockjaw.Fatty fish such as tuna, salmon and mackerel contain vitamin D, as does fish liver oil. Small amounts of vitamin D are found in egg yolks, beef liver and cheese. Other sources include fortified foods like milk, yogurt, orange juice, margarine, and some ready-to-eat cereals.Daily requirement of vitamin D for an average adult is 600 IU (international units)."

Try self-massage.,
Apply warm and cold packs alternately.,
Maintain good posture at all times.,
Avoid grinding your teeth.,
Eat soft food.,
Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water every day.",How to Cure Lockjaw Naturally3," Lightly massage your jaw muscles with your fingertips. Feel up your jaw line to the place where it is sore or clicking, and massage gently in a circular motion for a minute on each side. This may help the muscles and tendons to release., Icing the sore area will decrease swelling and inflammation. Heat will ease pain and relax muscles.Use a hot water bag or soaked towel for heat, and a cold pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel for cooling.You can also use a heat pack on your neck and shoulders if they are tight and sore.


Make sure not to burn or freeze your skin! Use cold for 10 minutes, then warm for 5 minutes. Keep the entire area covered with a cloth or towel to avoid damaging skin.

, It's important to maintain good posture throughout the day, especially when working on a computer, at a desk or just when sitting for a long time. Keeping proper head and neck posture will help in relieving stressed muscles.

, People who regularly grind their teeth are more likely to get TMJ because of the stress it puts on your jaw joint and muscles. Some people even grind their teeth while they sleep. Stop grinding your teeth to minimize your chance of lockjaw from TMJ., When your jaw muscles are tight and painful, you want to give them a rest instead of making them work hard. Eat soft foods like soup, eggs, fish, cottage cheese, smoothies, and cooked vegetables. Take small bites. Avoid hard foods and foods that are sticky or chewy.Do not chew gum.

, Dehydration can cause muscle cramps and make you more prone to lockjaw.Drink water regularly to help keep your muscles and bones in optimum condition. Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily.

Use preventative care.,
Take part in wellness programs.,
Look into extra discounts.,
Look into other insurance plans.",How to Cut Health Costs1," With the induction of the Affordable Care Act, health care plans must offer some types of preventative care free of charge. This includes cancer screenings, wellness checkups for women and children, and immunizations. These preventative methods can help you cut down on larger, and more expensive health problems later down the road.


If you aren't sure which preventative care your insurance provides, visit your provider's website.;
, Many employers are trying to control health care costs by offering wellness programs to their employees. These programs often lead to a lower insurance premium or other monetary incentives. The kinds of programs include:Health screenings of levels such as cholesterol and blood pressure.
Completing a health risk assessment, such as a questionnaire.
Taking part in physical activity programs or initiatives to quit smoking.
Diabetes or weight management plans.

, Some insurance providers offer extra discounts if you use certain doctors, providers, or hospitals. Look into your insurance documents or ask an insurance representative if there are places near you., If you think you might be paying too much for health insurance, look into different insurance plans. This may be a different plan from the same provider that might suit you better or another plan from a different provider.


Look into the details of your plan as well. You may find a better plan that will save you money in the long run, such as ones with a smaller deductible or a smaller copay."

Drink cranberry juice.,
Take licorice.,
Practice healthy hygiene habits as prevention techniques.",How to Cure H. Pylori Naturally1," Cranberry juice appears to prevent or inhibit the bacteria from attaching themselves to the stomach; one study recommends 250mL of cranberry juice every day. This study only had a 14% success rate after 90 days, so it's probably best to include other approaches as well., Licorice is a traditional ulcer treatment in Indian, Chinese, and Kampo medicine. Although more evidence is needed, the existing tests on animals and humans are promising. This seems to work by preventing the bacteria from attaching to the stomach, so it works best in the early stages of infection.One component in licorice has been linked to increased blood pressure. You can buy a natural tablet called DGL (Deglycyrrhizinated licorice), which has had this component removed.

, In order to minimize your risk of getting infected with H. pylori, make sure you carefully wash your hands and all utensils used for cooking and eating. Use warm, soapy water to wash. Don’t share utensils with anyone, and make certain anyone preparing foods for you is using proper hygiene. Wash all fruits and vegetables with warm, soapy water or a fruit and vegetable rinse product and rinse them well.

Recognize the signs and symptoms.,
Be patient with a hydrocele.,
Try an Epsom salt bath.,
Avoid trauma to the testes and STDs.,
Know when to seek medical treatment.,
See your doctor for an examination.,
Get the fluid removed.,
Have the entire hydrocele surgically removed.,
Take it easy while recovering.",How to Cure a Hydrocele," The first indication of a hydrocele is a painless swelling or enlargement of the scrotum, representing a fluid collection around one or both testicles.Babies rarely have complications from a hydrocele and the vast majority disappear before the age of one without treatment. In contrast, men with hydroceles may eventually experience discomfort as the scrotum swells and gets heavy. It can create difficulty sitting or walking / running in extreme cases.


Pain or discomfort from a hydrocele is generally correlated to its size — the bigger it gets, the more likely you'll feel it.
Hydroceles tend to be smaller in the morning (upon waking) and then get more swollen as the day progresses.Straining may cause certain hydrocele's to increase in size.
Babies born prematurely have a greater risk of having hydroceles.;
, In the vast majority of cases among baby boys, teenagers and men, hydroceles go away on their own without any specific treatment.The blockage or congestion near the testicle(s) resolves itself and the hydrocele drains and gets absorbed into the body. Thus, if you notice an enlarged scrotum and it's not painful or causing problems with urination or during sex, give it some time to resolve itself.


For baby boys, hydroceles usually fade away on their own within one year of being born.
For men, hydroceles often gradually disappear within six months, depending on the cause. Larger ones may take more time, but shouldn't go beyond one year without medical intervention.
However, in children and adolescents hydroceles can be caused by infection, trauma, testicular torsion or tumor, so these conditions must be excluded by examination from a doctor.
Hydroceles are similar to fluid-filled ganglions that form in tendon sheaths near joints and then gradually disappear.

, If you notice a painless swelling in your testicle(s)/scrotum, take a very warm bath with at least a few cups of Epsom salt added.Relax in the tub for between 15 – 20 minutes with your legs slightly spread, so that the water engulfs your scrotum. The warmth of the water can stimulate the movement of body fluids (it may help unblock a blockage) and the salt can pull fluid out through your skin and reduce swelling. Epsom salt is also a rich source of magnesium, which helps to relax muscles / tendons and soothe any tenderness.


If there is pain associated with your hydrocele, then exposing your scrotum to warm water (or any source of heat) may create more inflammation and make your symptoms worse.
Don't make the bath too hot (to prevent scalding) and don't sit in the tub for too long (to prevent dehydration).

, The cause of hydroceles is unknown in baby boys, although it's thought to be a backup of fluid from poor circulation due to the baby's position in the womb. In older boys and men, however, the cause is usually related to trauma to the scrotum or an infection.Trauma can occur from wrestling, martial arts, cycling and various sexual activities. Infections in the testes/scrotum are often related to sexually transmitted diseases;therefore, protect your scrotum from trauma and practice safe sex.


If you play contact sports, always wear an athletic supporter with a plastic cup to protect your scrotum from injury.
Always use a new condom when having sex in order to significantly reduce your risk of infection. STDs don't always infect the testicles, but it's not uncommon either.

, You should seek medical attention for your baby boy if his swollen scrotum doesn't disappear after a year, or it continues to get larger.Men should see their doctor if a hydrocele persists for more than six months, or it gets big enough to cause pain/discomfort or disfigurement.


A testicular infection is not the same as a hydrocele, but it can cause one secondarily. Testicular infections are very painful and should be treated because they increase your risk of infertility. Always seek medical treatment if you experience scrotal swelling and fever.
It's also time to see your doctor if the hydrocele is affecting the way you run, walk or sit.
Hydroceles don't impact fertility.

, If the hydrocele persists for longer than normal or it's causing pain and other symptoms, then see your family physician for an examination. Hydroceles are not serious, but your doctor will want to rule out other relatively serious conditions that can appear similar, such as: an inguinal hernia, varicocele, infection, benign tumor or testicular cancer.Once a diagnosis of a hydrocele is made, your options are essentially all surgical. Medications are not effective.


Your doctor may use diagnostic ultrasound, an MRI or a CT scan to better visualize what's going on inside the scrotum.
Shining a bright light through the scrotum can tell if the fluid is clear (indicating a hydrocele) or murky, which could be blood and/or pus.
Blood and urine tests are helpful to rule out infections, such as epididymitis, the mumps or various STDs.

, Once the hydrocele is diagnosed, the least invasive procedure is to have the fluid drained from the scrotum by a needle, which is called aspiration.After a topical anesthetic is given, a needle is inserted into the scrotum to penetrate the hydrocele, then the clear fluid is removed. If the fluid is bloody and/or pus-filled, then that indicates an injury, infection or perhaps cancer. This procedure is very quick and doesn't require much recovery time — usually just a day or so.


Needle drainage of a hydrocele is not done all that often because the fluid usually accumulates again, requiring more treatment.Sometimes the needle has to be inserted through the inguinal (groin) area if the hydrocele has formed higher in the scrotum or partially outside of it.

, The most common and effective way of dealing with a persistent and/or symptomatic hydrocele is to remove the hydrocele sac along with the fluid — called a hydrocelectomy.This way, there's only about a 1% chance of the hydrocele developing again.The surgery is either performed with a scalpel or a laparoscope, which has a tiny camera attached to a long cutting device. Hydrocele surgery is typically done at an outpatient clinic under general anesthesia. Recuperation can take up to a week or more, depending if the abdominal wall has to be cut into.


With babies, surgeons usually cut into the groin (inguinal region) to drain the fluid and remove the sac. Stitches are then used to strengthen the muscle wall — which is essentially the same as a hernia repair surgery.
In adults, surgeons often cut into the scrotum to drain the fluid and remove the hydrocele sac.After a hydrocelectomy, you might need a tube inserted into your scrotum to drain any excess fluid for a few days.
Depending upon the type of hydrocele, surgical repair may be recommended to decrease the risk of a hernia to the area that is cut off from blood supply.

, Recovery from a hydrocele operation is relatively quick in most cases. Otherwise healthy males can typically go home a few hours after surgery — it rarely requires spending overnight in a hospital.Kids should limit their activity (no rough stuff) and get extra bed or couch rest for about 48 hours or so post surgery. Men should follow the same advice, as well as delaying sexual activities for up to a week just to be on the safe side.


In most patients following a hydrocele operation, normal activity can restart after four to seven days.Potential complications from surgery to look out for include: allergic reaction to anesthesia (breathing problems), bleeding within or outside the scrotum that won't stop, and potential infection.
Signs of bacterial infection include groin pain, inflammation, redness, a foul odor and possibly a mild fever.

Understand what lockjaw is.,
Seek rapid medical attention.Ideally, you will have seen a doctor right when you were first potentially exposed to the tetanus bacteria.,
Try medications.",How to Cure Lockjaw1," ""Lockjaw"" is a colloquial term used to describe spasms of the masseter muscles (the jaw muscles) as a result of being infected with tetanus.Tetanus is a bacterial infection that results in painful muscle spasms; there is no cure, and 10–20% of cases result in death, which is why preventative tetanus vaccination is key.Most people now receive the tetanus vaccine in their youth, which makes this disease quite rare.The vaccine lasts for 10 years, so after that point a booster vaccine will be needed in order to stay immune to tetanus.
The tetanus infection is not passed from person to person; rather, it is contracted via a wound, usually a deep wound that can allow bacteria from the environment (usually soil) to get into the body.This is why whenever patients present to the Emergency Room with a deep wound, they are asked about the status of their tetanus vaccination.
Symptoms of tetanus usually begin to appear about a week after being infected with the bacteria. In addition to the spasms of the jaw muscles (the ""lockjaw"" symptoms), other symptoms of tetanus can include headache, fever, sweating, restlessness, trouble swallowing, irritability, and strange-looking facial expressions due to the muscle stiffness and spasms.;
, If you have not been immunized within the past 10 years, they will inject you with tetanus immune globulin followed by the vaccine.


3,000 to 6,000 units of tetanus immune globulin drug is administered via intramuscular shots. This injectable solution contains Immunoglobulin G, an antibody that helps your body get rid of all the toxins produced by the tetanus causing bacteria. Administration of this treatment will boost your immunity, helping you fight the infection.
A local anesthetic can be added to the injection to lower the amount of pain. Administration of this drug must always be done under medical supervision.
The doctors will also clean your wound thoroughly, and remove any foreign material that may be present in the wound, to minimize the chances of a tetanus infection.Note that if you are already presenting with symptoms of ""lockjaw,"" this means that you are late in seeking treatment; however, the doctors will give you the injection anyway even though it is preferable to have gotten it earlier (it can still be somewhat effective later on).

, If you have a tetanus infection, home treatment is not an option, and medications will be administered in the hospital. Muscle relaxers, such as Carisoprodol, and sedatives are commonly used to help relieve muscle spasms in your jaw and elsewhere on your body.Neuromuscular blocking agents are also useful in treating spasms. These medications include pancuronium, vecuronium, and baclofen.Your breathing and heartbeat can be affected by muscle spasms as well as by the use of sedatives. You may need to use a ventilator while in the hospital. In severe causes, you may be taken to the ICU, These facilities are ideal in severe cases because close monitoring of vital functions such as breathing and your heart rate can occur continuously, until you hopefully recover.

Consider your current diet and how well it serves your health. Note any areas for improvement.

, Mental wellness is a measure of how you cope with difficult situations and how well you balance your emotions.


Consider your present mental wellness. Which emotions do you deal with most often? How well do you deal with those emotions? What changes or improvements would you like to see to your mental state?

, Spiritual wellness isn’t about religion or personal faith but about how you perceive the meaning of life and your place in it.Spiritual wellness means that you are able to find meaning, hope, comfort, and inner peace in your life, whether through work, nature, art, music, family, or volunteer work.
Consider your current level of spiritual wellness: how fulfilled do you feel in your life? Do you lack a sense of purpose or efficacy?

, Emotional and relationship wellness pertains to how well you are aware of, accepting of, and able to deal with your feelings and the feelings of those around you. Having health emotional and relationship wellness makes you feel more resilient and supported. Conversely, lack of emotional wellness can sap your energy and happiness.


Take account of your present relationships, stress level, self-esteem, and life outlook. Are there areas on which you’d like to improve?
Are you happy? Do you feel weighed down by your relationships or emotions?

, This refers to the amount of information and knowledge you take in, and the amount of creative, critical and analytical thinking you put out. Learning, problem solving and mental productivity are important aspects of intellectual wellness.


Consider your level of intellectual wellness. Are you intellectually stimulated by your life, or are you bored?
Do you have sufficient creative outlets?
How often do you use critical and analytical thinking?

, Social wellness has to do with how you see your place in the world and in society and how well you adjust to your role in society.


Consider your level of social wellness. Do you feel secure and confident in your social roles?
Are you able to easily take up new and different social roles?

, This aspect of personal wellness stresses the importance of having a positive attitude towards work, as well as having a rewarding and enriching career path.


Consider your level of occupational wellness. Do you feel engaged by your work and career?
Do you feel appreciated for your work?
Do you feel enriched by the work you do?
Are you satisfied with your career path?

, Financial wellness entails your sense of financial stability and health.


Consider your level of financial wellness. Are you living within your means?
Are you financially secure for the future?
Do you have and keep a budget?

, This aspect of wellness relates to your level of environmental consciousness. Your well-being is intertwined with the well-being of the environment around you.


Consider your level of environmental wellness. Do you get enough fresh air, fresh water, and sunshine?
Do you take time to appreciate the environment around you?
Do you take measures to conserve energy and consume consciously?

, After assessing each dimension of your personal wellness, it’s time to begin setting goals. Keep your initial goals simple and achievable. You don’t want to get frustrated by difficult goals right off the bat.


It’s a good idea to to a local fitness center and inquire about physical evaluations. Talk to your physician first before embarking on a physical wellness plan if you’re overweight or have a history of medical problems.
Start by walking more often. Park your car further away from an entrance and walk more. Use the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator. Walk around the block or take your dog out for a nice walk.
Speak to your physician if you are overweight or have a significant medical history of heart disease, respiratory disease, arthritis, or any other serious medical condition. Your physician can help you set safe, reasonable goals.
Make sure the physical activity you choose is something you like to do and not something someone talked you into. If you like the activity, you are much more likely to keep at it.
Work your way up to increased activity. If you have spent the last 5 years with low to moderate physical activity, you’re probably not quite ready for a triathlon. Start slowly and gently, increasing your activity level when you feel ready and able.
Be patient and try a low-impact activity first like yoga, tai chi, or qigong.These ancient physical (and spiritual) exercises can improve health, reduce stress, reduce pain, and improve strength and balance.

, How do you know what the best diet is with all of the conflicting diets and advice? Try starting with some relatively simple rules:


Consider speaking with a nutritionist who can help you determine the ideal nutrition for you and your body.
Eat food that is as close to its natural form as possible. Try to limit processed and prepared foods and cook from scratch instead. Use a crock pot or stick to basic foods like rice, beans, and vegetables if you’re pressed for time. You might also consider preparing food for the week ahead of time and storing it in the freezer until you’re ready to eat it.
Limit your red meat consumption (prefer grass-fed if possible). Increase the amount of fish (wild over farm raised) and skinless poultry you eat.
Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you consume. Your intake of vegetables should be higher than your fruit intake, since fruit contains sugar.
Increase the amount of water you drink.
Be alert for food sensitivities. If you suspect you’re sensitive to a particular food, eliminate it from your diet for at least 2 weeks. Foods that may cause sensitivity include gluten, dairy, milk/lactose, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and soy.Visit the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) website for advice on nutrition for kids, parents, men, women, and seniors.
Give yourself 30 days on a new plan to form a habit and to fully evaluate the effects. When first making a change, your body may go through a transition/detox which is not always the most pleasant but may be necessary for longer term change. Dedicating yourself to the plan for the full duration can be a powerful but difficult step so surrounding yourself with a knowledgeable and supportive community may be helpful.

, Mental wellness takes work, but even if you’ve suffered from depression, anxiety, or another mental disorder, you can improve your mental wellness with the right actions. Try these approaches to reduce depression, anxiety and stress:Set aside time to quietly relax each day.
Take a walk when you feel distressed.
Set aside time to do relaxing activities you enjoy like reading, gardening, watching movies, etc.
Learn and use deep breathing techniques. For example, breathe by expanding your abdomen rather than your chest. This technique allows your diaphragm--the flat muscle below you lungs--to drop by expanding your abdominal muscles. Take 100 deep breaths each day.Practice positive affirmations. Some examples of positive affirmations include: “yes, I can,” “I am successful,” “I feel better every day,” etc. You might write your affirmation on a sticky note and post it where you can see it.Seek out the support of a therapist or support group.
Remember: If you’re taking medication for a mental disorder, never stop the medication or change the dose on your own. Doing so can be very dangerous and you should only do so under the guidance of your mental health professional.

, You can use many of the same techniques for mental wellness as for spiritual wellness. Some examples:


Learn and use deep breathing techniques. For example, breathe by expanding your abdomen rather than your chest. This technique allows your diaphragm--the flat muscle below your lungs--to drop by expanding your abdominal muscles. Take 100 deep breaths each day.
Meditate for a short period a few days a week. As you become more comfortable, gradually increase the amount of meditation you practice.Remind yourself to stay calm and “in the moment.”

, Be honest with yourself about how satisfied you feel in each aspect of wellness. That way you can create a wellness plan tailored to your needs.


Give each area a ranking from 1-10, with 1 being the poorest rank and 10 being the best.
From this, you can determine which area needs the attention.
But remember, each area relates to another, so you won’t necessarily benefit from focusing all of your attention on one area to the detriment of others.

, Once you identify the area or areas that you feel you need to work on, begin setting your goals.


Write down specific goals you want to accomplish in each area. Create achievable short-term goals that will move you towards increasingly larger long-term goals.
Make sure your long-term goals are also reasonable and doable. For example, if you are 25 years old, a reasonable long-term goal might be financial security by the time you retire at age 65. An unreasonable long-term goal would be becoming a billionaire by the age of 30.
Be patient with yourself. Personal evolution does not generally take place overnight, nor is it usually very easy. But it is doable, so don’t get discouraged if change doesn’t happen immediately.

, Make up a chart or a journal in which you can outline each aspect of personal wellness and the goals for each.


Do regular personal assessments: are you feeling happier, more content? Do you have more energy, more fun- or laughter-filled moments? Are your relationships happier?
Then set aside a calendar designated for tracking your wellness progress. Mark important dates and checkpoints so that you can see your progress. Begin by establishing your baseline of wellness for a particular aspect, write it down, then check in again after a month or two.
Seeing the positive effects of what you have already accomplished may be the best motivational fuel.

, As you develop greater personal wellness, you may that certain goals take more or less time than you anticipated. Or you might find that some goals are no longer inside the scope of what you want to accomplish. So make a point to monitor your progress and reassess your needs every 6 months or so. That way you’ll keep your wellness plan in harmony to your personal growth and progress.


The process of achieving personal wellness is dynamic. Your needs, your goals, your environment, and your relationships may all change. You then want to decide how you want to change along with them.
While your particular situation may change, by keeping these goals at the forefront, you can achieve a greater degree of control of how those changes will affect you. If for example, you set a weight loss goal of 10 pounds in 6 months, at the end of 6 months, re-evaluate that goal. Are you happy with your current weight? Do you want to lose more? If you are happy with your weight, your new goal may be maintenance. If you want to lose more, perhaps your new goal is 10 additional pounds in the next 6 months.

, Having the support of others can be crucial to maintaining your drive and motivation. Your supporters can hold you accountable, offer encouragement when needed, and perhaps even join you in your efforts.


Get professional help and advice where needed. If for example, you want to improve your diet and nutrition to attain physical and mental wellness, you may want to consult with a nutritionist.
If you are looking for financial stability, talk to a financial advisor.
Join support groups that address whatever area(s) you might need encouragement in.
Start a “buddy system” with a friend, spouse, or relative for various aspects of your wellness plan. For example, if you’re working on financial wellness, getting your spouse involved can be an important step in getting closer to both relationship wellness and emotional wellness.

Cut out unnecessary procedures.,
See a doctor within your network.,
Make lump sum payments.",How to Cut Health Costs2," When you end up in the hospital or at the doctor's office, ask your doctor if every test he is running or performing on you is necessary. Let him know that you only want procedures or medicine that is required to treat your ailment. Often, doctors run tests and offer other treatments that aren't required.


This will help you pay less in the long run, because your doctor and hospital bills will be lower., Most health care providers have doctors who are considered ""in network,"" which means that they will cost less. If you see a doctor out of your network, your coverage will cover much less of the expenses, which means your out of pocket costs will be higher.


Check your insurance provider's website or any supplementary material they send to you to ensure your doctors are in network.
If you are unsure, call your insurance company to ask., If you have a large medical bill, you may be able to negotiate a lower lump sum payment option. This will cost you more out of pocket at one time, but your overall cost can be much lower."
"
Switch to generic medications.,
Get your prescriptions through the mail.,
Get a discount prescription card.,
Use over-the-counter medications when possible.",How to Cut Health Costs3," Most prescriptions have a generic option. These cost much less than name brand medicines, but are essentially the same medication. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your prescriptions can be switched to generic version.


Insurance plans often cover more on these as well., There are mail-order pharmacies that you can send your prescriptions to in order to cut costs. These pharmacies take medicines for which you have a long-standing prescriptions and send you a three month supply for the price of one.


If you are taking expensive medications for chronic conditions, this can save you a lot of money since you will only pay for four months worth of medication per twelve months., There are certain organizations, such as AARP and AAA, that can offer discounts on prescriptions. There are even certain people who might qualify for free prescription cards through Medicare or other plans.


When using a discount card, make sure you find the cheapest price you can on the prescriptions before you use the discount card. Some pharmacies offer lower prices on medications than others. This way, your out of pocket cost is as low as possible., If there are conditions or illnesses that you suffer from that you can use over-the-counter medication for, use those medications instead. Conditions such as chronic allergies or head colds can easily be helped with over the counter medicine instead of expensive prescriptions.


If your condition doesn't get any better, see your doctor to make sure nothing serious is wrong."
"
Keep yourself healthy.,
Avoid emergency rooms if possible.,
Be aware of your own health.",How to Cut Health Costs4," In order to cut down on your visits to the doctor, keep yourself healthy. Eat healthy, exercise, and keep up with your hygiene. This will limit the out of pocket costs you pay because you will go to the doctor less.


Although this won't keep you from getting sick all the time, it will help keep your body in the best shape to fight illness., If you have an ailment that can be taken care of with a doctor's visit, make an appointment instead of heading to the emergency room. Emergency room visits can cost upwards of $1,000, which you may have to may out of pocket if your deductible hasn't been met. Common illnesses, such as colds, or other non-emergency problems can be taken care of at home or with over the counter treatments.


You can also visit a clinic or other after hours facility, which are usually cheaper than an emergency room. Try the Minute Clinic at CVS or urgent care facilities., If you are unaware of your personal health, you may be more likely to get reactionary health care. This can make your health costs pile up over time. Perform regular exams of your breasts, skin, testicles, mouth, and other common areas for cancer or other health issues.


Checking yourself over can also help you find major health issues sooner, which can help cut down on long term health costs."

Understand the limitations of natural remedies.,
Take probiotics.,
Try edible botanicals.,
Consider Korean red ginseng supplements.,
Try consuming other helpful foods.,
Eat a nutritious diet.,
Minimize processed and packaged foods.,
Combine several methods.,
Call your physician.",How to Cure H. Pylori Naturally2," Natural treatments for H. pylori center on a nutritious diet, the use of common hygiene principles, and the use of specific botanical medicines, probiotics, and other supplements. These approaches have not been proven to cure H. pylori, but they can help prevent and treat the infection. These approaches can also help reduce the symptoms, if you are experiencing any.

, Probiotics are sources of the types of “good” bacteria and yeast normally found in the body’s microbiome. This includes species of lactobacillus, acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. You can take these as a supplement (following the manufacturer’s instructions) or in foods. Preliminary evidence suggests this may help fight H. pylori.Good food sources of probiotics are fermented foods such as kefir, sauerkraut, pickles, kombucha (a fermented tea), tempeh, kimchi and other foods such as yogurt, miso soup, poi, asparagus, leeks, and onions.Include these foods at least 2-3 times a week in your diet.
2-3 times per week, you can also include pre-biotics which help support the healthy gut bacteria by providing food for the bacteria. Pre-biotic foods include whole grains, onions, bananas, garlic, honey, artichokes, and leeks., Many botanical medicines have antibiotic (bacteria-killing) properties. The following herbs have slowed the growth of H. pylori in lab cultures. This is a far cry from a complete cure of an existing infection, but they are worth a try:


Ginger, which may also have ulcer-reducing properties.Thyme, which also has general antibacterial propertiesTurmeric/CurryOreganoCinnamon, Korean red ginseng has shown anti- H. pylori activity in lab animals.Red ginseng is different than American ginseng and has a wide variety of uses. While many regard ginseng as effective in increasing mental performance and sexual function, it also lower blood sugar, increase heart rate and can either raise or lower blood pressure. If you are interested in trying red ginseng, talk to a knowledgeable healthcare professional first.

, Green tea, red wine, and manuka honey have also shown antibiotic activity against H. pylori. Many of these studies, however, were done in bacterial cultures or lab animals, so there is no human dosage information available. It is probably safe to include green tea and manuka honey in your diet but to drink red wine in moderation. These may help with an infection.

, There is no solid link between nutrition and H. pylori.That said, natural health philosophies recommend whole, unprocessed foods for general health, which may improve immune system response and support a healthier microbiome. A healthy diet includes:


High quality protein:

low to moderate amounts of red meat (preferably grass fed)
moderate amounts of skinless poultry
low to moderate amounts of pork
moderate to high amounts of fish


Fresh vegetables and fruit (in a variety of rich colors)

Broccoli sprouts may treat H. pylori, but this is only supported by one study involving nine patients.Beans and legumes such as lentils
Complex carbohydrates found in:

vegetables
whole grain foods
grains such as brown rice and quinoa
beans and legumes



, Although nutrition is not as simple as ""natural versus artificial,"" most processed foods are less nutritious and may include substances with negative side effects (sometimes including suppressed immune response).Avoiding them will probably lead to better overall health, but it's unlikely to have a direct effect on the H. pylori.


To check if a product is processed/packaged, check the ingredient list. The longer the list is, the more processed the food is. Processed foods are most often found in the center aisles in grocery stores. Less processed foods are found around the outer aisles and would include dry beans, fresh fruits and vegetables, brown rice, bulk foods and single-ingredient foods.
Stay away from “quick and easy” ready-to-eat meals. Again, these tend to be highly processed and contain preservatives and other chemicals that are not really food.

, You may experience increased success by combining a number of the approaches above. You will feel better overall and may help your H. pylori if you combine eating better, using the herbs and spices suggested to add variety and flavor to your foods, adding some fermented foods, and supplementing with probiotics.


Get tested after 2-3 months of trying these approaches to see if the infection still exists. At that point, you may want to consider the antibiotics and acid-lowering drugs recommended by your physician. Always discuss your options with a healthcare professional and get tested to make certain you are dealing with an H pylori infection.

, If these approaches don’t help you feel better or if you experience any severe abdominal pain, blood in the stools (black and tarry-looking stools) or bloody, black vomit or vomit that resembles coffee grounds, call your physician immediately! These can be signs of a serious problem.

Don't expect water to cure the problem.,
Don't put your faith in garlic.,
Keep fenugreek out of your medicine cupboard.,
Know which treatments are not based on evidence.",How to Cure H. Pylori Naturally3," Water consumption will not cure H. pylori or related ulcers. Ulcers are not caused by dehydration., Trials involving garlic show no effect on H. pylori, and no reduction in gastric cancer rates., For this health problem at least, fenugreek probably has no effect., The following home remedies do not seem to be based on evidence. They are no more likely to work than anything else in your kitchen.


Cayenne pepper
Baikal skullcap(Warning: if you want to try this treatment anyway, talk to a qualified healthcare professional first. It can slow blood clotting, affect blood sugar levels, and lower blood pressure.)

"
"
Take an antibiotic.,
Try acid-reducing medications.,
Add a bismuth solution.",How to Cure H. Pylori Naturally4," If a doctor determines that you have an H. pylori infection, she may want you to take an antibiotic to fight the bacterial infection. Your doctor will likely recommend two or more antibiotics to be taken for at least 2-3 weeks or longer, depending on your response to the antibiotics.


Some of the more common antibiotics used are amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline.

, Drugs that decrease acid levels (Proton Pump Inhibitors or PPIs) or a class of drugs called H2 blockers are often recommended along with the antibiotics. The decreased acid levels provide a less-than-ideal environment for the bacteria while the antibiotics kill them.

, In addition to the acid reducer and antibiotic, your doctor may suggest a bismuth solution like bismuth subsalicylate (eg Pepto Bismol TM). Bismuth solutions such as Pepto-Bismol won’t kill off the bacteria by themselves, but they do work well in combination with the antibiotics and the drugs that lower the amount of acid in the stomach.


About 70-85% of people treated with these combinations are H pylori negative after treatment with all three medicines. There are a number of different possible combinations of two antibiotics, a bismuth salt, and an acid-lowering drug, so talk to your physician about her recommendation.

Learn how H pylori causes ulcers.,
Know how you can get H pylori.,
Recognize the early symptoms of H pylori.,
Get tested for H pylori.",How to Cure H. Pylori Naturally5," H. pylori damages the lining of the stomach which normally protects the stomach from the stomach acids needed to start digesting your food. Once that lining has been damaged, the acids in the stomach begin to literally “eat away” at the stomach and duodenum, and may eventually cause pits (ulcers) that can bleed and cause significant pain.


This bleeding can cause anemia, fatigue and weakness, and the accompanying pain and discomfort can be debilitating.

H. pylori is associated with a type of stomach cancer and the gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The infection is also associated with a decreased risk of another type of stomach cancer and a type of cancer of the esophagus., You can get infected with H. pylori from infected foods, water, cooking utensils, or through contact with the fluids of other people already infected. For example, if you share a fork or a spoon with someone who is already infected, you may get infected as well.


The H. pylori bacteria are everywhere. They can be found in about two thirds of the world’s adult population, and children can be infected as well.Infection rates in the developing world are higher than in the developed nations.
To help prevent an infection, make sure you wash your hands before eating, especially after using the bathroom. Only drink water from a clean and safe source and make sure your food is prepared safely and with sanitary practices.You probably can’t avoid the bacteria completely, but you can decrease your chances of getting infected. If you eat well to keep yourself healthy, your immune system should be in a good position to combat the infection.

, Early infection of H. pylori can be totally painless and symptomless. In fact, unless your get tested, you may never even know you have the infection. When there are symptoms, these may include:An ache or burning sensation in the abdomen (which may worsen when you are hungry)
Nausea
Burping and belching
Decreased appetite
Bloating
Weight loss without intentional dieting

, Your doctor can diagnose H. pylori by your symptoms and by a number of different lab tests.


A urea breath test is one of the best ways to diagnose H. pylori.

You would be asked to drink a liquid containing a “label,” which can be slightly radioactive or non-radioactive, depending on the specific test used. After a relatively short time period, your breath would be tested for the presence of urea.Urea and ammonia are produced as a by-product of bacterial metabolism and give an indication of the presence of H. pylori.


A stool test checks for the presence of material from the bacteria.
Less often, your doctor may order a stomach biopsy which is then tested for the presence of the bacteria. Usually a biopsy is used when there is a suspicion of cancer, but it is the most reliable method for diagnosis and is preferred by some doctors.

Try massage.,
Use heat.,
Cool the area.,
Be aware that these at-home strategies do not take the place of professional medical treatment.",How to Cure Lockjaw2," Massaging the masseter muscles and jaw joints will help ease the pain. Apply light pressure and massage your jaw muscles to relieve pain.


With the help of your index finger and middle finger, rub your cheeks to find the tender point on the jaw. On you pinpoint the location, massage with your fingers in circular motion for 30 seconds. Be careful not to press to hard. It should be just slight optimal pressure such that it causes no pain and gives relaxation.

, Heat is great for relaxing your muscles, and will help you get rid of muscle spasms by increasing the local blood flow. Use a hot water bottle or heating pad by placing it on the desired area. Hold the heat source in the affected area for about 30 minutes.


Be careful not to apply a high heat level, as you may cause burns.

, Using ice packs in conjunction with heat is a great remedy. Lower temperature will help ease inflammation, thus relieving pain. Apply an ice pack for about 5-10 minutes after the heat treatment, and then switch between the two.

, They can be used to help with the pain of muscle spasms in your jaw that result from tetanus, but receiving tetanus immune globulin and professional medical support is key as well.

Talk in person, if possible.,
Listen in an active manner.,
Explain what upsets you.,
Avoid aggressive language.,
Compliment the person.,
Let your coworker have the final word.",How to Build Bridges With a Co Worker You Don't Like1," We communicate a lot of information through tone, gesture, and facial expression. All of this is lost in email. Accordingly, something meant to be funny could come across as hostile in an email. If possible, try to communicate in person or over the phone.


Leave email for very short communications—three sentences or less. Keep emails factual.;
, Effective listening can reduce tension. It also will help you find commonality with a difficult colleague. To be effective, listening must be active. You cannot passively sit as someone talks. Instead, try the following:Restate what someone has just said. This will affirm that you are listening to the person.
Ask if you understand them correctly. Say, “Did I understand you right?”
Sit with an “open” body style. Don’t cross your arms or legs. Instead, face the person you are talking with.
Understand that you aren’t endorsing someone’s point of view simply by recognizing it. After you have shown you understand the other person, they may be more willing to listen to you.

, If your coworker does something in particular that you don’t like, you should tell them. Be honest.For example, someone might make jokes about you being a redhead. You should tell them this upsets you.


Don’t call them out in front of other people, which might only cause them to deny what they have been doing. Instead, go to their office during a quiet time of the day.
Try to stay calm as you talk. People can become defensive if they feel like they are being attacked.
Get to the point. Say, “Jeff, I hate it when you make redhead jokes. Can you joke about something different?”
You may be terrified to confront the person. Unfortunately, they are unlikely to stop on their own.

, You should avoid accusing someone of bad behavior. Instead, focus on how someone makes you feel.It’s harder for someone to disagree with you when you focus on your feelings.


For example, don’t say, “Jeff, you’re always so hostile. Why don’t you start being nicer?”
Instead, you can say, “Jeff, I feel six inches tall when you talk to me like that.” Remember to use “I” statements., Identify the person’s good qualities. Usually, a coworker has at least a few good traits. By complimenting them on their good qualities, you can encourage them to minimize bad behaviors.For example, Megan might be abrasive but always gets her work done on time. You can say, “Megan, thank God you’re here! I know I can count on you to get this finished on time!”
Similarly, Jeff might erupt in anger if you don’t finish something on time. However, he could be great when dealing with angry customers. You can say, “Jeff, I wish I had your patience with people. We should talk about how you stay so calm.” This kind of statement might make Jeff think before he erupts in anger again.

, When having a conversation with someone you can’t stand, let them get in the last word. This lets them think they are in control, which may make them easier to deal with."

Select a goal you can commit to.,
Pick something that brings you satisfaction.,
Choose goals that match your values.,
Choose something that plays up your strengths.,
Set short-term, immediate goals.",How to Become an Optimally Functioning Person1," It’s been said that practicing for 10,000 hours on something will help you perfect a skill. If you can’t put in that kind of effort, you’ll likely fail. Therefore, choose something that you’re willing to put in time and effort to work towards.


For example, you’ll need a lot of time to train if you want to run a marathon. You can’t expect to run for a week and then have the endurance or physical strength to make it 26.2 miles (42.2 km). You’ll need to give yourself time in order to achieve that goal.;
, You may as well feel good about yourself if you’re going to put in all that time and effort to become an optimally functioning person. Choose to work on something that makes you feel good about yourself.


Perhaps choose something you’ve always wanted to achieve. You could also work towards helping your community, a talent you’ve wanted to showcase, or just something that helps you become the best version of yourself overall., Values are the ideas and beliefs that drive your life. This may seem like a no-brainer, but you're more likely to stick to a goal if you actually believe in it. Think about your personal values and then build goals that go in line with them.


For example, if you value family, you might have difficulty achieving your goal if it always pulls you away from your loved ones. Make sure your goals support your values instead of pushing against them., It's nice to set goals that help you improve on your weaknesses, but you're more likely to enjoy and commit to goals that focus on your strengths. Pay attention to the things you're really good at. Build your goals around these strengths.


For example, you might set a goal to master something you are already good at, such as a certain sport, a specific subject, or a favorite hobby. Working towards becoming better at something you are already good at can make your goals more achievable., Challenge yourself each week to get you closer to your goal. Set time aside each day to work on that task. Write down what you’ve done each day to hold yourself accountable. Long-term goals are necessary, too, but more immediate goals help you build healthy habits and boost self-confidence.

For instance, you might have a long-term goal of starting a business. A more immediate short-term goal might be to learn bookkeeping or marketing, which will help you achieve the long-term goal.
Don’t beat yourself up too much if you miss one day. Simply get back to it the next day and try to stay on track as best as possible."

Understand social behavior spread: Behaviors, physical and mental, are social contagions, meaning they spread from one person to the next.,
Mind the eating habits taken home from work: Nutrition habits can also spread past the workplace.,
Have a best friend with the same goal: At work, this can especially influence your diet.,
Aim for a healthy work culture: A company’s culture is also highly influential.,
Practice mindfulness: Try practicing mindful eating.,
Establish new habits: For example, you can agree to eat half a donut because, one, you will eat less, and two, you will start a new habit of self-control.,
Eliminate cues you associate with appetite: Cravings are situational, meaning they don’t always follow you everywhere you go.",How to Break Eating Habits at Work," This is especially true for social networks like the workplace. For better or worse, this also means that your job can impact your diet. Innate to you is the tendency to imitate others, a trait believed to help us form social groups for security (1). This spread of behaviors may prompt you to mimic food habits and emotions of other employees, causing unintentional weight gain or emotional eating.;
, Even on a worldwide scale, people can be influenced to eat poorly, as is the case today.

, Close friends who adopt healthy habits together, for example, are more likely to maintain them than those who don’t have support. So if you plan to eat well, ask a work friend to join you. On the flip side, a 32 year-long study concluded that ""A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval , 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval"" (2).

, For example, managers who support health programs can improve the stress, exercise and eating habits within their companies. If your workplace offers wellness benefits, take advantage of them to support your diet. Your participation can also encourage others to join.

, For example, if you see a donut, pause to ask yourself if you really need it. If it’s too tempting, you can still make other mindful decisions as a tool for eating control (3).

, Likewise, you and your friend can take the donuts (or other food item) outside and go for a walk, combining a new exercise routine with a guilty pleasure. Really, there are plenty of ways to learn mindfulness at the office, the point being to practice thought and build new behaviors with food.

, While you may have donuts with coworkers, you might avoid them at home. You can, for example, avoid seeing your coworkers with donuts or other cravings by eating in a separate break room. The trick is to hunt for the cues that spark your unwanted eating. Today, careers that destine you for an early grave tend to pay more, but I would challenge you to make health your number one job. After all, jobs are replaceable — your body is not.

Don't be overconfident.,

Don't get overly emotional, proud, hurt or angry.",How to Behave Professionally," The first thing that a stranger sees in you is your outward personality (your first impression) but not just your good looks and charms. So always have a winning personality that everyone seeks. Joining personality development programs is a good idea to develop your personality.;
, Don't go around telling everyone how you survived Antarctica barefoot or how you climbed the Mt. Everest without using an oxygen cylinder. It's good to boast a little with your close friends and family but not with everyone. They'll just think that you're a show-off. Let them talk about their achievements, so that you have equal right to then establish your status. You must not be a self-centered person, but let other people express their views.

, Don't talk about you and your life only. Let others tell you about themselves, and listen to them. It's a very good and professional habit to show interest in what they're saying. Never ignore them while they're speaking either.


It is not a good idea to interrupt the person who is speaking because one may get irritated. Plan the input you would like to make, and find the right time to do so.
Hopefully, this person will want to keep the conversation interactive, but remember, don't go off the topic when disturbing their presentation or point of view.

, It simply means wear clothes similar in style to others in the office or work space. The clothes may match your personality but don't overdo it.


It is also a good idea to make your own signature style regarding dress. For example, Steve Jobs wore his turtle neck, Levis jeans and white shoes in each and every keynote and public appearances.

, Make your style professional looking, wearing deodorant, light cologne, perfume, etc. Make sure that your appearance does not reflect immaturity.

, Maintain culturally appropriate eye contact with people who are talking to you; don't make faces and don't stare too much either, doing this makes the speaker think that you respect him but are not intimidated by him.

, No matter how hyped the product is, getting overexcited just displays immaturity. If someone has a product that you've been waiting to buy, don't beg them to give it to you a few moments sooner. Keep your calm and your excitement under control.

, Don't talk too much with people unless it's about sharing valuable ideas with the other people. Be sure to talk with logical, good sense. People should think that you are social but not too talkative.

, Remember, while you are talking less, with clear sense, be sure to talk formally as well. Speaking informally (lots of ""like"" ""y'know"" etc.)will leave a bad impression on other people, especially if you are just getting to know a person.


Remember not to have the ""holier than thou"" and the ""know it all"" attitude; it just puts people off.

, You must be updated with the latest world of fashion and technology and learn to walk with the modern times. Always accessorize yourself professionally.

, If someone asks for a necessary help, then please help them, but if a person shows up with a task which he/she can easily do but is unwilling to, then ask the person: ""Can you do it for yourself?"", but don't make unnecessary, judgmental comments or demands.

, If you have several skills or talents, be best at it and never ever try to imitate others. You must always have a great deal of competence so that others will likely notice your professionalism.

, Be it rich or poor, a CEO or regular staff, your grandpa or the garbage collector, you must respect everybody that you encounter. You must respect all jobs and talk to everybody with equal respect. Slowly, when people start noticing this trait, you'll be respected.

, When you make a promise to somebody, then make sure you keep it. Doing this will make the person think that you are reliable and honest, a trait which will boost your professionalism.

, Time should mean a lot to you. Always be on time for meetings, whether it is with your friends or your clients. Your punctuality will be remembered by other people, as being late drastically lowers the respect that other people have for you.

, Do not show a grin, snarl or grimace. If some work or project is given to you, then don't grin, or seem overly proud; just put your head up with a very slight smile (or anything else that makes people realize that you are okay with the work and the responsibility). You can also show this confidence at home, work or even on a date.

, Bring out factual information--citing a quote, offering, bringing forward evidence or support--for your position. It will influence the person to whom you are telling a quote. But these examples must be related to what you all are talking about. Not trying to do so will just make you appear to be uninterested in the conversation.

, Even if it's a funeral, or your friend's Nobel acceptance speech, keep things simple, and go for a firm handshake to congratulate each. Stay silent at funerals of acquaintances or distant relatives, with no obvious tears rolling down the cheeks; otherwise people may think that you are way too emotional to act professionally in all circumstances.

Know what Aerospace Engineering is.,
Develop sound math, physics and drafting skills in high school.,
Develop sound analytical skills.,
Apply for a degree in Aerospace Engineering.,
Consider other fields of engineering.,
Try to complete a summer Co-op or internship.,
Decide about attending graduate school.,
Keep a correct mindset in the workplace.,
Maintain the standards of ethical behavior and hard work while pursuing this degree.",How to Become an Aerospace Engineer," Before deciding on an Aerospace Engineering degree, be aware of what it entails. Read online resources, scientific journals and speak with knowledgable people to learn.;
, Aerospace Engineering requires advanced math, physics, numerical method skills and excellent spatial abilities. Examples are gravitation, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, thermodynamics, material science and strength of materials, among others. High school is the best time to begin developing the foundations for these skills.

, An analytical mindset is a requisite for a career in Aerospace Engineering as is the ability to solve complex problems using analytical techniques, using concrete or intuitive methods. Playing mental games like crosswords, chess and other strategy games helps.

, Apply for a degree in Aerospace Engineering at as many universities as possible. This gives you options when acceptance letters arrive. Make sure each university you apply to is ABET accredited. Most employers will not recognize degrees from universities that are not.

, There are not many universities that offer a degree in Aerospace Engineering. To broaden your options, research and consider other engineering disciplines such as Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering. Other engineering degrees like Electrical Engineering are excellent but require an entirely different toolbox to be successful.

, Once you are halfway through your sophomore year at the university, it is a good time to apply for a Co-Op or internship position. This allows you to gain exposure to the professional environment and some exposure to the concrete, technical aspects of the job. Employers recognize this experience as invaluable. You also have the opportunity to get good professional references and begin your professional networking early. This experience will give you a competitive advantage which is particularly important during times of economic difficulties.

, Graduate school can be helpful for your career but can also be a huge pitfall. Those in the industry understand that a student who continues straight through to a masters degree, before entering the workplace, are at a serious disadvantage even though they will garner a higher salary. The problem is that universities no longer tie the academic masters work to the real world. A student who comes straight in with a masters degree will have a high, often misplaced idea of their capabilities and worth to the company. However, those students who either pursue their masters and a career at the same time or wait a couple of years before pursuing it, are generally able to put academic concepts in their proper place in the real world they will have to work in. Keep this in mind.

, As you go through the process of obtaining your degree, it is easy to take the exceptionally good mindset you have developed for school and assume that it should continue into the workplace. It will not work, it is necessary to change your mindset to accommodate the needs of your employer(s). Understand that you are obtaining a degree in order to make money that allows you and your family to have a good life. To do this, you have to generate money for your company so they can satisfy their shareholders (a good rule of thumb is that you need to generate three times your salary, annually, for the company to be profitable). Done right, everyone makes money and is happy. At this time in your life you are fairly idealistic and this may not sit well with you. It is reality and adjusting to it while at the university is in your best interest.

, Your degree is a feather in your hat. You will find that after you graduate, when you let people know you are an Aerospace Engineer, people will respond with respect and will look up to it. It is indeed a feather in your cap and everyone recognizes it. Work hard and work smart and you will become one. And then it is up to you to maintain the standard that encourages people to respect Aerospace Engineers.

Watch how other people build bridges.,
Volunteer to work on a project together.,
Seek out opportunities to interact more.,
Make small talk.,
Find points in common.,
Connect outside of work.,
Identify a common enemy.,
Build your bridges slowly.",How to Build Bridges With a Co Worker You Don't Like2," Does your enemy get along well with other coworkers? Watch to see how they interact.Then try to adapt your own interactions so that you can work better together.


You might discover that a colleague’s bluntness is actually a dry sense of humor which other people find funny. Although you might not find them funny, you can at least recognize that they aren’t being mean.
Mimic how other people interact with your difficult colleague. If they ask about the colleagues’ children, show your interest by also asking about them.

, Another way to build a relationship is to stop avoiding the person. Jump on a project they are currently heading, or volunteer to sit on a committee that they are a part of. The only way to build bridges is to actually see and speak to each other.


Put forth your best effort on the project. You want to build trust with your coworker.You should be a reliable team player. When you finish a task, ask what else you can do to help.
Be available whenever the person calls or stops by your office. Put aside whatever you’re working on and focus on them. They will appreciate your attentions.
Remember to tell you coworker that you trust their judgment., No matter how busy you are, there should be opportunities to get to know people at work. Look for chances to interact with your difficult coworker. Consider the following opportunities:Ride the same train or bus to and from work. You can talk casually on the ride.
Take a walk together during your break.
Eat lunch together. You might want to have lunch in a group at first, which can make you both feel more comfortable.

, When you see an opening to talk with your enemy, say “hello” in the friendliest manner possible. Then move onto some small talk, which is polite conversation on non-controversial subjects—the weather, what people have been doing, etc. Small talk is a good way to fill silence and forge a tentative connection.


A good strategy is to ask open-ended questions.If you feel nervous or don’t know what to say, ask your difficult coworker what they did over the weekend. Try to ask questions that don’t have a “yes” or “no” answer.
After the person answers, you should answer, too. It can feel like an interrogation if all you do is ask questions.
Maintain a positive energy. Smile and know how to laugh at yourself. Your enemy might be as intimidated by you as you are by them.

, You can develop a relationship by finding out what you have in common with your enemy. For example, do you both have children? Are you both married? Do you enjoy the same hobbies? Look at the person’s social media to find out details about their life.


Avoid pretending to have something in common. For example, don’t fake being a New England Patriots fan simply because your enemy follows the team closely. Sooner or later they’ll figure out you were lying, and they will probably resent you for it.

, We are more than our working selves. Try to see your enemy as a person by spending some time together outside the office. You might find out that they are completely different when away from the stressful work environment.


It might be difficult at first approaching someone you dislike. However, think about activities you can do in a group. For example, you might organize a group of coworkers to go get drinks after work or organize a softball game over the weekend.
Remember to always stay on your best behavior. Although you are in a social setting, people are still judging you.Always remain friendly to your enemy.

, Nothing brings two people closer together than having a common source of hatred. Instead of hating each other, hate something else.Avoid hating another person—if you hate another coworker, you’ve only created a new enemy for yourself.


Instead, hate the economy or the President or your state’s Governor. Find something larger than your employer to hate.
Hate growing old or gaining weight. This common enemy can open the door for doing activities together—for example, meeting up at the company gym once a week to lift weights.

, It’s difficult to turn a relationship around overnight. In fact, you should be skeptical if someone goes from hating you to loving you in a short period of time. Realize that it can take months or years to really develop a healthy relationship.


Nevertheless, you can’t get water from a stone. If you aren’t getting anywhere, you might need to cut your losses. At best, you’ll try to survive in the same office—at least until one of you leaves for a new job.

"
"
Gain some perspective.,
Identify why the person triggers you.,
Limit face time.,
Report the person to HR, if necessary.",How to Build Bridges With a Co Worker You Don't Like3," You can’t become friends with everyone at the workplace, regardless of your best intentions. At best, you can remain civil and tolerate each other. Recognize that people have different values.By acknowledging these differences, you can look at the situation neutrally.


Try to put your failure to build bridges in perspective.Is it that big of a deal? Do you intend to stay at the business much longer?

, Some people might rub us the wrong way because they remind us of someone we don’t like outside of work.For example, a co-worker could remind you of your mother in law or step-father.


Alternately, your coworker could have flaws that you identify in yourself.Maybe you are secretly overly-critical of other people. By forgiving the other person, you forgive yourself for your weaknesses.
By identifying the reason you don’t like someone, you can cope more effectively. You might realize your coworker isn’t intentionally doing anything to annoy you—this is just how the person is.

, Keep conversations as brief as possible. Nevertheless, remember to remain cordial and polite so that you don’t cause any unnecessary tension.Think through what you want to say ahead of time so that you don’t ramble when you’re standing in front of the person.


Also choose the communication method they prefer. If they want an email, send an email.Communicating with their preferred method helps limit face time.
You can also try to communicate through another person as much as possible. Ask your secretary to call your enemy’s secretary to schedule appointments or obtain required information.

, In spite of your best intentions, your enemy might continue to attack or undermine you. You might be left with no choice but to go to HR and report the person for harassment or bullying.For this reason, it is best if you never retaliated against your enemy. Hopefully you didn’t stoop to their level and counterattack them.
You can write a complaint letter to HR. However, you might want to talk to your direct supervisor first, unless it is your supervisor who is harassing you.

Conduct some research.,
Break the goal down into smaller parts.,
Set a deadline.,
Find ways to track your progress.",How to Become an Optimally Functioning Person2," If you are well-informed about your goal, you have a better chance of accomplishing it. So, before you develop an action plan for your goals, spend some time learning what you will have to do to reach them.For example, if you set a goal to get accepted into college, you might conduct some research on this goal. From your research, you might learn that you need to keep your GPA high in high school, pass a college entrance exam, and participate in extracurricular activities.

, Once you've done your research, it's time to map out your goal. The best way to do this is by dividing it into smaller parts. This makes your goal more doable, and helps you build energy to keep going.For example, if you set a goal to lose 40 pounds, you might set miniature milestones for every five pounds lost.

, The most effective goals are time-sensitive, meaning you have a clear deadline. You won't be as motivated to reach your goal if it has an open end date. Set a realistic but challenging deadline for your goal and stick to it., How will you know when you cross the finish line for your goal? For some goals, the end point is obvious--for others, not so much. That's why it's important to measure your progress as you move along. How you track your progress will depend on your goal and your personal preferences.For instance, if you are trying to save money by a certain date, you can track your progress by using a savings account that tells you your current balance. If you are trying to lose weight, you can track your weight and measurements at intervals (like every week or two) in an app like MyFitnessPal.
You can also draw out a chart that shows your steady progress towards the goal.

"

Get some accountability.,
Take care of difficult tasks first.,
Get rid of negative language.,
Stop worrying about what others think of you.,
Envision your success often.,
Support your mental health.,
Improve your physical health and fitness.,
Be selective with your relationships.,
Seek professional help for emotional issues.",How to Become an Optimally Functioning Person3," To be an optimally functioning person, you will want to stay on track with your goals. You have a better chance of doing that if you're not the only one holding yourself accountable. Reach out to a friend or family member who can help you stick with your goals.

It will be even more fun if the person you reach out to is interested in the same goal. For example, you and a buddy might set personal goals to workout more in the gym together. If someone's counting on you, you're more likely to stick with it.

, Delaying is a recipe for disaster. The longer you put something off, the more excuses you’ll have to never get started. Get up each day and get started on your toughest task within an hour of waking.If you tackle the hardest task right away, you can go through the remainder of your day knowing that you have been somewhat productive. Plus, once you do the hardest task, you will feel more capable of taking on others.

, No one can make you feel as bad about yourself as you can. You know your insecurities better than anyone. That little voice in your head can make you feel low, but you’ll need to silence it if you want to be the best you can be.


Start by removing certain words from your vocabulary. Eliminating words like “can’t,” “won’t,” “never,” and “always” can help you move towards a more positive ""can-do"" mindset., The fear of criticism from others can stop you from being the best person you can be. Tell yourself it doesn’t matter what others think about you. You are in control of your happiness and if you are happy, that’s what is important.


Also realize that people probably don’t care as much as you think they do. You may think they are concerned about every detail of your life, when in reality, they are only thinking about themselves., Imagine yourself reaching your goal. Envision yourself crossing the finish line, getting your dream job, or building that community center you’ve always wanted to. Remember how you felt when you imagined reaching your goals and refer back to them if you become discouraged.Start a daily habit of setting aside a few minutes each morning to visualizing your goals being reached. Try to activate all your senses and make your visions as real as possible.

, Being of sound mind can increase your chances of becoming the optimally functioning person you want to be. Stress can make you start doubting yourself, so take measures to keep stress at bay.Support your mental health by practicing mindfulness meditation. Journal to understand your thoughts and feelings. Start a stress-relief toolbox with activities like deep breathing, light reading, or taking a walk outside. Take time each day to do something you enjoy.

, Well-adjusted people are physically healthy and fit. This will give you enough energy to cope with daily stress, and other physical demands. Remember, you will also need to be willing to change unhealthy physical behaviors and habits in order to improve.Exercise at least 30 minutes on most days of the week with activities like running, swimming, or weight training. Eat a balanced diet of real foods such as whole grains, lean protein, fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats.

, Don't settle for toxic or negative people who make you doubt your abilities. Settle for no less than happy, positive people who value you and what you bring to the table.


Get your distance from unhealthy relationships in favor of those who support you and help you to grow., If self-doubt prevents you from reaching your goals, it may be necessary to reach out for help. A mental health counselor or therapist can help you identify the barriers that are keeping you stuck so that you can stop self-doubt and achieve your goals."

Block off some recreation/renewal time.,
Block off study times.",How to Build a Study Schedule for Adult Learners2," Be aware that this step is the most difficult one for many adult students. When you are working, going to school, and maintaining other adult responsibilities, it seems ridiculous to plan some fun, but relaxation and renewal are vitally important to your performing at your best. Research demonstrates that students perform better when they give themselves a few renewing breaks through the week.Of course, you cannot allot this too much time, but a 15 to 30 minute bike ride or walk each every day can go a long way to helping you better focus and perform on school work.

, Most students mistakenly think this is the first step but it's the last step because you need to make sure you can really study at the times you block off.


Gather all your class syllabi and make sure you know what is expected in each class.
Until you know how much time you personally are going to need to study various subjects, a good rule of thumb is to plan 3 hours of study for each hour you are in a lecture (especially for your tough classes). If you have 3 hours of lecture, then you need to plan 9 hours of study a week. (Note: you will notice that taking a full class load means that you need to study almost 40 hours a week, so be careful how many classes you carry each term!)
Decide which is going to be your most difficult class and decide how many hours a week you need to devote to that class.
Look at your open times on the 'Working Plan' and decide when you will be at your best. Put study times for the difficult class into your 'best' times.
Now, block in the study times for your other classes.
Mark all times as study and list the topic, for example, ""Study Statistics.""

"
"
Take a moment and review your Working Plan.,
Take your Weekly Calendar and fill in each week for the term.,
Add in any unique events that will happen during the term, for example, a wedding or a doctor's appointment.

,
Take your syllabi and add any major assignment due dates or scheduled exams to your ""Class"" times.,
Look at each major assignment or exam on your Weekly Schedule.",How to Build a Study Schedule for Adult Learners3," Ask yourself:


Have you forgotten anything?
Are you giving yourself travel time?
Are you being realistic about your study times?
Are there small breaks between items where you could plan to do small amounts of study, for example, you could plan to review your notes during the half-hour between between one class and travel to pick up your kids or can you study while waiting on your child to finish a practice if you have materials with you (using digital materials can make this easier to do). Mark ""Study ____"" at those times.

,


Copy all your fixed, daily living, recreation times, and study times into this calendar for the duration of the college term.
Some students find it helpful to color code certain items to help them remember, for example you might highlight the short study times you've identified between major activities, so that they jump out when you look at the calendar.

,,


Be sure to know when your final exam is planned. Many schools hold finals at a different day and time than class meetings, so do not miss adding the correct day and time for all finals.

,


Will you need to plan extra time in the weeks leading up to that assignment or exam to prepare for it?
Working backward from the due date, decide when you need to begin and what you need to do in order to meet the due date, for example add ""research"" times three weeks before a paper is due.
Add these items to your calendar.

"
"
Each weekend, look at the week ahead and make a plan specific to that week.,
Keep true to your timetable.,
Consistently ask yourself if the Study Plan is working.",How to Build a Study Schedule for Adult Learners4,"


What is due this week and next?
Do you need to make any changes to your original study plan?
Jot down on each ""Study time"" what you plan to cover, for example, Monday at 4:30 pm you already had written ""Study Statistics.""  From reviewing what is due, you see that Chapter 4 homework is due by Friday. So, on the 4:30 Monday study time, you would add the note ""CH 4 HW.""
By taking time over the weekend to identify what you need to do during each study time, you will save yourself a lot of time during your busy week. When you are running fast from work to school and sit down in the library at 4:30 for an hour of study before class, you can quickly look at the calendar and pull out chapter 4 of the statistics book and you do not have to spend 10 or more minutes trying to remember what is due.

, Just as you would not blow-off an appointment with someone important, then do not blow off your study times with yourself. You and your education goals are just as important as other commitments in your life.

, Do not hesitate to change your ""Working Plan"" if it is not meeting your study needs.

Choose a Type of Celebrity


Actors and rock stars are not the only ones who need personal assistants.,
Develop Your Skills


CPAs need to know a little bit about everything, and know where to find out more.,
Get Some Training


There is currently no formal long-term education program to become a personal assistant, but you can develop many of the necessary skills in related programs, such as computer courses, household management courses (for butlers and household managers) and event planning courses offered by community colleges.,
Get Some Experience


One great way to learn the skills of being a celebrity personal assistant is to be a non-celebrity PA first.,
Find a Job Opening


Networking is an important first step: let everyone know that you are a CPA who is looking for work.,
Contact a Celebrity


Although you may not speak with the celebrities themselves, you can usually get in touch with their publicist, agent or even their current personal assistant.,
Avoid Common Mistakes


It would be great if you could just strike up a conversation with someone like an agent and get an immediate referral to a celebrity.,
Join an Agency


Most CPAs agree that this is a great inroad into the industry.,
Ace the Interview


According to Jonathan Holiff, former personal assistant to several celebrities, ""Assuming you have the skills and the temperament, it really comes down to a personality match."",
Join Professional Organizations

There are professional organizations that assist celebrity personal assistants with their career development.",How to Become a Celebrity Personal Assistant," You could decide to assist professional athletes, politicians, directors, bestselling authors, wealthy families, motivational speakers, dot-com millionaires… basically anyone with enough money can hire someone to be a personal assistant. It's probably best to work for someone in a field you're interested in, because the more you know, the more you have to offer. Potential employers will find you more appealing as a new hire.;
, Celebrities are currently looking for internet-savvy, technologically competent employees who can show them how to transfer information from their palm pilot to the computer, send an e-greeting to Mom, or keep track of their personal finances.






Most celebrities are also interested in your typing skills, etiquette knowledge, and party planning or gift buying ability. Above all, celebrities need to know that you will not reveal their intimate secrets to the National Enquirer, so make sure you get used to practicing the art of discretion as well.

, Find some good information sources on the internet that provide free how-to information, resources and useful links for Executive Personal Assistants - do a search on personal assistant tips and advice. Beware of ""consultants"" who claim to have celebrity personal assistant experience. Be sure to browse their website to look for proof that they are who they say.

, You may even discover that being a personal assistant to a non-celebrity is more your speed if you really enjoy organizing but don’t like the stress of the celebrity lifestyle.

, Think about all of the people you know, family and friends alike. In that vast network, is there anyone who is closer to a celebrity than you are? You can also meet celebrities through volunteering, working as a production assistant on a movie set, and job listings.

, Even if they aren't looking for an assistant immediately, they may have an opening in the future or know someone who does. There are many books and websites available that list addresses and contact information for celebrities.

, However, most people who are starting out don’t find it easy to say the right things off the top of their head. This is when having a script can be a tremendous help. A script is simply an outline of what you want to say. To sound like a professional avoid disclosing too much personal information about yourself, sounding too eager, or mentioning that you are hoping to launch your own showbiz career. Instead, focus on what you have to offer the celebrity.

, Once you’ve located one (more than a dozen agencies are listed in the FabJob Guide to Become a Celebrity Personal Assistant), send a brief email query asking who you should contact about becoming a CPA for one of their clients. Sign up with as many agencies as possible. According to Brian Daniel, owner of www.findcelebrityjobs.com, an agency can't help you all that much. You have a better chance of landing a job on your own because employers don't like paying the huge placement fees that agencies charge.

, You will more than likely have to go through a number of interviews before you get to meet your celebrity. Don’t let it faze you; just be honest and direct with everyone you meet. And when you meet your celebrity? Don't gush. Concentrate on being professional and establishing an immediate rapport with them.

, Once you start working as a CPA, you will be able to join these organizations and they will become an invaluable source of support and information.

Give a good interview.",How to Become an Environmental Scientist," You'll need at least a bachelor's degree (and may need a master's as well) to work as an environmental scientist, but you can get a head start on your career path by taking relevant courses in high school.Some relevant high school courses to take include:


laboratory sciences (biology, chemistry, and physics)
earth science, environmental science, or geology (if available at your school)
mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus)
statistics and computer science;
, Most entry-level jobs in environmental science require you to have earned a minimum of a bachelor's degree. Some schools offer a generalized environmental science degree, but most employers will accept a degree in any science-related field.Look for programs in either environmental science, or in a scientific field like biology, chemistry, geosciences, or engineering.
Search online for four-year college programs. You can search by program or by location, if where you study is an important factor.

, Internships are not necessarily a requirement to graduate or become an environmental scientist, but they provide you with invaluable experience and industry contacts.You can find internships online or by talking to professors and guidance counselors at your school.


The Student Conservation Association (SCA) provides many internship opportunities in all areas of environmental studies.Look for internship opportunities that include working with computer modeling, data analysis, and geographic information systems (GIS). Having experience in these areas of study will help qualify you for many additional jobs, and may give you an advantage when it comes time to apply for jobs., Whether you major in environmental science or a scientific field, it's important to do well in your studies. Some employers require a master's or doctoral degree, in which case your grades and GPA may affect your eligibility. Make sure you've studied hard, done your best, and pursued any opportunities available outside the classroom.

, For many entry-level jobs, you'll only need a bachelor's degree and some amount of relevant experience. However, if you want to advance at your job or become better-qualified for other positions, you may need to earn a master's degree. If you want to teach science classes at either the high school or college levels, you will absolutely need a master's degree, and if you want to perform university research you may need a PhD.You can learn about master's and doctoral programs in your area or in other parts of the country by searching online. As you research various graduate school programs, look for statistics like graduation rate, job placement rate, and publications by alumni.
Be aware that a master's degree in Biology or Environmental Science will generally take two to three years, and a doctoral degree will take considerably longer. However, the number of job opportunities, potential for advancement, and potential for a higher salary that accompany a graduate degree may make the time and money spent on a master's degree or PhD worth it.

, There are six primary career paths within environmental science, though of course there are many other related options, depending on your degree.Each career path involves many individual jobs in a variety of settings. The main career paths are:


agriculture - involves studying the science of sustainable agriculture and the impact it has on the environment. Common jobs within this career path include agronomist, range manager, and horticulturalist.
earth science - involves studying and preserving some specialized aspect of an ecosystem. Common jobs within this career path include hydrologist, soil scientist, and climatologist.
education - involves teaching science and environmental courses to students. While a high school teacher or college professor may be the first jobs that come to mind, there are numerous other possible jobs within this field, including park ranger/interpretive ranger, and environmental law enforcement officer.
life science - typically involves studying living organisms and their roles within an ecosystem. Common jobs within this path include ecologist, wildlife biologist, and forester.
physical science - involves studying specific aspects of an ecosystem and ensuring the health and sustainability of that ecosystem. Common jobs include water quality analyst, natural resource manager, and environmental compliance inspector.
planning and surveying - involves the study of landscapes and ecosystems to determine a sustainable way to build or work within that ecosystem. Common jobs include urban planner, surveyor/cartographer, and turf scientist.

, Depending on the career path and job you're most interested in, you have many options as far as which employers to work for.There are many opportunities at all levels of employment for someone with a degree and experience in environmental science, including:


private sector - working as a consultant, researcher, or outdoor laborer.
public sector - working for government agencies, including the Department of Interior or Department of Agriculture, as well as state or city agencies like colleges and universities.
non-profit organizations - working for environmental advocacy groups like the Environmental Defense Fund, Clean Water Action, Student Conservation Association, or the Sierra Club.

, One of the best ways to choose a career path is by talking to people who work across a variety of environmental fields. You should begin with talking to your professors (both current and former) and internship coordinators. However, you can expand outward and talk with researchers, park rangers/environmental law enforcement officers, private environmental consultants, and non-profit organization workers. This will give you a broader understanding of what specific jobs are available, and the pros and cons of those job options.


If you don't currently know anyone in an environmental field, find someone working in a relevant field near you and reach out to that person. Send a polite, professional email explaining that you're a student or recent graduate trying to gain a better understanding of what career options are available within the environmental field. Or try asking your professors if they have any contacts they can put you in touch with.

, Your resume is the first thing a potential employer sees when you apply to a position. It can make or break your chances of getting an interview, so it's important to write a strong, compelling resume that will highlight your best strengths and achievements.


Put your name and contact information at the top of the page. It should be perfectly clear to an employer who is applying for the job and how to contact that person.List your education first, in reverse-chronological order (most recent degree first). If you scored well and/or earned any honors (such as graduating cum laude, etc.), list those honors and your impressive GPA under the degree you earned.Include relevant skills and experience to illustrate that you've succeeded in similar endeavors in the past. This helps show an employer that you are capable of meeting the desired skills for that position. If you're fresh out of school and don't have very much experience yet, you may want to include a section on relevant coursework to show the extent of your studies and how that knowledge would translate well to your new career.
Detail your work experience in reverse-chronological order. You may want to list relevant work experience first, then have a separate section for additional work experience.

, A curriculum vitae (CV) is essentially a resume for working in academia. It highlights your academic accomplishments, including any relevant work experience.If you want to work in academia, either as a professor or as a researcher, you will most likely need to compose a CV instead of a resume.


Include your name and contact information at the top, just as you would for a resume.
Mention your specific area(s) of academic interest.
List your education history, including degrees (both earned and in-progress), schools/institutions, major or concentration, and year of graduation. These should be listed in reverse-chronological order.
List any awards you've earned, either academic or professional, in reverse-chronological order. You should also include any grants you were awarded and any honors you graduated with. Include the dates of those awards/grants/honors and any relevant information that a prospective employer may need to know about each award.
Detail your publication and presentation history. List any published articles, essays, or books, and any presentations you've given at conferences. If there are a lot of both presentations and publications, you can create a separate section for each.
Include a section on employment history, listed in reverse-chronological order. You can also include any relevant volunteer work, laboratory or field experiences, and teaching experience, or compose separate sections for each type of work experience if you have an extensive record in each category.
List any professional or scholarly organizations with which you are a member.
Include a section for your list of references. This should include any individuals who will be writing letters of recommendation for you, but may include other employers or long-term coworkers as well. Be sure to include each reference's contact information, and make sure it's okay for you to name that person as a reference by checking with him/her ahead of time., Not every job requires an actual reference letter, but most jobs will ask for a list of references. It's important that you choose carefully when compiling your list of references, as these individuals will have to speak to both your work ethic and your talents/skills.


If you've participated in any internships, ask your internship leader/supervisor if he or she would be willing to provide you with a job reference.Talk to former employers or coworkers from relevant jobs you've worked in the past. Just be sure that you choose employers with whom you ended on good terms.
If you're fresh out of college, reach out to your favorite professors or teaching assistants. You want someone who can speak to your interest and dedication to the field of environmental studies, so be sure that your teacher/TA will remember you and is willing to provide you with a professional reference.

, There are many places to search for environmental science jobs. You may want to begin by asking your professors and current/former coworkers if they know of any professional openings that you might be qualified for. If you don't have any network contacts, that's okay - simply search online.


You can typically search for jobs based on location, job title/career path, agency/employer, salary, or education/experience requirements.
Look into placement programs for recent graduates. Some prestigious placement programs include Environmental Career Programs (through the Environmental Protection Agency), the Presidential Management Fellow Program, and the Pathways Program.Search through career-specific job sites. Some websites to consider include EcoEmploy, Earthworks, Green Dream Jobs, and Greenbiz.Follow the application requirements closely, including the deadline for applying. Be sure that your application includes all supplemental materials requested by the employer.

, If your resume and application materials impress an employer, you may be called back for an interview. This is your chance to make a good impression, and you'll want to conduct yourself professionally and competently.


Dress appropriately. Women should wear a business suit or a professional-looking skirt and blouse with minimal jewelry and cosmetics.Men should wear a two-piece matching suit and tie, with well-groomed hair and facial hair (if relevant - if you do not have facial hair, be sure to be clean-shaved for your interview).Research the company before the interview. Know what the company does, what your job would entail, and memorize the interviewer's or interviewers' name(s). Be sure to address the interviewer by the proper title (Dr./Mr./Ms.) and his/her last name (for example, Doctor Ramos).Arrive 10 to 15 minutes early. Arriving late shows a careless or disrespectful attitude. If you are running late for reasons outside your control (traffic or a car accident, for example), call the office and let the interviewer or his/her secretary know that you will be late due to unforeseen circumstances. You'll want to apologize for any delays both on the phone and in person when you arrive.
Bring at least one extra resume to the interview.
Be confident and avoid using poor language, slang terms, or pause words like ""uh"" or ""um"".
Highlight your achievements and accomplishments, but don't brag.
Be honest about your academic and professional background. If you're unsure about some aspect of your work experience and the interviewer asks about it, be polite but direct - say something like, ""I'm honestly not sure about that. When I worked in that department, my job primarily focused on _____.""
Illustrate the research you've done on the organization you're interviewing with by relating your answers to some aspect of that organization. If the interviewer asks if you've got any questions at the end, you can cater your question(s) to some aspect of the business to show you've taken a serious interest in working for their organization.

Go the extra mile.,
Talk to your boss about taking on extra responsibilities.,
Vary your daily routine.",How to Beat Boredom at Work1," If you have nothing to do at work and you notice that your coworker is swamped, ask them if they need a hand.This will eliminate your boredom productively, improve your relationship with your coworker, and potentially improve your standing in the office.


If you offer to help your coworker, don’t expect anything in return. You’re not doing them a favor, you’re lending them a hand.;
, If you find yourself standing around without any tasks, become an overachiever.For example, shelve two racks of shoes instead of one. Your boss will notice that you’re taking the initiative without being asked.

Don’t complete a task that was assigned to someone else. They may interpret your enthusiasm as an insult and resent you for it.

, If you’re under-stimulated at work then you may not be challenged enough. If this is the case, ask your boss if you can permanently take on more responsibilities.This will make your boss see you as a hardworking, dedicated employee.

Don’t make any promises that you don’t intend to follow through on. Your boss will think you’re flaky instead of hard-working.
Only ask your boss for extra work if you’ve been doing all of your duties perfectly for several months. Otherwise they may tell you to get a handle on your current workload first.

, If you’re bored because you feel you’re your job is monotonous, try to shake things up.This will bring excitement and variety into your day. For example:

If you can work remotely, try working from a coffee shop.
If you normally sort the returned clothing just before your shift ends, sort it when you get to work instead.

These classes teach public speaking, tourism and travel industry terminology, leadership and teamwork, and other skills valuable to tour guides. They’ll give you a certification when you complete their programs.Be sure to register for courses meant for tour guides rather than tour directors. Tour directors are responsible for logistics and management, while guides lead groups and provide narration about places the group visits.
These programs are great for meeting people in the field. Your teachers, in particular, could connect you with people they know are looking for guides.

, If you live near a local university or community college, check out the course listings. If there are offerings in linguistics, leadership, hospitality, and/or tourism, register.

Absorb and memorize lots of information to be a good guide.,
Act fast when something goes wrong.,
Be prepared to be a freelance worker.,
Put your needs last when guiding a group.,
Understand the physical requirements.,
Be a storyteller to make facts interesting to your audience.",How to Become a Tour Guide3," Being a tour guide means you need to be a people person. Be prepared to answer questions constantly, handle difficult personalities, and herd groups of people around interesting sites and locations. You’ll need to be cheerful and upbeat whenever you’re on the job.You may want to schedule alone time during your days off to balance out your work schedule.

, Your primary job is to give people interesting facts about the places you visit. Take time learning about those places. Get information from your company, the local library, and online to expand your knowledge.Attendees will ask you questions that may be slightly off-topic. Knowing these answers will impress your audience and make you a better guide.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, say so. Tell your audience you’re not sure, but that you’d love to know the answer and will be looking for it as soon as you can.

, When you’re coordinating people, travel plans, and site visits, there’s a lot of opportunity for crisis! Don’t panic if someone gets sick, your tour bus breaks, or a park randomly closes for the day. It’s your job to think on your feet and deal with situations as they arise.You can always contact your company for assistance in these situations, but you’ll need to keep a cool head. You’re the leader of the group when you’re out on a tour, and they’ll look to you for guidance.

, One of the hardest aspects of being a tour guide is that you’re usually hired as a temporary worker. If you live in a country that provides health insurance through employers, you may need to coordinate getting private insurance on your own. You’ll also need to be responsible for keeping employment and tax records., Remember that your group is on vacation, and you’re at work. Do whatever you need to do to keep the group happy and safe. Stay focused on them whenever you’re on the clock.

This might be hard if you’re leading groups in beautiful and relaxing locations, but stay strong! You’re getting paid for this work.

, Being a tour guide requires you to be on your feet and walking around most days. You’ll need to be physically healthy and fit to keep up with the rhythm of this worklife., To keep your tours moving and engaging, tell stories. Don’t just recite a list of names, dates, and events. Give your audience something to grab onto by narrating short stories at different spots along the tour with beginnings, middles, and climatic endings.You also need to make sure that you and your group respects the environment you’re visiting. You’ll be responsible for enforcing the rules.
Always face your audience when giving tours."

Learn a language.,
Write a book.,
Plan a vacation.,
Do some light exercise.",How to Beat Boredom at Work2," Instead of twiddling your thumbs, use an online program or mobile app to learn a new language. There are hundreds of free online language learning programs that you can choose from. You can learn a popular language such as Japanese or even learn computer programming languages such as CSS and Javascript.


Some popular online language programs include Duolingo.com, Babbel.com, and Mangolanguages.com.
Popular online coding language schools include CodeAcademy.com and W3Schools.com.

, Most people who want to write a book say they can’t find time to do it. If you’re bored at work, you probably have lots of time to get started on your masterpiece. Writing a book will help you feel productive and give you something to look forward to.Plus, if you force yourself to write every day, you’ll be finished with it in no time!


If you work in an office, you’ll look more productive while writing a book than you would surfing the internet or playing on your phone.

, There’s nothing more entertaining than going on your dream vacation. The second best activity is planning it. Use your phone or your computer to research the different places you’d like to visit and how much it will cost. Once you’ve planned out the logistics, create your savings goals to help you realize your dreams. Make sure no one catches you googling “beach vacations” while you’re on the clock.

, If you’re forced to be at work all day, you might as well squeeze a good workout in. If you work in an office, swivel from left to right in your desk chair to exercise your stomach muscles. If you walk a lot for your job, choose the stairs instead of the elevator.Some other examples include:

Doing squats in the break room to build your leg muscles
Sitting on an exercise ball instead of a chair to improve your balance

"
"
Take a break.,
Add some interest to your surroundings.,
Add perks to your day.",How to Beat Boredom at Work3," Studies have shown that taking short, frequent breaks improves your productivity and decreases your boredom.After an hour or so of work, stand up and take a short walk outside or take a cigarette break. Alternatively, go make yourself a fresh cup of coffee and chat with your coworkers. Some other break ideas include:


Volunteering to run an errand. This will help you escape your workplace for a while.
Taking a short nap
Playing your favorite mobile game for a few minutes

, The less boring your environment is, the less bored you’ll be.You can add interest to your surroundings by cleaning your work area, displaying cool artwork, or covering the handles of work-related tools in cute stickers.

For example, if you work in a cubicle or office, add some excitement to your walls with prints and posters.
If you work in retail, buy some new clothes to freshen up your work look.

, Break the monotony of your daily schedule by planning small treats for yourself. For example, plan a small walk around the park during your lunch break. Similarly, you can bring your favorite coffee mug and a tea blend to keep in the break room. Whenever you’re bored or discouraged, pep yourself up with a cup of tea.

Focus on healthy treats and rewards. If you don’t, you may replace your boredom problem with a weight-gain problem.

Obtain relevant information.,
Be empathic.,
Avoid over-generalizations.,
Use open-ended questions.",How to Become an Expert in Critical Reasoning," Before you can deal with a problem, you need to acknowledge that there is a problem and define what the problem is.;
, Being open minded simply means that you do not just accept an opinion or view as being true or useful. Try to look for other alternatives or possibilities in the middle ( by assuming a middle ground ). Avoid looking at things as either right or wrong, good or bad, true or false etc. Such extremes are seldom applicable.

, Language is merely a representation of what we perceive as our reality. It may not necessarily be the reality. One should be able to see beyond the words of what is spoken. We should be able to see the reality of things as clearly as possible and remember that language will represent these things in many different ways.

, In order to make the correct decisions, you will need as much information as possible about the concerning issues. Scan the different websites or seek advice from reliable sources.

, This simply means putting yourself in the other persons shoes. Listen to all sides of the story. This encourages people to say what they want to say and facilitates communication.

, An over-generalization means, arriving at any conclusion based on very little evidence.

, If ask questions in a certain way, you may only get ""Yes"" or ""No"" answers. If you phrase questions differently, you are likely to get more information, which may be more helpful in helping you decide on the final outcome.

De-clutter your mind.,
Break work into smaller chunks.,
Skip the pressure to begin.,
Make yourself work for five minutes straight.,
Try a reward system.,
Take advantage of your better days.,
Just get there.,
Work on saying ""no.""",How to Be Productive at Work when You're Depressed1," When your mind is buzzing with all the different things you need to do in a day, it's harder to get things done. To help you focus, take the time to write or type out a physical list for the day. That way, you're not trying to keep them all in your head at once. Plus a list can help you see just how much you've done in a day, which can motivate you., When you're depressed, even small tasks can seem monumental; therefore, it's best to try to view tasks in smaller chunks, so that you can accomplish things piece by piece. Instead of thinking, ""I need to send 500 emails today,"" think ""I have one email to send in the next five minutes. I can do that.""Making tasks smaller makes it seem easier to do them.
If it doesn't seem to be working, try even smaller chunks. You could say, ""I just need to get through this one sentence. That's it.""

, Sometimes, trying to figure out how to begin a task is the hardest part. Maybe you can't find the words you need to start a report, for instance. The key is to just start somewhere. You don't have to start at the ""beginning."" You just need to get started.Once you have some work done, you'll find it easier to go back and work through the beginning.
Also, you won't be paralyzed with indecision about how to ""start.""

, It can be tempting to give in to procrastination when you're feeling depressed. You have a tendency to get distracted, for instance, or you have a desire to get up and do something else; however, just promising yourself you'll work for a set amount of time can help get you started.Cut out distractions. Don't go anywhere else on the internet than what you need for work. Don't go talk to a friend. Just sit down and pay attention only to your work.
Remind yourself you can't do anything else. Even if you don't work, don't allow yourself to do something more interesting.
If you're in a more active job, try to cut distractions like talking to co-workers and just focus on the task at hand.
Set a timer if you need to. Set it for five minutes, then give yourself a short break and start again.

, A reward system can be as simple as, ""If I get this task done, I'll get a cup of coffee."" You could also try, ""If I get this task done, I'll go talk to my friend for five minutes."" Only give yourself the reward if you actually get it done.Another reward could be a task you enjoy more. Maybe you hate folding shirts but enjoy arranging ties. Try the task you hate first, and reward yourself with the more enjoyable task.
You can also set rewards for the day, such as, ""If I get this list accomplished, I'll get Thai food tonight. If not, I have to stay in.""
Make sure you don't make your tasks unattainable. You should be able to accomplish them if you get down to work.

, That is, when you're having an up day, try to be as productive as possible. That way, when you have down days, you can maybe take a little break. You'll still need to work obviously, but maybe you won't have to work quite as hard., Part of treating depression is trying to be more active. If your job is more active, obviously you won't feel like doing it. When you can, force yourself to go, as just being more active and being around people can help. When you can't cope at all, take a sick day if possible.Doing well at work can also help you feel better about yourself., It can be hard to say ""no"" at work to new projects and commitments; however, if you're overextended, due in part to your depression, you can calmly tell your boss that, or speak to someone in human resources. Some bosses will not understand, of course, but it's worth a shot for your mental health. Plus, some bosses may not even realize they're giving you too much to do, even when you are feeling better mentally."

Identify feelings of apathy and lethargy.,
Change your mindset.,
Address lethargy by eating well.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Check in with your doctor.",How to Be Productive at Work when You're Depressed2," Apathy and lethargy are commonly experienced by people who are depressed and they can make it extremely difficult to feel motivated to do things, from seeking help to going to work to simply getting out of bed in the morning. Apathy is an actual lack of emotion — it means you feel nothing. It has been shown that you must have a feeling about something in order to be motivated to change it, so feeling apathetic makes it extremely difficult to change your situation. You might know that your lack of productivity at work might get you in trouble or even fired, but you simply can't make yourself care enough to actually do anything about it.Lethargy is a feeling of fatigue, which can make it even harder to work up the motivation to do things, even when you know you must.Apathy may cause you to feel like happiness, fulfillment, or the ability to reach your goals are impossible. You may feel bored, worn out, and like there is nothing to look forward to.
If you notice feelings of apathy or lethargy as part of your depression, you will need to learn to manage and overcome them to be productive at work.

, The challenge with apathy and lethargy is that you don't feel like doing anything. So, while there may be many things you can do to relieve those feelings, you can't get yourself motivated to actually do them. Overcoming these feelings begins with changing your mindset so you get to a place where you can begin to take action. Start challenging your apathy. Recall the times in the past when you felt happy, motivated, and enthusiastic. What were you doing? Who were you with? Try to do something as small as text someone who always makes you laugh, or do a crossword puzzle if that's something you used to enjoy. Start small.
Ask yourself what you can do right now to move forward, even a tiny bit. Maybe you know you should see a doctor, but your lethargy and apathy are making it seem impossible. Try simply doing an online search of doctors in your area. You don't need to call or make an appointment today — just take that first, small step.
Identify the things you cannot change. Perhaps you feel apathetic because there are some things about your situation you simply cannot change right now. Work on accepting those things and focusing on what you can change.
Manage your expectations. Setting your expectations too high and asking too much of yourself sets you up for failure and can make you feel worse about yourself. It's okay to adjust your expectations throughout the day — even multiple times. If you start to feel overwhelmed, check in with yourself and consider that your current expectations may be too high., Depression may cause you to lose your appetite or turn to unhealthy comfort foods, which can drain your energy and leave you tired and fatigued. Try setting an alarm to go off ever two to three hours and make yourself eat a healthy snack containing protein and complex carbs. These foods can give you energy. Try eggs, yogurt, meat, raw greens, and nuts.Avoid sugar, which can give you a quick burst of energy but ultimately cause you to crash. It may also cause you to feel irritable.

, Getting down on yourself for your feelings of depression, apathy, and/or lethargy will only make you feel worse and isn't constructive in any way. Putting yourself down and calling yourself ""lazy"" won't do anything to motivate you to do more work. Take steps to end negative self-talk by first becoming aware that you are doing it. Ask yourself — What am I saying to myself? What messages am I sending? Would I say this to a friend?Try apologizing to yourself when you catch yourself engaging in negative self-talk. Say something like, ""I didn't deserve that. I'm not lazy — I'm depressed, and there is a difference. I am doing the best I can right now.""

, If you're continuing to feel apathetic and lethargic, you should check in with your doctor. You may need to have your medication adjusted, either by upping the dose of your current medication or switching to a different one. If you're not on a medication, consider talking about one with your doctor. If your depression is affecting your work, it may be time to think about an antidepressant. There's no shame in getting medical help to improve your mental health.

Make time for breaks.,
Try a deep breathing technique.,
Increase the light.,
Work some exercise in.,
Vent if you can.",How to Be Productive at Work when You're Depressed3," It may make you feel more productive to push through to the end of a task, but getting some space from it can actually help. Taking a break can assist with mental clarity, as well as boost your mood and memory.Try to take breaks regularly throughout the day, and you'll likely notice an increase in your productivity.

, Another way to calm yourself is to use deep breathing techniques. Deep breathing just means taking a moment for yourself to relax and focus on your breathing, sort of a mini-meditation. All you need to do is close your eyes (if you can) and focus on your breathing.Try breathing in for four counts, holding for four counts, breathing out for four counts, and holding for four counts. Repeat a couple of times until you feel yourself calming down.

, Make sure you're getting enough natural sunlight during the day. Being stuck inside, especially during the winter months, can mean you're not getting enough sunlight. Sunlight helps your body produce vitamin D, which can boost your mood. Try to spend a few minutes outside on your breaks. You can also open your blinds or go stand by a window on your breaks., Exercise is a natural mood booster — in fact, it may be as effective in treating depression as some antidepressants — so if you can work some exercise into your day, you can help increase your productivity.Try adding some small exercise routines that you can do around your workspace or during your breaks.For instance, take a short walk around the office or outside the building on your lunch break.
Try doing a few jumping jacks when there are no customers around.
When you feel yourself getting tired, try standing up and jogging in place for a few minutes.
If you already have an active job that makes you move around, that's all the better.

, If you are experiencing anxiety in addition to depression, it may help to find someone you can vent to. Of course, it must be someone you trust implicitly, so you know they won't go behind your back and use the information against you. Nonetheless, having someone to talk to at work can help keep your stress levels down.If you don't trust someone enough at work, find a friend outside of work. It won't be quite the same (since they don't know who's involved), but they can still listen.

De-clutter your workspace.,
Listen to calming music.,
Try adding some blue.,
Add visuals that make you happy.",How to Be Productive at Work when You're Depressed4," Clutter is a nuisance because it makes it harder for you to work. In addition, it can also contribute to your depression. On your good days, try to keep your work area uncluttered so that on your bad days, having too much stuff around won't bring you down even further., If you're depressed, you may also be feeling some anxiety about not being able to get your work done. That anxiety isn't going to help the situation. Try keeping yourself calm by listening to some music that soothes you, if your boss allows it. Of course, put in some headphones so you don't disturb your neighbors, particularly if you are in a cubicle or out in the open., Blue can be a calming color, keeping you relaxed. It can also help increase your productivity. Try adding some splashes of blue to your desk or work space or changing your computer background to a predominantly blue picture.If you can't change much, try adding a touch of color, such as a tiny stuffed animal or sticker where customers can't see it.

, If you can, add some pictures or art to your workspace that make you feel happier. Put up pictures of your kids if that's your thing, or have a desk calendar with cat pictures. You could also put up prints of artwork you enjoy.

, This includes adhering to the noticeable dress code. Everybody would like to speak with a person who is clean and tidy. The rule applies in office as well.

, These people often report early to set the day's agenda, and will notice you before the rest of the shift reports. At the very least, always be punctual and avoid being late.

, Do it quality-wise and appropriately.

, If you are the person who always finishes a job ahead of schedule, your supervisors and customers (if applicable) will appreciate your efforts.

, Staying late just to collect overtime, of course, will draw negative attention to you, and that is not the focus of this article.

, Some employers have suggestion boxes, and some even offer bonuses for suggestions that make a task more efficient or profitable.

, A smile is the best asset that anybody has! Flash it around and get noticed, simple.

, Don't hesitate or be afraid, most bosses like people who talk. Remember: ""A talking mind is an open one"".

, Lending a hand, helping out with good suggestions, or just listening to them when they need someone to sound off to will get their attention.

, Many workplaces take collections for the United Way, local charities, or employees who are having medical problems they need help paying for.

, This may happen at company functions, meetings, or even when you run into them out on the town.

, It's said, ""When in Rome, do as Romans do!"" This goes well when it's about your workplace. Your colleagues, especially seniors, should not know if you had a fight with your husband this morning or you did not sleep through the night, until it's extremely required.


Outside-office friends should remain outside. If you'll keep busy in taking care of old friendships while at work too, then you will never be able to become a part of your present place i.e. office. Try to develop a healthy relationship with your colleagues in office.

, In order to keep their employees motivated and as a part of recreational activities, many offices celebrate Office Days. They may include 'Red Colour Day' or 'Robot day', etc. Even if you feel it's a bit immature, treat it as the permitted opportunity to let down your hair and really get to know others at work in their ""true colours"". It's a good chance to use your humour and take it lightheartedly.

Stay away from the clock.,
Seek out work that you feel motivated to do.",How to Be Motivated at Work1," What do you actually do? Sometimes, getting a fresh sense of your job can help you to forget the day-to-day annoyances which threaten to sap your motivation, and helps you concentrate on actually doing the job. Are there jobs you feel like you could do well? Are their projects that you want to tackle? Think about why you are working and why you are well-suited for the job.


Where do you see yourself working in 1-2 years? How is your current job helping you reach that goal?;
, If your job doesn't quite suit you passion or skill set, find a way make it fit. For example, if you love to write you might offer to draft the company newsletter, or offer suggestions to your boss about ways to improve the copy on your website. Input a bit of your own personality in your work and you'll find that the motivation takes care of itself.

, One quick way to stay motivated at work is to look at what you have completed. Ticking off the to-do list is a good way to show you how much you have done in a day. It is also a great way to keep track of overall goals and show yourself how small, seemingly unimportant tasks come together to complete a larger project.

, Working isn't always fun. But the best way to stay motivated when doing tedious or tough tasks is to remember the end-goal. The best goals are personal ones that mean a lot to you, making it much easier to motivate yourself.


After you complete a milestone, like finishing the first chapter of a manuscript or completing expense reports on time, reward yourself. Celebrate your accomplishments and they will become much more meaningful.
Your goals don't have to be related to your current job. You could be saving up to go back to school or working your way up the company ladder to a better job, too.

, Negative thoughts have a way of festering, growing, and getting worse the more you think and talk about them. Instead of always venting about a terrible boss, difficult tasks, and annoying coworkers, think about the things you do enjoy. Make a list of the positives in your work and try to think about them every time you hear yourself complaining or thinking about the negatives.

, Don't force yourself to re-motivate for work every morning. Instead, make your work a matter of habit -- something you do and get done in a set amount of time. Having your work scheduled out and sticking to that schedule teaches your body and mind to turn on ""work mode"" when you need to work, getting you to your desk and completing tasks much faster.


Organizing your desk and tidying up your workspace is a great way to make work more manageable. An organized workspace is key to an organized headspace.

, Time will only seem to move slower if you're checking the clock every 5 minutes. Instead of counting down the amount of time you have left in the day, use your checklist to see how many tasks you have left and how many you can cross of. Make yourself goal oriented, not time oriented, to find more motivation.

, If there is nothing holding you to your old job, and you can't find any motivation in what you're doing, then it is time to start looking elsewhere. Work you enjoy or find meaningful will motivate you by itself. If you can't find the will to keep working your job for weeks on end, and you have no long-term prospects that might improve things, then you should consider moving on to a new position.

Loosen the laces to open up the cleats.,

Pat the shoes down with a dry cloth.,
Fill cleats with lightly balled newspapers, mimicking your foot in the boot.,
Place cleats in a dry place, preferably with a breeze or light fan.,
Change the newspaper out after 2-3 hours to speed up the process.,
Understand that direct heat will damage cleats permanently.",How to Dry Cleats Quickly," You want to get air to as much of the cleat as possible. Furthermore, wet cleats tend to contract as they dry, creating tension on the seams. Loosening the laces will alleviate some of this stress.;
, Again, the more pieces of the boot you can expose to air, the faster they are all going to dry. Wrap the insole up in paper towels, or leave it upright by an open window or fan to start drying it.Hanging your insoles up with a clothespin is a good way to quickly dry them.

, Get as much of the mud off now as you can, as it will be harder to remove once it has dried onto the shoe. Don't worry about adding a bit more water to them now to help wipe away the mud. If they are already soaked, this won't make a huge difference., Remove as much surface moisture as you can to kick-start the process. Get both inside and outside of the cleat.

, You're not making a newspaper foot mold, of course, and you don't want to stuff it so tightly that the cleats are bulging. Simply fill it snugly with newspaper so that it won't shrink as it dries. To dry the tongue and laces, slide a piece of newspaper between them as well and lightly tighten the laces down.


You don't want to tightly scrunch the newspaper. The looser it is, with more surface area, the better it will wick moisture away from the boots.
Paper towels, napkins, small hand-clothes, and other absorbent materials can all be used in place of newspaper if need be.The newspaper will also absorb water much more quickly than air alone.

, Moisture is wicked away faster under moving air, so a fan or gentle breeze is a good way to gently speed up the drying process. Either way, don't put them in damp or humid areas -- drier air will lead to drier cleats.


If your hair dryer has a cool or low setting this can be used to speed up the process slightly. Do not use the hot setting -- if the air is too hot to hold over your skin, it is too hot for the cleats.
If you don't care about the smell, a refrigerator is a great place to quickly dry cleats -- the cold air is constantly circulated, drying the shoes rapidly.

, As the newspapers fill with water, they become less effective at absorbing more. Changing out the newspaper greatly increases the moisture pulled out of your boots., Using a hairdryer, a drying machine, or the oven will damage your cleats worse than moisture wil. Do not be impatient when trying to dry your cleats rapidly, as this will only lead to damaged leather and warped shoes. Do not:


Put in the drier
Blast with hot air
Stick out in direct sunlight for more than 1 hour

Always dress in layers.,
Stick with synthetic base layers.,
Wearing the proper pair of pants can also be critical for comfort.,
Finally, one of the most important precautions to take on any Alaska fishing trip is to bring along the best rain gear that you can afford.,
Always dress in layers and always bring rain gear.",How to Dress for Your Alaska Halibut Charter," Even in the peak of summer the mornings can be darn right cool, sometimes even cold. Your base layer should always be a quick wicking synthetic. It is wise to avoid cotton fabrics. Cotton isn't near as breathable, nor has the wicking power of the synthetic garments. When wet, cotton takes forever to dry and can leave the fisherman uncomfortable for the extent of the halibut fishing trip.;
, After the base layer you may add as many long sleeve shirts as the weather report calls for. The beautiful thing about dressing in layers is that you can shed off layers anytime you wish and put layers back on when you are feeling chilly. There are many great types of lightweight fleeces being made today. The best type of fleece you can have on is one that's lightweight and that can stop the wind. When you are heading out to the halibut fishing spots you might be on the back deck of the boat, usually in the morning. The back deck can be quite cool and the wind can chill the bone. A good fleece will stop the wind and make you feel nice and cozy. In addition to the layers, a medium to lightweight coat should be brought along. You'll sure wish you brought one on a cold Alaskan morning.

, It is advised to not wear jeans. When wet, cotton jeans are miserable and won't dry for the entire time of your halibut charter. Again, try to wear a synthetic blend pair of pants. As for footwear, a lightweight wool sock is recommended and a waterproof boot of some kind.

, Both the pants and the jacket are a must due to the unpredictable weather in Alaska. It can look beautiful out in the morning and by midday it's pouring rain and the temperature could drop ten degrees or more.

, These two precautions will ensure you stay comfortable on your halibut fishing charter, leaving you to fully concentrate on catching those huge halibuts.

This starts with finding work and tasks that you enjoy, but it doesn't end there. Spending some time by yourself and taking occasional breaks while you work is a great way to ensure that you are happy and motivated for anything.

, Go out and splurge on lunch. Get someone to make you a playlist or suggest a new band to listen to while working. Try out a new shirt or tie, something bright and a bit weird. Take control of your work life and inject it with a bit of spontaneity. This burst of personality will help you feel more personally invested in your work.

, There are lots of ways to do this, of course, but all of them aim to make your work an extension of you, not something you're forced to do. Bring in photographs, toys, and knickknacks that make your desk an enjoyable place to be. Take some time to get your desk in order, and make things just how you like them, so that you don't loath sitting down at your desk each morning.

, Having a support system in place at your work will help everyone stay motivated. Take some time to chat to your coworkers to build a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. If you notice someone doing a great job, let them know. If someone seems down, ask them what's up. You'll start hearing similar comments back at yourself, and this sense of community is a great way to keep everyone working together on common goals.

Learn to brace your abdomen.,
Start with one-legged balances.,
Do leg swings.,
Try a one-legged clock balance.,
Add an off-balance element to standard strength-training exercises.,
Add back leg raises and side leg raises.,
Move to planks.",How to Do Off‐Balance Exercise1," If you've ever been in a yoga or pilates class, you've probably heard that you should draw your navel toward your spine to activate your core. However, bracing is generally a better method to activate your core for stability and balancing purposes.Bracing does a better job of activating your entire core than the hollowing action of drawing your navel to your spine.
To properly brace your abdomen, think of how you would brace yourself if someone was about to punch you in the gut.;
, A one-legged balance is a beginning exercise to help get you used to off-balance exercises and practice activating your core to maintain stability when doing off-balance exercises.Stand with your feet together, then lift one foot a few inches off the ground. Hold your foot up for a minute or two, then switch and do the other foot.
Practice this exercise with your eyes open and with your eyes closed. Activate your core to maintain your balance, and try not to lean or wobble. You may want to do this with a stable chair or table nearby when you're just starting.

, Once you've mastered the one-legged balance, you can increase the difficulty by lifting each foot and swinging it forward and back. Focus on moving your leg only, keeping your spine neutral and not moving your torso.To start, touch your foot on the floor in the middle to re-stabilize. As you get better with this exercise, you can try it without touching the floor. Do 5 to 10 repetitions with each foot.

, A one-legged clock balance will help you integrate your upper and lower body to better strengthen your balance and stability, which will help you with more challenging off-balance exercises.To do this exercise, stand on one leg and imagine your arms are the arms of a clock. Start at 12 with your arms straight overhead, then point to 3 o'clock. Try to swoop down to 9 o'clock without losing your balance, then come back up to 12.
If you're exercising with a partner, have them call out hours for you to point to with your arms. Since you don't know what's coming, this makes the exercise more difficult.
Be sure to do this exercise balancing on the other leg as well.

, Once your balance has improved to the point that you can easily balance on one leg, you can add an off-balance element to virtually any strength-training exercise.For example, if you normally do squats, you can do one-legged squats by pointing one leg out front as you go into your squat. Remember to do both legs.
You also can do weight-training exercises, such as dead lifts, with one leg. However, make sure your balance is strong before moving to off-balance weight training exercises. It's typically best to have a spotter when lifting weights while balancing on one leg.

, Back leg raises can help strengthen your glutes and buttocks to help improve your balance, while side leg raises will strengthen your hips and thighs as well. When you first start, you might want to keep a sturdy chair or table nearby that you can use for support.To do back leg raises, stand on one leg and raise the other leg backward, keeping your torso straight and activating your core. Lower the leg back to the floor in a slow, controlled movement. Do two to three sets of 10 leg raises with each leg.
Do side leg raises the same as back leg raises, only raise your leg to the side rather than backward. Avoid leaning when you do this exercise, keeping your torso straight. Do two or three sets of 10.

, Planks are the classic exercise to activate and strengthen the muscles in your core. Strengthening your core will enable you to improve your balance so you can successfully complete off-balance exercises.To do a standard plank, lie on your stomach on the floor with your wrists directly below your shoulders. Tuck your toes under and raise up so that you are on your hands and toes with your body forming a straight line from your heels to the crown of your head.
Brace your abdomen to hold the position. If a full plank is too difficult for you, start by getting onto your knees and elbows, with your forearms flat on the floor.
Try to hold the plank for as long as you are able without experiencing neck, back, or shoulder pain, then lower yourself to the floor in a slow and controlled manner.

After you have the rhythm, bring the hand back up to the level of the other. Your shoulders should be slightly curved forward but not creating tension. Your head should be at a natural position with your eyes concentrating on a point on the wall or an object in the distance if you are outside.

, Your shoulders will begin to hurt. That's normal. You will also feel your hands getting warm and feeling pressure in them as if they are being filled with water. You will feel the chi circulate in your body. Many parts will begin to twitch and you might feel tingling sensations or trembling sensations. All these are normal experiences.

Squat, reaching your hands to the floor in front of your feet. Then kick your legs back into a plank.
Lower your chest to the floor, or as far as you can go, then push back up into a plank and jump your feet back up into a squat.
You can jump up from the squat and land in a squatting position at the end of the exercise if you want to increase the intensity.

, Mountain climbers are another standard exercise frequently featured in interval training. This exercise works your legs as well as your lower abdominal muscles.Get into high plank position with your wrists under your shoulders. Lift your left foot and bend your left knee as you crunch your leg forward. Think of it as trying to get your left knee to touch your left elbow.
As you bring your left leg back to plank, bring your right knee forward using the same movement. Set a timer for 30 seconds and do as many of these as you can with continuous movement during that time.

, Barbell complexes combine strength-training with interval training to build muscles and encourage fat burning. Keep in mind that these movements are not meant to be done as quickly as possible, like some other interval exercises are.To build strength, start by using just the bar and work your way up in 5-pound increments. You may want to work with a trainer to build complete complexes that effectively target the upper and lower body. However, keep in mind that typically barbell complexes are intended to be more of a whole-body workout.
For example, a whole-body barbell complex might include a barbell squat, push press, Romanian deadlift, barbell row, and power clean. Move from each exercise after completing one set of five to eight reps.

Include an effective warm-up.,
Do some dynamic stretching.,
Alternate aerobic and anaerobic activities.,
Set periods of high intensity and low intensity.,
Avoid working the same muscle groups back-to-back.,
Include a variety of exercises with different goals.,
Limit your high-intensity sessions.",How to Do Scissor Jumps3," If you're going to do interval training of any intensity, warming up your muscles and your cardiovascular system is essential if you want to avoid cramps or other injuries.For brief interval training, five to ten minutes is enough time to warm up. Good warm-ups include a brief jog or jumping rope. You also can jog in place or just do jumping jacks for a few minutes.

, Dynamic stretching will warm up your body effectively while also stretching all muscle groups so that your whole body is ready for intervals. Follow up your five-minute warm-up with five minutes of dynamic stretching.To organize your dynamic stretching routine, think of going from your head down to your feet. Start by doing head circles, then move down to shoulder circles, then arm circles, and so on.
Do leg circles while standing, being sure to do them with your knees bent as well as straight. You can also do these while lying on your back if you are having problems with balance.

, Aerobic exercises are those that engage your cardiovascular system. Anaerobic activities are those in which you remain relatively stationary, such as lifting weights.Make a list of the exercises you want to include in your routine, and label them as aerobic or anaerobic. Then, set up your routine so that you are doing an aerobic exercise followed by an anaerobic exercise followed by another aerobic exercise.
For example, you might start with scissor jumps, then do weight lifting or static stretches, then do burpees.

, Especially if weight loss is one of your exercise goals, alternating high intensity and low intensity can increase your metabolism and get your body to burn excess fat, even after you've finished your workout for the day.Your low-intensity periods should be longer than your high-intensity periods. For example, if you're doing low-intensity exercise for one-minute intervals, you should follow up with a high-intensity exercise for 30 seconds.

, Since interval training typically does not include rest periods between exercise intervals, working alternate muscle groups allows the muscles you just worked to recover.This can be difficult if you have a lot of whole-body exercises in your routine, but think about what muscles are most targeted by the exercise. For example, if you're doing planks, this is a whole-body exercise that primarily targets the core. Mountain climbers also target the core, so you wouldn't want to follow up a plank interval with an interval of mountain climbers.

, To build an effective interval routine yourself, you need to think of what you want to accomplish through your workouts and then look for exercises that will help you achieve those goals.Scissor jumps are an effective whole-body exercise that will help increase your overall fitness, including your cardiovascular fitness. If your goal is simply to become more physically fit, you should incorporate scissor jumps into your routine.
If you want to lose weight around your midsection and build strong abdominal muscles, you want to include core exercises such as planks and mountain climbers as well.
If you're new to exercise, work with a personal trainer to build your routine, or search online for free instructional videos of interval routines.

, If you've decided to start doing high-intensity interval training, you need to be aware of the toll it takes on your body. Although this is a quick and efficient way to improve your fitness, you must allow enough time for your body to recover.Typically you don't want (or need) to do more than one or two high-intensity interval sessions each week.
Leave at least 48 hours of recovery time between high-intensity sessions.

Work with a trainer.,
Use a BOSU ball and a stability ball.,
Incorporate split stance and one-leg exercises.,
Try balance or wobble board exercises.",How to Do Off‐Balance Exercise2," If you are an athlete and are adding off-balance exercises to your training regimen to help prevent future sports injuries, working with a trainer is essential. A trainer with experience in your particular sport knows which off-balance exercises will best benefit you.Doing the wrong off-balance exercises as an athlete can actually increase your risk of injury and cause a decrease in your performance overall.

, A BOSU ball is generally a half of a stability ball with a flat surface on the other side. Both of these pieces of training equipment can be used to do off-balance exercises that will improve your stability and can enhance your overall athletic performance.When using a BOSU ball, start by standing on the rounded, or ball, surface. Once you are comfortable with the tool, try flipping the ball over so that you stand on the flat part. Move to exercise only when you are comfortable standing on both the flat and rounded parts.
These pieces of equipment originally were used for rehabilitation after injuries. Adding them to your training regimen can also strengthen the stability of your joints to lower your risk of future injury.
For example, you might do lunges or squats on a BOSU ball. Do three sets of 10 repetitions of these exercises. Try to hold the squat or lunge position for several seconds and activate your core to maintain balance.

, One-leg exercises are the standard off-balance exercises that require you to activate your core to maintain your balance. However, split stance exercises may be more beneficial for preventing sports injuries.Split stance exercises are still considered off-balance exercises because you're shifting the center of your mass further away from your base of support.
With split stance exercises, however, you keep both feet on the floor, so you're not exercising from an unstable surface, which can increase your risk of knee injuries.

, Balance and wobble board exercises are frequently prescribed for rehabilitation from a sports injury. Regular balance and wobble board training can improve your understanding of your joint position to prevent injuries to your ankles or knees.A balance or wobble board is simply a board with a rounded bottom that you can either stand on, or do simple exercises such as squats or lunges.
The uneven surface will cause you to wobble as you exercise, forcing you to engage your core to maintain your balance.

Talk to your health care provider.,
Shake your head while walking.,
Practice walking heel to toe.,
Shake your head while standing on one leg.,
Work with a wobble board.",How to Do Off‐Balance Exercise3," If you have had an injury or have a medical condition that causes vertigo or chronic dizziness, you may benefit from balance retraining exercises. However, you should not start an off-balance exercise program without consulting your doctor.Your doctor will be able to recommend specific exercises that you should do, or may send you to a physical therapist.

, To recalibrate your internal balance and equilibrium after it has been damaged due to an injury or medical condition, you'll start by simply shaking and nodding your head while standing still. Move your head slowly if you have recently experienced neck or spinal issues, or if you have a chronic condition in those areas.If you can accomplish this while standing without getting dizzy or losing balance, you can transition to walking. As you walk, shake your head from side to side and then nod up and down.
You should practice this exercise both with your eyes open and with your eyes closed. However, if you're walking with your eyes closed it's generally best to have a spotter with you in case you do lose your balance, so you won't fall.

, You may recognize the heel-toe walking technique as part of a roadside sobriety test. Walking heel to toe in a straight line can improve your balance and coordination.Simply walk forward in a straight line, heel to toe, for 20 steps. Then walk backward the same 20 steps. Repeat two to three times.
You can hold your arms out at your side to steady yourself, but ultimately you should get to the point where you can do this without the assistance of your arms for balance.

, If you've progressed to the point that you're able to stand on one leg without losing your balance, add a head shake to bring the balance system of your brain into action.Stand on one leg with the other foot in front of you a few inches off the floor, then shake your head gently side to side and up and down.
As when you shook your head while walking, you should do these exercises both with your eyes open and with your eyes closed.
Keep a stable object nearby in case you lose your balance. You also might want to have a spotter or skilled therapist working with you. Do this exercise for one minute, then switch legs.

, If you have access to a wobble board at a gym, you can use it to increase your stability and improve your overall balance. To start, make sure you have a sturdy chair or table nearby that you can use to stabilize your upper body.Stand on the wobble board with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Engage your core and rock on the board, back and forward as well as side to side. Gradually build up the amount of time you can do this.

Do squat jacks for endurance.",How to Do Jump Squats," Get into a normal standing position, with your body facing forward and feet parallel. Your feet should be directly underneath your shoulders. Now, slide them a couple inches apart and turn your toes slightly outward. From this stance, you’ll have a solid base to take off from and land in. Also, your knees will stay in natural alignment with your toes during the squat portion of the movement, which will alleviate the pressure on your knees.If you plan to do a very deep squat, then make sure that your knees are aligned directly above your ankle or foot. Improper knee alignment can result in a range of injuries when you are doing this exercise, such as a twisted ankle or a torn ligament in your knee.
Because everyone is built differently, the optimal stance and body positioning for performing a jump squat will also be different for everyone.
If any part of the movement feels unnatural or causes discomfort, adjust your technique to better suit your individual body type.;
, Begin the squat by lowering your hips back and down while bending your knees. Keep your chest upright, with your chin up and head facing forward. Get into as deep a squat as you can while maintaining the correct technique. Your arms can either be down at your sides or held poised out in front of you to assist in balancing at the lowest point of the squat. Take a deep breath as you go down.Lower yourself in a smooth, controlled manner during the squat, then explode as forcefully as you can into the jump.
Your knees should never extend over your toes. This shifts the strain of the squat to your knee joints.

, Once you’ve gone as low as you can, reverse your motion in one quick, explosive movement. Drive hard with your legs as you come up out of the squat. Lift your arms to chest level and keep your torso and head straight and upright. Breathe out sharply as you push through the squat.You should think of the jump squat as two distinct movements: the squat and the jump. Your squat should be fluid enough to allow you to transition directly into the jump without any awkward or disjointed missteps.

, At the top position of the squat, keep pushing to propel yourself into the jump. The balls of your feet should be the last part of your body in contact with the ground. Take advantage of the strength of your calf muscles to generate extra force as you go airborne. Throw your arms up straight over your head and use the momentum to extend your body and carry you higher.Don't forget to breathe! Inhale as you descend into the squat and exhale as you jump. It's easy to instinctively hold your breath during tense, demanding exercises like squat jumps, but failure to breathe will exhaust you much faster.
Keep your legs straight at the highest point of the jump. This will put them in position to land safely.

, When you reach the peak of your jump, you’ll need to begin preparing yourself for the landing. Keep your core tight to prevent your body from turning or rotating off its axis in midair. Bring your arms back down from overhead to guide your trajectory as you lower your eyes to spot the ground beneath you. Your legs should be fully extended when you reestablish contact with the ground.Stay straight as you’re coming down so that you don’t land off balance.

, Point your toes and allow the balls of your feet to touch first. The calves control extension and flexion of the foot, and will be the first muscle group responsible for slowing your downward movement. Your feet should be in roughly the same position they were in during the takeoff, slightly wider than shoulder width apart with toes turned outward.Always remember to take off from the balls of your feet and land on the balls of your feet.
Landing on the whole foot transfers shock up through the bones of the heels, ankles, and knees, which can eventually cause chronic pain, tendinitis, and even stress fractures.

, Continue lowering your weight after making contact with the balls of your feet. Bend your knees and brace yourself with your legs as you sink to gradually dissipate the force of the landing. Try to land as softly and smoothly as possible. This part of the landing is critical in avoiding injury.Conditioning the legs to absorb impact has the added benefit of strengthening the connections between muscles and tendons.

, If you’re performing a single jump squat, or if it’s the last one of your set, stand back upright after absorbing the impact of the landing. If you’re doing multiple, continuous jump squats, use the knee bend as a lead-in to the next jump squat. Keep your arms in movement to stabilize yourself and increase the height of each jump.Jump squats are used to train maximal power output, which means they can be extremely taxing. It’s best not perform more than about 10-15 jump squats per set.When you begin to get tired, your technique suffers, which can lead to accidents. At best, you’ll keep yourself from getting the most out of the exercise. At worst, you could hurt yourself.

, Speed up the tempo of your sets for more of a metabolic effect. This will make each set much more difficult, so be careful not to overdo it. Do 10-15 jump squats, then take a short rest and perform another set. Alternately, try super setting (performing two different exercises back-to-back with little or no rest) jump squats with other exercises like push ups, pull ups, crunches or lunges.Don’t get sloppy or let your technique break down when increasing the speed of your jumps squats.
Minimize the time you spend in contact with the ground by moving quickly into the next jump. This type of training will make you more explosive and reactive.

, For a tougher variation of the standard jump squat, do tuck jumps. Instead of jumping straight up with legs extended, pull your knees up and tuck them into your chest at the top of the jump. The extra movement required for each jump will make them more tiring, letting you get more out of the exercise.Try to tuck tight enough to touch your chest with the tops of your thighs.Tucking will change the rhythm of the movement. Make sure you untuck with enough time to prepare for the landing.

, Hold two small dumbbells in each hand for added resistance. Select dumbbells that are light enough to allow you to land safely to avoid placing undue stress on the knees. Adding weight is advantageous for those wishing to build strength while improving their cardiovascular conditioning.Resistance should be kept low. Using too much weight can be hard on your joints and increase your risk of injury.
Performing weighted squat jumps with a barbell requires impeccable technique and balance, and should only be attempted by advanced lifters.

, Turn your jump squat into a modified box jump. Set up a box or elevated platform of an appropriate height (this will depend largely on your individual level of strength and fitness) and place it about a foot in front of you. Calculate the jump portion of the jump squat so that you land on top of the box instead of simply touching back down in place. Make sure to bend your knees and land on the balls of your feet when you land on the box.Box jumps are superb for training bodily and spatial awareness, as they force your takeoff, landing and trajectory to be more precise.

, Rather than performing jump squats in place, do them while traveling forward. These are commonly known as ""frog jumps."" Shorten the movement by not dropping quite as low into the squat and leaping for distance in addition to height. Frog jumps will improve the dynamic strength of your squat while strengthening your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. And since you'll be hopping all around, they also feel more like play than work.Take the same cues as the standard jump squat when landing frog jumps, keeping your body upright, touching down with the balls of your feet and sinking at the knees to absorb impact.Add light resistance or give yourself a certain time or distance to meet for more of a challenge.

, Squat jacks are a conditioning exercise that combine the intensity of squat jumps with the coordination of the classic jumping jack. Get into low squat position with your feet side by side. Place both hands behind your head or hold them crossed in front of your body. As you jump, spread your legs out wide, then bring them back together as you land the next jump. Stay deep in the squat throughout the whole movement and try not to let yourself come up. These are sure to get your legs burning!Do as many squat jacks as you can at the end of your workout for a ruthless all-out finisher. Movements like this are low-impact, meaning they can safely be performed to failure.
Try not to let your knees cave inward when you land. Keeping your toes turned out can help with this.

Your stance should be solid and stable.Some people prefer instead to do this exercise while sitting on a bench, feet on either side.This is also fine, but be sure not to slump or slouch.;
, Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Your thumbs should be around the handles and your palms should face your body.The dumbbells should rest next to your thighs and your elbows should be straight.
They weight of the dumbbell depends on your arm strength. Choose a dumbbell that will challenge you,but not one that's so heavy you have to strain just to pick it up.
A dumbbell that is too heavy can injure you. Don't push yourself to lift a dumbbell that causes strain, especially if you suffer from back problems.

, Contract your abdominal muscles to brace your torso. Pull your shoulder blades down and back, and make sure your neck is aligned with your spine.Hold this position throughout the exercise. Do not slump or arch your back. If you feel this occurring, you may need to consider lighter dumbbells.

, Before you begin the exercise, bend your elbows just a little to take the tension into your biceps., Let out a deep breath., Slowly bend your elbow until the dumbbell almost touches your shoulder, being careful not to let your elbow move forward.Only your forearm should move.









Keep your wrist straight. The palm of your hand should face your body as you lift. Do not shrug your shoulders.
Note that you can either lift both dumbbells at the same time, or alternate between arms, raising and lowering one dumbbell and then the other., When your dumbbell reaches the high-point of the lift, hold it there for just a moment and squeeze with your hand to flex your bicep., Take a deep breath in., Slowly straighten your arm to lower the dumbbell to to the starting position, keeping your back straight.








Do not simply allow the dumbbell to drop back to your side, as this does not exercise your muscles. Lower it slowly, keeping control over it the whole way down.

, If alternating arms, repeat the process with the other arm. Continue through your desired number of repetitions (reps).









For beginners, one or two sets of eight to 12 reps is recommended. Don't strain yourself.For more advanced lifters, do three sets of 12 reps., One popular variation of the dumbbell hammer curl is to lift the dumbbells with your palms facing straight out in front of you in the starting position. This is called an ""offset grip"" hammer curl.








This variation exercises your forearm along with the muscles that a standard hammer curl works.

, To further increase difficulty, lean on a preacher bench. With the peak of the bench in your armpit, extend one arm down the bench. Hold a dumbbell in one hand and place the other hand on the bicep of the first. Curl up. , Another variation involves adding a lunge press to the motion. Step forward into a deep lunge, touching one knee to the ground. Raise the dumbbells simultaneously toward your shoulders. Then, straighten your arms, raising both dumbbells above your head as you return to a standing position.Repeat this, but alternate which knee touches the ground.

Show up 10 minutes early.",How to Do Indoor Cycling1," There are all sorts of indoor cycling classes. There are a few factors to look for, and the rest is up to you. Contact local gyms, as well as cycling studios and ask about classes that are better geared for beginners. Make sure the facility will help you adjust your bike and go over safety information on your first visit.Arrive early so that someone can help you get your bike set up.


Many group classes will have themes regarding type of workout, or even type of music. For instance, you can sign up for a beginner-specific class, a strength workout, or a class featuring non-stop hip-hop. The important thing is choosing a class that appeals to you.
Make sure to identify yourself as a new class member when you go for the first time. This will help to ensure that you get the help you need to set up your bike and enjoy the class.;
, If you’re planning on a scheduled indoor cycling class, you may be able to reserve the specific bike you’d like to ride. If this option is not available, try to arrive early enough to be able to choose the bike you want to ride. Choose whatever location that will best enable you to focus on the class.If you think you’ll be more comfortable sitting near the back, do so.
Consider sitting in the front row if you’re new. This will offer a better view of the instructor. Additionally, you may be motivated to work harder if you’ve got other people sitting behind you!

, Moisture-wicking fabric is best for your top. Tights or bike shorts are ideal options to wear on bottom. Avoid anything too baggy or that hinders your range of motion.Bike shorts are worth trying out. They range in cost from about $20 to $100. Don’t worry about brand; choose a pair based on comfort., Most cycling classes will feature bikes with pedals that are designed to work with a clip-in bike shoe. Alternatively, you can often strap in a regular athletic shoe. Check beforehand to ensure you don’t need a certain type of shoe, and ask whether you can borrow or rent bike shoes if you don’t have any.Hold off on buying bike shoes until you’ve been to a few classes and want to make the investment. In the meantime, wear stiff-soled athletic shoes.If you’re ready to buy a shoe, choose a pair that has a solid, non-flex bottom, and fits well. Pricey cycling shoes are not necessary if you intend to use them mostly indoors.

, Avoid eating a full meal within a few hours of your class. However, you should eat a small, healthy snack an hour and a half or so before you begin cycling. This time frame allows you to digest the food and have energy stored for your workout., It’s always important to show up on time for group fitness events. You may not be allowed to join if you arrive late. Arrive especially early for your first few classes to ask any questions you may have and meet others in your classes."

Clear plenty of floor space.,
Get in a push-up position.,
Start crawling.,
Keep going for 10 to 20 yards.,
Rest between reps.",How to Do Bear Crawls1," If you're going to do bear crawls, you need plenty of room to move around in all directions. You don't want to run into somebody or put yourself in danger with possible obstacles.Bear crawls are a good exercise to do outdoors, where space typically will be at less of a premium than it would be in a crowded gym.
Think about how far you want to crawl, and in what direction. You may want to use a cone or other marker to keep your place.
If there's a school near you that has a track or football field that's not in use, do your bear crawls there. You have ready-made markers to keep your distance.;
, To start the bear crawl, get into a push-up or plank position. Start on your knees with your hands under your shoulders, palm down on the floor. Extend your arms to raise your upper body over the ground.You want your fingers pointed out, with your hands slightly further apart than shoulder width.
If you're a beginner, you may want to do bear crawls on your knees to start. This exercise is not only a little easier, but also helps ensure you keep your back flat and straight while crawling.
To do the full bear crawl, get on your toes with your legs straight out behind you. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder width.
Your hips should be raised slightly relative to how they would be if you were in plank position, when you would strive to make your body a straight line from head to heel.
Your back should be flat and straight, and your legs should be straight as well. Squeeze your glutes to help you maintain the correct position.

, To do a bear crawl, you simply walk forward on your hands and feet, alternating each side just as if you were walking or crawling normally. The difference – and what makes this a demanding exercise for your core – is the position of your body.Your back should always be a straight line from your shoulders to your hips, and should remain in a neutral position throughout the exercise.
Tighten the space in your midsection so that your ribs are tucked towards your hips and your shoulders are pinned.
When you crawl, stay straight. Don't allow your hips, pelvis, ribs or spine to rotate or collapse.

, When you start doing bear crawls, go for a shorter distance so you can focus on maintaining your form. As you get better, you can go for a longer distance.Your steps should be relatively short and controlled. Don't extend your arms or legs out further than you can move with stability.
Breathe in through your nose deeply, then out through your mouth as you complete this exercise. You should breathe in a normal rhythm without holding your breath at any point.
Only go as far as you can while still maintaining perfect form and control over your movements. If you feel yourself falling out of correct position, stop. Doing bear crawls incorrectly can put you in serious risk of injuring your back or shoulders.

, If you're adding the bear crawl to a conditioning routine, make sure you take a break for 30 seconds to a minute between each crawl in your routine, or before moving on to another exercise.During your rest periods, make sure you're breathing deeply – in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Avoid moving from one exercise to another without stopping unless you're working closely with a trainer who can monitor your form. This is an easy way to start getting sloppy and put yourself at risk for injury.

When you jump, jump off the floor (not into it). Your feet need to bounce off the floor and into the Traveling Russian position., When you jump up into the air, don't leap or take a big step because a Traveling Russian is a middle split leap.

When you do your Traveling Russian, cross your wrists, then uncross them. It's as if your wrists cross, then sway as you throw your arms across both sides of you.

, Make sure that the foot you jumped off goes behind you, not in front of you., In summary, it's run, jump off the in-front foot, Traveling Russian ""middle split leap"" and face forward, wrist sway, and keep looking forward and your foot goes behind your other foot."

Set the handlebars and saddle at hip height.,
Get in the saddle.,
Tweak the handlebars for comfort.",How to Do Indoor Cycling2," Stand beside the bike you’ll be riding and adjust both the seat (or “saddle”) and the handlebars so that they are level with the top of your hip bones. You’re not done yet though. Bend one of your arms 90 degrees and make a fist. Touch the front of your knuckles to the center of your handlebars, with your elbow pointing directly towards the saddle. Adjust the saddle so that its front touches the back of your elbow., You may still need to adjust the bike further, but get in the saddle to feel it out after setting the right saddle and handlebar heights. As you sit in the saddle, rotate the pedals slowly. When the pedal on one side is all the way down, make sure the leg on that side has only a slight bend. Shoot for 25 to 35 degrees.When the pedals are level with one another, one knee should be directly above the forward pedal. If not, re-adjust the saddle forward or backward, as necessary.
On a recumbent bike (which are much less common, but are still available at some facilities) the leg extending on a stroke should only be bent 10 to 15 degrees, while the leg on the rear pedal should make a 90-degree angle.

, Make sure you can reach your handlebars comfortably, with an upright back and open chest. Your shoulder should be relaxed and your elbows should be slightly bent. In a comfortable, safe position, you won’t feel pressure on your back, knees, or wrists. If your position is uncomfortable in any way, or if your shoulders or back are rounded, ask the instructor for help with adjustments.


Your handlebars may be too low, or tilted forward detrimentally, if your back is uncomfortable.
If you have recurring back, neck, or shoulder pain, set your handlebars a bit higher and scoot the saddle forward to sit more upright.

"
Clip in correctly.,
Pull the pedals, don’t just push.,
Follow the instructor’s direction.,
Push yourself.,
Stand with stability.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Do Indoor Cycling3," Clip in one foot at a time by tilting your toes forward on top of the pedal and pushing your foot downward into the middle of the pedal. You should hear an audible click as the shoe clips into the pedal. To unclip, turn your ankle away from the bike.In regular athletic shoes, rest the ball of your foot right on the middle of the pedal. While your toes should be in the pedal’s cage or strap, don’t push your foot forward all the way in.

, The most helpful lesson to learn about cycling is that the upstroke provides most of the power you put into the pedals. To state this otherwise, pulling the pedals upwards will make it even easier to speed up and maintain higher speeds. This is why cycling shoes clip in, and pedals have straps or cages.Keep your feet flat throughout your strokes. If anything, try to keep your toes slightly above your heels. Avoid pointing your toes downward while pedaling.

, You’re going to hear a lot about RPMs. This acronym stands for revolutions per minute. This essentially measures the equivalent of your speed, or “cadence.” The bike’s resistance setting, usually controlled by a knob, will adjust how hard you have to work the pedals to increase your RPM.The class instructor will likely direct you on when and how much to adjust your bike’s resistance. Try to stay as close as possible to what the instructor recommends. Don’t hesitate to turn your resistance down if you can’t keep up though.
When the instructor directs the class to add resistance, do so, even if you only add a bit. Adding resistance periodically actually helps prevent injury. The quality of your strokes, and your workout in general, will improve once you settle into a steady pedaling rhythm. Pedaling against resistance helps!

, Don’t just try to crank the pedals as hard and as fast as you can. You want to work your way into a smooth, steady cadence while periodically increasing resistance. Even if you’re pedaling slowly, if you’re pushing against a good amount of resistance, you’re generating plenty of power – and likely working hard to do so. Essentially, increase resistance instead of RPMs.Think about going as fast as you can on a bike outside. It requires a lot of force to get a bike going quickly and keeping it moving at a high speed. As a point of reference, you are unlikely to go above 100 RPM for a sustained amount of time outdoors, because the resistance you feel when going full speed makes it hard to maintain RPM.
Don’t ever allow your RPM to go above 120. At this point, the pedals are likely carrying your feet, and you don’t have control of the bike.
Shoot for 60 to 80 RPM during a “climb” (when resistance is high to mimic a hill climb on an outdoor bike), and 90 to 110 RPM otherwise.

, You may be directed to stand, or simply want to stand periodically to vary the muscles you’re using. When you do stand on your pedals, don’t lean forward. Keep the nose of your saddle near the back of your inner thighs, keeping your back straight and your chest open.Focus on stability over speed. If you’re bouncing up and down, you’re losing power and risking injury. Hold your body steady, pushing down and pulling up with equal force.

, You’ll likely be surprised by how much water you’ll drink during a cycling class. Come prepared with at least one full water bottle, but two is better. As a rule of thumb, bring an ounce of water for each minute of your class. After a 40 minute class, finish what’s left of the 40 ounces you brought with you."
"
Get your doctor’s approval.,
Stop cycling if you experience dangerous symptoms.,
Stay consistent.,
Do a weekly easy ride.,
Challenge yourself once a week too.,
Push your limits if you only cycle once per week.",How to Do Indoor Cycling4," If you have health conditions that affect your ability to exert yourself physically for a prolonged period of time, talk to your doctor before attending a cycling class. Further, if you have any injuries that have not fully healed, ask your doctor when you can return to non-contact fitness activities.If you’re hoping to transition out of a mostly sedentary lifestyle, another type of exercise, such as walking, may be a healthier way to start exercising. Talk to your doctor about where to begin, and you will likely be cleared to hop on a bike sooner than later.

, Intense cardio workouts are hard work, and you’ll experience some physical discomfort during a challenging cycling session. However, there are certain signs you should watch out for, as they may indicate an oncoming heart attack or exhaustion. If any of these symptoms develop, stop cycling immediately to rest and drink water.Watch out for sudden, intense pain in your chest, or the feeling of rising pressure or squeezing within your chest. Similarly, don’t ignore irregular heartbeats. If these symptoms persist for more than a few minutes, seek medical assistance.
Extreme shortness breath is also a concern. While you will certainly have labored breathing while cycling, if you’re struggling to breathe or can’t slow down your breathing when you slow your bike down, take a break. If your breath returns to normal, you can always return to cycling.
Stop exercising immediately if you become dizzy or light-headed, or experience nausea and cold sweats. If these sensations do not go away after a few minutes, seek medical attention.

, Cycle three times a week to quickly and steadily improve your fitness level. Of course, the important thing is consistency. If you can only make one class per week, that’s fine – just make sure to go every week! Once you attend a few classes, you can likely simply guide yourself through solo sessions. If you do wish to go off on your own, plan to have one relatively easy weekly workout, one challenging one, and one that really pushes you., For an “easy” ride, simply keep a steady pace and focus on endurance. Ride for an hour to an hour and a half, keeping your RPM between 85 and 100. Add resistance as needed to keep your breath deep and steady throughout the ride. Since this is a more time consuming ride, plan this one for the weekend., For a harder ride, incorporate intervals that bring you right up to the point of discomfort. In other words, work a few long “climbs” into your ride. With heavy resistance to simulate a climb, maintain 70 to 85 RPM for as long as you can. At lower resistances, maintain 90 to 100 RPM. Both of these will likely challenge you. Your breathing will be quicker during these rides, but should remain steady. Cool down as needed, allowing yourself to reduce your RPM for as many minutes as you were able to maintain a higher RPM., Stated simply, intervals of intense cycling will help you burn calories, increase your aerobic capacity and overall fitness, and keep your heart in good shape. These types of workouts are best if you can only fit in one session per week. After working up the bike’s resistance, go as fast as you can for two to four minutes. Allow yourself to slow down as needed, but try to keep your RPM as high as you can while keeping your breath steady and rhythmic."

Try lateral bear crawls.,
Bear crawl backwards.,
Climb ""bear mountain."",
Make a bear square.,
Add a hover.,
Tow a weight sled.",How to Do Bear Crawls2," For a lateral bear crawl, you'll get into the same position as you did for a traditional bear crawl, only instead of moving forward you'll move to the side. This move gets your lateral abdominal muscles engaged.Make sure you're maintaining correct form when doing lateral bear crawls, and that your back remains flat and your spine neutral.
Pay attention to rotation in particular. Your body naturally wants to turn in the direction it's going, so when you're moving sideways you have more of a risk that your hips and pelvis will rotate in that direction rather than remaining oriented parallel to the ground.

, If you've mastered the forward bear crawl, add a backwards bear crawl to your routine. When you get to your distance marker going forwards, simply bear crawl backwards instead of standing and jogging back to your starting mark.The backwards bear crawl is a particularly good workout for your triceps, which will be doing a lot of the work as you crawl.

, To do this bear crawl variation, you'll have to move your workout outdoors. Climbing bear mountain involves doing a traditional forward bear crawl, only up an incline. The steeper the incline, the harder the exercise will be.Form and body position are particularly important when you're on an incline. It can be tempting to lean forward more than you would on level ground, putting more stress on your shoulders.
Make sure you're using your legs as much as you're using your arms. Trying to pull yourself up the incline with only your arms will put too much pressure on your shoulders. Instead, focus on pushing yourself up with your legs.

, Once you can bear crawl forwards, backwards, and sideways while maintaining correct form and technique, put them all together. Mark off the points of your square before you begin, then bear crawl from point to point to form a square.Moving in all directions is a good all-around strength-training exercise that will condition multiple muscle groups at once.
A bear square also is a good full-body warm-up move, particularly for advanced exercisers. With correct form, you can warm up all the muscles in several muscle groups relatively quickly.

, A bear crawl with a hover makes the bear crawl exercise particularly grueling. With each step you take, you're going to pause your front hand and back foot a few inches above the ground and hold them while exhaling fully. Then inhale and complete the motion.You can improve your stability by holding your breath during the hover. Exhale when you're ready to move forward.
Moving side to side can be a risk when performing a bear crawl with hover. To avoid this, imagine you are crawling through a tunnel and there are walls on either side of you that prevent you from moving in any direction other than forward.
If you've been taking larger steps in traditional bear crawls, you may want to take smaller steps when you add the hover. As you become more stable, you can gradually increase the length of your steps.

, If the bear crawl has gotten too easy for you and you're craving some resistance, strap a weight sled over your shoulder and pull it along as you complete your forward bear crawls.Make sure you start far enough away from the sled that the chain is already taut.
As you move your feet forward while towing the sled, it can help to imagine that you are using your feet to drive the floor away from you.
If your hips are above your hands as you move forward, you'll get better leverage from your lower body.

Start with planks.,
Do crab walks for added agility.,
Work your upper body and core with army crawls.,
Increase mobility with the inchworm.",How to Do Bear Crawls3," Since a bear crawl is essentially a moving plank, you should have the plank mastered before you start adding bear crawls to your routine. Having a strong plank can keep you from damaging your back or putting unnecessary stress on your shoulders while you're doing bear crawls.To do a plank, get on the floor on your stomach, with your arms bent at the elbow and your hands under your shoulders. Raise up until your arms are straight. Your legs should be out straight behind you so that the only parts of your body that are touching the floor are your toes and your hands.
When you are in plank position, your entire body should form a straight line (a flat plank) from your heels to your shoulders.
For beginners, you can do planks on your knees rather than your toes. You also can do elbow planks, in which your upper body is supported by your entire forearm and hands on the floor.
You probably shouldn't attempt bear crawls until you can hold a plank in perfect form for several minutes. This ensures you have the core and shoulder strength necessary to perform bear crawls correctly.

, Crab walks work some of the same muscle groups as bear crawls, but since you are on your back those muscles have to work together differently. Doing crab walks in addition to bear crawls can give you more well-rounded muscle development.To do a crab walk, start in a sitting position with your feet on the ground. Your legs should be bent and spread slightly. Lean back a little to put your hands flat on the ground behind you, with your fingers facing towards your body.
From that starting position, lift your body up until you are entirely supported by your hands and your feet. Then you can scuttle along the floor (like a crab) by moving your hands and feet.
You can do crab walks in any direction.

, Army crawls involve upper body strength almost exclusively, and will build strength particularly in your shoulders, upper arms, and upper back.An army crawl starts in the elbow plank position. This is similar to a regular plank position, only you are on your elbows with your forearms and hands touching the ground. Your body should be straight and flat, like a plank of wood.
Then you pull yourself forward, using your shoulders and arms. Your arms should stay in the elbow position with your forearms making contact with the ground as you move forward.
Your core should be locked, so that your hips and pelvis do not sway or rotate. Make sure your legs and feet aren't moving or doing any of the work. Rather, you should be dragging them with your upper body.

, The inchworm combines a crawl exercise with a forward bend, increasing your overall mobility as well as the strength and flexibility of your core muscles.To do an inchworm, start in the standing position. Do a forward bend, placing your hands flat on the floor, close to your toes.
Slowly walk your hands forward without moving your feet. Eventually you'll be in a plank position with your arms extended in front of you.
From this position, walk your feet forward to meet your hands until you find yourself again in a forward bend. Stand and repeat the exercise between 5 and 10 times to make a full set to incorporate into the rest of your workout.

Wear supportive sports bras while you exercise.,
Sleep on your back.,
Don’t allow weight fluctuations.,
Replace your bras when the supportive bands stretch.,
Use anti-aging creams on your neck and upper breast area.,
Apply cold water on your chest.",How to Firm Your Breasts1," The breasts bounce and stretch with each jump or step. Women with large breasts should look for underwire sports bras with thick straps.A sport’s bra should fit more snugly than lingerie. It should wrap around your rib cage.;
, If you favor one side while you sleep, you may find that the top breast sags and stretches more. By staying on your back, you can keep both breasts firmer longer.

, Yo-yo dieting can lead to stretch marks and inelastic skin. Each time you gain weight, your breasts may appear to sag more when you lose it, because the skin has to stretch around extra fat tissue.

, If the last clasps on the bra no longer provide a tight, supportive fit, it is time to replace them. Breast size can change with hormones, weight fluctuations and pregnancy, so get sized for a new bra if your current bra is uncomfortable or too loose.


Maintain the life of your bras by clasping them before you wash them. If you can’t hand wash them, use the gentle cycle and place them in a mesh laundry bag to avoid stretching them., Choose formulas that improve collagen in the skin. They can make your cleavage look more youthful.

, Cold water or even ice can help your breasts avoid sagging.

After you've finished showering rinse your breast with cold water (if using hot water).
You can even rub some ice on them.

Plant your feet.,
Angle your knees.,
Jump up.,
Land your jump lunge.,
Repeat the jump lunge.Hold the lunge position for about two to three seconds after you land before heading into your next one.",How to Do Jump Lunges1," The lunge position requires you to stand with your feet pointing directly ahead hip-width apart. Place one foot about half a meter (two feet) forward of the other. It doesn’t matter if you put your right foot forward of your left or vice versa. Your back foot should be bent at the toe, and your heel should be up at about a 45 degree angle relative to the ground.Find a soft surface, such as a patch of grass, some carpeted or padded floor, or a rubber track. Avoid doing jump lunges on cement.;
, Drop your hips until both knees form right angles. Push your front-most knee out slightly to the side. Keep your back knee and thigh parallel with your body. Do not allow your forward-most knee to extend beyond the ends of your toes.Place your hands on your hips, head, or at your sides., The lunge position enables you to jump with tremendous force. From a lunge position, move as if to stand, but do so quickly. Summon a lot of power to explosively push yourself off the ground with your feet. Pop straight into the air. Once in midair, quickly move your back foot to the frontal position and your front foot to the back.For instance, if -- in your initial lunge position -- your left foot was behind you and your right foot was in front of you, you should move your right foot behind you and place your left foot in front of you.
Jump up, not forward.

, Place your feet at the same distance that you did when assuming the initial lunge position. You should land on your toes without bending your knees further. In other words, since you’ve already adjusted your legs to assume the lunge position in midair, your landing should simply drop you down to return to the position you started in.Your landing should be quiet. This indicates your body is absorbing the shock of the landing and not stressing your joints.

, You should be able to do eight in about 15 to 30 seconds.


When you first begin doing jump lunges, do three to five. As you improve your technique, slowly add one jump lunge each week until you’re doing about eight jump lunges.
You could also increase the difficulty of the jump lunge by making your lunges slightly deeper as you get better.

Buy a natural bristled brush.,
Buy a loofah or exfoliating glove from a drugstore.,
Buy an exfoliation scrub that contains pits, sugar, salt or another natural exfoliating substance.",How to Exfoliate Skin1," If you want to exfoliate outside of the shower, you can use circular motions with a long-handled, natural bristled brush.


This brush is available in the cosmetics section of most box stores, like Target and Walmart, as well as in natural food stores.
Start with your legs and move slowly up your body. Always brush in a circular motion in a small area before moving onto the next area. Work up toward your chest, then brush your back and arms.;
, These products are made with natural sponge and help to exfoliate the skin in the shower.


These products are not suggested for use on the face.

, It should say ""body scrub"" or ""cleansing scrub."" (Do not buy products with beads - these are now illegal in the US due to environmental damage.)


Allow the shower to run over your skin for a few minutes, if you are using an exfoliating scrub or a loofah. Choose warm, not hot, water. Water that is too hot will dry the skin.
Rub the loofah or the scrub over your moist skin in a circular motion. Rinse well. Perform this exfoliation process every 3 to 7 days, depending upon your skin's sensitivity.

Floss, brush your teeth and rinse your mouth out with mouthwash.;
, Nothing beats the natural high you get after a good workout, so do yourself a favor and get motivated to get moving!


Go for a run or hike outdoors -- this will allow you to get some exercise while also enjoying the fresh air. Bring your camera with you in case you find come across any great photo ops!
Go for a swim -- swimming is a great total body workout which will leave you feeling tired but refreshed. If you really want to feel invigorated, try swimming in the ocean!
Take up a dance class -- dance is a great way to get your body moving and burn calories without even realizing it. Try hip-hop, jazz, salsa, ballet or Zumba -- whatever floats your boat!
Try a team sport. Team sports are a great way to socialize and make new friends while also being physically active. Think about joining a volleyball, soccer or ultimate frisbee team in your local area.

, When you eat poorly, your body can feel bloated, sluggish and out of energy. Eating healthily, on the other hand, gives you more energy, allows you to concentrate better and may even help you to slim down.


Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables with every meal, eat lots of protein like turkey, chicken and lean beef, eat lots of oily fish and seafood such as salmon, tuna, sea bass, trout and oysters and eat plenty of healthy whole grains and cereals.
Stay away from foods with a high sugar or fat content and from highly processed foods, as these are bad for your health. These kinds of foods cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar levels, followed by a crash.
Try to control your portion sizes and eat only when you're hungry. However, a number of small, healthy snacks throughout the day can help to boost your metabolism and give you more energy.
Cut down on sugary sodas (even the diet variety which are full of chemical sweeteners) and try to drink more water and green tea.

, Sleep is an essential part of feeling good physically. A lack of sleep will leave you feeling tired, grumpy and out of energy -- pretty much the opposite of feeling amazing!


Try to get a minimum of seven, if not eight hours sleep a night. Set yourself a strict bedtime and don't let yourself stay up too late reading, watching TV or wasting time on the internet.
Do something relaxing before bed -- don't watch scary movies or play exciting video games, as these raise your heart rate and make it more difficult to sleep. Try reading a book, listening to gentle music or taking a relaxing bath instead.
Make sure your bedroom is nice and dark, as light can trick your brain into thinking it's daytime and prevent you from falling asleep. Make your bed as comfortable as possible and use clean, fresh sheets.

Start with pushups.,
Do chest fly.,
Try a “C” sweep.,
Use TRX bands.,
Do a chest workout three times a week, with a day of rest in between.",How to Firm Your Breasts2," Try 3 different types of pushups to firm different areas of your chest and back. Do pushups in a knee plank, if you can’t do a full plank position.


Do regular push-ups. Get on all fours, and then unbend your knees and support your body with your feet and arms. Place your arms directly below your shoulders with the fingers pointing straight up. Do 5 very slow push-ups as low as you can go. Then, do 10 faster pushups.
Try military style pushups. Move your arms slightly wider than shoulder width. Then, turn your arms so the fingers are pointing inward at a 45-degree angle. Do 5 slow push-ups and 10 fast push-ups.
Follow up with tricep push-ups. Move your arms to shoulder width apart. As you lower yourself into the pushup, make sure your elbows go directly down, brushing against your rib cage. Do 5 slow and 10 fast pushups.

, Lay on the floor. Take a hand weight between 3 and 7 lbs. (1.4 to 3.2 kg) in each hand.


Bend your elbows slightly. Raise your arms until the weights meet each other just above your chest.
Slowly lower them until your upper arms are perpendicular to your trunk. Your lower arms should be slightly above the floor. Repeat with 2 to 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
If the exercise is too easy, get a slightly heavier set of weights.

, Instead of lowering your arms to the sides, lower them to the ground above your head. The weights should stay a few inches apart as you lower and raise them to ensure you aren’t creating a muscle imbalance.


Don’t allow your rib cage to lift as you bring them over your head. Use your upper ab muscles to keep your back and rib cage engaged.Do 3 sets of 10.

, Instead of using free weights for tricep and bicep curls, use suspension bands at your local gym. Walk your legs forward and lean back in an inclined position.Keep your upper arms close to your chest to do bicep curls.
Open and lift your arms to the sides for chest fly and presses.
Lean forward on the bands with your arms to close to your chest to perform tricep curls. Start with your wrists near your armpits and push down until your arms are straight.
Hand down with your legs in front of you in a pike position to ready yourself for shoulder presses. Lift your body up till your arms are in a 90-degree angle, then lower yourself down.
Repeat in 2 to 3 sets of 10 for all exercises.

, These exercises will tone the pecs and arms. As your pectoral muscles lift, your boobs will look firmer and perkier.

Take care of your knees.,
Pay attention to your body’s feedback.,
Don’t sacrifice proper form for speed.",How to Do Jump Lunges2," Lunges can put a strain on the knees. If you have a history of knee pain or problems with your knees, look for another exercise. Alternately, keep your feet closer together when you try a lunge. The closer your feet are together when you lunge, the shallower your lunge will be, and the less likely it is that you’ll hurt yourself.You could also try a reverse lunge.In this variation, instead of putting one foot forward, you put one foot behind you before dropping into the standard lunge position.

, If your forward leg hurts, increase the angle of your knee. In other words, don’t bend as deeply or lunge as far as you have been. If you continue to experience pain or have trouble balancing yourself, try to add some support by using skiing poles or leaning against a chair or weight rack to help you maintain balance., Many people find that one way to increase the challenge of lunges is to increase their speed. If you’re training to build endurance during climbing or skiing, for instance, increasing the pace at which you perform your jump lunges can be beneficial.If your knees twist, then you might hurt yourself. Always keep your knees, toes, and hips facing in the same direction when you are doing lunges.

Your doctor may use microdermabrasion, which uses a mechanical device to remove skins cells. These may include salt crystals or wire brushes.
Your doctor may also suggest chemical peels. These peels use stronger acids that are useful when treating acne. They are not for use with all skin types.

Read a book.,
Start learning a new language.,
Do some math problems.,
Have a stimulating conversation.,
Travel.",How to Feel Amazing2," Books are amazing objects filled with imagination and information, and reading is like exercise for your mind.


Reading a book -- whether it's a work of fiction, a historical account or an encyclopedia -- will sharpen your mind, educate you and help you to feel smarter and more informed about the world.

, Learning a new language is a fun endeavor and a really productive thing to do in your spare time.


Try to focus on the conversational side of your new language, don't get too bogged down in grammar rules or learning tenses.
Remember that having a conversation with a native speaker is a lot more rewarding than learning verb tables!

, If you haven't given your math skills any attention in a while, you could try searching online for some fun and challenging problems to solve.


It may sound like a nerdy thing to do, but it will keep your mind sharp and is a lot more worthwhile than binge-watching Netflix!

, These days, people are so obsessed with messaging each other through phones, computers and tablets that they often forget the pleasures of simple conversation.


Try turning off any technology, grabbing a cup of tea or coffee and having a good, old-fashioned chinwag, whether it's with your best friend, your grandmother or a complete stranger.
Gaining another person's unique insight or perspective is always beneficial, regardless of the subject matter.

, Travelling opens your eyes and exposes you to a range of new experiences and perspectives.


Whether you choose to climb an active volcano in Central America, or zip around on a scooter in Rome, going to a new place and trying new things will be an unforgettable experience that's sure to make you feel amazing!

Hang out with friends and family.,
Spend time with animals.,
Give someone a hug.,
Write a journal entry.,
Do a good deed.",How to Feel Amazing3," When you're feeling a little down, the best thing you can do is to hang out with people who love you.


It could be a group of your best friends, your significant other, your siblings or your parents -- as long as it's someone who knows you well, makes you laugh and can remind you how great you are!

, Spending time with animals (particularly cute baby animals!) can have a calming, relaxing effect on people, lifting their spirits and making them feel happy.


So next time you're in need of an emotional boost, hang out with your dog, cat, bunny, horse, donkey or whatever animal you can get your hands on!
Talk to them stroke, them or just be with them....you'll soon feel amazing.

, Hugs are scientifically proven to make you feel happier, so try to give at least one or day. Although a quick, one-armed hug will do, a nice, tight, ten-second bear hug is even better, if you can manage it!

, If you don't feel like talking to anyone, writing down your thoughts in a journal or diary can be extremely cathartic.


You can burn the pages afterwards if you like -- it's the act of writing something down and getting it off your chest that counts.

, Doing a good deed will make you feel really good about yourself while also making someone else's day a little brighter.


Buy coffee for the person behind you in line, leave an extra chocolate bar in the drawer of the vending machine or donate some money to charity.

Do an outdoor lunge.,
Lunge with weights.,
Go deeper with your lunge.",How to Do Jump Lunges3," Outdoor lunges are not only a great way to get some fresh air, but can also prepare you for the real-world conditions you might face. If your lunges are a way to prepare for climbing or cross country, you would benefit from practicing your lunges on terrain that resembles the terrain you will spend most of your time on. Find a semi-empty nature trail or hilly area where you can practice., You could lunge with hand weights or ankle weights. Choose a weight level that is appropriate for your body type and strength level. Start slowly by adding just one pound in each hand or on each ankle, then adding weight slowly to each limb in half-pound increments. When 8 to 12 reps produces a significant strain, you’re at your maximum weighted lunge limit.Free weights, dumbbells, and ankle weights are available at most fitness and sporting goods stores.

, Depending on how deep your lunge was to start with, you might not have much room to deepen your lunge. If you do, though, you can strengthen your butt or improve your range of motion. Just make sure that you do not extend your front knee beyond the tips of your toes. Keep your shin vertical."

Pick out flattering formal attire.,
Wear clothing that is appropriate for a special event setting.,
Accessorize for your ensemble.,
Wash and style your hair.",How to Dress for the Theatre1," In some cases, such as opening nights and special ""black tie"" events hosted by the theater, attending a stage production might require formal dress. For these occasions, you should plan to piece together some of the more elegant selections from your wardrobe. Typically, black and white will be the best chromatic choices for such events.If a production is advertised as ""black tie"" or ""white tie,"" or if it's an inherently formal type of event, like an opening night or opera, this means that formal dress standards are expected.;
, In contemporary times, the rules of formal dress have changed somewhat. One effective strategy is to dress in a manner similar to the way you would for a night out at an upscale restaurant, or perhaps even a professional setting. If you're a woman, this may be a mid-length skirt or pant suit, although evening wear like a tasteful cocktail dress will create a more alluring look. Men should choose a well-fitting suit in dark, neutral evening hues; shirtsleeves with a tie and pressed slacks are also generally acceptable.For modern formal theater events, the same attire you might wear to a wedding, funeral or charity dinner will generally be sufficient.

, Finalize your formal look with necklaces, bracelets, watches and other jewelry. Wear closed-toes shoes with appropriate stockings or dress socks, even in the summer. Carry a matching purse or handbag for small belongings (if you have a larger bag that might take up too much aisle space, leave it at home). And, of course, be courteous to the actors and other patrons and keep cell phones and other devices put away until after the show.Oversized or abundant jewelry can look gaudy and distract from a sharp outfit.
Binoculars are permissible if the theater where the production is being staged is quite large, or for those with who have trouble seeing at a distance. Because they don't make noise or emit light, like phones and camera, binoculars are considered normal theater accessories.

, Your hair is also a vital part of your appearance. Scruffy hair that is tangled and in need of a wash can spoil an otherwise dapper ensemble, so be sure to wash it the night before or the morning of the show. Buns, loose curls or straightened hair is encouraged for women. Men should keep hair tamed with pomade, slick or part hair that is grown out or pull long hair back neatly.Consult a style guide for options on how to style hair of your consistency and length.
As silly as it sounds, hats and tall hairdos can obstruct the view of the people sitting around you. As a rule, hats should not be worn indoors, and you should think of the other theater patrons when coiffing your locks.

Start off with what music you listen to.,

Now makeup: If you're nice to everyone, happy, get good grades, do something clean and add a little colour.",How to Express Yourself Through Clothes and Hair," Rock, pop, or the blues, r&b and so on. After you're done deciding, make a list of all the different types of music you listen to. However, if you only like to listen to one artist or one band in that genre, feel free to write the person's/band's name down instead.;
, If you're not sure, ask someone. Could be your teacher, family, or friends. After you're done add this to the list.

, (ex: your country of origin, nature, actions, popular quotes, etc.)

, Anything that is related on your list and you like it, get it. Don't spend too much money. You're going to need some more later on of course, especially if your saving up for something special. Again, don't end up spending money on something that's not you. After you're done buying things that represent you, move on to the next step.

, Decorate, decorate, decorate. Find things you could put on your shirt. Rhinestones, ribbon, buttons, glitter, write stuff down with fabric marker as long as it is you. Don't make it too much though.

,, Everyone wants a hairstyle they like, but it has to suit you as well and go with your personality. This could be bangs, layers, simple style, trims, short hair, long hair, coloured hair! Anything. Before you do so, go to a professional hair stylist and ask if it will look good on you. Also pay close attention to if you really like it, it suits you and looks good. Don't cut it yourself, unless you've done it before and loved it. As for colouring your hair, go with your favourite colour, something that you'd like, could be multicoloured, maybe even streaks. If you don't want to cut or colour, find some hairstyles that you like and do them to school or to the mall, or a party.

, If you're into music, do something funky. Don't cake makeup all over your face if you don't feel like it's necessary - you could get loads of acne and bumps all over your face. If you don't want to use a lot of makeup, just moisturise your face daily and add some mascara and lip gloss.

Take pictures of your outfits and item piles.,
Now that you've figured out your outfits, put some thought into hair and makeup.",How to Envision Your New Style," Read some magazines, watch your favorite shows, and read inspirational blogs. Are there people who inspire you? (Classmates, celebrities, etc.) Is there a specific time period you like? (80s, Victorian Gothic, etc.) Are there any styles that influence you now? (preppy, punk, etc.) Once you have an idea of what you want to look like, stick with it.;
, You can even make a fashion mood board or a Polyvore collage with clothing, colors, and inspirational pictures.

, What are the key elements that stand out in this look? Here are some examples: Scene kids have their cute plastic jewelry or colorful hair clips, punk kids love biker-style jackets or schoolgirl skirts, and almost everyone loves skinny jeans. Write a minimum of 5 key fashion items for your style. This should include apparel, shoes, makeup, jewelry, etc.

, These are the essentials or extras you don't already have. Here's an example: Doc Martens, stud leather satchel, and Lady Gaga hair bow. If you're on a budget, poke around the mall and internet to find your wants at lower prices. Shopping online is good as well, although buying accessories and jewelry over the internet is recommended over buying shoes and apparel (you can't really try on the clothes from your desk chair). Use all the coupon codes you can find.

,, Organize them in piles or stacks in outfits, colors, clothing type, etc.

, Try them on, see what you would fix about each outfit, and rearrange the pieces accordingly.

, If they match your desired look, print them out and make a collage or two. Place the collage in your closet or next to your dresser, or somewhere you can see it (especially on a day when you're not sure what to wear).

, Get your hair done, watch some YouTube hair tutorials, etc. If you include makeup, the ""basics"" commonly include lipstick or gloss, foundation, at least one eyeshadow pallet with colors you love, and eyeliner (liquid is good, but you'll need steady hands).

Wash your face no less than two times a day; in the morning and before you go to bed. Be gentle. If you scrub really hard you will only irritate your skin. Don't ever sleep with your make-up on. Your pores will get clogged and you'll start breaking out. After washing your face, use a good moisturizer that is made for your skin type. If you have blackheads or whiteheads, try using Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.;
, Wash your hair as often as needed.Don't let it get greasy. Use deodorant. Moisturize your skin daily. It's best to do this after you shower because your skin is still damp and the lotion will soak in easily. Grooming your nails is also important. Keep them cut short and buff them once every couple of weeks to keep them smooth and nice. Push back your cuticles to prevent hangnails. Don't ever cut them! If you like nail polish, try using a sheer pink color or clear coat them. If you use a sheer pink color, use one coat so the natural color variations of your nails show through. It really does look nice.

, When getting your hair cut, make sure you know exactly what you want. If you're not sure then ask your hairdresser for a cut that will go with your face shape. Don't dye your hair; keep it natural. If you must, find a color that's close to your natural color, only better. Try not to use heat devices to style your hair. You can look up tutorials on curling or straightening your hair without heat on YouTube. Don't spend a ton of time styling your hair. The whole point is to bring out your natural beauty. Find a way to rock your natural style.

, Find your favorite facial feature and capitalize it. But don't overdo it if you go one day without all the makeup everybody will notice and their thoughts won't be very good. If your teeth aren't as white as they could be, don't wear bright lipstick. This will draw attention to the contrast. Instead, for example, wear a dark mascara. This will bring out the intensity/ beauty of your eyes.

, Make yourself do it. It's the ultimate act of self-respect. Soak in the bubble bath or read an inspiring book. These little pleasures allow you to feel special. You can fake it if you need to until you actually feel deserving of it. Whatever you choose, follow the action by writing down what you did and how it made you feel. Make it your own ""attitude file"". Include stories, quotes from friends and photographs that have made you feel good about yourself.

, Feel good, feel pretty and that's what the world will see. If you feel ugly, that's what people will see. Try to look as good as you can. There are ways to live in beauty without being obsessive about it.

, What people say, whether intentional or not, make us feel good or bad about ourselves. Look for people who make you feel good when you're down. This person will give you compliments. If you've done something different or if you're wearing something new, they will notice it. Keep these compliments and they will build your self esteem.

, Each of us has a voice inside our head that will give us advice. This is like a therapist. It will guide us in the right direction. It will calm us down, cheer us up and even help us figure out why we're overeating or not bothering to iron our clothes. The problem is that we often don't take the time we need to hear this important information. Schedule some quiet time in a leisurely bath or walk, or even while putting on your make-up. Treat this intuition as an inner cheering section.

, Relax. At least twice a day, set aside five minutes to recheck your make-up, hair, posture and clothing. No matter how impeccably you started out your day, a touch is both necessary and warranted. Take some deep breaths to renew and restore your appearance.

, (These are convenient, money saving and work!) Some that I use are; An egg. Which is brilliant as a facial- crack the egg in half and separate the egg whites and yolk. Roughly whisk the egg white in a bowl and apply to your face (leave on for approximately 5 minutes). Wash off with slightly warm water. Next apply the yolk (which is a great moisturizing ingredient) leave on for again 5 minutes then wash with lightly warm water. Another is a Tomato; wash your face with slightly warm water. Cut the tomato in half and rub gently around your full face (this can be done 2/3 per week a gentle exfoliator) leave on for 10 minutes to soak up the goodness and then lightly rinse face with warm water, then freezing cold (to close your beautiful pores!). Finish off with your favorite skin appropriate moisturizer. Learn more easy home-made beauty tips online.

Wear the proper bra.,
Draw attention with a statement piece of jewelry.,
Wear plunging necklines.,
Look for ruching, ruffles, or even fringe.",How to Dress to Add Curves to Your Body1," Select a bra with pads in the cups and one with a solid underwire to provide lift and support. A plunge shape and half-cup style create the illusion of additional curviness while also providing versatile support.You can even combine these with ""chicken fillets""- flesh colored breast emulators made of synthetic material that slip under your natural breast when wearing a bra to give further volume. These are available for purchase at most lingerie stores.
An estimated 85% of women wear the wrong bra size. Many stores that sell lingerie offer free bra fittings. Take advantage of this service to ensure that your bra is not only comfortable but providing the proper support. You can also avoid “back overspill” with the proper measurements.;
, Pull eyes upward and keep them there by wearing a striking necklace. Or, put on a sweater with a bejeweled or embellished neckline.


Sparkly or eye-catching embellishments on your upper-half also serve to distract from a less-than-curvy lower body.
With a minimalist outfit, a small, thin chain necklace that drapes down into your cleavage will also create the illusion of fullness.

, Choose tops with lower necklines, such as deep Vs or wrap tops, as they open up your bust line and draw attention to your face. High necklines have the opposite effect and create one block of fabric and color, resulting in a boxy appearance.To achieve this look for a button-down, without the risk of exposure, visit a tailor and ask to have darts sewn in to the lower buttons.
For added modesty, wear a camisole under your top.

, Purchase dresses and tops with fabric gathers and embellishments over the bust area. These additional fabric folds help to create volume while drawing attention upward.Beware of tops that include darts or inlaid boning that you cannot fill out naturally.

Understand What a Personal Legend Is...,
Acknowledge your Personal Legend


The language of the world will attempt to reveal your personal legend to you in many different ways, whether it be through omens, mentors or signs.,
Have a Clear Goal


Create for yourself a goal in which you will be able to realize when you have completed your Legend.,
Do not be a Sheep


Coelho uses Santiago's sheep to illustrate a life of someone who has ignored the call to their Personal Legend.,
Appreciate the Simple Things


The gypsy tells Santiago that ""It's the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them"" (15).

,
When You Feel Like Giving Up, Don't


 Sometime during your quest, you will feel as if the universe is not conspiring to help you achieve your Legend.,
Let Go of Your Fears and Doubts


Santiago realizes after hearing about the baker's ignorance to his Personal Legend that ""there nothing to hold him back except himself"" (28).,
Follow the Omens!!,
Change your Outlook and Learn from Every Obstacle


Like the old saying ""You cannot change the direction of the wind, you can only adjust your sails,"" Santiago realizes that when he thinks positively about his situation he is much closer to his legend.,
Carpe Diem!,
Go with your Gut


Santiago begins to understand that ""intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life... where we are able to know everything"" (74).,
Realize When You've Arrived at your Personal Legend


Since you have defined a goal early on, you should be able to realize when you have completed your Personal Legend.",How to Embrace and Follow Your Personal Legend,"


When Santiago meets the old King of Salem, Melchizedek, he teaches the boy for the first time what a Personal Legend is. He says that a Personal Legend is ""what you have always wanted to accomplish"" (21).;
, Whichever way you come to know your personal legend it is important that you acknowledge it and take action to make your dreams a reality. After all, ""when you really want something, the universe always conspires in your favour"" (36). It is easiest for people to realize their legend when they are young because ""at that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their life. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend"" (21). This is why Santiago is the ideal candidate, because he has not become jaded over time. That being said, you are able to pursue your Personal Legend at ANY time in your life!

, Without a clear, explicit goal, or Personal Legend, it is impossible to ever achieve it. The King said that ""you must always know what it is that you want"" (56). Santiago's goal was to find the treasure awaiting him in Egypt.

, They live a mundane life, where ""all they think about is food and water"" (11). While these are important things, there is so much more to life than just the necessities. Money and greed corrupt some people so that all they think about is how to get more, which is similar to how the sheep are focused only on one thing at a time. The sheep ""don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day,"" (11) very similar to the way some people get so caught up in the day-to-day that they forget to stop and smell the roses.

,, At this point, the King will ""always appear in one form or another. Sometimes appears in the form of a solution, or a good idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, makes it easier for things to happen"" (23). He goes on to say that often times he does other little things, but people rarely notice them. Santiago experiences this when he first arrives in Tangiers and is robbed. He thinks to himself that he's ""too insignificant to conquer the world"" (39), and is really down on himself, but that is when he remembers the stones the King gave him. This omen tells him to continue on his journey! Remember the old proverb, ""It is said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn""

, The main reason why the average person, including the baker and the crystal merchant, will fail to seek out their Personal Legend is safety. People are more concerned with making a name for themselves and being comfortable that they choose to settle for an average life. When Santiago meets the camel driver, he reveals to Santiago that people ""are always afraid of losing what have, whether it's life, or possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when understand that life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand"" (76). By trusting in fate, you are able to free yourself from these fears. The alchemist teaches Santiago this as well when he says "" Don't give into your fears... If you do, you won't be able to follow your heart... There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure"" (141). Without fearing failure, you are free to pursue any path you like.

,


I can't stress the importance of this step enough! Omens help guide Santiago in his quest and the King reiterates this lesson over again before he leaves, so that Santiago will not forget it, saying, ""Don't forget the language of omens"" (30). The crystal merchant asks Santiago at one point, ""Why ask more out of life?"" and Santiago replies, ""Because we have to respond to omens"" (52). It's clear that the merchant has not responded to the omens, and that is why he has a hard time understanding Santiago's constant quest for greatness.

, After receiving the omen from the King in Tangiers, he thought to himself that ""this wasn't a strange place, it was a new one"" (41). Also, when facing the vast desert Santiago has to cross to reach Egypt, he recalls ""learned things from the sheep, and learned things from crystal... can learn something from the desert, too"" (73). Even though Santiago is not thrilled with the long walk ahead of him, he knows that if he looks positively towards his obstacle, he'll be able to learn valuable lessons from it.

,


""I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought... But maybe I'll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in Egypt.... The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours closer to his treasure"" (64). Santiago knows that his old life is always waiting for him, but if he doesn't pursue his Personal Legend now, he may never be able to do it again. The camel driver also says to him, ""If you can concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man"" (85). Since this is such an important message, it comes up again when the topic of the seer comes up. The seer says ""The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better... Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity"" (103). Seize the day, and don't be distracted by the past, or future.

, Our heart knows how to interpret the omens, and therefore knows the right decision when our conscious mind is not able to decide on its own. Santiago later realizes that he ""and his heart had become friends, and neither now was capable of betraying each other"" (134). When you really get to know your heart, you are able to listen to the soul of the world. The Alchemist tells Santiago, ""You already know what you need to know. I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure"" (115). This quote illustrates how the power to find your Personal Legend within you, otherwise it wouldn't be your Legend! Your mentors will only give you the nudge in the right direction that you may need from time to time.Trust that you and your heart can always make the right decision.

, After this, you may find that you discover another, and another yet. Whatever you do, whether you are content where you are, or you strive for more, do not forget the lessons you have learned in your journey. After all, it is not necessarily they goal you must pursue, instead savour the time it takes you to get there!

Go with acceptably casual garb.,
Dress plainly and comfortably.,
Take advantage of the season.,
Practice good hygiene.",How to Dress for the Theatre2," ""Casual"" as a mode of dress has a different meaning than is typically assumed, so don't show up wearing just anything. If a casual dress style is best suited for a certain production, you will still be expected to present a nice appearance because even though there may not be a formal dress code imposed, as an audience member you are agreeing to be part of a meticulously organized event. Shorts, t-shirts, tanktops and sandals will not fly here: think ""dinner at slightly upscale restaurant,"" not ""lazy evening after work."", Remember how your mother used to dress you for Easter Sunday or to go visit your relatives? Take cues from mom's casual style. Good choices for men are khakis, polos or button-down shirts and loafers or boat shoes. Women arguably have more options: a simple blouse and skirt will work just fine, or you might break out a sundress or knit sweater and tights depending on the weather.


No matter what you wear, make sure you are dressed for comfort. You will be sitting down for a couple of hours, so settle on garments that don't chafe and aren't too snug.

, There are many wonderful seasonally-exclusive pairings when it comes to dressing and accessorizing. Make use of them. Spring and summer is the time to work with lighter colors and fabrics like pastels, while fall and winter favor heavier materials and an intricate layered look. Cardigans, corduroy, dress boots and linen can all become components of a spruced-up seasonal style.The theater may get a little hot or chilly in certain climates. Bring a warm extra layer that you can shed if need be.

, Just because the event isn't a formal one doesn't mean you shouldn't go to the necessary lengths to make yourself presentable. Keep hair and clothing clean and arranged; tuck in loose shirt tails and don't wear skirts or dresses that fall above the thigh-line, or tops that expose too much cleavage. You'll be in a crowded theater right next to other audience members, so freshen up your deodorant. If perfume or cologne is desired, it should be applied lightly, as excessively strong fragrances are overpowering.Brushing your teeth, trimming your nails, wearing clean socks and washing your face and hands are also good hygienic habits to be in. It would be embarrassing to be a nuisance to other theatergoers because of the way you look or smell.

"
"
Know what is expected.,
Buy and wear merchandise.,
Put on costumes and facepaint.,
Wear everyday clothes.",How to Dress for the Theatre3," Not all theaters will require the same formality of dress. Pay attention to what kind of production you'll be attending and decide the most appropriate way to dress. For instance, it's improbable that a production aimed for children will require any particular fashion sensibilities, whereas attending even a small, locally produced opera might make you want to consider nicer wardrobe choices. In this case it's all about context. Special black tie events and opening nights will usually call for formal attire, while you should feel free to dress casually for the average Broadway or matinee show, or for more conceptual dramas like those put on by black box theaters.


It can be a good idea to run a search or call up the theater managers before a show to find out whether there is an expected dress code.
If you're ever uncertain about what to wear to a given event and have no guidelines to follow, it's usually alright to go casual.

, If you've seen the show before, or if a merchandise booth is selling souvenirs before the show, grab a t-shirt or hat to show your support. Many long-running or family oriented shows appreciate when fans show up wearing that production's apparel. These products are often unique and exclusive to that live performance, so you'll never have a better chance to model them.

, This is a no-no for most opening nights and more focused productions, but for established shows like The Lion King and Wicked it is encouraged and can be a lot of fun, especially for younger kids. Dress yourself or your child up as your favorite characters and have fun immersing yourself in the event. Just don't go too overboard with costumes and props—remember, an audience member's appearance can be distracting.


Do some research to find out whether a particular show recommends the use of costumes and props before you buy your tickets and decide what to wear. Even then, keep elaborate costumes reasonable and don't be tempted to act out or make noise during the show.

, In rare instances it may be okay to come as you are. Off-Broadway shows and smaller productions usually don't mandate a dress code, so jeans and sneakers won't be an issue. Make sure you always know ahead of time what the expected mode of dress is for a given production or venue, and enjoy an increasingly uncommon opportunity to present yourself fashionably at a formal society event.


Even if normal clothes are allowed, it's never a bad idea to dress nicely. Your appearance says something about your character, so make sure it has good things to say."
"
Sport an A-line or full skirt.,
Don a pencil skirt.,
Cinch with a belt.,
Consider high-waisted pieces.",How to Dress to Add Curves to Your Body2," Opt for a short length or peplum (a form-fitted skirt with a small puff on the hips), a knee-length for a neutral and preppy look, or go full retro with a calf-length skirt. Full skirts add volume to the hips, while drawing attention to a narrow waist.Just think of 1950's skirts and you'll be able to select the right one.
If it's a longer skirt, you could even wear layers, such as petticoats made of tulle, underneath to increase the fullness.

, Choose a pencil skirt that's made of fabric that clings to the body to get instant curves. A wide waistband also helps by creating an illusion of movement from waist to hip.


A pencil shirt should sit at your natural waist, about two inches above your belly button. Any lower and you risk unflattering flaring of the fabric along your hips. The skirt should extend to just about an inch or two above the knee., Choose a wider belt (3-6 inches in width), often called a corselet, which is specifically designed to minimize the waist. Wearing the right belt can break up the straight lines associated with a boxy or boyish figure.


If you have a narrower frame, a wide belt may appear overpowering. Instead, opt for a slim belt worn over matching apparel. A dark brown leather belt worn over a chocolate sweater dress, for example.

, Wearing a high-waisted garment creates the illusion of a smaller waist while elongating the leg line. Jeans and skirts both come in high-waisted options and benefit greatly from tailoring to ensure the proper fit.High-waisted pants with wide legs are particularly good at providing figure balance with a slimmer torso.

Wear panties with extra padding.,
Go for large pockets.,
Love a snug fit.",How to Dress to Add Curves to Your Body3," You can buy specialized pairs of underwear that contain built-in padding for your bottom. They follow the same principals as push-up bras, but for your backside. They go by many different brand names and are available for purchase online and in stores that sell lingerie.


A silken texture is a good option for this undergarment as it will not cling to, or bunch up with, outer clothing.

, Choose pants with larger pockets in the back. The size of the pockets will create a fuller look. High-rise jean styles often include more obvious pockets, making this cut a particularly good way to create feminine curves., You want your pants or skirts to hug your body without being too tight (to the point of showing blemishes and the like). If you are wearing baggy clothes, the extra fabric will gather around your backside, making it look almost empty in appearance. Instead, look for a fabric and cut that moves with you."

Put on a pair of heels.,
Visit a tailor.",How to Dress to Add Curves to Your Body4," Remove all extra garments, including indoor coats. Wear only the items that you absolutely need to stay warm. Burying yourself under layers of clothing hides the lines of your body, resulting in a boxy silhouette.


Coats are naturally bulky but can be a necessary layer, so look for one with a cinched belt to carve out an hourglass shape.

, Purchase a v-neck wrap dress with a dynamic and colorful print. The pattern will help to conceal any imperfections and will create a sharp silhouette. Likewise, vertical stripes add curves by flaring out at the bust and hips.""Illusion dresses"" are form-fitted with two main front panels that may be pale or white, paired with two dark side panels (often black). They are designed to make your waist look smaller and your bust and hip larger in comparison.

, A benefit of the wrap dress is that it is flattering to all figure types. Tying the dress closed at the waist creates the same effect as a cinching belt. Make sure to purchase the right size in a high quality fabric in order to avoid clinginess.

, Wearing heels makes your legs appear longer and leaner while adding contrast and fullness to your hip and backside area. This is especially the case when you wear fitted or tapered garments.


A neutral, or nude, heel is even better as it creates the illusion of the never-ending leg, thus amplifying the slimming effect on the waistline as well., Make an appointment with your local tailor and bring a few favorite clothing pieces with you. Ask them for specific ideas as to how to accentuate your feminine curves using those particular garments.

, People connect money with success, so wearing an expensive scarf, belt, watch or coat can help a boss perceive prosperity., If you have a low-paying job, but you only wear designer fashions, your boss may get the idea that you aren’t smart with money or you aren’t grounded.

, If you don’t have the time or the ability to iron your pants and shirts, get them ironed at your local laundry. You may make up the extra expense with your next promotion.The same is true for business casual environments. Your slacks and dresses should not look crumpled.

, Choose your outfit the night before if you know you’ll be in a rush.

, Older, more senior people tend to dress more conservatively, so use color in your accessories, rather than your basic suits.

, If your company seems to appreciate people with good fashion sense, then try brighter colors and a few fashion pieces. If a company party is coming up and you want the CEO to notice you, pick a color dress or tie color that is a little unusual, but still conservative.

We hold back our thoughts and this can stop us from developing our full potential.;

Organizational skills – the more organized you are the easier the road to success will be, plan out your ideas to their fullest before putting them into action
Learn from mistakes – you will make mistakes along the way but you can learn valuable lessons from these and move on
Confidence in yourself – you have to be self-confident and believe in yourself and your ideas, there is no room for doubt
Stay realistic – don’t set yourself goals that you cannot realistically achieve in a set amount of time, by setting yourself unrealistic goals you are setting yourself up for failure again and again.

, Once you have these facts clear then you can go full steam ahead towards achieving what you want.

It's common for people as they get older to become disconnected with what they enjoy.Write down a list of hobbies and interests that you enjoy and think of ways to incorporate them into your current life.

Start applying to jobs in your new industry.,
Get out of your current career.,
Ensure that you are financially stable for the transition.,
Remain dedicated and work hard towards your goals.",How to Do What You Love2," Use social media and your networking contacts to locate a new job in the industry you're passionate about. Ask around and see if friends know of any job openings for entry level positions in your desired industry.


Go through your list of friends on your Facebook or LinkedIn and determine who is working in your dream career. Reach out to them through direct messages and ask them if they know of anyone hiring for entry level positions.
If you notice that someone has been posting pictures revolving around career that you love, call them and ask them how they got started in it.
You can say something like, ""I don't have much experience, but I realized that doing this is my passion. I just need an opportunity to gain some experience. Do you know of any companies that are hiring?""

, Just because you love doing something doesn't mean that you'll love doing it professionally. A great way to determine whether you'll like your new profession is by interning part-time. Search online for any fellowship or intern programs being offered by companies that you'd want to work for.


Some interests and hobbies like graphic design, art, or writing, may have many different operations in a professional environment opposed to doing it casually.

, If you have a job, use any downtime to start applying for jobs in the industry that you love. You can wake up early, fill out applications during your lunch break, or search for jobs after work. If you are unemployed, try applying to jobs every day until you get callbacks and requests for interviews. Treat looking for a new job like a job itself, and keep strict hours for applying to different positions.


Use websites like Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, and Craigslist to find job openings.

, If you feel unhappy in the career you are currently in then you should consider getting out of your current job. Do not let fear of change paralyze you into not looking for another career.Always leave on good terms, give at least two weeks notice, and get references before you leave.


If you can't overcome your fear of change, visualize yourself in your current position for the next five years and think of how unhappy you'll be.
It may be hard to leave your current job because of how comfortable you feel, but don't let this get in the way of your dreams.

, While doing something that you love is enjoyable, it's important to remember that you'll still need to take care of your responsibilities. Make a list of all your expenses per month and calculate how much you'll need to be paid in your new job.


If you are concerned with switching careers because of financial reasons, start looking for new jobs while working at your old one.

, Doing a job that you love requires dedication and passion. If you aren't already established in the industry that you are looking to excel in, it may be hard to build up experience at first. Put in the work and don't give up just because it gets hard. Passion will generate good results and employers will see your hard work.


Be ready to put in overtime and serious effort to become good at your new job.
If someone criticizes you, don't take it personally. Try to look at their advice from an objective view and use it to improve your skills.
You may have a hard time obtaining an interview at first. Keep applying for jobs and look for positions that don't require a lot of experience.
If you feel like you aren't moving towards your goals, take a step back and reevaluate. Consider going back to school or getting an additional certificate to improve your chances.

Hobbies can include singing, dance, learning an instrument, or taking an art class.

, Refrain from making excuses and practice regularly. Life can become busy, and it's easy to put the hobby you love on the backburner for more important things. Try scheduling your day out and lessen the time you spend on other tasks so you can fit in room for your hobby.


Eliminate other time-consuming tasks like watching TV or surfing the web and dedicate that time to your hobby instead., Friends and family may be critical of your new hobby if it's different than what you normally do, or they don't agree with it. Don't let this persuade you not to pursue the hobby you love. Don't listen to people that say you can't do it, and take the time to learn about your hobby and get better at it.


Don't quit a hobby just because other people think it's silly. If it makes you happy and you genuinely enjoy doing it, stick with it.

, If you are new to your hobby, or you haven't been practicing it for a long time, there's a good chance you'll need to get better at it. Most people won't be proficient at a task without being given the time to practice. Age may also play a factor in your new hobby and could prevent you from doing it well if it's physical and you're out of shape or have health conditions. Evaluate yourself honestly, and set goals that are realistic to your abilities.

, Honesty is not a policy or business transaction. It is the most natural and profitable way of leading life. And it is not as difficult as it is made out to be. Start with an understanding that Honesty is a value and not an attribute. Each value has a denominator. Fix your denominator for this value. Start with the conviction that no one is either 100% or 0% honest. Grid yourself: somewhere in between the extremes. Start being less dishonest every day and slowly graduate to being more honest every day. If you feel that you are more honest today than you were yesterday move yourself up the grid a little. Be very conservative and mean while grading yourself. Let your physical being work hard and deliver definitive measurable results to convince your inner being. Don’t be charitable to yourself, but celebrate small success. This will encourage and motivate you to raise the bar daily and perhaps even many times in a day. Keep comparing the percentage daily/weekly growth and set new goals.

, Not every human being is as empowered or as privileged as you may be, people with lesser attributes or lesser privileges are not lesser human beings. They may be children of lesser gods or victims of circumstances. Show compassion, treat them as your equals, and try in your own way to elevate them physically, mentally and spiritually.

, Take ownership of your responsibilities both at home and the work place. Loss of integrity means loss of character. And loss of character means loss of your life mentally and spiritually. There is no use being only physical alive.

, Forgiveness is not only a virtue, but also an act that creates remorse & makes a better person of the person forgiven. It also wins you a friend.

, Spare no one human beings, animals, nature and innate things. Reciprocation will start sooner or later from all living things and ultimately you will end up winning hearts.

, The most knowledgeable also seeks knowledge to become more knowledgeable. Pursuit of knowledge should be a continuous process. Knowledge can not only be acquired from books, teacher, institutions, but also from things around us including nature.

, Having time sense is just one part of the discipline. Discipline encompasses every aspect of your day to day life. Your actions, your attire, your speech, you silence, your movements, your treatment of others and yourself. Don’t be undisciplined even to yourself.

, People think that they are treating their parents properly but in most cases this is an illusion. Please do this small exercise. Draw a table with three columns. First column write Serial no. 123… next column against each number write one thing your parents have done for you and in the next write a value for this between 1& 10. Like this right from your childhood try to recollect and write each and everything your parents have done for you and put a value for each item. When you finish, total the values you have put.

, Now compare the values, you will find that sum of what you have received far exceeds the sum of what you have done for them. You will find that, what you have done for them, and may possibly do for them in future, will at most account for the interest for the debt you have incurred. You can never repay the debt, at least pay the interest properly. If for some reason, you don’t have the affection for your parents, even then, you need to look after them well to at least put the math in order.

Be aware that your brain cannot tell the difference between a real history and an imagined history or the history of others.,
Capture the moment.,
Anchor this as a resource state so that you can bring it up at any time you require it.",How to Improve Your Performance Through NLP," Imagine an invisible circle on the floor. In your imagination, make it about 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter and 2 feet (0.6 m) in front of you, something large enough to walk into.


You can draw chalk on the floor, or draw a circle on paper if you like when you are first training to master this mental technique.;
, Go inside the circle and imagine that you are wonderful at what you want to be doing. For example, if you are a golfer and want to have a perfect put, imagine yourself as that person. See yourself doing that. How would you stand? How do you look? What do you wear? Flood your body with the good feelings of your confident performance. Imagine yourself carrying out this task and watch yourself doing it as if you are watching yourself in a film.

, In your mind, you can use visualization to step-into-the-shoes-of role of someone you admire to get into that state you want. Imagine Tiger Woods, for example, and build a representation in your mind of that person who can do what you want to do well.

, All you have to do is emotionally capture that feeling of excellence using whatever role models or scenario playing that works for you. Go ahead, no one will know!

, Step automatically into the powerful state you've created within the circle. Move into that circle of excellence. Step into the picture of yourself, imagine it's as if you step into that person, that set of states, the whole of that experience.

, In other words, figure out how to draw upon this state at will by practicing it, and then associating some mental or physical link or cue with it to bring it back when needed. That might be tapping your fingers, holding your arms in a certain way, or whatever physical link you can easily and accurately repeat. Repeat with more experiences to enhance the power of the circle of excellence. Use this method whenever you feel you need to boost your performance.

Encourage the teachers' passion.,
Relate the lesson to the students' experiences.

,
Ensure a good teacher to student ratio.,
Don't fuss with uniforms.,
Encourage the parents’ participation in the student’s studies.

,
Focus should change from imparting education to imparting knowledge that helps students not just in finding a good job but helps them contribute in their own way to the betterment of the society.

,
Teachers play a very crucial role in ensuring that students understand and learn what they are being taught in the school.Keeping that in mind enrichment programs should be conducted to make them aware of the latest tools and techniques of imparting knowledge.

,
The profession of teaching at school level should be given its due respect in the society by ensuring better pay and facilities for teachers.

,
Incentives should be given in form of scholarships,financial assistance for studies, assured teaching positions for students who want to take up teaching as their profession.

",How to Improve Learning Potential in School (India)," Teaching doesn't mean to spoon feed information. Teach enough that the student is then compelled to find out the rest of the answers through using the access to reference books to help to sort out remaining ambiguities alone.;
, This precious time should be used for play, homework, and study. It should be no more than 15 minutes of travel.

,,, Include essential sports like swimming, skating, cycling.Encourage your students to take part in sports competition.Other school sports would be Volleyball, Throwball and Kho-Kho.

,, Have students asking why they are learning what they are learning. Things students need to learn include:


planning the steps,
executing the flow chart and
satiating the journey from abstract to real.

,,, Children have an innate fascination for environment; air, water, animals, plants, sky... They respect principles of nature and their behavior is impressed by nature. The environment is a rich, effective teaching tool. Nature captures the imagination and curiosity and engenders thinking.


Educational aids, demonstrative models, retained nearer to natural forms catch better perception.
Nature is a way to correct unwanted behavior to bring out the best by modifying the way students interact with environment.

, Freedom of thinking and action is most essential for mental growth. While working on a project, ensure that the student is free to try, check and relate the outcome to what he has learnt in formal lessons.

, Rest is essential.

, Language is an effective tool of instruction. A language rich in words and grammar and communicable between learner and educator is good. Help those whose first language is not the one used for teaching.

, Once in a week, initiate a change in schooling time, change of place, change in subjects like drawing, student as teacher or visit to industry refreshes learning activity.

, Passionate teachers will make learning more interesting.

,, The number of students in a class should not be so high so as to lose contact with his students.

, The uniform has nothing to do with learning. It may be a political or social economic symbol or may be used as a tool for social security. A simple and atmosphere friendly dressing in class is enough for learning.

Research programs and agencies.,
Donate.,
Vote to increase nonmilitary foreign aid.,
Support efforts at reducing military conflict.",How to Help Achieve Universal Primary Education1," There are a multitude of UN, governmental, and intergovernmental programs actively working toward universal primary education. You’ll be better prepared to support programs advancing the goal when know which agencies are most active in the field. Some of the major organizations are:The United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI) is a UN agency focusing on education among women, because women and girls around the world are far more likely to be unschooled than men and boys. UNGEI partners with agencies in individual countries, offering technical support in the design and funding of schools.Abriendo Oportunidades (Opening Opportunities) is another UN initiative, this time based in Guatemala, which focuses on the education and mentoring of school-age girls.The Global Education Cluster is the premier UN agency addressing the difficulties associated with providing education to those in conflict zones. It aims to make the provision of educational resources a standard practice in the dispensation of humanitarian aid (it isn’t now).;
, If you’ve found some private agencies that share your vision, the most straightforward way to help them is by giving a donation. Your donation can be monetary or in-kind.There are dozens, if not hundreds, of private nonprofit groups active in assisting education in developing areas. You can see a partial listing of highly regarded nonprofits at http://campaignforeducationusa.org/members.

, The UN has no independent authority to tax individuals. Contributions to goals set by the UN are determined by individual countries and disbursed through the UN. When you hear the term “foreign aid,” it’s a blanket term describing all types of aid, including aid to help advance the Millennium Development Goals.While you can’t pick exactly where foreign aid will go, most nonmilitary foreign aid will at least help advance educational goals indirectly. For example, malnutrition, poverty, and disease are big reasons why any particular child isn’t attending elementary school.

, While more children overall are in primary school compared to fifteen years ago, the opposite is true when it comes to children in conflict zones. In conflict zones, the proportion of children out of school has increased to 36% from 30%, a discrepancy high enough to indicate a relationship between the types of wars fought today and the disruption in educational services.Therefore, it should be clear that “military solutions” to global problems are not solutions to problems of school enrollment, whatever their other merits may be.

Spread the word amongst friends and associates.,
Take advantage of social media.,
Transform your opinions into media.,
Join a preexisting group.,
Reach out to people in power.",How to Help Achieve Universal Primary Education2," Talking to your friends, colleagues, and family about barriers to universal worldwide enrollment can prepare you for more serious advocacy. Explain to the people in your circle the importance of primary education and just how close the international community is to solving the problem. Even if they don’t care about the issue as much as you do, they should walk away from the encounter understanding why it’s important, yet solvable, problem. As always, tailor your appeal to the individual. Think about their experiences and sympathies so your pitch sinks in.


For example, imagine your friend is a person who prides themselves on being “self made.” Even though you care about universal primary education in a way they don’t, you can make them care about the issue.Talk to your friend about the ripple effect a nonexistent elementary education has on a person’s life. You could open by saying something like this: “You’ve managed to go out and achieve a lot, which is pretty exceptional. But can you imagine how hard it would have been if you didn’t know multiplication tables, the scientific method, or how to read? Would you have been able to achieve what you’ve managed to achieve if you hadn’t?”
It’s easier to influence a new opinion than change their mind. Try to talk about unfamiliar subjects or by approaching new subjects in unfamiliar ways.

, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms are a cheap way to raise awareness of any type of issue. You can reach large audiences with comparatively little effort. Plus, there's always the possibility of an issue going viral (remember KONY 2012?).Use social media to promote articles, videos, and memes that tackle issues relating to problems caused by inadequate primary education and initiatives designed to stop it.


Sometimes the reach of social media is larger than its impact (remember KONY 2012?). Even though it’s a low cost way to broadcast a message, social media by itself doesn’t create change. In fact, relying too much on social media can turn your activists into “slacktivists,” or people who are constantly hitting the “share” button to spread a message, but do nothing else., You can take your advocacy one step further by creating content centered around achieving universal primary education. “Content creation” just means creating any type of media—like hosting or contributing to podcasts, blogs, and vlogs. While creating your own blog, podcast, or YouTube channel is more work, if you want complete control over messaging, it’s the only way to go. See Start Your Own Podcast and Start a Blog to learn more.

, By joining a group that’s already established, the message is amplified in accordance with the strength of the group. Even though you sacrifice control over the message, the group helps give you credibility and access you wouldn’t ordinarily have. In addition to the aid agencies and programs outlined in the first section, there are several private entities devoted to addressing this issue, such as the Jesuit Refugee Service, Books for Africa, RESULTS, School Girls Unite, and the United Methodist Board of Church and Society.Saying, “I advocate with a group called RESULTS, which addresses global poverty and educational resources. I’d like you to know a few things we do,” has a much better ring to it than “You know what I think?”

, Take your message to people who have the power to make the changes you want to make. With an international effort to address primary education, there are many different decision makers and many ways to communicate with them. For example:


You can write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper, your congressman, senator, mayor, or other political figure. Let them know how close the UN member states are to achieving the goal of universal primary education, and how increased foreign aid could make a serious dent in the problem. Advocate in support of diplomatic efforts to broker peace treaties, or simply highlight the efforts of a group you belong to.Start an online petition and publish it on social media. If you don’t think you own voice is enough, amplify it. Sometimes change isn’t possible until elected officials understand how many people care about an issue. If you gather enough signatures, printing out a hard copy can be a very dramatic gesture. The big stack of papers is more visually impressive than a PDF with a few thousand signatures.

Be a voluntourist.,
Become a teacher overseas.,
Work for a nonprofit that works in a conflict zone.",How to Help Achieve Universal Primary Education3," “Voluntourism” means planning a tourist experience around volunteer activity, and it is a growing sector of international travel. Instead of your vacation revolving around pleasure activities, it centers on service activities.While voluntourism is well intentioned, it isn’t a cure all for the world’s problems. If it puts a native worker out of a job, it can even cause more problems than it solves. Make sure you have a skill that can truly be beneficial to the people in your host country (they are likely to have all the unskilled labor they need).
Learn more about the thousands of voluntourism opportunities at http://www.voluntourism.org/traveler-start.html.

, There’s no education without teachers, so teaching elementary school in a developing country is the most hands-on way to aid universal primary education as a goal. There are a few ways to go about this:


Most teachers overseas are English teachers, and most English teachers are certified to Teach English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). There is no one accrediting body for TEFL certification, and there are hundreds of programs offering certification both online and at university campuses. Those applying to a course typically do need a bachelor’s degree, however. If you want to teach another subject area, you can look at job vacancies in the locale where you want to go, or browse the International Educator’s online job board. You can find the list at http://www.tieonline.com/.

, Since the fastest-growing population of unschooled children are in conflict zones, an area where a person can have the greatest impact is in a conflict zone. There are many highly regarded non-profits at work in conflict zones, including Mercy Corps, International Rescue Committee, International IDEA, Peace Brigades International, and Peace Direct.Of course, each job will have its own specific qualifications, but many jobs for overseas nonprofits look for persons with Master’s Degrees, foreign language skills, and experience working or living abroad.

Work out math problems.,
Play brain games.,
Join a debate or reading club.,
Build a large knowledge base.,
Take time to think about things.,
Expand your worldview.,
Search for connections.,
Pay attention to detail.,
Ask yourself questions about why things are the way they are.,
Take on new responsibilities.,
Challenge yourself with little things.,
Instruct others on analytical thinking.",How to Improve Analytical Skills," Solving math problems is one of the most common ways of improving analytical skills. Math is very logical and math problems are structured in a way that we are given information and are forced to use that information to solve a problem. As a result, math problems are one of the simplest ways of honing analytical ability.


Practice complicated math problems that include long division, algebra, calculus, and more. These problems will help you develop your logic and reasoning skills and as a result improve your analytical ability.
Identify math problems in everyday life, then take time to solve them.
Enroll in a college level math course. Many college level math courses will help you cultivate your analytical skills.;
, One of the best ways to improve your analytical skills is to engage them directly by playing “brain games.” Brain games are games that challenge you to think deeply and to develop your analytical skills. These games will get you used to thinking in a certain way and as a result, they will help improve your ability to think. Ultimately, brain games are a fun way to actively develop your analytical skills while having fun.


One example of a brain game are logic puzzles. Logic puzzles vary and include crossword, riddles, Sudoku, and more. Logic puzzles are available on the internet or at a book store near you.
Play board games. Many board games require you to use your analytical skills and to develop them further. Perhaps the best of these are games like scrabble, some strategy games, and games like chess or checkers.
Find video games that encourage the development of your analytical skills. A wide array of video games help to improve analytical skills. Some of the best, though, are strategy games and other games that challenge us to solve problems and achieve broad goals., Another great way to improve analytical skills is to join a debate or reading club or group. Groups like these provide people with the opportunity to come together and discuss ideas, literature, and problems in a congenial setting. Ultimately, groups like these will provide you with the opportunity to hone your analytical skills and be able to articulate yourself better.


Book clubs will allow you to talk about what you’ve observed reading a specific piece of literature. You’ll also have the ability to discuss and interact with others who may have a different take on a given piece of literature.
Debate clubs are excellent ways to hone our analytical skills because our perspective and arguments will be constantly challenged by others who are working on their own debate ability.
Most any social group that encourages the free exchange of ideas and the pursuit of knowledge will help you to actively develop your analytical skills., One of the most important things in developing your analytical skills is also creating a strong knowledge base for yourself. The more you learn, and the more you know about the world, the more tools and information you’ll have when it comes to understanding and solving problems. To enlarge your knowledge base, consider:


Reading extensively. Don’t just focus on one subject or genre.
Attending lectures and academic talks and conferences.
Going back to college or finding free educational classes in your community., Take all the time you need to think and reflect about an array of things. In fact, make it a point to think about things instead of making quick and rash decisions. Thinking about things and considering a variety of factors will help hone your problem solving and analytical skills.


Use any opportunity you have to think things over and to examine different scenarios. For example, if you are going to take a pawn with your castle in Chess, instead of just quitting after thinking about the first (or most likely) response your opponent will take, think out all of the possible responses.
Consider multiple sides of a problem before picking a solution.
Avoid picking the easiest and simplest solution right away. However, don't rule out the easiest solution, as it might be worthwhile., One of the best ways to improve your analytical skills is to expand your worldview. This is no quick fix though. Expanding your worldview takes time. Ultimately, it will help you better evaluate information and to analyze different ideas and outcomes.


Try to think about different ways of viewing the world. Do this by trying to step outside of your religious, political, and cultural suppositions about truth.
Try to understand and even work to defend positions and ideas you would normally dismiss. You can do this by taking important political positions and working to rationalize and defend the opposite viewpoint that you accept.
Meet with and surround yourself with people who are very different from yourself. Finding people who have different backgrounds and ideas than you will help you understand and accept ideas different than those you are familiar with., Ultimately, many things in our daily lives are connected. Whether it be the migration of birds and other animals and the seasons, or car emissions and changing whether patterns, things are connected. By discovering connections, you'll help hone your analytical skills.


Think about things in terms of cause and effect. Consider the repercussions of a prolonged drought. What is the impact of the drought? Look beyond the obvious.
Think about the similarities between things. How are all living things the same? What similar things do both humans and spiders need to exist?
Think about connections in history. What cycles, patterns, or other common trends do we see? For instance, in American history, consider how periods of reform are often ended by conflict (the Progressive Era and World War One, the New Deal and World War Two, the Great Society and the Vietnam War)., Attention to detail is extremely important in analytical skills. Without knowing the ins and the outs of a problem, or knowing the specifics, you'll be less likely to craft a successful and workable solution. Make sure to look at small things (as well as large things).


For example, when viewing a forest, try to view individual trees and the uniqueness and place each tree has in the forest.
When meeting new people make sure to memorize their names, what they’re wearing, and any features that set them apart from everyone else., Contemplating the natural order of things is an extremely helpful way to hone your observation and analytical skills. By thinking about why things are the way they are, you'll develop a better understanding of the world and you'll challenge yourself to think about complex issues.


Never take the easy answer. Always keep questioning.
If you see a dog, observe what it's doing. Ask yourself why it is doing that. Even if it is a simple action. If it is running to fetch a ball or stick, is it doing this for fun? What about hunting instincts? Is it showing loyalty to its owner by doing that? Is the dog looking motivated, or lazy? Why might it be motivated or lazy?, After you’ve spent a little time honing your analytical skills, put them to the test by taking on new responsibilities. Taking on new responsibilities in your academic, personal, or professional life will enable you to practice and to further hone the skills you’ve been working on.


Apply for a promotion or a better job. Moving into a more challenging position at work will enable you to further work on and show off your sharpened analytical skills.
Take on some volunteer positions. Certain volunteer positions like being a scout leader, little league coach, or a tutor for at risk kids will allow you to use your analytical skills and help others., Improving your analytical skills will do little good if you don’t work to challenge yourself on a daily basis. As a result, make a conscious effort to challenge yourself and to use your analytical skills on small things every day. Using your skills everyday will keep them sharp and make sure you are performing at your best in your private or professional life.


Try to solve complex problems without aid. Instead of using a calculator to compute a math problem, do it in your head or on paper.
Avoid the easiest solution or path. While it might seem like a no-brainer to always do the quickest, simplest, or easiest thing to solve a problem, do not. Instead, test yourself by picking the harder way to solve something., Now that you’re confident in your analytical skills, move on and help others improve their skills, too. Not only will you be able to help others hone their skills, but you’ll continue to work on you own skills.


Mentor others at work.
Consider starting a blog where you can share your experience with others.
Work with your children, friends, or family, who might be struggling with education or professional issues."

Clear your mind.,
Focus on the object in your mind and “ask” the universe for it.,
Spend some time thinking about how what you want makes you feel.,
Feel the joy of having the object as if you already had it.,
Take some time to think on what you desire.,
Don't dwell on any negative emotions.,
Believe that the universe will give you new opportunities and that your visualization will manifest positively in your life.,
Trust your intuition.,
Express gratitude for what you already have.",How to Get Anything You Want (Through Intent)," When a person clears their mind, they try to stop thinking about anything. This creates a calming effect on your body and your mind. You will need to be in a calm state of mind to focus your desire properly.


Listening to music or using music to meditate can help. Put on some of your favorite calming music, sit in a comfortable position, and try to clear your mind. Just don’t fall asleep!
Take a walk. Physical activity can calm the mind. While walking, focus on your breathing and try to be in-the-moment, or aware of your surroundings. Don’t let your mind wander while you walk. ;
, Sometimes it can be helpful to ask for what you want by writing it down.


For example, if you wanted a promotion at your workplace, you would write, “I would like to get a promotion at my job.” Then you would either read it out loud or in your head as many times as you needed to focus on it.

, If you’re going to spend a lot of mental energy trying to make something happen, you want to be sure that it will be good for your life.


If the object you desire makes you feel happy, this is a good thing! Try to focus on the positive feelings associated with the object.
If the object you desire makes you feel neutral, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. There are many people who think that thinking neutrally about what you want will help you focus your attention on it.If the object you desire makes you feel more negative emotions than positive emotions, than this may not be the right decision for your happiness. If so, you will need to create new life goals. If you are sure that you want something that makes you feel negatively, you need to work on thinking positively instead. For example, whenever you catch yourself thinking negatively, make an effort to have a positive thought instead., Sit somewhere quiet and form a mental image of yourself holding the object in your arms. If your desire isn’t an object but rather a state of being (for example, being healthy and fit) imagine yourself in that state. Make as complete a picture as possible. What does it look like? How does it feel? How does it make you feel? What do you do with it? This is a process called visualization and will be useful in other steps as well.For example, if you were trying to get promoted at work, you would want to think about what your life would be like with the promotion. Think about how you would get to work every day and what office you would go to. What work would you be doing? Who would be working under you, and what kinds of tasks would you give them?

, Think of creative ways to remind yourself of your goals so that you can visualize your success throughout your day. However, don’t let it become a chore! You don’t want any negative emotions associated with your visualization. If you need to, take a break from visualizing and clear your mind.


Create a vision board. Cut out pictures from magazines or create your own images and documents to glue onto a piece of cardboard or cardstock. Place the vision board somewhere where you’ll see it every day to help you positively visualize what you want more often. For example, you could create an “acceptance letter” for the promotion you wanted and pin it on your board.
Write a short letter to the universe thanking it for giving you what you want. For example, write “I am grateful that you helped me get a promotion at work.” This can help you feel as if you already have what you want.

, If you're disappointed in yourself in some way that has to do with what you desire, don't continue to visualize it. Think instead about all of the positive emotions you have towards what you want. For example, if you didn’t get a promotion the last time you thought you might, instead of thinking of the situation as a failure think of it as an opportunity to get a better promotion down the road.

, Look for new opportunities, especially in places that you wouldn’t normally expect them. This can include talking to people you normally wouldn’t or accepting invitations that you would normally decline. The universe might be giving you an avenue towards what you want!For example, if you’re trying to get a promotion at work and you’re offered a position on a project that you would normally decline, accept the position instead. That project might lead you to your promotion!
Be patient. Large changes in your life won’t happen overnight. It can take years of thinking with intent to see the changes you want to see. Trust that the universe will take care of the details and lead you where you need to go., If you feel compelled to do something out of the ordinary, go ahead and do it. It might be the universe giving you a nudge in the right direction. For example, if you go to the same coffee shop every day on your break but suddenly feel the need to go to a different coffee shop, follow that impulse. For all you know, you may meet someone who will be pivotal in helping you reach your goals!, This will help keep negative emotions away. When you’re trying to bring something you want into your life through visualization, you don’t want any negativity getting in the way of your positive visualization. This can negatively affect the outcome of your focusing and may stop you from getting what you want!"

Assess your wants and desires.,
Focus on what is most important and attainable.,
Set a long-term goal.,
Formulate a plan.,
Put your plan into action.,
Develop willpower.,
Keep an eye on progress.,
Celebrate little wins.,
Identify obstacles as they arise.,
Be adaptable.,
Learn from failures.",How to Get Everything You Want in Life," The first step is to know what you want in life. We’re not just talking about material objects but goals, achievements, and feelings. Look inside and ask yourself what it is that you most desire.Ask what it is that you want in life and what is most important to you. Try writing down your answers as they come, without assessing them.
Be as specific as possible in your stating what you want. “I want a lot of money” is a start, but “I want to be financially secure and retire by age 50” is more specific and better.
Are your desires achievable? Are they realistic? Are they about you? They will need to be. You might have a good job, but can you manage to retire early? How would you do so?;
, Let’s be real: you probably cannot achieve everything that you want in life. Cars, clothes, fabulous riches, luxuries – it would simply take too much effort and divide your energies. Focus on what is most important to you, giving that your full effort.


Look again at your list of wants and desires and reassess it. What is at the top? Is your desire for financial security and to retire early really what you want most out of life?
Ask yourself again whether it is doable. Are you sure that you can manage this goal or are you simply setting yourself up for failure?
Try to be realistic and open-minded. Don’t embark on an overly ambitious dream if you doubt that it can be done.

, Having a long-term goal will give focus to your ambitions, give you a sense of purpose, and make you aware of possible obstacles. For instance, where and how to you envision your life in the future? What lifestyle do you expect? What things to do want to do?Identify a long-term goal. Try, again, writing it down and be as specific as possible. “I want to retire at 50” is not as specific and achievable as a goal as saying “I want to be debt-free, own my own home, and be able to retire at 50 on an annual income of at least $50,000.” The latter sets concrete benchmarks for success.
Start to brainstorm pathways to success. How can you get there? What sort of job will you need? How much will you need to save every year?

, A long-term goal needs long-term vision. You will have to have a clear idea of how you want to get from Point A in your life to Point B, keeping in mind that you might have to take unexpected detours through Points C and D. You will also need a timetable and benchmarks.


Consider breaking up your ambition into smaller parts. This will make the plan less daunting and help to keep you motivated, working toward smaller, incremental goals.Be specific again about timelines and what you want to achieve within a given time. For example, rather than just saying “Retire at 50,” think in terms of “By age 30 I want to have $200,000 in stable and growing investments. By age 40 I want to be 75% of the way to my financial goal.” Ambitious? Yes, but concrete.
You can even break steps into substeps, each with its own plan. For example, how do you intend to invest $200,000 before age 30? You’ll need to set aside enough money, talk to a financial adviser, and develop an investment plan. , Now is the time to take the first step. Put the plan into action. Consult with people who can help you, find resources, and begin to work toward your long-term goal. It is all up to you now.


Seek expert help. For instance, if you’re interested in getting in shape, talk to a personal trainer. If your goal is financial, talk to a financial adviser.
Inform yourself and utilize resources. You can teach yourself a lot about investment, for example, through personal research or by taking a financial planning course.
Most importantly, be proactive. Your goals will not come true through wishful thinking.

, Stay focused on your long-term vision. You may have to make some sacrifices on the way, and for this you will need to discipline – willpower. Willpower is the ability to resist short-term temptations in order to achieve larger goals.You practice it by going to the gym when you feel like sleeping in or by doing an extra hour of work while your favorite show is on.


Cultivate discipline. Studies show that students, for example, who exhibit more willpower generally perform better. Avoid procrastination, as well, as you are prioritizing short-term satisfaction.
Get into a routine that helps you make progress toward your desires. For example, it will be easier to be physically healthy if you stick to an exercise schedule. If your goals are financial, sticking to a budget can do the same.
Develop habits that keep you on track while avoiding ones that derail your progress. For example, avoid going to the mall if you tend to make impulsive purchases. Make a habit of immediately depositing part of each paycheck so that you can meet your savings goals.

, As you work toward your dreams and aspirations, keep an eye on how things are going. Have you met benchmarks? Are you still following your timeline? What short-term goals have you met? Recognizing how far you have come is important to carrying out your plan and to staying motivated.For one thing, taking stock of progress will allow you to make necessary adjustments. What if you failed to meet one of your benchmarks? You tried hard but only saved $100,000 by age 30. You might need to tweak your long-term goal, either by moving retirement age back or by committing to save more.
You may find that your plan needs to be changed. Maybe your original goal was too ambitious. A house, insurance, and a family cost more than you ever planned and might mean that an early retirement is impractical.
Progress is also a very powerful motivator. By seeing how far you have moved toward a short-term or long-term goal, you will normally get a mental boost., The road to your dream in life will be long. As you trace your progress, take pride in passing all the milestones. Celebrate when you meet short-term or long-term goals and you should find yourself refreshed and re-energized. Recognize what you have accomplished by pausing, reflecting, and treating yourself. Did you finally run a full marathon? This calls for a toast! Or perhaps you got a long-desired promotion? Go out for a special dinner in celebration.
These small wins show progress. They show you moving slowly but steadily toward your desire, which will help you to stay focused on the long-term.

, Reviewing your progress should make you aware of any minor or major obstacles to meeting your long-term goals. What's important to realize what the underlying cause is and to address it. Inaction will only set back your efforts.


Try to get to the bottom of any issues. What is the cause? Be honest with yourself. Say that you have not been saving enough. Is it an income issue – are you not making enough money? Or are you spending too much? Maybe it is an issue of time, and you need to put in more hours.
Resolve to do what it takes to accomplish your goals. If you are facing a major obstacle, re-evaluate your plan and try to adjust.
Some things are beyond our control. You may face illness, job trouble, or family issues that hamper your long-term vision. Focus instead on what you can control.

, There is a good chance that you’ll have setbacks on the road to your dreams. While discouraging, you shouldn’t let this derail you. It is important to be flexible and to adjust. Adaptable people are able to take control, find alternatives, and to move past setbacks.First of all, don’t panic. Failure may be difficult but it is not the end of the world. Remember to have reasonable expectations and try to look for the opportunities that arise from a setback.
Adjust accordingly. Say that your original dream did not pan out. You don’t have enough money to retire early at 50. But can you compromise? Can you work part-time for ten or fifteen more years, saving more money? By then you’ll still be well-off and at a normal retirement age.
Keeping a backup plan is a good idea. Hopefully you will have worked out different scenarios and tried to anticipate setbacks. Having a clear Plan B in place is smart. Can you continue to work? Will a career change help you to meet your goal?

, Consider a setback a way to learn. Highly motivated people are able to use failures to learn, to adjust, to grow, and to move forward. Try to do likewise and to take the most out of your setbacks.Assess what went wrong. Look first at your planning.Did you not anticipate an obstacle? Did you not give yourself enough time? Was it a failure on your part or something outside of your control?
Look at your preparation. Say that you lost ground on your financial planning because you had to dip into your investments because of an emergency. Was this setback unavoidable? Or did you not have enough of an emergency fund set aside?
Evaluate your execution. Try to honestly judge your effort. Was it consistent? Did you take missteps or did the setback have to do with external factors?After you have assessed your effort, try to use what you have learned from it. Going forward, make sure not to repeat the same errors or to anticipate similar problems.

Set the tone.,
Formulate your questions with the idea of challenging the participants.,
Ask questions about the world and the things that you know the children have an interest in.,
Find people to ask the questions instead of you.,
Encourage the participants to come up with challenging questions of their own.",How to Formulate Questions for SOLE Activities," When explaining the question process in a SOLE activity, draw attention to the fact that you know children love to answer difficult questions. This will help them to be receptive to the challenge that you're about to set them. An example might be: ""You know how you're all really good at answering questions? Today we have a challenge with a few tough questions that we need you to find the answers for!"";
, The question is what influences the extent and breadth of the children's investigation. As the adult facilitator, your role is to ask questions that encourage the children to undertake deep exploration and to have lengthy and involved discussions about the research results they've found. Simple questions that can be answered quickly and without much thought will not promote this sort of exchange between the participants, so it is important to ask questions that are focused on the big picture and are open-ended, with possibly many or even no answers. The more difficult and interesting the question, the more likely the children will be enthused to explore widely and get excited about discussing.


Don't shy away from difficult concepts or big words. Scientific principles, math equations and Shakespearean language are all simply an opportunity for the children to dig deeper and work out for themselves what the meanings are, as well as finding the solutions to the question.







, This line of pursuit will encourage children to learn more about the world, their place in it and the things that they care about. The questions may cover such things as the way other children in the world live and learn, animals, nature, science, math, food, the universe––indeed, anything that you know the children will love to explore in greater depth.

, You don't necessarily have to come up with the questions yourself. In fact, it's probably a good idea that you don't be the one always asking the questions; involving other people can be a part of the learning experience about other people in the community, country and world around the children. You could either obtain a question from another person and read it out, or organize a video or Skype link-up of someone else asking the question that they need to pursue.


For example, you could have a question asked by a child in another country, a scientist on an expedition or a person at their place of work. Parents, friends, community groups, school link-ups, and other networks can all be a possible source of finding challenging questions for the children to pursue. The added expectation of reporting back to this person who is outside of their school environment will add a sense of purpose to finding good answers.






It is a good idea to write the question up on a whiteboard or blackboard for constant referral after it has been asked. This will help keep the groups on track with their research.

, As the participants become more familiar with the SOLE process and answering the questions, have them take on the task of finding challenging questions for other participants. This will help them to develop their question-asking and facilitating roles on top of the exploring and learning roles. Eventually, some of the children entering their teen years may take on the role of moderating SOLE activities for younger children.

Determine your area(s) of research interest.,
Enroll in a degree program in your area of interest at a college or university.,
Make sure you've taken classes relevant to your area of research interest.,
Write an outline of the research project you want to do.,
Locate professors at your university who do research that interests you.,
Locate other research institutions in your area of interest.,
Prepare your resume.,
Contact the professor directly about your interest in his or her research, and/or enroll in a research program.,
Ask to meet with the professor or researcher.,
Read and become familiar with the professor's publications and background information about the research.,
Prepare to explain the reasons for your interest in joining the research group.,
Prepare questions for the professor.",How to Get an Undergraduate Research Position," What fascinates you and makes you want to learn more? Think about your major, your favorite classes, your hobbies, and your career goals. If you are having trouble narrowing down your interests, don't worry--that's part of what the undergraduate research experience is for. Brainstorm, make a list, and go with what seems most exciting and most promising. If you get into a research area and it ends up not being right for you, you can look into other research areas.;
, If you want to join a professor's lab or research group, it's best to be a student at that professor's university.

, It is not necessary to be an expert in all areas involved in the professor's research. Make sure you are familiar with the basics and have a foundational understanding of the research area. You will learn more once you join the lab or group.

, This step is optional. If you don't have a project in mind (which is to be expected from someone looking for first-time research experience), then the professor will find something for you to work on. This may mean that you'll be doing busy work or menial tasks (cleaning glassware, doing literature searches) before the professor finds a project you can help with. If you already have some specific project you want to research and it aligns with the projects going on, then the professor will be more interested in having you and your ideas around.

, If you're in a class with a professor who works in your area of interest, ask about what research your professor does and how you can get involved. Browse through faculty webpages in whichever university departments you think are doing research that interests you. Use search engines and your university's website to find professors. Your university may have an undergraduate research opportunities program (often called UROP) that helps connect faculty to students and can give financial aid for research projects.

, Hospitals, companies, and other institutions also do research, and many have educational programs open to students. Search online and through your university to fi

nd opportunities like summer research jobs, lab volunteering, and student positions., When you contact the professor, you will need to be able to present what experience you have. In your resume, list what classes you've taken related to the field of the professor's research, and what relevant skills and prior experience you may have. Don't worry if you don't have much in the way of skills and experience, because that's what you will learn while working with your professor and the research group. Demonstrate that you are thorough and reliable--necessary qualities for a good researcher.

, Now that you've found professors who are doing research that you'd like to help with, you need to contact them. It's best to contact a number of professors, because not all of them will have positions available for you. Professors' email addresses and phone numbers should be publicly available on faculty webpages. If your university has an undergraduate research program, sign up for it and contact professors that way. If you sign up for a program, it is always a good idea to contact professors directly in addition to through the program.

, In an email of phone call, explain who you are, why you are interested in joining the research work, and ask if there is a position for you. If the professor responds and says yes, then ask if the professor is available to meet with you to discuss how you can join the lab or research group and what you will do there.

, Selected publications will often be listed on a professor's webpage. Alternatively, search engines like Google Scholar, software like EndNote, and online academic journal sites can help you find publications by searching the professor's name. This way, you will also be able to better discuss the lab or research work. When you meet with the professor, you want to demonstrate that you are interested enough to have looked into his or her work.

, Know what you will tell the professor about what you have to offer, and what you want to gain from your time there, and why.

, When you meet the professor and discuss the current research projects, ask questions about anything you don't understand. This will give you a better idea of what goes on in the research group, what you have to gain from it, and it shows the professor that you are interested in actively learning more. Be sure to ask about things like the time commitment, the location, and other requirements for joining. And, if possible, try to get to know the professor personally--make sure you get along. It's important to have a friendly lab environment.

Earn an Associate degree in phlebotomy.",How to Get a Phlebotomy Certification," Several agencies offer a phlebotomy certificate, each with its own requirements. The names of the specific certificate that you’ll earn vary, as each organization gives their certificate a different name. Practically speaking, the certificates are all sufficient to earn you a job as a phlebotomist. The primary phlebotomy certification bodies are:.


The National Healthcareer Association (NHA) which provides a Certified Phlebotomy Technician (CPT) certificate. This is the most common phlebotomy certificate.
The American Society for Clinical Pathology, (ASCP) which provides a Phlebotomy Technician (PBT) certificate.
The American Medical Technologists (AMT) which provides a Registered Phlebotomy Technician (RPT) certificate.
The National Center for Competency Testing (NCCT) which provides a National Certified Phlebotomy Technician (NCPT) certificate.
The American Certification Agency (ACA) which provides a Certified Phlebotomy Technician (CPT) certificate.;
, Although the five programs listed above all provide a similar final product, the requirements along the way may differ from one another.You can find the certificate requirements for each on their respective websites, and all are also listed in order on the Allied Health Schools website.

For example, the NHA requires that certificate applicants have attended a phlebotomy training program which includes having performed 10 capillary sticks and 30 venipunctures on live individuals.
The ASCP, on the other hand, does not require completion of a training program, as long as you have been trained in phlebotomy (or worked as a full-time phlebotomist) at an accredited laboratory.

, There are many certified and accredited programs that offer phlebotomy training. These programs practically prepare students for the certification exam and typically take 2–4 months to complete. Students learn about patient ethics and communication, blood sampling, and legal considerations of the practice.Be sure to find a program that offers hands-on training in addition to classroom instruction, as some certification bodies require a certain number of successful blood collections.

, After having completed an accredited phlebotomy training program, you will have to apply for the agency’s certification exam. You can register for every agency’s exam online through the agency’s respective website. You’ll need to provide proof that you have met the agency’s examination requirements.Each certifying agency will also provide a different exam structure. View the Phlebotomy Training Group’s website for more specific information.You’ll also need to pay any accompanying fees online. As an example, the test for ASPT certification costs $90, or $135 for walk-ins., Once you’ve registered, you can begin studying for the exam. Although your training course will have given you the needed knowledge, it will help your chances at passing the test if you study beforehand. To assist with studying, websites like the Phlebotomy Training Group provide sample exams.Passing the exam will effectively make you a certified phlebotomist.

Each certifying agency will structure and grade their examination differently. For example, the NHA scores exams on a numerical scale from 200 to 500. Examinees must score at least a 360 to pass.

, Every certification body requires phlebotomists to renew their certificates in a given time period. The time periods vary depending on the certifying body; some require annual renewal while others require renewal every two years. Each certification agency can provide information regarding how to renew.To renew, you may be required to take courses to show continuing education or have completed a certain number of blood collections.
Failing to renew your certificate may result in extra fees to re-certify. Some certification agencies will even require you to re-take the exam should you forget to renew your certification.

, If you’re still in high school and interested in pursuing phlebotomy as a career path, take as many courses as possible in pre-medical fields like chemistry and biology. These will give you a competitive edge over other applicants when applying to phlebotomy certification programs.Practically speaking, a firm knowledge of biology (e.g. anatomy) and chemistry will also make the certification process and your work as a phlebotomist easier.

, You will need to be at least 18 years of age to be eligible for phlebotomy training, and have a high school diploma.If you have not graduated from high school, you can earn a diploma by passing the General Education Development (GED) exam.

, While this is not required for the certification or to practice phlebotomy, it will give you a great deal of specific, practical knowledge regarding the profession of phlebotomy.If you’re not already in college, a two-year degree would help you prepare for the career of a phlebotomist. You could even earn the degree while you’re working on the phlebotomy certification.

That said, if you already have a four-year degree (even in an unrelated field), it’s probably not worth your while to return to school for a two-year Associate degree.

Confront the reasons why you avoid instructions or instruction manuals.,
Make yourself at least glance at the instructions whenever you receive a new item.,
Determine how important it is to read the directions.,
Consider that you could be missing out on important/exciting features.",How to Force Yourself to Read the Instructions First," Some people consistently read the directions, cover to cover, but not you. Why?


You feel as though instructions are a waste of time. You just want the meat and potatoes of the new item and don’t need to know every detail about it.
You think that you already know what you are doing. Some people feel as though “they got this” and barrel through because assembling the item or administering the medication is easy.
You are too busy or in too big of a hurry to stop and read all the instructions. Many people work at the speed of light, trying to accomplish more in their day than Hercules. One glance of the instruction booklet and you know reading the directions will be way too time consuming.;
, Whether it’s a new entertainment system that must be put together or an upgraded iPod, tell yourself to pull out the instructions and at least give them a chance.


Recall the last time you tried to assemble/use something new and it blew up in your face. Hopefully the item didn’t actually blow up in your face, however there has to be a series of mishaps and misuses in your past if you’ve refused to read the directions. Think about what went wrong and why (most likely because you didn't consult with the instructions).
Have someone else hold you accountable. Tell your spouse, roommate or friend that he/she needs to back you up in your goal to read the instructions first.

, Ponder the ramifications of not reading the directions. In some cases, not reading the directions could put you or your family in harm’s way.


Is this an item that could put you or your family in jeopardy because you don’t read the directions? If you are administering medication or a safety device not reading the instructions could result in someone getting injured or possibly killed. For example, not reading the directions on how to safely install an infant seat in your vehicle could mean the difference between whether your infant makes it out of an accident alive or not.
Could you assemble or use the item incorrectly, which could cause harm to you or someone else? For example, if you are using an at home blood pressure reading system, could your avoidance of the instructions lead you to misread or misinterpret a reading (possibly making you miss life saving information)?

, Remember the last time you “winged it” when putting together your entertainment system and only found out years later that the system had an extra component for storage.


You already spent the money for the item so make sure you make use of every penny. You may be paying for extra features that you aren’t utilizing, simply because you blow off the instructions.
Ignoring the instructions could delay progress. For example, if you receive an antibiotic from the doctor and the only way the pill is absorbed is if you take it on an empty stomach, it would be important to know this in order to hasten your recovery. You could be taking the pill with meals only to have to hit round two of the same medication because you aren’t getting well.
Your item’s features could save you both time and money. What if the feature you blew off finding more about could actually make your day run more efficiently or save you money in the long run? For instance, many new computers provide you with the “plug and play” capabilities, but until users read the instruction manual they will never realize that their system has built in features that can help them do their job or manage their day.

Or, alternatively try the ""You do not have to eat it"" approach.,

Avoid placing newer, more nutritious foods next to your child's favorite foods.,
Choose leaner protein sources.,
Eat fruits and vegetables at every meal.,
Go for the whole grains.,
Drink mostly water.",How to Encourage Kids to Eat Healthier Foods," Adults do the grocery shopping, so if the cabinets are filled with chips, sugary cereals, ice cream, soda, fatty meats, and pastries, it is due to the adults in the household. It is thus the job of the adults to provide healthy and wholesome food. If children have healthy food in the house, that is what they will eat.


This means the adults, too. Children are very aware of when adults adopt a ""Do as I say, not as I do"" approach. If you are eating junk food, they know that.
You may need education yourself on healthy eating. If you grew up eating unhealthy food, you may not really know what a healthy diet looks, tastes, or feels like.
Be careful of foods that pretend to be healthy. The cookie that is ""made with real fruit"" is still full of sugar and fat. Fruit juice is not meant to be guzzled all day long. The chicken nuggets ""made with whole grain"" may offer only a very little fiber.
Make healthy substitutions. Some ""upgrades"" are not so difficult. Homemade baked chicken nuggets are typically far less fat and calories than the ones bought at the supermarket. A veggie burger may be a surprise hit. A yogurt smoothie instead of soda may be met with delight.
Pay attention to portion size. It is one thing to eat one grilled cheese sandwich, another to eat three. Instead, offer one grilled cheese sandwich and carrot sticks and some fruit.;
, It's not news that kids model behavior after their parents — even starting during infancy.Use this opportunity to work on demonstrating a good attitude and good eating behaviors for your children to mimic.


Show your children that you enjoy eating a wide variety of foods — including healthy and nutritious foods like lean protein, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. If you are not eating these foods, they will not, either.
Talk about nutrition. Children need to know what foods are healthy, in what portions, and why. This can be at the dinner table, at the grocery store, in the garden, or anytime.
Speak positively about food. Try not to label things as ""good foods"" or ""bad foods."" Some studies show that children ate more of and wanted more ""bad foods"" if they were labeled so by their parents. (After all, unhealthy foods often taste really good!)In America, children's educational shows such as ""Sesame Street"" talks about the difference between foods eaten every day, and ""Sometimes Foods."" This emphasizes that there are foods that are not eaten every day, even though they are delicious.
Although treats should not be a common occurrence, there is some merit for not having them be extremely rare. A child who never has chocolate, or ice cream, or cupcakes may go overboard when off on their own.


Choose eating out locations carefully. Eating at restaurants too frequently is a bad idea and so is eating at greasy fast-food restaurants.

, Many families do not eat meals together — especially dinner. With busy work schedules, sports or music practices and fitting in homework, it can be difficult to find time to eat together; however, studies show that when families eat together, children eat better.Aim to eat meals — particularly dinner — together as often as possible. This will give your family a time to reconnect after their day and allow children to watch their parents eating healthy, nutritious foods.
A study in 2000 showed that children who ate dinner with their families on a regular basis ate more fruits, vegetables and ate fewer fried foods and soda.In addition, these children also had a more balanced diet. Overall, they consumed more calcium, iron and fiber during the day. These are all important nutrients for children's growth and development.
When families eat ""in shifts"" there is a tendency to rely on prepackaged and often highly refined foods. For example, Dad might end up making macaroni and cheese for the kindergartner, heat up a slice of pizza for the teenager after play practice, and then Mom finally make a microwave meal after coming home from the PTA meeting.

, Studies have shown that if you allow your kids to get involved in the choosing, preparing and cooking of foods, they're more likely to choose healthy and nutritious foods.Allow children to come to the grocery store and pick out a new vegetable or fruit they want to try. Even if it is something you do not like or enjoy, be a good role model and allow the child to try this new food.
Also let your child get involved in preparing and cooking foods. Even for toddlers, they can help wash, stir or cut (using a butter knife or other child-safe utensil) fruits and vegetables in the kitchen.
Also ask your child how they think you should prepare a new fruit or vegetable or what would make it taste delicious.
Go to the garden. When children are involved with the growing of food, they are more likely to try it. Picking a tomato from a patio container can lead to trying it later in the day.
Go on food field trips. Going to where food comes from has a way of connecting food with pleasant memories. Berry picking, visiting an orchard, farmer's markets, or the like can make a connection to the food.

, Some parents get into the habit of essentially preparing two meals: one for the adults, and one for the kids. In some cases, parents customize the dinner for each child! But this sort of accommodation teaches kids that they do not have to try something new or different — instead, they will get what they know they will like. Of course, there may be some softening for this rule. Sometimes offering a choice of two vegetables, for instance, may avoid dinnertime angst while keeping nutrition paramount. After all, some people never come around to liking a vegetable, no matter how many times presented.
If you always cater to your child's wants and desires when it comes to eating and trying new foods, you are not setting them up for a well-balanced or nutritious diet in the future.
Kids will learn to expect and wait for you to make a special meal instead of trying a new food. This is a learned behavior.
Only make one meal nightly for everyone. And make sure that everyone in the family has each food on the plate and will try at least a few bites. This sets up good behaviors in your child as well.
Children will not die of hunger if they refuse dinner, or decide to give up after only three bites of asparagus. If they complain of hunger later, feel free to re-heat the dinner plate. Or, perhaps offer a healthy but not particularly appealing choice, such as carrots or a banana. Do not whip up a separate second dinner.


, This approach avoids power struggles over dinner by setting up a system in which the child is not forced to eat anything; however, the alternative is something pre-arranged and preferably what the child can make themselves, such as a peanut butter sandwich or baby carrots. This gives the message that the child has a choice to eat the food — or not — but whims or fussiness will not be catered to. This approach avoids a power struggle, introduces the food, and honors the fact that in the end no one can really be forced to eat anything. Forcing someone to eat something rarely ends in the person actually liking it.


Patience is key in this approach. Your child will be unlikely to try novel foods the first, second, or even subsequent times; however, by repeated exposure the ""fear factor"" is removed.
Remember that in this approach you still do not make separate dinners. While this approach gives the child more choices, the adults are the ones that decide what is for dinner.

, Kids will notoriously be picky eaters (especially between the ages of two and six years old); however, offering a variety of nutritious foods multiple times increases the likelihood that your child will grow to like these new foods.Offer your new foods a few times. You may want to consider preparing them differently to help entice your child's tastebuds.
Although offering a ""disliked food"" multiple times may seem counterintuitive, it actually is a kid-friendly method of eating. This is how children will eventually learn to be accustomed to certain tastes and textures of new foods.
Remember, it can take up to 15 tries for a child to decide whether or not they like a new food or a more nutritious foods. In addition, their tastes will change and evolve each year as they grow.
A ""try"" may be simply exposure. You do not necessarily have to get the child to eat the food for there to be some success. Just having the food on the plate — even if the food is not touched — helps emphasize this is a food. This can pave the way to actually eating the food down the line.

, An easy way to get kids to eat more nutritious foods — especially vegetables — is by sneaking them into foods they are already familiar with and enjoy.


Since there will be children who are exceptionally picky and all children (and even the adults) could use a few more fruits and vegetables, sneaking these nutritious foods into their meals is an easy way to boost your child's nutrition.
Blending is a great trick to add a whole host of items to a variety of different foods. You can blend fruits and vegetables into yogurt smoothies, put blended or pureed vegetables into baked goods like meatballs, meatloaf, soups, baked goods or casseroles like mac and cheese.
Although you can hide many foods in your child's diet, this isn't a trick you should solely rely on. You need to continue introducing new nutritious foods in their whole state.

, Another trick to get kids to eat more fruits or vegetables is by making these foods a little more fun by making them ""dippable.""Kids like that they're able to hold ""kid-sized foods"" in their hands and dip into a tasty sauce or dressing.
Cut up raw or slightly steamed vegetable sticks and serve with a homemade ranch dressing, yogurt dip or hummus.
You can also serve cut up fruit or make fruit kabobs and serve them with a lightly sweetened yogurt dip.

, Turning healthy, nutritious foods and meals into fun and kid-friendly meals is important. Foods need to be easy to eat and the more visually appealing they are to kids, the more likely your kids will eat them.


Cut up foods into bite sized pieces or serve bite sized foods. These little pieces are easy to pick up and perfectly sized for little kids. Try serving foods like: grapes, berries like blueberries or raspberries, mini meatballs, olives, steamed and cut up broccoli florets or halved snap peas.
Make foods fun in other ways too. Try cutting out shapes of your child's sandwich by using cookie cutters or making ""sushi"" by rolling deli meat and cheese in a wrap and slicing into little rounds.
Also go for bright and unique colors. This visual appeal may tempt your child into trying a new food. For example, try yellow or red beets, orange sweet potatoes, purple carrots or blood oranges for something exciting!

, An easy trick to make your child's whole dinner plate more kid friendly is by decreasing the ""food competition"" that's on the plate to begin with.For example, if you put a new food or a food previously disliked next to a favorite food (like pasta, chicken nuggets or fruit), your child will most likely automatically go for the favorite food first. This may leave little room for and appetite for the ""new food.""
Present new foods first — maybe at an afternoon snack or with foods that kids do not feel very strongly about. Serve vegetables and dip as an afternoon snack in addition to serving these foods with their dinner meals.

, When preparing meals at home for your family, choose nutritious foods to serve. Lean protein is an essential food group for both you and your children and should be included at every meal.


Lean protein is lower in calories and unhealthy sources of fat. Although children don't need to be overly concerned about calories, you do not want to feed them fatty cuts of meat that are overly high in saturated fat.Include a 1 – 2 oz serving (about half the size of a deck of cards) of lean protein at your child's meals. Including protein at each meal will ensure that they meet their daily recommended intake of protein.Try a variety of lean proteins throughout the week. Remember, they may not like some foods immediately, so continue to expose your child as often as you can. Try: poultry, eggs, seafood, lean beef, pork, legumes and low-fat dairy products.
Dryer or tougher cuts of meat like a grilled chicken breast or a steak may be too difficult for your child to chew and swallow. They may show a dislike due to a texture difficulty. Serve moister protein choices or serve them with a sauce. For example, instead of grilled chicken breast, try roasted chicken thighs.

, Fruits and vegetables may be tricky food groups to get your child to eat (especially vegetables; however, aim to serve these foods at each meal and snack.


Children do not need overly large quantities of fruits or vegetables each day. But give them a small serving around 1/2 cup each time they eat a meal or snack. This will help them meet their daily minimum intake.Fruits and vegetables are important food groups for kids and adults alike. These foods are ""nutritional powerhouses"" and contain high amounts of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Although vegetables can be the most tricky group for kids to like and be willing to eat, be patient and continue to expose them to new vegetables and new ways of preparing them.

, When you're preparing meals, also include whole grains. These are a much more nutritious choice than more refined grains.


Whole grains are minimally processed and offer higher amounts of fiber. Both children and adults should aim to make most of their grain choices, whole grain.Some children may not like the nutty flavor, chewy texture or darker color that many whole grain foods have. Again, patience and continued exposure can help.
However, many food companies are now making 100% whole grain foods with ""white whole grains."" These foods are white in color, have less of an intense flavor and a less chewy texture. Many children will eat these foods easily and never realize they are eating a healthy food.

, Children love sweet things, and juice and sugary drinks are typically a favored beverage However, children (and adults) typically only need water.


Make sure your child stays hydrated everyday. Aim to have them drink about 2-3 cups of water each day.In addition to water, kids should also drink low-fat milk. This provides protein, calcium and vitamin D which are essential for healthy growth and development.Aim to have your child drink about 2 cups daily of low fat milk.
Avoid fruit juice cocktails or juice drinks, sodas, sports drinks and other sweetened beverages. If your child does want juice occasionally, always serve 100% juice.
Even 100% juice is a very concentrated source of sugar, albeit natural sugars. It is still not as healthy as whole fruit. While some is fine, it should be limited. Diluting fruit juice is a good habit to start early so they don't get used to the taste of 100% juice. Give children diluted juice early (i.e. 1/2 water, 1/2 juice)
A good guideline for fluid intake is to keep servings of juice to one or two a day, and at mealtime. Milk is for the other meals. Water is served any other time of day.

Never let your baby consume any leftovers.",How to Cook Oats for a Child," You can use your food processor to grind the oatmeal and puree and blend baby food from jars. But you can also serve your baby nutritious home made food using the food processor and be assured you are feeding your baby healthy, non processed food as well as saving some money.


According to Dr. Alan Greene, a clinical professor of Pediatrics at Stanford School of Medicine, most babies will have good food habits when they eat natural foods, as they are usually less sweet and salty than processed foods.;
, Solid food such as hard pieces of fruit and vegetables can lead to choking when given to babies, since most babies have not yet developed better eating skillsand lack the ability to chew and swallow well. Make sure your pureed food is ready to swallow and moist so it does not require your baby to chew it., Just make sure that you really grind and cut the food into small pieces to avoid any choking hazards for your baby.

, Use about ¼ cup of oats, since most babies usually consume small amounts of food at one time and you want to avoid wasting any of the oats.

, Grind for fifteen to thirty seconds or until the oats are finely ground, forming a soft powder that looks easy for your baby to swallow.


If you do not have access to a food processor or grinder, you can also buy powdered oats.

, The size of the pot should fit the amount of oats you are going to cook.

, Use this ratio: ¼ cup of oats for one cup of water.


You can also add milk for flavouring if you prefer. You can add ½ cup of milk and ½ cup of water or just add 1 cup of milk, depending on the desire consistency and taste.

, Stir the mixture constantly, as this will prevent the oats from sticking.

, Set the stove temperature to medium heat.

, Stir it continually until the mixture is thick and creamy.


Check after five to ten minutes to see if the liquid (milk or water) has been absorbed by the oats. The oats should appear expanded or plumped up.
Once they look done, turn off the stove and place the cooked oats in a bowl.

, You can do this by dabbing a small amount of food inside your wrist, which is the thinnest skin on your hand. The temperature should be warm but not too hot.

, For example, apple or carrot. You can also mash up food using a fork, such as ripe bananas or boiled potatoes., You can sprinkle about ½ of ground cinnamon into the oats to add more flavor.


Make sure your baby is old enough to digest cinnamon and other natural ingredients. Usually when your baby is starting to eat solids at around four to six months old, they can also eat natural flavoring. Feeding most babies natural flavors too early can cause an allergy or diarrhea., These can cause allergic reaction.


Symptoms like rashes, trouble breathing, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, and vomiting may occur if your baby is allergic to these foods.

, Prepare one-ingredient baby food daily at first, and then wait four days to introduce a new food. Never combine food for your baby to avoid unnecessary allergies.For example, introduce oatmeal for now before introducing other ingredient to be combined with it like fruits or natural flavoring.

, You can add other ingredients to the oats like maple syrup and raisins. If your baby loves berries, you can also add in some of these fruits.


Never add honey to your baby’s oatmeal, especially if your baby is below one year old. Honey cannot be given to babies under the 12 months of age as there are bacteria that contaminate the honey.
As well, avoiding honey can reduce the risk of infant botulism, a weakness in muscle among infants., Always throw away any unconsumed food. Leftovers can be contaminated and if eaten, can lead to sickness or poison your baby.

",How to Use a Chemex Coffee Maker," The ideal filter choice for use with a Chemex brewer is the Chemex-bonded filter. This filter is made from a very thick paper, which increases brewing time and prevents collapse, as the Chemex brewer does not support the underside of the filter. The filters are square-shaped, and can be folded into a cone by pulling 1 of the 3 folds away from the others.;
, The thicker side, with 3 folds of paper, should rest against the pouring spout of the brewer.

, Because Chemex filters are especially thick, they tend to impart an unpleasant papery taste to the coffee. This can be prevented by pre-wetting the filter. Pour a few ounces (50 ml or so) of hot water into the filter; the water should quickly wick up into the entire filter. Once the filter is soaked, pour the water out into the sink.

, Coffee should be ground using a medium setting, similar to the grind used for automatic drip coffee makers. Use 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of ground coffee per 3 fluid ounces (90 ml) of water.

, For brewing coffee, water should be heated to between 195 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 - 93 degrees Celsius). This can be achieved by letting water come to a rolling boil and then removing it from the heat source for 30 seconds.

, Begin by pouring in a circular motion just enough water over the ground coffee to soak all of the grounds, but not enough to allow any of the coffee to float up onto the surface of the water. This process, called ""blooming,"" allows the grounds to expand and prepares them for even extraction.

, After allowing the coffee grounds to bloom, pour the rest of the water into the filter. It is best to pour a small amount at a time, as this keeps the overall volume of water low and ensures effective infusion.

, Once the water has drained through the grounds (this process should ideally take 4 minutes), remove the filter, and discard it. Coffee grounds and filters can readily be composted.

, Pour the coffee by gripping the Chemex brewer by the wooden collar and tilting it. Do not attempt to place the glass brewer onto a heat source to warm the coffee; this can cause the glass to fracture.

Pour the milk immediately into your espresso drink.",How to Use a Commercial Espresso Machine," Turn on a cold water tap and let it run for a minute. Either remove the reservoir and fill it at the tap, or fill a separate container and pour the water into the reservoir. If the machine has a lid, replace it when the reservoir is full.


Do not fill the reservoir past the water line.
Some commercial espresso makers have water piped directly into the machine. In this case, you don’t have to worry about filling the reservoir.;
, The power switch will most likely be located on the machine’s backsplash. Turn the switch to the ""on"" position and give the machine at least 15 minutes to warm up. This will give the machine time to heat the water and build the pressure required to force water through the grounds.Larger espresso machines may need up to 45 minutes to warm up. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for the exact preheating time.

, The portafilter, or portable filter, is the handled cup component on an espresso machine that holds the coffee grounds. To get the portafilter ready, insert a filter basket into the basin. Then, insert the portafilter upward into the bottom of the group head and turn the portafilter to the right to lock it in place.Filter baskets and portafilters come in multiple sizes. Choose the right size portafilter and basket depending on whether you're making a single, double, or triple shot of espresso.

, Once the portafilter is in place, turn on the water for a single shot and allow it to pour through the group head and portafilter. This will rinse out any old coffee, detergent, or other particles.


When the water has finished, remove the portafilter by turning the handle to the left and then pulling the portafilter down and out of the group head.
Wipe the portafilter and group head dry with a clean towel. Return the portafilter to the locked position in the group head.
Once the espresso machine is ready to go, always leave the portafilter in this position. This will prevent the machine from losing pressure and help it maintain the right temperature., For a standard double shot of espresso, you'll need 18 to 21 grams of coffee beans.One of the keys to a good espresso shot is the grind of the beans. The espresso process requires very fine coffee grounds that are close to a powder. Transfer the beans to the grinder and grind them until you have grounds that are roughly the same size as salt grains.


Once you’ve ground the beans, remove the portafilter from the group head and transfer the grounds to the portafilter. Don’t worry if the portafilter is overflowing slightly.

, Use your finger to distribute the grounds and level off the top. Brush any excess grounds into a bowl or knock box. To tamp the coffee and create a compressed espresso puck in the portafilter, you have to:Hook the portafilter onto the ledge of a counter to keep it in place.
Place the tamper on top of the grounds.
Hold your tamping arm perpendicular to the floor, so your elbow is at a 90-degree angle. Your wrist, arm, and elbow should all be in the same line as the portafilter.
Apply 30 pounds of pressure evenly to the tamper to create a level bed of espresso grounds.
Remove the tamper and check that the espresso is even and flat.

, Lock the portafilter into its position in the group head. Place a glass cup below the spout. Turn on the water. This will force the water through the compressed coffee in the portafilter, and the espresso will pour out the spout and into the cup. The full extraction should take about 25 to 30 seconds.


The ideal shot of espresso will have a rust-colored crema on top and a dark espresso on the bottom., You can serve the espresso in the cup you poured the shot into, but be sure to stir it first if you do. Otherwise, transfer the shot to another glass or cup for serving, especially if you're going to be making a latte, cappuccino, or other espresso-based drink.


Stirring or transferring the shot helps to distribute the crema throughout the liquid., It’s always a good idea to clean the steam wand before and after using it. This will ensure no contaminants get into the milk. Stand back from the steam wand and turn on the steam by opening the valve. Let the steam blow for about five seconds, and then close the valve to turn it off., Espresso-based drinks come in many sizes, and the size of the drink will determine the amount of milk you use. Many coffee drinks are between 6 and 20 ounces (177 and 591 ml). Use the size of the coffee as a guide for how much milk to pour. Once you’ve measure the cold milk, pour it into a clean metal container.


Don’t forget to subtract the espresso quantity from the milk. For instance, if you're making a 6-ounce (177-ml) coffee, you only need 5 ounces (148 ml) of milk if you made a single shot of espresso.
Remember that the milk will froth up as it foams, so measure slightly less milk than you actually need.
Only use cold milk for steaming, as this will ensure the best consistency., Position the metal container so the steam wand tip is submerged in the milk. The tip of the wand should be near the middle of the milk. Hold the container at a 45-degree angle.


Turn on the steam and allow it to froth the milk.
As the milk increases in volume, move the cup down until the wand is just below the surface. Then, gently plunge the wand back down to continue aerating the milk.Continue frothing the milk like this until it reaches 140 F (60 C), or until the container is very hot to the touch.
Turn off the steam.

, Remove the container and set it aside. Turn on the steamer again to purge any excess milk. Let the steam run for about five seconds. Turn off the steam and wipe the wand with a damp towel.


This will prevent milk from drying and hardening on the wand., As soon as the milk is hot and frothy enough, pour it with your prepared espresso and serve.You can also sweeten the drink with sugar, top it with cinnamon, or cover it in whipped cream if you like.

""My coffee isn't getting hot.""",How to Use a Coffee Maker," While natural or bleached filters can be used, it's suggested to use a non-generic one. Cheap generic filters are less dependable for good results.


Many coffee makers come with their own mesh filter. If it is available, it's usually the easiest and environmentally friendly choice. Use a coffee maker's specialized filter rather than a paper one.;
, The more coffee you want to make, the more coffee you'll need to put in the filter. Depending on your coffee machine and the type of coffee you are making, the ratio of coffee to water may vary. A standard ratio is about 2 tablespoons for every 6 ounces of water you plan to brew (or one full coffee grinder lid, no more). It's advisable to double check your coffee maker manual when deciding the ratio between coffee and water.









Special coffee blends may have special coffee/water ratios - most coffee blends will have instructions on the package.
Make sure that you are using a tablespoon. Most coffee makers come with a scoop. Read the instructions to see how many scoops you need.

, To measure, you can use the measuring lines on the coffee pot or on the side of the coffee maker. Use the coffee pot to pour the water into the coffee maker - there is usually an open space behind or above the filter.









For first-time coffee maker users, it may be tempting to pour the water directly into the filter basket. Do not do this. Pour into the compartment intended to hold the water until brewing. After pouring, put the coffee pot back on the warming plate.

, Some makers start brewing the coffee automatically while others have a manual time setting.








, Some coffee makers have a ""pause"" setting, that allows you to pause the brewing process and fill a cup before it's finished.








, If you remove the coffee grounds too late, your pot will be too bitter due to flavors released later during the brewing process.









If you used a mesh filter, simply throw the coffee grounds in the garbage (or recycle them) and wash the filter.

, For a fresher, more flavorful coffee, you should buy fresh coffee beans and grind them yourself, rather than buying pre-ground coffee. A coffee's flavor comes from delicate flavor compounds within the cells of the coffee bean. When ground, the coffee bean's interior is exposed to the air and, over time, will react with it, causing the coffee to lose some of its aroma.








Be sure to store your coffee beans in an air-tight container. Coffee has odor-absorbing properties - that's why coffee grounds can substitute for baking soda in the fridge. Unfortunately, this also means that if your coffee isn't kept sealed in an air-tight container, you may have garlic-y coffee.
Coffee aficionados disagree on whether to store coffee beans at low temperatures. Some recommend keeping coffee beans in the fridge if they will be used within a week and transferring any beans that won't be used for a few weeks to the freezer. Others prefer simply to keep them in a cool, dark place., Like any equipment that uses substantial amounts of hot water, coffee machines can accumulate mineral sediments over time. These sediments can give a nasty, rancid taste to the coffee. Periodically clean your coffee maker for the best tasting coffee. See our guide on How to Clean a Coffee Maker









If your coffee machine has a noticeable odor or visible sediment when it's not in use or if you simply can't remember the last time you've cleaned your coffee machine, it's probably time to clean it.

, Different coffee brewing methods may require coarser or thicker grinds for optimum flavor. Because ground beans exchange their flavor compounds with water, changing the coarseness (and thus the overall surface area that can be touched by water) of the grounds can affect the final flavor. Generally, the more time that the brewing method requires the coffee and water to be in contact with each other, the coarser the grind.


For normal ""drip"" coffee makers as described in Part One above, a medium grind (like you'll find for most pre-ground coffee) is usually fine. If you're using a more exotic brewing method like a french press or an aeropress, consider consulting a coarseness chart like the one available here: http://www.coffeeconfidential.org/grinding/ground-coffee/ .

, For brewing processes, water should be around 195–205 °F (91–96 °C), or just below boiling. Colder water won't extract enough flavor from the coffee beans, while hotter water can scald the coffee, affecting the taste.








If you are boiling your own water for your coffee, allow the water to come to a boil, then remove from the heat source for about 1 minute before pouring it over the grounds.
If you keep your coffee grounds in the refrigerator, most brewing processes won't be negatively affected by the cooler beans. However, if you're making espresso, you should allow your beans to reach room temperature before brewing.Because espresso brewing uses a relatively small amount of water that comes in contact with the coffee for a relatively short time, cold beans can actually affect the extraction process.

, Like all appliances, coffee makers are suspect to occasional malfunction with regular use. Below are a few of the most common problems encountered with coffee makers and suggestions for fixing the problems. Before attempting any troubleshooting, make sure the coffee maker is unplugged and there is no hot water in its reservoir.








, As discussed above in Part Two, hot water can leave mineral deposits in your coffee maker which, if allowed to build up, can affect the taste of your coffee. It's recommended to clean your coffee maker (including its internal components) monthly if it's being used regularly. Consult our how-to guide on How to Clean a Coffee Maker.









Also consider the possibility of errors when storing/handling the coffee. Make sure the coffee has not been left in the open or in contact with any contaminating ingredients - coffee absorbs flavors and aromas from other sources very well.

, If very little water (or no water at all) seems to be flowing through your coffee maker, you may have a blockage in one of the machine's tubes (the aluminum heating tube is especially blockage-prone.)Run the machine with vinegar in the water tank and no coffee or filter. Repeat as needed until blockage is cleared, then run the machine twice with water to rinse away the vinegar.








, Many modern coffee makers have options to control the size of the brew to allow on-the-go drinkers to brew coffee directly into a mug or thermos. Make sure that your coffee maker's settings are configured correctly and that the correct amount of water is in the reservoir before brewing - you may need to consult a manual for precise instructions on modifying brew size.








, This is most likely a problem with the heating element or the coffee maker's internal wiring. Because replacement parts can be hard to find and the repair process involves working with potentially dangerous electric wires, it may be best to replace the coffee maker in this case.









If you'd still like to attempt to fix an electrical issue with your coffee maker, be sure to unplug and power-off the machine before proceeding.DIY guides for many common electrical issues are available via a quick internet search.

, There are hundreds of photos, Pinterest boards, design blogs, and home magazines that have examples of both professional and amateur coffee station designs.Look for your favorite examples, and use these pictures to brainstorm how you might design your own. If there is a particular feature that you like about a coffee station, take note of it. Try to think about how you can use that in your own kitchen.

, You will need to find which area of the kitchen you want to dedicate to your coffee station. This should be a clear surface with access to an outlet. Once you have determined which space you are going to use, you should measure it so you know how much room you have to store your things.


Countertop space is great to use for a coffee station. Make sure you have enough room for your equipment. If you are limited on counter space, try organizing everything on a single tray. Place that tray on your counter. This will help you confine your coffee supplies to a limited area.If you can’t use counter space, you may want to invest in a sofa table, side bar, food cart, or hutch. The surface should be at a convenient height. You can move this surface anywhere in your kitchen where you have sufficient space and access to an outlet.Some people use built-in cabinets for their coffee station. If you want an uncluttered look, you can remove the shelves from a cabinet, and place your coffee makers, cups, and ingredients inside. Make sure that the cabinet is at a convenient height for you to make coffee., The equipment itself should remain on the counter or table surface, but everything else can be stored elsewhere if you decide. If you’re short on space, you may want to think of other storage options. You might consider:


Installing hooks on the wall for your cups and mugs.
Building shelves above the station for cups and ingredients.
Using cabinets above and below the station for storage., If your kitchen has a theme to it, you should try to think about how your coffee station might fit within the larger design scheme. Try to match the color scheme, theme, and organizational pattern of your larger kitchen.


If you have a minimalist kitchen, you may not want a cluttered coffee station. Hide your supplies in cabinets, or try to build the coffee station within a cabinet.
If you have a small kitchen and not enough counter space, try to find a corner where you can place your coffee station. This will make appear as though the coffee station is not taking up too much room.If your kitchen follows an industrialist or modern theme, you might want to use steel canisters for your ingredients. Try to find a design that utilizes straight lines.

, If you are planning on adding hooks, shelves, or cabinets for your station, you should install them before setting up the station itself. Place the coffee maker where you think you might put it, and mark its height on the wall with a pencil. This will help you measure where you can install shelves or hooks. You should not build it right at the mark but rather start measuring your shelves and cabinets from above this mark.


If you are installing hooks for mugs, use rounded hooks. Nail them into the wall. Do not use adhesive tape for your hooks, as they may not be strong enough to hold mugs. You can nail the hooks below a wall-mounted cabinet or buy premade mug racks., If you are using an electric coffee maker, you should go ahead and place it where you think it will be most convenient. Make sure that its cord can reach the outlet. You will arrange all of your other supplies around the coffee maker.


If you are using a manual maker, such as a French press or pour over drip brew, you should still organize the space around the equipment. You may have more flexibility, however, in where you put your coffee maker.

, At this point, you can start adding in your cups, sugar, creamers, syrups, and the coffee itself. Arrange these items as you please around the coffee maker using the storage options you have chosen.If you are using hooks for your mugs, place the mug’s handle on the hook. It should hang slightly tilted to the side.
If you don’t already, you may want to consider buying airtight jars to store your coffee, sugar, and other powdered ingredients in. This will help the coffee station look less cluttered and more put together.

, The coffee station should make you happy. It should be convenient for making coffee, but you may also want it to be neat, uncluttered, or stylish. Make a cup of coffee using your coffee station to see how easy and convenient it is. If it does not work, take some time to reorganize the coffee bar.


If you are having trouble reaching the coffee maker or if there is not enough space for you to use it correctly, you may need to shift where you place it.
If you need more space for your coffee maker and cups, consider storing the ingredients in a cabinet or pantry.
If the space you have chosen is not working out, you may need to move the entire station to another place within the kitchen.

, If your kitchen has neutral tones or if you do not have a color scheme for your kitchen, a color station is a great place to add a burst of color. Choose a bright color that you enjoy, and think about how you might incorporate it in your coffee station. You may want to stick to a single color theme, unless your kitchen has a larger pattern that you are using.


If you are using a cart or side table for your coffee station, you can paint it with your desired color.If you are using counter space, you may want to incorporate this color into the cups, jars, and plates that you use. You can even paint a tray your desired color. Place the coffee maker and other items on top of this tray., A chalkboard will give you an authentic feeling of a café at home. You can buy and hang a chalkboard on the wall. Alternatively, you can paint your own by painting the wall directly.Use two coats of chalkboard paint, waiting for the paint to dry between layers. Invest in some chalk so you can draw and write to your pleasure.


You can write inspirational quotes, funny drawings, your daily schedule, or notes to your family on the chalkboard.

, If you are not using your wall space, the area above the coffee station is a great place to hang art. Find a piece of art that fits in with your kitchen’s theme or the colors of your coffee station.Some ideas include:


Ceramic tiles or a mosaic
A hand-painted sign about your love of coffee
A clock
A wall decal
Vintage café boards, What you store your ingredients in can help bring out the character of your coffee station. Find jars for your coffee beans, grounds, sugar, dried creamers, spices, and anything else you like to put in your coffee.You can use:


Glass jars and containers
Vintage tins
Painted ceramic jars
Antique sugar bowls
Steel canisters

, If you have free space above your coffee station, you can put up a string of lights to make it cheerful. This will also give you some extra illumination when you are making your coffee. String lights are a great addition to any kitchen, as they can create atmosphere at night and wake you up in the morning.

Clean your cast iron cookware properly before storing.,
Dry your cast iron cookware completely prior to storage.,
Soak the pan in vinegar.,
Scrub out any lingering rust with soap.,
Re-season the pan.",How to Store Cast Iron Cookware," The most important thing to remember when storing cast iron cookware is that the area you choose must be dry. Moisture is what causes cast iron cookware to rust, so it's important you store cast iron pots and pans somewhere dry.Many people leave cast iron cookware on the stove for storage. If you don't mind having a pot or pan out all the time, this is generally safe. However, remove cast iron cookware when using the stove. You do not want steam or water to accidentally get cast iron cookware wet.
You can also store cast iron cookware in a cabinet or cupboard somewhere in your kitchen, as long as you make sure the area you choose is generally dry. Under the sink, for example, may be a bad idea. Leaky pipes could get a cast iron skillet wet, causing rust.;
, You may have more than one cast iron pot or pan to store. If you're stacking cast iron cookware, always place a piece of paper towel between cast iron pots and pans. This prevents scratches and other damage., Many people prefer to store cast iron cookware in an oven. This is generally a safe, dry place to keep your cast iron cookware when it's not in use. However, if your cookware has any wooden parts, you should not store it in an oven as this is a fire hazard.When removing cast iron cookware from the oven, make sure to use oven mitts. Cast iron cookware will get very hot inside the oven.

, Proper ventilation is important when it comes to storing cast iron cookware. You want to make sure any moisture evaporates. Therefore, leave lids off when storing cast iron cookware. Lids can trap moisture, leading to problems like rust., Seasoning is a process that helps cast iron cookware become non-stick. A seasoned pan will be easier to clean and dry, making rust in storage less likely. If you have not already seasoned your cast iron cookware, do so prior to using and storing. You can season your pan in the oven or on the stove top. The process usually involves coating the pan with some kind of oil, like vegetable or canola oil. Some people prefer to use grease or lard for the process.To season in the oven, you would preheat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly coat the pan with oil, lard, or grease and let bake for an hour. Then, remove the pan with oven mitts and wipe off any excess oil, grease, or lard.
To season on a stovetop, heat the pan on the stove top until it's hot to the touch. At a light layer of oil, grease, or lard. Leave the pan on the stove top for a few more minutes, then remove. Wipe away any excess oil, grease, or lard.

, You want to make sure your cast iron cookware is completely clean prior to storage. You should clean messes from a cast iron skillet right away, before they become set in. You should wash your cast iron cookware with hot water, never using soap. You should never allow cast iron cookware to soak in the sink, as this can cause rust.You can use a sponge or a stiff, non-metal brush to clean a cast iron pan after use.
If there is a lot of set on food mess, add a cup of kosher salt to the pan. Take a pair of tongs and wrap a towel around them. Fill the pan with warm water, and scrub with the salt until the food comes unstuck. Then, rinse the pan thoroughly.

, You should never store cast iron cookware that is still wet. This can easily lead to rust. You should dry the cookware as much as you can with a towel. Then, set the pan or pot on the stovetop at low heat. Leave for a few minutes, as long as it takes for the pan or pot to get warm.After a few minutes have passed, use a paper towel to rub the pan or pot with a small coating of lard, grease, or oil. Heat for 5 to 10 more minutes.
Allow the pan or pot to cool. Wipe away any excess oil. Now, your pan or pot should be safe to store.

, Even if you're careful to take every precaution, your cookware may rust. Cast iron cookware is made to last, so rust can usually be successfully removed. If your cookware is very rusted, doing a vinegar soak can help remove rust and restore the pan.Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Make enough to fully submerge your pot and pan. You can soak the pan in a bucket or in your sink.
Check the pan about once an hour. As soon as most of the rust is gone, you should remove the pot or pan from the vinegar. If you let cookware soak after the rust is gone, the vinegar will eat into the cast iron surface. Once you remove the pot or pan, rinse and dry before storing again.

, While soap should rarely be used on a cast iron pan, it can be helpful for scrubbing out any rust left after a vinegar soak. Use a mild detergent and warm water to scrub out any remaining rust. Never put cast iron cookware in your dishwasher. A green scrub pad or steel wool would work well. Once you've scrubbed out any remaining rust, dry the pan completely., A vinegar soak will remove the cookware's seasoning. You should re-season your pan after removing rust. Re-seasoning methods do vary based on the type and size of cookware, so you may want to do some research first. However, many types of cast iron cookware can be re-seasoned with aluminum foil and oil.Place a piece of aluminum foil in the oven and then preheat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Rub vegetable oil over the entire pot or pan.
Set the pot or pan upside down over the foil. This will catch any oil that drips down during cooking. Let the cookware bake for an hour, and then cool for 45 minutes.

Cook the vegetables.,
Scramble the eggs.,
Pour the eggs into the skillet.,
Lay the tortilla strips into the skillet.,
Sprinkle on the cheese.,
Serve the migas.,
Finished.

",How to Make Migas," Place them on a cutting board and use a knife to slice them into 1/2-inch strips. It's easiest to stack the tortillas and cut them all at once.;
, Pour in a pat of butter or a tablespoon of vegetable oil and heat it for a few minutes.

, Use tongs to flip them over and cook them on the other side until they turn a little brown and crispy. Let them drain on a plate lined with paper towels.


Some people skip this step, preferring to eat migas with tortillas that are soft instead of crunchy. If this is your preference, cut the tortillas into strips and skip to the next section.
If you wish you can fry the tortillas until they get quite crunchy, like tortilla chips. In fact, tortilla chips may be substituted for tortillas in this recipe if you have them on hand.

, Heat more oil in the skillet over medium heat. When the oil gets hot, toss in the diced onions and peppers. Let them cook for a few minutes, then use a spatula to stir them around. Continue cooking the vegetables until the onions turn translucent and the peppers get slightly soft.

, While the vegetables are cooking, crack the eggs into a large bowl. Use a whisk or a fork to stir them, breaking the yolks and mixing them together until you have a sunny orange liquid. Whisk in a few dashes of salt and pepper to taste.

, Try to distribute the egg mixture evenly across the bottom of the skillet. Let it cook for a minute so that the bottom sets a bit before finishing the migas.

, Place them over the uncooked egg, distributing them evenly across the skillet. Use a spatula to press them slightly down so that the egg mixture coats them all over.


If you want the tortilla strips to remain extra crispy, don't poke them down under the egg mixture. Let them sit on top instead, so the edges won't get soggy.
The eggs should be pretty well cooked at this point. Stir them a bit if there are still wet pools of egg in the pan.

, Spread the cheese evenly across the migas. Keep cooking the mixture until the cheese has totally melted. If the cheese seems to be melting too slowly, you can cover the skillet with a lid for about a minute to help it along.

, Use a spatula to scoop migas from the skillet onto plates. Serve with salsa, sour cream, refried beans, more tortillas, and any other toppings you desire.

Preheat the oven to 350 ºF (177 ºC).,
Wash and dry the skillet.,
Coat the skillet in and out with lard, vegetable shortening, or olive oil.,
Place the skillet in the oven.,
Repeat this process three times.",How to Season a Cast Iron Skillet1," Don't plan on cooking anything else in the oven while you season the cast iron, since the process can be affected by steam created by cooking other food.;
, Use soap and a scrub brush to completely scour it. This is the only time you'll be using these items to clean your skillet; after it's seasoned, you no longer scour it.

, Make sure it is completely coated, and rub it in with a paper towel.

, Let the fat or oil bake into its surface for two hours. Remove the skillet from the oven and allow it to cool.

, It takes more than one coating of oil to completely season cast iron cookware. To make sure you have a good nonstick surface that won't strip off when you cook food, give it another coat of fat or oil, cook it, let it cool, and repeat the process again.

Place the skillet in the vinegar solution.,
Rinse the skillet in water and wipe it dry.,
Coat the skillet in a layer of fat or oil.,
Bake the skillet in the oven.,
Repeat the seasoning process.",How to Season a Cast Iron Skillet2," Find a large container big enough to submerge the entire skillet. Fill the container with a mixture of half white vinegar, half water.

, Make sure it is completely submerged. Allow it to soak for three hours. The vinegar will dissolve the rust. Remove the skillet after it's finished soaking.


If you still see rust on the skillet, use a scrub brush to scrub it off. It should come off easily at this point. Make sure no rust remains.
Don't put the skillet back in the vinegar solution to soak. If you let it sit in vinegar for too long the cast iron will start to degrade.

, Make sure it is completely dry by heating it up over the stove or in the oven for a few minutes.

, Make sure it is completely covered. Use a paper towel to rub the fat or oil into the skillet's surface.

, Season the skillet at a temperature of 350 ºF (177 ºC) for 2 hours. Remove the skillet from the oven and allow it to cool.

, To make sure you build a good nonstick coating, coat the skillet with oil, bake it, allow it to cool, and repeat the process again.

Clean it right away.,
Make sure the skillet gets completely dry.,
Re-season the pan periodically.,
Store the skillet in a dry place.",How to Season a Cast Iron Skillet3," Cast iron is easiest to clean right after cooking, before the food has a chance to become one with the skillet. As soon as it is cool enough to touch, wipe out the food remnants with a towel and rinse it with hot water.


If there's a layer of caked-on food at the bottom of the pan, use a mixture of kosher salt and vinegar to scrub it off with a paper towel. Afterward, rinse the skillet with hot water to make sure you wash off all traces of the vinegar.
Caked-on food can also be burned off. Place your skillet in an oven turned to very high heat. The food will turn to ash, which can be brushed off once the skillet has cooled down. If you use this method you'll have to re-season the skillet, since the seasoning will get burned off, too.
Don't use soap or a wire scrub brush on seasoned cast iron. It will scrape off the seasoning, removing the nonstick surface allowing moisture to react with the metal and create rust.

, After you rinse out the food, dry the skillet completely. Use a dry dishcloth to wipe it off, taking care not to miss any crevices and make sure the back gets dried off, too.


You can place the pan upside down over the burner that you used to cook on, if the burner is still a little warm. This will help the pan dry faster.
To make extra sure the pan is dry, heat it up in the oven for a few minutes.

, Every time you cook with a cast iron skillet, the oil you use infuses with the pan and helps keep it seasoned. However, you can help the process along and make sure your skillet stays completely nonstick by using the full seasoning process from time to time, especially if you had to use vinegar and salt to clean it.

, Make sure water from other kitchen supplies doesn't drip onto the pan. If you're storing it with other cookware, line it with a dry dishcloth or paper towel to protect the surface of the cast iron.

Top the Pfannkuchen and enjoy!",How to Make German Pancakes1," Pfannkuchen is a generic name for a sweet pancake (literally, Pfannkuchen) make in a pan either on the stove or in the oven.Pfannkuchen are a year-round favorite that can be served topped with any number of things from applesauce to powdered sugar and even peanut butter.


There is no one standard recipe for Pfannkuchen, with different variations among families and geographic regions.Some variations have fruit such as cherries, blueberries, or apples folded in to them.
Pfannkuchen is also known by different names within Germany including Eierkuchen, Flädle in Swabia, Schmarrn in Bavaria (which is a smashed up Pfannkuchen), or Pankech in the region around Bonn and Koblenz (called the Eifel).;
, Before you can make your Pfannkuchen, gather the ingredients you need to make them. The recipe is so simple that you may already have everything at home. If not, the ingredients are available in any supermarket.


For a Pfannkuchen that serves four people you’ll need the following ingredients: 3 large eggs; 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; 1/2 cup whole milk; 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt; 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract; 2 tablespoons unsalted butter; 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (optional); 1/2 cup fruit jam (optional); 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar.The traditional topping for Pfannkuchen is either applesauce or powdered sugar.However, consider other options such as marmalade, fresh fruit, peanut butter, Nutella. Pflaumenmus, which is a delightfully spiced plum spread, is another excellent choice.

, Before you can enjoy your Pfannkuchen, you need to prepare it. Preheating your over to 400° F before you start mixing ingredients will ensure that you can eat the Pfannkuchen as quickly as possible.This simple recipe calls for baking the Pfannkuchen in the oven in a pan, such as a cast iron pan, at a temperature of 400° F. Other recipes will cook the Pfannkuchen directly on the stovetop. You can try cooking the Pfannkuchen using both methods.

, You’ll need to mix your ingredients together before you can put them in the pan and then the oven. It’s important to mix them in the order in which they’re listed so that you achieve the best results.


Whisk the 3 large eggs to combine them.
After you’ve whisked the eggs, add the ½ cup flour to the egg mixture. Continue to whisk the eggs and flour until they’re smooth.
When your egg and flour mixture is smooth, add the ½ cup whole milk, ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, and ½ teaspoon vanilla.

Try making berry pancakes.,
Try making chocolate chip pancakes.,
Try lemon poppy seed pancakes.,
Try savory vegetable pancakes.,
Try gluten-free pancakes.",How to Make Pancakes for One2," A handful of fresh berries in your batter will give your pancakes a delicious fruitiness. Virtually any berry will work well here: blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, and other berries all make good choices. You can also get away with adding berries that are slightly over-ripe — once the pancakes are cooked, they'll be unrecognizable.


In a pinch, you can use frozen berries in most pancake recipes. As long as your pancakes are fairly thin, they'll thaw completely.

, Adding chocolate chips to your batter will give you a rich, cookie-like treat. Choose whichever type of chips you like: milk chocolate will give you the sweetest taste, while semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips will give a flavor that's a little more complex.


These pancakes go well with ice cream or whipped cream as a dessert dish.

, If you're a fan of breakfast muffins, try these deliciously unique pancakes. Add lemon zest and juice to the batter along with a handful of poppy seeds for texture. You may need to compensate for the extra liquid by adding a small amount of extra flour. Try adding it 1/8 of a cup at a time until you achieve a good consistency.


To zest a lemon, use a fine grater or microplane to grate the outer layer of the peel into your mixing bowl. You won't need much — if the peel gets white, you're going too far.

Simple syrup with lemon juice makes a great syrupy condiment for this dish.

, If you're trying to get another serving of vegetables into your daily diet, try these treats by adding shredded carrots, onions, long beans, and garlic to your batter. These pancakes aren't sweet, but they taste great with a little butter or olive oil. Salty fish (like whitebait) also make great companions.


If you like spice, try adding a little red pepper to the batter with the vegetables. Plain greek yogurt is a great side in this case — its rich smoothness counteracts the spice.

, If you suffer from Celiac disease, never fear — you can still enjoy your favorite pancake recipe. Just substitute gluten-free flour for all-purpose flour in the ""Basic Pancakes"" recipe above.The taste and texture may be very slightly different, but you may even prefer these differences.


There are many kinds of gluten-free flour available. Examples include buckwheat and almond flour. Try checking your local health food store or specialty grocer if you're not sure where to buy gluten-free flour.

, After you’ve mixed the dry ingredients, add 1 cup (246 g) of ricotta cheese, ¾ cup (177 ml) of milk, 2 egg yolks, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract to a separate large bowl. Blend the wet ingredients together until they’re fully mixed.To separate the eggs, crack them against a flat surface. Break the eggs in half over a bowl, allowing the yolks to drop into the lower half. Move the yolks back and forth between the halves, so the whites drip into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolks until all of the whites are removed. Reserve the whites for later use.
If you’d like to add a fresh, lemony flavor to the pancakes, mix 1 tablespoon (6 g) of finely grated lemon zest into the wet ingredients., Once all of the wet ingredients are mixed, pour the dry ingredients into the bowl.

, When the whites are stiff, take a small spoonful and add it to the pancake batter. Gently fold the whites in to help lighten up the batter., After you’ve mixed in the first scoop of egg whites, add the remaining whites. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold them in until there are no white streaks in the batter.Once again, take care not to overmix the batter. You don’t want to deflate the whites, or the pancakes won’t have a light, airy texture.

, When you’ve finished mixing the batter, place a large skillet on the stove. Heat it over medium-high heat, and add a small amount of butter to melt and grease the pan.You can use a griddle to cook the pancakes if you prefer.
You want to add just enough butter to coat the surface of the skillet when melted. Start with a small amount and add more only if necessary.

, When the skillet is hot and greased, ladle approximately ¼ cup (30 g) of batter into the pan for each pancake. Allow the pancakes to cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden.You can often tell that the pancakes are finished on the first side when bubbles begin to appear in their tops.
If you’d like to add chocolate chips or blueberries to your pancakes, sprinkle a few into the pancakes when they’re just set but before you turn them over.

, When the first side of the pancakes are finished cooking, use a wide, metal spatula to carefully flip them over. Let them cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the other side is also golden., When your first batch of pancakes is finished, transfer them from the skillet to a plate. Add more pancakes to the skillet and repeat the process until you’ve used up all of the batter.You can keep the finished pancakes warm while you cook the other batches by placing another plate on top of them and placing them in the oven with the temperature set to low or warm.

, Once you’ve finished cooking all of the pancakes, divide them between plates to serve while they’re still warm. Top the pancakes with maple syrup, butter, fresh fruit, powdered sugar, fruit jam, and/or lemon curd."

Be sure to keep the blades of your blender below the surface of your mixture to prevent food from spattering.When blending, move the blender slowly up and down. This will encourage a well blended, smooth consistency in your mixture.
For tough ingredients, like vegetables, or thick mixtures, like some soups, you may have to blend for some time until the mixture is smooth and consistent.
Running the motor of your blender for extended periods can do damage to it. Try to limit your blending to 30 to 50 second intervals., If the blender attachment is activated while the blender isn't immersed, it can be very dangerous. To prevent accidental harm or injury, unplug your blender as soon as you finish using it."

",How to Use a Slow Cooker,"


Position your slow cooker near an outlet.
Keep the slow cooker at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from other appliances, food wrappers, walls or other surfaces. The slow cooker does not get hot enough to burn your countertop, but it can damage other surfaces that rest against it or near it.;
,


Chop, slice or dice vegetables as directed by the recipe. Tend to the vegetables ahead of time to speed up the assembling process.
Trim fat and gristle from meat.
Brown meat, if directed by the recipe. This step can be eliminated if time does not allow it.
Add seasonings to meat or vegetables. If your recipe doesn't require you to season the meat or vegetables before adding them to the slow cooker, sort out what you need so all seasonings and spices are ready when it's time to assemble the recipe.

, Layer food as directed by the recipe instructions. Some recipes suggest layering so that some foods reach warmer temperatures for longer periods of time during the cooking process.

, Your slow cooker should be half-way to three-quarters full after the liquid is added to the food contents.

, Add aluminum foil to the lid if it appears to have gaps or is loose. The lid must fit well for your slow cooker to cook your food effectively.

, Select the proper setting.


Choose the low setting if you want your recipe to cook for 8 to 10 hours. The low setting allows a slower warm up period, which often results in more tender meat and vegetables.
Select the high setting to cook your meat for 4 to 6 hours.

,


Keep the lid on. Lifting the lid allows heat to leave the slow cooker, lengthening the cooking period.
Refrain from stirring your food midway through the cooking process. Stirring is unnecessary.

,


Pour pasta into the recipe 30 minutes prior to when you expect your dish to be done. Pasta cooks more quickly and becomes mushy if left in the slow cooker too long.
Stir in corn starch to thicken up liquid 20 to 30 minutes before your meal is ready.
Put in quick-cooking vegetables during the last hour of cooking. Examples include broccoli, cauliflower and corn.
Add seafood within 60 minutes of the dish being completed. Seafood cooks quickly compared to other ingredients in slow cooker recipes.

Avoid using non-stick pans and glass dishes.,
Keep your the blender motor above all liquid when blending.,
Unplug the blender when cleaning.,
Store your immersion blender in a safe location.",How to Use an Immersion Blender2," Glass can chip or shatter if it comes into contact with the blades of your blender. If this happens, you'll have to throw out your mixture, otherwise you could ingest glass, which can be deadly. The non-stick coatings on pans, too, can chip off into your mixture. This coating can be unhealthy if ingested.


The safest kind of mixing container for you to use with your immersion blender will be stainless steel., By lowering the motor of your immersion blender into your mixture, you could cause the motor to burn out, the electrical components to short out, or you could potentially electrocute yourself. Even with especially deep dishes, refrain from lowering the motor into or beneath your mixture., Always unplug your blender before cleaning it. Never immerse the motor of your blender in water when cleaning, but you can clean it with mild soap and a sponge or damp cloth. The blending shaft should be washed by hand in hot water and should also be cleaned with a mild soap.


When cleaning the blending shaft, be extra careful around the blades. These are very sharp, and can cut you easily., Immersion blenders are simple enough for children to use, and may be confused for a toy. This can be very dangerous, so you should store your blender in safe locations that are difficult for children to access, like in a high cupboard."

Blend up some salsa.,
Whip up a pesto sauce, presto.Add basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, and a little salt and pepper to a tall, narrow stainless steel mixing dish.,
Mix up batter quickly and efficiently.Most hand blenders come with a beater attachment that'll allow you to mix smooth batter with ease.,
Create smoothies in small batches.,
Blend up homemade mayonnaise.",How to Use an Immersion Blender3," If you're not a fan of chunky salsa, your immersion blender can make a smooth version in a jiffy. Add tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalapeño, cilantro, and a little bit of salt and pepper to a tall, narrow stainless steel dish. Then move your immersion blender up and down until your ingredients are blended to your preference.


Depending on your tastes, you'll have to determine how much of each ingredient to use. For example, if you like spicier salsa, you might want to add more jalapeño to the mix.
You may want to add your tomatoes last to your mixing dish. This way, they'll be at the top and blend first. This will release liquid that will help blend the other ingredients.
Keep your blender level when operating. Even in your mixing dish, tilting your blender on too much of an angle can cause foot to spatter and fly., Keep the blades of your blender level, and with an up-and-down motion, blend together the ingredients to make your pesto.A simple pesto recipe you might use: 2 cups packed with fresh basil leaves, 2 full cloves of garlic, ¼ cup of pine nuts, 2/3 of a cup of extra-virgin olive oil., If your batter has a tendency to turn out lumpy, using your immersion blender to mix it should help prevent this., Making a smoothie in a full sized blender can result in more smoothie than one person can drink along with a considerable mess.Add frozen fruit, some yogurt, and enough juice to cover all the ingredients to a tall, narrow stainless steel mixing dish. Then, use your blender to mix all ingredients thoroughly., This normally time consuming activity can be ready in as few as five minutes when using an immersion blender. Add 2 egg yolks, 1 tsp lemon juice, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp dry mustard to a tall, narrow stainless steel mixing dish. Use your blender to combine these ingredients. Then add 1 cup of olive/canola oil a little bit at a time to the mixture while running your blender.


Wait until added oil disappears completely before adding more oil to the mixture. As oil is absorbed, it will add to the mixture more easily. Once you've added half a cup of oil, you can add the remaining half in a steady stream.
If the mayo turns out too thick for your liking, use your blender to mix in water 1 tsp at a time until you achieve your preferred consistency."

Rinse the rice.,
Combine the rice and water.,
Secure the lids.,
Set the microwave.,
Cook the rice.,
Rest and fluff the rice before serving.",How to Use a Microwave Rice Cooker1," Place the rice into the rice cooker. Fill the bowl with water, or enough to cover the rice plus an extra inch (2.5 cm) of head room. Use your hand or a spoon to stir the rice and swirl the water around. Drain the rice by pouring it into a fine-mesh sieve.


Rinsing rice may prevent it from sticking together, and it will also help rinse off traces of arsenic.;
, Transfer the rinsed rice back to the rice cooker. Add the water. For flavored rice, you can also add a bouillon cube in with the water, or salt, pepper, herbs, or other spices to taste. For different types of rice and other foods, you'll need a different ratio of water per cup of:Long-grain brown rice, use 3 cups (705 ml) water
Wild rice mix, use 3 cups (705 ml) water
Quinoa, use 1½ cups (353 ml) water
Polenta, use 2 cups (470 ml) water
Couscous, use 1 cup (235 ml) water

, Most microwave rice steamers come with an inner and an outer lid. You're supposed to use both when you're cooking food. Place the inner lid into the recess. Place the outer lid over top of the inner lid. Latch the handles in place if your cooker has locks.If your inner and outer lids have holes in them, offset the holes to ensure the best results.

, Set your microwave to 70 percent power if your microwave is 1,000 watts or more. This will prevent the water from evaporating too quickly and the rice from becoming crunchy.

, Place the rice into the microwave. Set the timer for 13 minutes and press “start” to cook the rice. If you're cooking something other than rice, the cooking times will be different:Cook long-grain brown rice and wild rice mixes for 30 minutes
Cook quinoa for 13 minutes
Cook polenta and couscous for 4 minutes

, When the microwave has finished, carefully remove the rice cooker and place it on a heat-proof mat. Set the rice aside and let it stand for five minutes. When the time is up, remove the outer lid, followed by the inner lid. Remove the far side first to let the steam escape away from your body.Before serving, stir the rice with a fork to fluff it up and let excess moisture out.

Select and prepare a food to spiralize.,
Choose your blade.,
Insert the blade into your spiralizer.,
Put in your food to be spiralized.,
Spin the crank to spiralize your food.",How to Use a Veggie Spiralizer1," You can spiralize nearly any vegetable or fruit that will fit in the food attachment of your spiralizer. Pick the food you wish to spiralize, clean it thoroughly under cool running water, and pat dry the food with a paper towel or a clean dishrag. Some food you might consider spiralizing:


Vegetables: zucchini, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, squash, onions, cabbage, and more.
Fruits: apple, pear, plantain, and more.;
, Most spiralizers come with three different blades, each of which spiralize your food differently. More advanced spiralizers may have more blades, and less advanced ones may only have a single blade. Generally, you can expect to find:


A noodle blade. This will cut the food in your spiralizer to the thickness of a normal sized spaghetti noodle.
A spiral blade. This attachment is excellent for curly fires and will cut your food at about the thickness of bucatini noodles.
A ribbon blade. This blade creates a delicate ribbon spiral out of your food. If you're planning on using veggies in a salad, this attachment works well., To correctly and safely insert your blade into your spiralizer, you should follow its usage instructions. However, for most models, this involves sliding your chosen blade attachment into a slot until it locks into place.Some models may click when the blade is locked in place. Even if you don't feel a click, be sure the blade is firmly in place.
Use care whenever handling your blades or whenever a blade is in your spiralizer. These are very sharp, and can cut you easily.

, Depending on the model of spiralizer you own, the food attachment may be oriented up and down or side to side.In most cases, the food attachment will consist of a plastic arm, with the blade side of the arm having spikes to hold your food in place and the opposite side of the arm having a crank.At this point, your food should be held between the blade side of the arm and the blades. You may need to cut the ends off your food to make it fit better in the attachment., As you turn the crank and wind your food, the blades of your spiralizer will shave ribbons or noodles of the food free. Some models may emit the noodles into a storage container, but if yours lacks this feature, you may want to set out a bowl or container to catch and store your spiralized food."

Make chili.,
Whip up a batch of potato salad.,
Make black beans and rice.",How to Use a Microwave Rice Cooker2," Chili is a simple, healthy, and filling meal you can make in the microwave rice cooker in no time. You can use any type of ground meat you like, such as beef or turkey. You can also use tofu if you want to make a delicious vegetarian chili. To make chili in the rice cooker:Cover and cook the turkey (in the rice cooker) for four minutes.
Drain the turkey.
Add the green pepper and onion and cook for two minutes.
Stir in the remaining ingredients.
Cover with the lid and cook for an additional 10 minutes.

, Potato salad is another delicious meal or side dish that you can make in the microwave rice cooker. Place the potatoes in the rice cooker and add enough water to cover them. Cook the potatoes for 10 minutes. Drain the water. In a separate bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Add the dressing, celery, and onion to the potatoes and stir to coat.


You can also make mashed potatoes in the rice cooker using the same method. Cook the potatoes and drain them. Mash them with a fork or potato masher. Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of milk and continue mashing. Stir in butter, salt, pepper, chives, sour cream, or any other mashed potato fixings you fancy., This dish is similar to chili, but it calls for rice instead of meat, and the seasonings are different. Combine the water, rice, and salt in the rice cooker. Cover and cook for about 14 minutes, until the water has been absorbed. Set the rice aside for five minutes. Stir the rice with a fork and add all the remaining ingredients. Stir to combine.You can serve the rice as is, or garnish it with some shredded cheese, sour cream, or fresh parsley or cilantro.

Insert the steamer basket.,
Add the food and water.,
Close the lids and cook the food.,
Let the food stand before draining and serving.",How to Use a Microwave Rice Cooker3," Some microwave rice cookers come with a steamer basket that fits inside the cooker. You add food to the basket and water to the bottom of the cooker. Because the food is not sitting directly in the water, it gets steamed instead of boiled.


Place the empty steamer basket directly inside the rice cooker.

, The steamer basket is ideal for pasta and vegetables, including potatoes, greens, corn, carrots, and more. Add the desired vegetables to the steamer basket and add ½ cup (118 ml) of water to the bottom of the cooker.


For pasta, it’s better to boil than steam. For every 12 ounces (340 g) of pasta you use, add about 7 cups (1.65 L) of hot water, or enough to cover the pasta.Do not fill the steamer basket more than three-quarters full to leave room for expansion.

, Insert the inner lid over the steamer basket. Add the outer lid and close the latches on the handles. Set 1,000-watt microwaves to 70 percent power. Cooking times will vary depending on the food. For a pound (454 g) of food, microwave for:4 minutes for pasta
4 to 7 minutes for spinach and peas
5 to 9 minutes for corn and Brussel sprouts
7 to 13 minutes for asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots
11 to 16 minutes for beans

, When the cooking time is up, remove the cooker from the microwave and set it on a heat-proof mat. Let the vegetables or pasta stand for two minutes. Then, remove the lids, pull out the steamer basket, and discard the excess water.


Transfer the veggies or pasta to bowls or plates and serve.
Spinach should not be left to stand after cooking. When the cooking time is up, remove it from the cooker immediately to prevent wilting and sogginess.

Re-imagine Italian pasta dishes.,
Create an exotic Asian stir fry.,
Saute your spiralized veggies simply.,
Boil your spiralized food.,
Microwave spiralized food for fast preparation.",How to Use a Veggie Spiralizer2," The noodle blade is the perfect way for you to recreate your favorite pasta dishes with noodles made from healthy alternatives. Some Italian dishes you might want to consider, and some foods to use in making these dishes, include:


Spaghetti and meatballs, linguine and clams, noodles carbonara, baked pasta, and more.
Potatoes, turnips, rutabagas, sweet potatoes, zucchini, and others., The noodle blade of your spiralizer is also well suited to making the kinds of noodles served in Asian stir fry dishes. Use sesame oil and a splash of teriyaki sauce to saute noodles made from things like:


Carrots, daikon radishes, potatoes, turnips, zucchini, and so on., A simple saute of your spiralized veggies will need a little bit of cooking oil added to a heated pan. Toss the spiralized veggies in the oil until they are tender but crunchy. Allow the veggies to cool, and they're ready to be eaten.After your veggies are finished being sauteed, you might want to add some seasoning, like a little bit of salt, pepper, garlic, and more., You can boil your spiralized food in a sauce or a soup to give it impart it with the flavor of that sauce or soup. This is an excellent way of adding nuance to the flavor of your spiralized food. Simply add the food to the boiling pot and cook it for five to seven minutes.Residual heat in soup and sauce will continue to cook your spiralized food even after you turn off the heat of your stove. For this reason, you may want to slightly under cook food when boiling it., Transfer your spiralized food to a microwave safe dish. Then moisten a piece of paper towel and place it over top the food. Microwave the veggies in two minute intervals. When the veggies are tender, but still crunchy, they are ready to eat.


In some cases, while microwaving, liquid can form in the bottom of your container. Drain liquid from the food before serving it or cooking it with anything else."

Pre-heat your oven.,
Cut your spiralized veggies.,
Arrange the food on your baking sheet.,
Bake the veggies.,
Allow the fries to cool and enjoy.",How to Use a Veggie Spiralizer3," It'll take some time for your oven to reach the proper temperature, so it's best to pre-heat straightaway. This way you can do other prep-work while waiting for the oven to heat. Generally, pre-heating takes between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on your oven. Set your oven to 425°F (218°C)., Straight from the spiralizer, your soon to be veggie fries will likely be in long ribbons. Take a kitchen knife or pair of kitchen scissors and cut the spiralized veggies into fry-length segments. Then:


Put these in a container and drizzle oil (like vegetable oil or grapeseed oil) onto them.
Add a little salt, pepper, or other seasonings to the mix. Be sparing when adding seasoning. You can always add more later, but adding too much might ruin the fries., Lay out your spiralized food onto your baking sheet in a thin, outspread layer. Clumping or layering your fries too thick will cause them to bake unevenly.


Prevent uneven baking by baking your fries in batches or using two baking sheets if you feel that the baking sheet is too full.
By layering your baking sheet with aluminum foil, you can save yourself time when cleaning up. After baking, all you'll need to do is throw away the foil., Your oven should be heated by this point, though if its indicator says it is still pre-heating, you may have to wait a few minutes. When the oven's ready, place your tray on the middle rack and allow it to bake for 20 to 30 minutes.


Especially toward the end of the baking time, pay close attention to your fries. When they are golden and crispy, your fries are done.
Be sure to use an oven mitt or potholder to protect yourself from the heat when removing your baking sheet from the oven.
Extreme heat can damage some counter tops. You may want to lay out potholders on which you can set your baking sheet to cool., Right out of the oven, your fries will be quite hot. Give them some time to cool, then sample one to evaluate its seasoning. If the fries need more seasoning, like salt, now's your time to add some. After that, serve and enjoy.

Place a Nutella disk on top of each pancake.,
Top each pancake off with more batter.,
Flip the pancake when the bubbles appear.,
Continue cooking the pancake until it is golden.,
Make the rest of the pancakes.,
Serve the pancakes.",How to Make Stuffed Pancakes1," Use 1½ to 2 tablespoons (28.5 to 38 grams) of Nutella per drop. This recipe is enough to make 6 to 7 pancakes, but it might be a good idea to make a few dollops of Nutella in case one breaks.If you can't find any parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead.
If you don't like Nutella, you can try other fillings as well, such as peanut butter or jam.Consider mixing flavors. Try half a dollop of peanut butter and half a dollop of jelly.;
, The disks need to be about 2½ inches (6 centimeters) wide and ¼-inches (½-centimeter) thick. You can use a spoon or rubber spatula to do this., It will take about 60 to 90 minutes for them to freeze. Once they are solid, peel them off of the parchment paper, then store them in the freezer., Measure the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the baking powder, sugar, and salt. Stir everything together until everything is combined and no clumps remain., Pat down the dry mixture first, then make a hole in the center. Pour the milk into the hole, then add the egg and vanilla extract. Stir everything together with a whisk until smooth. Be careful not to over-mix, or the pancakes will turn out tough and chewy., Place the pan over the stove and add ½ teaspoon of butter. Allow the butter to melt, then wipe most of it away with a paper towel., Leave the rest in the freezer. The next few steps will go by quickly but Nutella melts quickly. If you take all of the disks out, they will melt before you get to use them., You will need to use ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of batter per pancake. If your pan is large enough, you may be able to fit two pancakes., Make sure that the disks are centered. Working with frozen Nutella disks is much easier than working with soft Nutella., This time around, you only need to use enough batter to cover the Nutella disk. Use the edge of a spook or spatula to help spread the batter over the Nutella. Work quickly because the disk will start to melt once it's in the pancake., After about 2 minutes, bubbles will start to form around the edges. Use a spatula to lift the pancake up and check the underside. If it is golden, carefully flip the pancake over., This will take another minute or so. When the pancake is golden on both sides, slide it off of the pan and onto a plate. If Nutella oozes out onto the pan, wipe it off. If you don't, you'll end up with Nutella on the next pancake., After the third or fourth pancake, you will need to add more butter to the pan. Remember to wipe the butter off. You should be able to make at least 6 pancakes, but you might be able to make 7., They taste great with sliced strawberries. If you want to you could even add some whipped cream!"

Do not reheat leftovers in the slow cooker.",How to Use a Slow Cooker Safely1," Always thaw your meat and poultry inside the refrigerator. Also, keep the meat in the fridge until you are ready to put it in the slow cooker for cooking.Your slow cooker will not be able to heat frozen meat to a consumable temperature quickly (140 degrees Fahrenheit/60 degrees Celsius), which can cause food borne illnesses.;
, The purpose of the warm setting is to keep your food warm after it is cooked. If you use the warm setting to cook your food, then it will not be cooked through and will be unsafe for consumption., Every time you lift the lid, the internal temperature falls 10 to 15 degrees, slowing the cooking process by 30 minutes. Therefore, only lift the lid to stir your ingredients or to check your food for doneness., Store them in tupperware and place the tupperware in the fridge after you have finished eating. Try not to let your food cool down in the cooker., Instead, manually reheat leftovers on the stovetop, in the microwave, or in a conventional oven until it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.9 degrees Celsius). Then you can transfer the food to a pre-heated slow cooker to keep it hot for serving.Before serving, make sure the food’s internal temperature is at least 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).

Assemble the parts of the steamer.,
Fill the reservoir with water.,
Fill the basket(s) with fresh vegetables.,
Turn on your steamer and set the timer.",How to Use a Vegetable Steamer1," Before using an electric steamer, it's important that you read the instructions that came with your steamer. Taking proper safety precautions can help prevent injuries and fires/burns.Never submerge the cord, plug, or base unit in water.
Only use electric steamers indoors and on a stable surface, like a kitchen counter.
Only use the steamer while water is in the reservoir. Running a steamer dry may overheat the steamer, which can damage the equipment and may cause a fire.
Use caution when opening the steamer. There will be hot condensation on the inside of the lid, and opening it too quickly could result in accidental scalding.
Unplug the steamer when you're not using it.
Let the steamer cool off before adding, removing, or cleaning any part of it, and make sure it's turned off and unplugged before attempting to do so.;
, Before you can steam vegetables in your electric steamer, you'll need to assemble all the pieces.Different steamers may be slightly different, but in general, you should have the following basic components:


the base unit (which should contain the water reservoir)
a diffuser plate
one to three baskets, which you'll arrange your vegetables on when ready
a lid with vents and a handle

, Once the rest of the steamer is assembled, you're ready to add fresh, cool water to the reservoir. Your steamer may come with specific instructions on how much water to use, and you should follow those instructions. If your steamer does not have instructions, you can simply fill the reservoir up to the maximum fill line (but never exceed that line).Once you've added water to the reservoir, make sure the diffuser tray (if your steamer included one) is properly in place.

, Make sure your vegetables are uniformly cut into equal-sized pieces. Arrange them loosely in the baskets so that the steam can travel between and around each piece of vegetable. Try to limit your basket(s) to a single layer of vegetables. When your veggies are in the basket(s), cover up your steamer with the lid.







, Once everything is ready, plug in your steamer. Then set the timer (depending on your steamer, as well as the type and quantity of vegetables you're steaming) and press the ""cook"" button or its equivalent. Follow the instructions that came with your steamer for proper cook times and preparation tips. When the timer goes off, you'll have freshly-steamed vegetables that are ready to be served."

If you choose to make your pancake batter from a box instead, use less water and/or milk than required. This will give you a thicker batter that is easier to work with., Beat together the yolks, sugar, and salt first until everything is smooth and consistent and not streaks remain. Stir in the baking powder until just combined., Keep whisking until the batter is smooth. It will be a little lumpy, which is fine. Don't try to beat these out or you will over-mix the batter. This could lead to tough and chewy pancakes., Use a rubber spatula to scrape the beaten egg whites into the bowl. Gently fold them in, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Keep folding until the color is consistent and no streaks remain., During this time, you can start preparing the bacon. By the time the bacon is ready and cooled, the batter should be ready too., Wipe the excess grease from the pan when you are done. This way, you won't have to re-grease the pan for the pancakes.If you don't have a griddle, you can use a skillet instead. Keep in mind that you will have to make the pancakes in smaller batches later on., This will help soak up the excess grease and make the bacon even crispier.Once the extra grease has been soaked up, you are ready to continue., Leave about 2 inches (5 centimeters) of space between the each slice of bacon.If you turned the heat off on the griddle, turn it back to medium-high., Use a soup or sauce ladle to scoop up the batter and pour it over the bacon strips. The batter will ooze over the sizes of the bacon and give you rectangular pancakes., After 1 to 2 minutes, check the underside of the pancake.

Place vegetables in the slow cooker first.,
Turn the slow cooker on and place the lid on top.,
Use a thermometer to check your food’s temperature.,
Place it on the warm setting.",How to Use a Slow Cooker Safely2," Also make sure it is 6 inches away from other kitchen appliances such as microwaves, toaster ovens, and coffee machines. This way, the cooker’s heat will be able to dissipate., This way you can avoid cross contamination. Also, store your meat and vegetables separately in the refrigerator if you decide to prep them ahead of time, like the night before.You may need to chop large cuts of meat into smaller pieces before placing them in the cooker. Make sure to consult your instruction manual.

, You want to do this because vegetables cook slower than meat. Then place your meat on top of the vegetables and pour broth or water over the ingredients per the instructions.Make sure your cooker is halfway to three-quarters full before cooking. However, do not overfill your cooker with food.

, Depending on how fast you want it to cook, place the cooker on the low or high setting. The low setting will cook your food in about 8 to 10 hours, while the high setting will cook it in about 4 to 6 hours.If possible, cook your food on the high setting for the first hour then switch it to the low setting if you are using the low setting to cook your food. However, it is ok if this is not possible.
If you are going to work, it is better to cook your food on a low setting for a longer amount of time than on a high setting for a shorter amount of time that uses a timer to turn it off automatically once it is done cooking., Do this once your food is done cooking. This way you can ensure that your food is cooked through.Beef, steak, lamb, veal, roasts and seafood need to have an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (62.8 degrees Celsius), however 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71.1 degrees Celsius) is ideal.
Poultry, stuffing, casseroles, stews, soups, and sauces need to have an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.9 degrees Celsius) to be safe for consumption.

, Do this once you have determined that your food is cooked through. After you are done eating, turn off the cooker and unplug it from the wall. Then transfer the leftovers to tupperware and store them in the fridge.Make sure to store your food within two hours after turning off the cooker.

Fill a pot with water.,
Bring the water to a boil.,
Place your vegetables in the basket and cover the pot.,
Check on your vegetables as they cook.,
Turn off the stove and serve your vegetables.",How to Use a Vegetable Steamer2," The first thing you'll need to do is fill up a pot with clean water. As the water boils, the steam will rise through the stovetop basket and steam your vegetables. How much water you use will vary, depending on how many vegetables you're cooking and how soft you want them.


For a smaller batch or firmer veggies, fill the pot with about a half inch to an inch (approximately 1.25 centimeters) of water.For a larger batch of vegetables or for softer veggies, fill the pot about halfway full.Make sure the bottom of your strainer is not touching the water. Otherwise, your veggies might simply boil in the water.

, It's generally recommended that you wait until the water has already started boiling before you add the vegetables.However, some people recommend putting the vegetables in before the water starts to boil.This is largely a matter of preference. Adding the vegetables too soon will not ruin the meal, but it won't accomplish much, as the water will not be producing much steam yet.









Once the water has come to a boil, lower the heat so that the water simmers and lightly bubbles.
You don't want a full bubbling boil, or you may steam off most of your water before the veggies have cooked.

, If you haven't already placed your vegetables in the basket before the water started to boil, you should do so once it's boiling. The timing is largely a matter of preference, and it's best to go with what you feel works well for your cooking methods.









Try to limit the number of vegetables you put in the basket. A single layer is ideal, as anything on top won't receive as much steam and may not cook uniformly.Once the vegetables are in and the water is at a gentle boil, you'll need to cover up the pot with a loose-fitting lid. This is to keep the bulk of the steam inside so that your vegetables cook properly.

, The steam time for vegetables will vary considerably, depending on how thick they are and how large or small you cut them. As a general rule, though, most vegetables will be steamed in approximately 3 to 10 minutes.Most veggies will have a brighter, more vivid coloration after steaming, which lets you know that they're ready.








Asparagus spears that are thin should steam in about four minutes. Thicker spears may take around five to six minutes.
Broccoli will steam in about five minutes. You should be able to visually tell when broccoli is ready, as it will get darker in color.
Brussels sprouts will take about 10 minutes to steam.
Carrots sliced 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick will steam in approximately six to eight minutes.
Cauliflower florets will steam in about six minutes.
Green beans will be steamed in approximately five minutes.
Peas steam rather quickly. They generally only need about three minutes on the stovetop.
Zucchini slices should steam in about six or seven minutes, depending on how thinly they're sliced.

, Once the vegetables look their brightest and most vivid, they're ready to eat. Turn off the stovetop, remove the basket of freshly-steamed veggies, and serve them while they're warm.

Arrange your vegetables in a microwave-safe bowl.,
Add a little fresh water.,
Cover the bowl.,
Cook your vegetables in the microwave.,
Drain any excess water and serve the veggies warm.",How to Use a Vegetable Steamer3," If you're steaming vegetables in the microwave, you won't need a steaming basket or any special equipment. All you'll need is a microwave-safe bowl, a microwave-safe cover, and some water.However, if you have a special microwave-safe steamer, you can use this the exact same way.









Steaming vegetables in the microwave is fast and easy.
Be aware, though, that cooking vegetables in the microwave may alter their flavor.Cooking in the microwave can also reduce the nutritional value of your vegetables., Steaming, even in the microwave, will require fresh water. However, you won't need very much. Start with about two to three tablespoons of water and see if you need more or less for that dish., You'll want to make sure that whatever you cover the bowl with is also safe to use in the microwave. Some people prefer using a microwave-safe plastic wrap.You can also lay a dish flat on top of the bowl, if the dish is also microwave safe.









Whatever microwave-safe cover you use, make sure one corner of the bowl is left slightly open/uncovered. This will help vent some of the steam so that your veggies do not overcook.
If using a plate that is too big to partially uncover, try laying a microwave-safe object (like a wooden chop stick) across the top of the bowl. This can help raise one small portion of the covering plate so everything steams properly.

, The cook time will vary in the microwave, depending on which vegetables you're steaming and how thick and








Asparagus spears will steam in about four to six minutes, depending on their thickness.
Broccoli will steam in about three to five minutes.
Brussels sprouts should steam in about seven minutes.
Carrots sliced approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick will take about five minutes.
Cauliflower will steam in about three to four minutes.
Green beans take about three to four minutes to steam.
Peas only take about one to two minutes to steam.
Zucchini takes six to eight minutes to steam.

, Once your vegetables are steamed, they're ready to serve. If there is any excess water remaining in the bottom of the bowl, carefully drain it out over the sink. You may want to remove the vegetables with a fork before draining the water so that you don't burn yourself or spill veggies into the sink. Serve the vegetables while they're still warm.

Buy a kitchen torch.,
Take safety precautions.,
Place your food items on the sturdy metal tray.,
Light the torch and wait for a blue flame.,
Make sure you have a clean nozzle.,
Aim the torch away from your body.,
Use a slow, sweeping motion.,
Turn off the gas.,
Torch meat and fish prior to baking.,
Make grill marks.,
Caramelize sugar on fruits and desserts.,
Roast some peppers.",How to Use a Kitchen Torch," Look for a kitchen torch that has a fuel gauge, so that you can keep on eye on how much fuel is left in your torch. It is also wise to pick one that has hands-free operation, which will allow you to operate the torch without constantly holding down the ‘on’ button.You can purchase a kitchen torch at specialty kitchen stores or online. Kitchen torches cost between $30 and $60.
You can get kitchen torches that use gas, butane or other fuels. If you purchase a torch online, make sure you know where to purchase the fuel in your neighborhood so that you can easily get refills.Typically, the fuel canisters will screw onto the back of a kitchen torch.;
, Turn on the fan in your kitchen. Make sure you know where the fire extinguisher is located in your kitchen. Clear a surface for torching by removing any flammables such as kitchen towels and plastic items. Place a sturdy metal tray or cast iron grill on your kitchen counter or stovetop to prepare for torching. Finally, you should wear a kitchen apron and make sure your clothing does not get in the way of the flame.Keep in mind that a kitchen torch can melt common metals such as aluminum and copper.For instance, acrylic clothing and fleece jackets tend to be quite flammable.

, Prior to turning on your torch, you should have your food items prepared. Place the food items on a sturdy metal tray, such as a steel cooking tray or a cast iron grill. Make sure there are no plastic or other flammable items in the vicinity of your work area., You need to light the torch prior to exposing it to food. Once it is lit, you will need to wait a few seconds for the yellow or orange flame to go away. Once you see a small, hissing, blue flame, you are ready to torch.If you torch your food prior to seeing the small, blue flame, you may get torch taste. Torch taste is caused by fuel contaminating your food., If you or others use the blow torch a lot, the nozzle will get dirty. If there are food items covering the nozzle, it could lead to poor aim. You could also end up with poor flavor, since you may end up getting bits of old food on the dish you are cooking.If the nozzle is dirty, you can clean it with a rag or dish cloth.

, The torch should be pointing away from your body, including your other hand. It is not uncommon to get second and third degree burns from a kitchen torch. In addition, you should make sure that you are wearing appropriate clothing and that it is not in the way of the flame, in order to avoid lighting yourself on fire., To properly torch your food item, you should slowly move the torch back and forth across the area that you want to grill or char. If you just point the torch at one spot, you are likely to burn your food item., When you finish torching, you should turn off the hands-free operation and then turn off the gas on your torch. Once the gas is turned off, you can go ahead and store your torch.If you are not using the hands-free version, you should release the 'on' button and then turn off the torch.

, If you are baking a meat or fish dish, you can try torching it prior to putting it in the oven. Lightly torch the surface to give it a bit of a crisp outside. Then, put it in the oven following your normal recipe.If you are grilling the meat, you probably won’t need to use the torch since you will get the smoky and crispy effects from the grill.

, If you are nostalgic for summertime but stuck indoors, you could simulate the look of the barbeque with your torch. After cooking steaks, burgers or veggies on the stovetop, use your blowtorch to make grill lines. Simply move the torch back and forth over the same area to make a line, and then repeat the process to create a series of grill lines on the meat., Caramelizing your desserts with a torch will give them an extra depth of unexpected flavor that your guests will adore. If you are making a pie, for instance, use your torch to caramelize the sugar on top. When the pie is out of the oven, gently burn the sugar on top until it looks brown and crunchy. Similarly, you can caramelize sugar on top of fruits like grapefruit or peaches., If you are making an Italian or Spanish dish that requires grilled peppers, avoid the old, canned peppers in the grocery store. Instead, purchase fresh peppers and then grill them yourself with your kitchen torch. You could throw them on tacos, fajitas or in pasta sauce to add a depth of smoky flavor."

Take apart and clean your oil mister.,
Fill the base of your mister with oil.,
Reassemble your mister.,
Prime the mister for spraying.,
Press the applicator to spray the oil.",How to Use an Oil Mister1," Bacteria, dust, or other undesirable elements may have contaminated your mister in the factory, during packaging, or in transit. You should always follow the care instructions for best results, but in most cases you can clean your mister by screwing off its top, removing its inner pump mechanism, and then:


Using warm, soapy water to clean all parts of the mister, inside and out. This includes the top and pump mechanism.
Allowing the mister to air dry completely before moving on, or pat your mister dry with clean paper towel or a dishcloth to speed the drying process.;
, You can use most oils, like olive oil, grapeseed oil, and similar oils, in your oil mister. Oils that have floating ingredients should be avoided, as these could cause the sprayer of your mister to clog.


Additionally, you may want to avoid coconut oil. This oil tends to solidify over time, and could contribute to clogs., Now that oil is in your clean mister, you can reassemble all the parts. In most cases, this will involve inserting a pump mechanism that is usually plastic into the oil and screwing a top in place.


Make sure that all parts of your mister fit together securely and snugly. Gaps can cause air pressure to leak out, in which case your mister won't work., In some cases, a primer lever may be located on the screw on cap, but in most cases, you'll use a special priming cap to build up air pressure so your mister can spray. Use the primer lever or priming cap to pump up and down until it becomes difficult to pump.


Most oil misters only require 7 to 10 pumps before they are ready to spray. However, the kind of oil you are using can influence the number of pumps necessary., Remove the priming cap, if necessary. Then hold your mister so the nozzle is pointed in the direction you wish to spray oil. Press and hold the top button on your mister firmly to apply the spray.


Depending on your model, when you finish spraying, you may need to press a button or turn the cap to a special position to relieve the remaining air pressure in your mister."

Choose your oil for hydrating.,
Fill and prime your oil mister.,
Mist your hair with olive oil.,
Distribute the oil through your hair evenly and enjoy.",How to Use an Oil Mister2," You can put natural oils, like olive oil, jojoba oil, and coconut oil directly onto your hair. Store bought commercial hair oils generally have an oily consistency and may contain natural oils, but usually include other additives, some of which you may want to avoid. Commercial hair oils may also have special application procedures, so you should always read the label before buying one.


Natural oils, like olive oil, have the added benefit of being a readily available kitchen ingredient.
Store bought hair oils often target certain negative features, like excessive curliness, frizziness, and dullness., Depending on your oil mister, this process may vary slightly. In most cases, you'll have to remove a top and take out the pump mechanism of the mister. Then, add your oil to the mister and put it back together. After that:


Use the priming cap or a primer lever to pump up your oil mister and pressurize it. In most cases, this takes 7 to 10 pumps., Remove the priming cap, if necessary, then hold the mister in your hand. Spray a fine mist of oil onto your hair by pressing and holding the top button. This should emit a steady mist for as long as you hold the button, so long as pressure remains.


Depending on your model of oil mister, you may have to re-prime it one or two times while misting your hair.
Use your free hand to lift your hair in layers as you mist so the upper and lower layers of your hair receive oil.
You may want to wear an old shirt or drape a towel around your shoulders when applying oil to your hair to prevent oil stains from getting on your clothes., Even when using your hands to lift layers of your hair while applying the oil, it's likely that some spots received more oil than others. Comb your fingers through your hair after you mist to ensure all of your hair receives the benefits of the oil."

Verify that the top is secure.,
Check the nozzle when it sprays poorly.,
Clean your oil mister to remove clogs.,
Replace broken pump mechanisms.",How to Use an Oil Mister3," A loose top will allow all the pressure you build up pumping your mister to escape. Without pressure, your mister cannot spray. When your mister isn't misting, first check to see the top is firmly and snugly attached.


In some cases, a rubber o-ring on the underside of your top or at the top of the mister's base may have become twisted, forming an imperfect seal. Use your fingers to smooth all seals to the top of the mister., In some cases, your nozzle may have been knocked askew. This can cause the line from the mister base to the nozzle to be obstructed. Use your fingers to gently check the nozzle, and:


If the nozzle is simply out of place, use your fingers to adjust the nozzle until it returns to its proper position.
If the nozzle appears bent or similarly out of place, apply firm, moderate pressure to realign the nozzle.
If the nozzle cannot be returned to its proper position, the damage to your mister may be irreparable.

, Depending on your brand of oil mister, the proper cleaning procedure may vary. Generally, to clean your oil mister, fill its base with warm, soapy water, then reassemble the mister. Allow it to sit for 20 minutes or so, then:


Take apart the mister, dump out the soapy water, and rinse the mister thoroughly with warm water.
Refill the base of the mister with warm water. Prime your mister to spray, then spray the mister as you would normally.
Continue priming and spraying water through your mister until the water is emitted in a fine mist., Over time, the pump mechanism of your mister may wear down and pump less efficiently or not at all. In these cases, you'll either have to replace the pump or buy a new mister.


For some models of mister, you may be able to buy replacement parts on its company's product webpage.

, The fun part, right? If it doesn't lift up easily, it's not ready. And don't worry -- the bananas, if anything, make flipping it easier. Lift up a bit of the edge and check to see if it's the right shade of brown.

Drizzle with honey or syrup.",How to Make Pikelets," Making pikelets is similar to making pancakes and other griddlecakes. Along with your ingredients and toppings of choice, you'll also need:


One medium and one small bowl
Sifter
Whisk
Griddle or non-stick frying pan
Tablespoon
Spatula;
, Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Pour in the sugar, and whisk all the ingredients together to remove lumps and combine everything.If you don’t have a sifter, simply combine all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk them together.

, Crack the egg into the small bowl and beat it for a minute with the whisk. Pour in the milk and whisk the two ingredients together for a minute until they're fully combined.It’s important to crack the egg first into an empty bowl, because that way you can easily remove any shell pieces that fall in.

, Use your hand or a spoon to make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the egg and milk mixture into the well. Whisk all the ingredients together until they're just combined and form a smooth, thick batter.Don’t overmix the batter, as this will develop the gluten in the flour. This will result in dense pikelets.
Making a well in the center of the flour mixture will help you incorporate all the ingredients faster without having to overmix.

, Pikelet batter should be thick, but not so thick that it won’t drop off the end of a spoon. If the batter isn't runny enough to do that, add milk in tablespoonfuls (15-ml increments) until you achieve the right consistency., Place your griddle or frying pan over medium heat and allow it to warm up. If you're not using a non-stick pan, add a tablespoon (15 ml) of cooking oil to the pan as well.When the oil is warm, pick up the pan and swirl the oil around to coat the pan.
You can use butter to cook the pikelets, but butter has a much lower smoke point than oil, and even medium heat will be enough to burn it.

, Pikelets are traditionally quite small, and each one only requires a tablespoon (15 ml) of batter. Drop one tablespoonful of batter into the hot pan for each pikelet, leaving room between them for expansion.


Cook the pikelets for about a minute, until bubbles begin to form and pop in the surface of the batter. When that happens, flip them over and cook for another minute or so, until both sides are golden brown., Remove the cooked pikelets from the pan and transfer them to a plate. Cover them with a clean tea towel so they stay warm while you cook the remaining batches.Continue cooking the pikelets until all the batter is gone.

, Like pancakes and crumpets, pikelets can be eaten plain, or topped with a variety of ingredients. Butter is a classic topping for pikelets, and you can combine it with other toppings as well.


When the pikelets are still warm, spread a thin layer of butter over each one.
You can also stack a few pikelets on top of each other, and then place a dollop of butter on top of the stack.

, There are many ways that you can use fruit to garnish pikelets. You can serve them with fresh fruit cut into bite-sized pieces, you can top them with jam, or you can make your own fruit puree and drizzle that on top.


Great fruit to pair with pikelets includes strawberries, blueberries, and bananas.
Crumpets are traditionally served with salted butter and jam, and you can serve pikelets the same way., Butter isn't the only option for spreading on pikelets, and there are many dairy products you can use to garnish these little griddlecakes, including:


Heavy cream
Ricotta cheeseDevonshire cream
Whipped cream or whipping cream

, For people who prefer their pikelets a little lighter, you can also serve them with sweet syrups, such as honey, corn syrup, maple syrup, birch syrup, or chocolate sauce.Make a stack of two or three pikelets on a plate. Top with a bit of butter, and then drizzle the entire stack with the syrup or sauce of your choice.

, A thin coat should suffice, but use more if you like. You may also consider using margarine, olive/vegetable oil, or a non-stick cooking spray.

, The size of the pancake depends on the size of your plate, but be aware that larger pancakes will take longer to cook.

, Adjust the time if you know that your microwave is particularly weak or strong. If the pancake is still runny, heat it for another ten seconds, but don't go overboard. There's no grill involved, so your pancake won't brown. If you do overcook your pancake, it will become dry, not burned.

, Place the cooked pancake onto a clean plate. If the cooking plate is still well-greased with butter, then pour another dollop of pancake batter onto the first plate. If not, then spread more butter as needed to ensure that the next pancake doesn't stick. Cook the second pancake for one minute or until it is no longer runny. Repeat until you have as many pancakes as you want.

, Pour water into the mug (about half a mug's worth) until the mixture becomes a paste of medium thickness. Mix with a teaspoon until the consistency is smooth. You can add more water if the mixture is too thick, and more flour/pancake mix if the mixture is too thin.

, The pancake is fully cooked when there is no runny mixture left in the mug. If the mix is still runny, then microwave the mug for 30 seconds longer.

, Most fluids of a watery consistency, such as water, fruit juice, cream, and yes, even milk (including non-dairy milk), etc., will work equally well to combine with these ingredients, to make the pancakes. However, there are a few caveats depending on whether you're making pancakes, crepes or waffles:


Since crepes, pancakes, waffles, and an even a thicker batter for coating thin precooked meat pieces (ham, sausage, salami, etc.), will each require different amounts of fluid, giving a specific measurement is not possible. If you've never made pancakes, start by making the batter as if you were making a very thick gravy. Test to see if it's of the consistency that you want, then add dry mixture or fluid to adjust it to be thicker or thinner. Be prepared to experiment a little.
For example: For a single deep Belgian waffle, you'd start with about 1/2 cup of fluid and add 3 to 4 level tablespoons of the dry mix while mixing and add dry mix or fluid until it gets to the thickness you want.

, The batter is ready when it is suitably pourable. As already noted, you'll be wanting a thick, pourable batter for waffles, with it being a little thinner for pancakes, and very thin for crepes.


Cobbler recipes can use this batter. If you mix fresh fruit, sugar, and a thickener (your own recipe) for a fruit cobbler you can use this recipe for the topping. Just use less fluid to make a very thick paste that you can spread with a wet spoon or spatula. I like to add about twice the sugar to sweeten the final topping.
If you want to flavor the pancakes, see Tips below for ideas.

, Tip the pan to help the batter spread evenly, if needed.

Melt the butter by microwaving it in a microwave safe container for thirty seconds.
You can use fresh or frozen blueberries. Thaw the frozen blueberries by letting them sit in the refrigerator for a few hours.;
, First, mix the salt, baking powder, and flour into a large bowl. If you’re worried about the mixture clumping, use a sifter to mix the dry ingredients.Hold the sifter over the bowl. Pour in each dry ingredient, shaking the sifter back and forth to create a powder in the bowl.


If you have two bowls of different sizes, use the larger bowl to mix the dry ingredients.

, In a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. You can use a whisk or an electric beater. Beat the mixture until the eggs are completely combined.


The melted butter should be hot, but not so hot that you can’t touch it. Otherwise, it will cook the eggs as you mix them.

, There shouldn’t be any flour on sides of the bowl or lumps in the batter.After you’re done mixing the batter, you can either fold in the blueberries or wait to add them until you cook the pancake.


If you fold in the blueberries, the blueberries will be unevenly distributed. Many cooks prefer to add the blueberries later to control the blueberry-to-pancake ratio.

, Cover the batter with plastic and leave it on your counter. If possible, let it rest for one hour.This will aerate the batter and create fluffy, tall pancakes. However, the pancakes will still be delicious if you decide to start cooking immediately.

, You can use a frying pan or a large griddle to cook pancakes. Grease the pan with a pastry brush dipped in melted butter. Alternatively, use cooking spray to grease the pan.If you’re using a non-stick pan, use a small amount of butter to grease the pan instead of cooking spray., Use a quarter-cup measure to scoop batter onto the pan.This will make medium-sized pancakes. The larger your pan, the more pancakes you’ll be able to cook at once.


Don’t crowd the pancakes. If you place them too closely together, they will melt into one giant pancake.

, Distribute the blueberries evenly throughout the pancake and press them gently into the batter.

, Look for cooked, dry edges and small popped bubbles in the surface of the pancake batter. You can also gently lift the edge of the pancake with a spatula to see if the bottom is golden-brown. These are signs that your pancake is ready to flip.Slide a spatula underneath the pancake and carefully flip it over to cook the other side.


The cooked side of the pancake should be a light golden color. If it’s too dark, reduce the heat on the pan or cook the pancakes for less time.
If the pan is giving off smoke but the pancake is still doughy and hard to flip, you need to reduce the heat.

, Line a large plate with paper towels. Once the other side of the pancake has cooked for a few minutes, use a spatula to transfer it to the plate. Make sure the blueberry side of the pancake is facing upwards and the non-blueberry side is against the paper towel.

, Blueberry pancakes can be topped with a variety of delicious spreads. The most popular serving method involves slathering butter on the hot pancakes and pouring over thick maple syrup. Some other popular toppings include:



whipped creamlemon curdfresh blueberries
powdered sugar
pancake syrup
blueberry syrup

, Place a tray of pancakes in the middle of your table. Next, arrange serving dishes with the different topping options and a small spoon. If you have other breakfast dishes such as eggs or bacon, place these on the table as well. Your diners can serve themselves pancakes and top them with whatever they’d like.


If you don’t have room on your table, place the serving dishes on your counter. Your guests can serve themselves in line and sit at the table to eat.

, This option is good for a fancy brunch. Place two or three pancakes on each plate. Next, place a square of butter at the center of each stack. Add your other toppings to the pancakes as the butter melts.


Add powdered sugar after you’ve poured on the syrup. Otherwise, the syrup will absorb the powdered sugar.

Finished.

",How to Use a Dutch Oven," You can cook bread, pizzas, cakes, and other desserts in your Dutch oven by placing hot coals on top of the lid and underneath the Dutch oven full of food. To bake, you should place more coals on top of the lid than underneath the Dutch oven. This will prevent food on the bottom from burning.Consider your Dutch oven's diameter. To figure how many charcoal briquette coals to put on top, add 3 to the diameter. To determine the bottom number, subtract 3. For example, if you have a 12 inch Dutch oven, you'd need 15 coals on top and 9 on the bottom.;
, Since you're trying to heat water or a liquid like stew, you should place all of the hot coals underneath your Dutch oven. This will quickly concentrate the heat near the bottom of the pot. You should also place all the coals underneath the Dutch oven if you'd like to use it for frying food.While you can use the lid when bringing your food or water to a boil, you shouldn't put coals on top of the lid. Having hot coals on the lid of a Dutch oven full of boiling liquid could be dangerous and difficult to remove.

, If you want to quickly fry up breakfast, turn the lid upside down and place it directly on hot coals. Watch the food to make sure it cooks completely and doesn't burn. You might want to use this method for frying bacon, eggs, pancakes, or sausages.Most Dutch oven lids are slightly shallow with a dip in the middle so they can hold runny ingredients.

, Dig a hole about 3 feet deep and line it with rocks. You should be able to build a fire in the in it. The heat from the wood fire should heat the stones so that you can lower your Dutch oven into the hole and cook the food. Cover the lid of the Dutch oven with coals and shovel dirt over the hole. This will trap the heat. You'll need to leave the Dutch oven to cook, usually overnight.Keep in mind that it will take several hours to get the rocks in the hole hot enough before your can lower the bean pot down.
It's a good idea to par boil your dry beans for an hour and then soak them in water overnight before you even begin using the bean hole to cook them.

, If you need to cook a large meal for a crowd or just want some variety in the meal you're cooking outside, stack several ovens. You'll need at least three Dutch ovens. Fill your Dutch ovens with food and place hot coals underneath the largest one. Place hot coals on its lid and then stack another Dutch oven directly on top. Place coals over this oven's lid and stack another Dutch oven. Finish by placing coals on the topmost Dutch oven's lid and let the food cook.You can use Dutch ovens of the same size or you can tier them. For example, use a 14 inch Dutch oven on the bottom, a 12 inch in the middle, and a 10 inch on top.

, Since Dutch ovens maintain heat well, they're good for roasting large cuts of meat. Heat your conventional oven to 350 F (176 C). Heat your Dutch oven on the stove top and brown your meat to get a richer flavor. Add liquid and any vegetables you like to your Dutch oven. Cover it and place it in your preheated conventional oven. Bake your roast for an hour or two (longer if there's a bone in it).Only use a lid if it's made to withstand oven temperatures. Most Dutch oven lids should work, but avoid putting a lid in the oven if yours has any plastic parts. Just cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil instead.
You can also use Dutch ovens in your oven when baking things like cornbread, cakes, or casseroles.

, If you want to make something that takes a long time to simmer, consider using your Dutch oven. Just set your Dutch oven on your burners and cook your food directly in it. Turn the heat to a little lower than you're used to when using other pots and let your food simmer for several hours. For example, you might make a stew with dumplings or chili.


When using a cast iron Dutch oven, you don't need to cook with such high temperatures because the cast iron maintains heat so well. Try cooking on medium heat., To tell what you kind of Dutch oven you have, look inside your Dutch oven. If it's bare cast iron, it will appear black or gray and be slightly bumpy. If your Dutch oven is enameled, it will look white inside and be smooth. It may have black matte enamel which will also be smoother than an unprotected cast iron Dutch oven.Bare cast iron Dutch ovens aren't coated with any protective enamel, so they need to be seasoned before using.
If your Dutch oven has a protective coating, a porcelain has been bonded to the cast iron surface.

, You won't need to season your enameled Dutch oven, but you will need to wash it after each use. To clean, wash the Dutch oven with soapy water so that food is completely removed. Avoid using metal pads like steel wool to clean since these can damage the enamel finish. Never wash your enameled Dutch oven in the dishwasher.If the white enamel becomes stained, make a paste of baking soda and water. Rub this into the stains and rinse it off.

, If your Dutch oven doesn't have a protective enamel, you'll need to season it like you would any other piece of cast iron cookware before you use it for the first time. Wash and completely dry the Dutch oven while you preheat an oven to 325 F (162 C). Dip a cloth or paper towel in vegetable oil or melted shortening and apply a thin layer to the entire Dutch oven. Turn the Dutch oven upside down and bake it in your oven for 1 hour. Turn off the heat and let it cool completely before handling it.You may want to lay a piece of aluminum foil in the bottom of your oven so that when you're baking the oiled Dutch oven, the foil will catch any drips that fall.

, Once you've been cooking with your Dutch oven, you'll need to clean it after each use. Avoid using soap to wash the Dutch oven. Instead, use hot water and a scrub brush to clean away the food remnants. Completely dry the Dutch oven with a clean towel and pour about a teaspoon of oil into it. Use a cloth or paper towel to wipe the oil over the entire Dutch oven.You can use any oil you like. Or, if you want, you can melt vegetable shortening to use.

, If you've neglected to properly clean and season your cast iron Dutch oven, you'll need to scrub it with soapy water using steel wool or a scrub pad to remove food debris and rust. Rinse the Dutch oven and place it in an oven that's heated to 300 F (148 C) for 10 minutes so that it completely dries. Drizzle oil and a handful of kosher salt in the bottom of the cooled Dutch oven. Rub the mixture with a cloth to completely remove the rust. Rinse the Dutch oven and dry it in the oven again. Season it like you did before you first used the Dutch oven.You may need to repeat the scouring, rinsing, and drying steps. Keep repeating the process until your Dutch oven is completely clean.
If your Dutch oven turns brown or rusty over time, you probably need to reseason it. Scrub it clean and season it again.

The two long arms that clamp onto the side of the can are the levers. The handle that is used to turn the can is comprised of an axle and a wheel. Lastly, the circular wheel that cuts into a can is called a wedge.The tin can was invented in the early 1800s by an Englishman. It required some skill to open it, and people usually used rocks, chisels or knives to work their way into it. Finally, the can opener was invented in 1858, and the task became a lot easier.;
, Place the metal tooth (the wedge) on the lip of the can. This will automatically align the wheel of the opener to where it needs to be. Firmly squeeze the arms together. With practice, you’ll be able to tell when it’s on right.


Until you get the hang of it, you may have to do it several times.

, Otherwise, it could fly off the can. It is a sharp object, so you want to be careful. This begins to rotate the wheel underneath that then cuts into the can.

, This action pierces the seal, cutting into the can as it moves around the edge of the lid. When it has gone all the way around, the lid will naturally disengage from the opener. Carefully dispose of the cut lid. Enjoy the contents of the container."

Polish the steel.",How to Repair Scratched Stainless Steel," The most important part of repairing stainless steel is rubbing in the same direction as the grain. Look very closely at the steel and determine which direction the surface seems to be running in. This is the grain.Working against the grain can actually make the scratches worse. That’s why it’s so important to know the direction of the grain before you begin.
The grain will generally run either from side to side (horizontally), or up and down (vertically).;
, There are a few compounds and cleaners that can be used to fill and smooth very light and minor scratches on the surface of stainless steel. Products you can try include:Bar Keeper's Friend
Perfect-It Rubbing Compound
Revere Stainless Steel and Copper Cleaner
Whitening toothpaste

, Some compounds and cleaners come in a powdered form, and these must be made into a paste before you can apply them to the steel. Mix a tablespoon (14 g) of powder with a few drops of water. Stir to combine, and add a few more drops of water until you have a smooth paste.


The consistency you're looking for is that of toothpaste., Pour a few drops of cleaner onto a clean microfiber cloth. For the paste, spoon about a quarter of the paste onto a cloth. Working in the same direction as the metal’s grain, rub the compound gently into the scratch. Because the compound isn't abrasive, you can rub back and forth over the scratch.


Continue rubbing, adding more compound as needed, until the scratch has been buffed away., Soak a clean microfiber cloth with water. Wring out all the excess so the cloth is barely damp. Wipe the surface of the steel with the cloth to remove excess compound and shine the surface., Wipe the surface with a dry microfiber cloth to remove any leftover dampness. Examine the surface of the stainless steel to assess whether the treatment was effective.


Repeat the buffing process again if the scratch improved but is still slightly visible.
If the scratch is still quite visible, you may have to take more drastic steps, such as sanding the entire surface.

, Slightly deeper scratches on the surface of stainless steel will require more work than light and fine scratches. You have three basic sanding products you can choose from, and they include:


Course (maroon) and fine (gray) scouring pads400- and 600-grit sandpaper
Scratch removal kit, Scratch removal kits come with a lubricant or polishing compound. Apply a few drops of this to the coarsest pad.For sandpaper, soak the 400-grit sandpaper in a bowl full of water for a few minutes. For scouring pads, use a spray bottle filled with water and apply a few spritzes of water to the surface of the pad.The liquid or compound acts as a lubricant, and helps the sanding product move over the surface of the metal.

, Following the grain of the metal, rub the sanding product over the surface of the stainless steel in a single direction. Apply gentle but even pressure to the sandpaper or scour pad. Use long, even strokes.It’s important to work in a single direction because rubbing back and forth over the surface can create small abrasions on the metal.
To ensure you're applying even pressure, wrap the pad or sandpaper around a wooden block before you begin.
To find the grain, look closely at the metal and see if the surface is running horizontally or vertically. This is the grain of the metal.

, Rub the entire surface of the stainless steel in this way. You can't just sand the scratched area, or the sanded section will look visibly different from the rest of the metal. The sanding process is actually re-surfacing the metal, so you have to sand it all.Continue sanding until the scratch has been sanded down and is mostly gone.
Depending on the size of the area you're sanding, this could take 15 minutes or more.

, When you finish sanding with the coarser pad, switch to the finer one. Apply polishing compound, soak the 600-grit sandpaper, or apply water to the gray scouring pad. Sand the entire surface using long, even strokes and gentle, even pressure.Continue sanding until the scratch has disappeared.

, With a clean microfiber cloth, wipe down the surface that you just sanded. This will remove sanding and metal dust, as well as leftover polishing compound or water.Even when you're cleaning, it’s important to rub and buff in the direction of the grain. Look closely at the metal to determine what direction the surfaces runs in, and make sure you rub and clean in that same direction.

, Transfer some vinegar to a spray bottle. Spray the surface of the metal with several sprays of vinegar. Use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe the metal.


The vinegar will clean the surface of the metal and remove all traces of other compounds and cleaners.
Do not use bleach, oven cleaner, abrasive cleaners, or abrasive pads when cleaning stainless steel., When the stainless steel is clean and dry, apply a few drops of oil to a clean microfiber cloth. You can use mineral oil, vegetable oil, or even olive oil. Rub the cloth against the steel, in the direction of the grain, to polish the metal.Add more oil as necessary. Continue rubbing until the entire surface has been polished.

Assess your needs.,
Determine whether or not you want nonstick pots and pans.,
Select your cookware.,
Select your utensils.,
Select your knife.,
Buy a tool for sharpening your knives.,
Select a cutting board.,
Avoid equipment that only performs 1 task.,
Add to this set of equipment according to your needs.",How to Select a Basic Set of Kitchen Equipment," Ask yourself what kind of food you cook (or what kind of food you'd like to cook, if you're new to the kitchen) and what tools you use most often. A good set of basic equipment might start with a 10-inch (25 cm) sauté pan, a 4-quart (3.8 liters) saucepan, and a baking or roasting pan.;
, Nonstick coating, such as Teflon, keeps food from sticking to the pans as you cook. This allows you to use less fat to grease the pan, and also makes cleanup easier. However, non-stick surfaces aren't particularly oven-safe (as they can burn and emit harmful fumes), and they make it harder to prepare certain types of sauces which call for deglazing.

, Look for pots and pans that are thick and heavy; the thicker the pan, the more evenly it will conduct heat. It will also retain heat better when cold foods are placed into it. Aluminum, stainless steel and copper are all good material choices. When selecting cookware, go for quality instead of quantity. Remember, if treated with care, good cookware will last you a lifetime.

, A basic set should include wooden spoons, a set of tongs and a spatula. Only add other items (such as a whisk or ladle) as you begin working in the kitchen and recognize a need for those items.

, Don't make the common mistake of thinking you need a knife set that comes in its own block. You really only need 1 or 2 knives, and it is far better to spend your money buying a single quality knife than a whole set of lackluster ones. To start, buy a chef's knife and a serrated knife. The chef's knife is your all-purpose knife, and a serrated knife is excellent for cutting bread and soft fruits like tomatoes.

, A whetstone is a great option, as they are small and very gentle on your knives. Many larger knife sharpeners can actually damage your knives over time.

, You only need 1, and it should be made from wood or plastic. Do not buy a glass cutting board, as these will make your knives dull very quickly.

, You don't need a rice cooker, for example; rice can be cooked perfectly well in a saucepan. Also avoid small appliances (like blenders, toasters and food processors) unless you really need them; they tend to create kitchen clutter very quickly., As you start working in the kitchen with a basic set, buy additional equipment as your needs arise."

Give your bread time to cool.",How to Use a Bread Maker," These are the components that will be responsible for mixing, kneading, and baking your bread. Open the lid on the top of the machine. You’ll see a heat element in the bottom and a place where the bread pan sits inside the machine.


Insert the pan into place, and then place the paddles (sometimes called the blades) on top of the peg inside the pan.
To remove the pan from the machine again, use the handle and give it a gentle pull.
The paddle will knead the bread, and the metal pan is what the bread will bake in.;
, Bread machines have different capacities, and some can make small, medium, or large loaves of bread. It’s important to determine the capacity of yours, because you can’t overfill your bread maker.


Add one cup of water at a time to the bread pan, keeping track of how many cups you added. Add water until the pan is full.
For a machine that holds fewer than 10 cups, you can make one-pound loaves. For a machine that holds 10 cups, you can make 1.5-pound loaves. For 12 cups, your bread can be two pounds. More than 12 cups indicates a 2.5-pound loaf.A small to medium loaf of bread (one to 1.5 pounds) will have around two cups of flour, while a medium to large loaf (two to 2.5 pounds) will be around three cups., Dump or reuse the water from the bread pan. Replace the pan and paddles inside the bread machine. Close the lid, and plug in the machine. Most machines will come on automatically, but there may be an on/off switch.

, The Select button allows you to begin programing your bread maker according to your ingredients and preferences. The different settings you’ll be able to choose include:


Loaf size
Crust darkness
Flour type
Rapid cycle
Dough-only

, Some larger bread machines have a button that allows you to select the size of the loaf you’re making, and this will adjust the baking time of the machine accordingly.


Most bread machines will have a single Loaf button, and you can push this multiple times to change the setting.
As you change the setting, pay attention to how it alters the time on the display. , Bread machines have different settings for different flours, and this is because your loaf will take a longer or shorter time to bake depending on the type of flour, such as white versus whole wheat.Some flours have a longer kneading and rising time, while others can be put on a rapid cycle.
There are some bread maker models that don’t have flour types written right on the machine. Instead, you may have to select a menu number that corresponds with different flour types.

, Many bread makers allow you to control the crustiness or darkness of your crust, because it will add a longer or shorter baking time to your setting.


Like the Loaf control, your machine will likely have a single Crust button that you can push multiple times to change the setting.

, This setting is for when you just want the bread machine for mixing, kneading, and rising, but not baking. This comes in handy when you’re making non-loaf breads, such as:


Pizza dough
Rolls
Round loaves
Bagels or pretzels
Ciabatta
French bread

, The rapid cycle is a quicker version of the bread machine process for when you’re in a hurry, but keep in mind that even this will usually take at least one hour. You also likely won’t be able to choose custom settings like crust darkness when you select this option.


When you have the time, it’s recommended that you allow your machine to go through the full cycle, because this gives the yeast and ingredients the proper time to activate., The time or delay setting allows you to program your machine to start its cycle at a later time. For instance, you can put all your ingredients into the machine in the morning, set the delay for five hours, and then your bread will be ready when you get home after work.


To use the time delay, use the up and down arrows to add or subtract time from your programmed setting.
Once you select your flour type, bread size, and crust setting, your bread machine will give you a cycle time, such as three hours, for example. You can add five hours (so the time display will read eight hours), which means your bread maker won’t start the process until five hours have elapsed.
Never use the delay cycle for recipes that contain dairy or other ingredients that should always be refrigerated., You can play with the settings on your machine all you want, and the machine won’t start mixing, kneading, or baking until you actually hit Start. When you do hit Start, the machine will begin its cycle, or will begin counting down through the time delay.

, The bread machine manual should have all the information you need regarding the functions, how to solve different problems, and possibly even some tasty recipes. But if you have lost your manual, take a look online to see if you can find a digital version.


Websites like manuals online are a great resource for replacing lost appliance manuals.

, Insert the paddle, and gather all the ingredients you need for your bread.

, It is especially important to add ingredients in the proper order if you are using the time delay function. Your bread maker may be different, but most machines say to add the wet ingredients first, and this includes the water and oil.


In order to activate the yeast, make sure that any liquids you add to your bread are at least 80 F (27 C)., Add the sugar and salt first, followed by the flour. You want to make sure the salt and sugar are separated from the yeast, so you want to create a barrier with the flour.


To make an herb bread, you can also add seasonings in with the dry ingredients, such as thyme, oregano, sage, dill, or rosemary.

, Make a small well in the flour with a spoon or your finger, and pour the yeast into the well. The yeast always comes last because it needs to stay away the from salt, sugar, liquids, and the heat element until a certain time.Separating the yeast from the other ingredients is especially important when you are using the timer.

, Once all your ingredients are in, replace the bread pan into its position in the bread machine. Close the lid.

, Press Select. If you only want the machine to make dough, select the dough cycle. Or, you can select the rapid cycle. Otherwise, select your flour type, loaf size, and crust preferences. Press Timer, if necessary,and use the arrows to adjust the time if you want to use the delay function.


When you are finished, press Start. The machine will begin spinning the paddles to mix the ingredients and knead the bread. It will likely go through several periods of kneading and rest, and eventually it will stop to allow the bread to rise.

, Depending on the bread you’re making and the settings you’ve chosen, your machine may beep to indicate it will start the baking process soon, and this is your chance to lift the lid and add extra ingredients like nuts, seeds, fruit, or cheese.

, When the machine beeps to indicate that the dough is ready, unplug the machine, lift the lid, and remove the bread pan.


To bake your simple white bread in the oven, preheat your oven to 375 F (191 C). Grease a nine-inch by five-inch loaf pan and place the dough into it. Set it aside and give it some time to plump up again as the oven heats up.
Bake the loaf for 30 to 35 minutes, until golden brown., If you’ve opted to bake your bread in the bread machine, the last 30 to 45 minutes or so will be for the baking process.


The bread machine will likely beep several times to indicate that it has completely finished its cycle.

, Use an oven mitt to grab the handle, and gently pull the bread pan out. Tip the pan upside down, and use a plastic or rubber spatula to remove the bread from the pan.


If the paddles are stuck inside the bread, use the handle of a wooden spoon to help get them out., Transfer your freshly baked loaf to a wire cooling rack and let it cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving."

Finish casseroles in the broiler.",How to Use a Broiler," Older gas ovens have a drawer at the bottom of the oven that contains the broiling unit. This compartment is commonly called the “broiler drawer.” If your oven doesn’t have a broiler drawer, the broiler is inside the main oven compartment. In this case, the broiling unit in will be attached to the top of the oven interior.;
, Most recipes ask you to place the rack 3-4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) away from the broiler. To do so, move the oven rack to one of the top two rack positions. Use a ruler to measure the distance from the rack to the top of the oven. If you’re oven has a broiler drawer, you will not be able to adjust the shelf height.

, If you have a gas oven, the broil setting will be the last setting on the temperature dial. Depending on the model, an electric oven can have a “broil” button or a broil option on the temperature dial. To turn on the broiler, simply press the “broil” button or turn dial all the way to the word “broil.” Some newer electric ovens have several broiling settings. If the recipe doesn’t specify a temperature, use the highest setting., Close the broiler drawer or oven door. Let the oven preheat for at least five minutes before cooking any food.Some meat recipes will call for longer preheating times to help sear the surface of the meat.

, Avoid putting glass or Pyrex dishes under your broiler. These materials may crack or explode when exposed to the high temperatures in a broiler.Instead, use sturdy metal or cast iron pans.For example:


Cast iron pans are usually preheated with the broiler. These pans are great for searing meat.
Metal baking sheets can be lined with foil and used to broil toast or vegetables.
Slotted broiling pans have an extra tray underneath that circulates heat and catches draining fat. These trays can be used for any kind of food.

, This method only applies to gas ovens. Once the broiler is on, look inside the oven to find the flames. When you place food in the oven, try to center it directly underneath these flames.Electric ovens use heated coils instead of flames to broil food. These coils are usually evenly distributed along the top of the oven.

, Leaving the oven door or broiler drawer slightly open will allow air and heat to circulate evenly. However, not all oven units will operate with an open door. Check your oven’s manufacturer manual to find out.If you have small children in your home, leave the oven door or broiler drawer closed to avoid any accidents.

, Broilers use high temperatures to quickly sear food. Therefore, most recipes only ask you to broil food for 5-10 minutes. If you leave the food in too long, it could burn or even catch on fire.This is especially true for dry foods such as toast. If your food catches on fire:


Turn off the broiler.
Leave the oven door or drawer closed. If the door is open, close it. This will cut off the oxygen supply to the fire.
Let the fire burn out on its own. Open a window to ventilate any smoke.
Keep an eye on your oven. If the fire gets bigger or the flames start coming out of your oven, evacuate your home and call your local emergency hotline., First, place a cast iron skillet in the broiler. Preheat the oven and the skillet for 15-20 minutes. Next, place a seasoned steak in the hot cast-iron skillet. Broil the steak for three to five minutes per side. After the steak is cooked, let it rest for at least five minutes before serving it.Season the steak by brushing it with olive oil and sprinkling on a layer of salt and pepper.
Let the steak come to room temperature on your counter before cooking it., Cut a loaf of French bread into large pieces about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 centimeters) thick. Next, spread a liberal amount of seasoned butter onto each slice. Place the bread on a foil-wrapped baking sheet and broil it for 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on the bread to make sure it doesn’t burn. Create a savory seasoned butter by combining:


5 tablespoons of softened butter
2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil
3 cloves of crushed garlic
1 teaspoon of dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste, This method of cooking softens vegetables while giving them a smoky, charred flavor. First, toss thinly chopped vegetables in olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Next, place them on a foil lined baking sheet and broil them for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring them every five minutes.This method works for many vegetables, including:


Carrots
Bell peppers
Onions
Zucchini
Potatoes

, Use your broiler to add a golden baked finish to the top of your casseroles. First, cook your favorite casserole in the oven. Once it’s almost done cooking, place it under the broiler. Broil the casserole for three to five minutes before removing it to cool.Let the casserole cool for five to ten minutes before eating it.

Carefully pull or twist the stuck cooking bowls apart.You could use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other cooking oil to unstick the cooking bowls.

, If you don’t have any liquid cooking oil on hand, or if you’ve found that the oil is ineffective, you could use an oil-based spray. Just spray the point of contact between the two bowls with a light coating of cooking spray.Carefully pull or twist the cooking bowls apart.

, Whether you’ve used an oil spray or liquid cooking oil, sometimes the oil won’t be effective immediately. If, after pulling or twisting the bowls apart, they are still stuck, wait about 20-30 seconds. This will give the oil time to work its way between the two cooking bowls that are stuck together.If necessary, apply or spray another coat of cooking oil to loosen them.

Clear out the removable toaster tray and wash it with dish soap. Then turn the toaster upside down and gently tap out any remaining crumbs. Wipe the toaster and area around it. This can keep fires from igniting., Depending on what you put in your toaster, there may be grease or other residue. Cleaning the toaster vents and other surfaces with residue can prevent fires.Wash the areas with mild dish soap and water every other month. Then wipe dry with a clean cotton cloth.Make sure the toaster is unplugged when cleaning up residue.

, As toasters heat up, they can also heat up things near them. This may cause a fire. Make sure there is space between your toaster and cabinets. Clear the area around your toaster as well. Some items that present a burning or fire hazard include:Paper items
Plastic items, including bags
Clothing, Unattended cooking is a common cause of kitchen fires. Make sure that you are close to the toaster when you’re using it. This can help you smell or see any potential burning and prevent a larger fire.If you need to step away at all, stop the toaster until you can come back and watch it.

, Toasters continue to draw on electricity when you’re not using them. Although rare, this can cause a fire. Unplugging your toaster when you don’t use it may prevent burnt surfaces or a fire., Acting quickly if you notice any burning or fire is important to prevent a fire. Installing a fire extinguisher on the wall or someplace else in plain view in your kitchen can keep potential fires at bay.Avoid putting a fire extinguisher in a cabinet or cupboard where you can’t reach it quickly.

, Some companies have recalled toasters because of defective pieces or risk of fire. Figure out if your toaster is recalled by consulting the website https://www.recalls.gov/. This site will also email notifications about product recalls. This can automatically alert you if your toaster is recalled.Most companies will compensate you or provide a new toaster if they recall your appliance.

, Place the pottery item into the oven set at 50ºC or 122ºF. Leave it for 30 minutes. Remove and work on while still warm.

, Follow the instructions on the adhesive for any mixing or preparing required.

,


Crack:

Crack in object: Use a toothpick or fine brush to force the glue into a crack in the pottery item. Ensure that the crack has absorbed as much glue as possible.

Crack that has broken object in two: A brush is excellent when the crack has resulted in two pieces. In this instance, brush the glue lightly along both broken edges and press the broken pieces together gently. Hold in this position for 30 seconds to a minute before releasing.Chip: Fill the chipped area on the pottery piece with glue. Slide the chipped piece into place and when you are satisfied that it is sitting neatly, hold the piece in place for about 30 seconds before letting go.

, Alternatively, use a razor blade or utility knife to scrape away any excess., It is best to leave it overnight to solidify before attempting to use for culinary, watering or other active purposes. Display items can simply be re-shelved.

Include instructions.",How to Make Pancake Mix," When preparing any of the home-style, dry buttermilk, liquid buttermilk, or sour cream pancake mixes, all the dry ingredients should be thoroughly mixed in a large mixing bowl.









When making a pancake mix, you should only combine the dry ingredients. Each mix requires you to add liquid ingredients before cooking pancakes, but these liquid ingredients should not be included in stored mixes.
For best results, sift together lumpy ingredients like flour and cornmeal before stirring them into the other ingredients.
All-purpose flour is standard in these recipes, but you can also substitute it for fine-grain whole wheat flour if you want a healthier version.
Stir the ingredients with a whisk, wooden spoon, or large plastic mixing spoon. Make sure the ingredients are mixed thoroughly.;
, If you have a large enough jar, you can combine the dry ingredients in the jar. After filling the jar, tightly secure a cap or lid to it. Give the jar a vigorous shake to mix the ingredients together.









If you do not have a jar or container large enough to do this with the entire batch, you can cut the batch down to fit the jar you do have.
Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty space between the top of the mix and the top of the jar. This empty space is necessary to encourage easy movement within the jar, which is essential if you want to mix the pancake mix inside the jar.

, Each of the home-style, dry buttermilk, liquid buttermilk, and sour cream pancake mixes can be cut into smaller amounts or multiplied into larger amounts. Simply make sure to maintain the current ingredient proportions.








, Prepare a chocolate chip pancake mix by combining 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 ml to 125 ml) of mini milk chocolate chips for every 2 cups (500 ml) of basic dry mix.









Similarly, you can create white chocolate pancakes by replacing the milk chocolate chips with white chocolate chips. Black-and-white pancakes can be made by combining 2 Tbsp to 1/4 cup (30 ml to 60 ml) of white chocolate chips with equal parts milk chocolate chips.
Other baking chips you can consider combining with the mix include peanut butter chips and butterscotch chips.
Mini baking chips work best, but standard-size chips can also be used. If these are too big for your liking, though, you can give them a rough chop with a sharp kitchen knife before tossing them into the dry pancake mix.

, Add 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 ml to 125 ml) of finely chopped, unsalted nuts to 2 cups (500 ml) dry pancake mix.









You can use any sort of nut that appeals to you. Some variations worth trying include peanuts, pecans, walnuts, and macadamia nuts.
To create crunchy peanut butter pancakes, add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of chopped unsalted peanuts and 1/4 cup (60 ml) peanut butter baking chips to 2 cups (500 ml) dry pancake mix.
You can also combine milk chocolate chips with peanuts, pecans, almonds, and most other nuts to create pancakes reminiscent of chocolate-covered nuts.

, Fresh fruit cannot be added to pancake mix you plan to store, but if you prefer fruity pancakes, you can add various types of dried fruit to the mix. Combine roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of dried fruit for every 1.5 to 2 cups (375 to 500 ml) dry basic pancake mix.









Note that many types of dried fruit may be too large to include whole. In these instances, you should give the fruit a rough chop with a sharp kitchen knife before stirring the pieces into the dried mix.
Raisins, dried cherries, dried blueberries, dried strawberries, and dried apricots are a few types of dried fruit that work well in pancakes even without the addition of other customized ingredients.
You can create tropical pancakes by mixing in equal parts dried pineapple, dried mango, and dried kiwi.
For a flavor with greater dimension, combine nuts and fruit. Chopped walnut chips go well with dried dates and dried cranberries, for instance.

, A combination of ground cinnamon and dried nutmeg is a safe way to go. Add roughly 2 tsp (10 ml) of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) nutmeg for every 3 cups (750 ml) flour used.









You can also add cinnamon to pancakes containing dried fruit like raisins or nuts like pecans.

, Fresh fruit should be added to the mix immediately before you cook it, not before you store it. Do the same with other ingredients that have a limited shelf life, like flaked coconut.








, Each jar or container should have an airtight seal, and each needs to be labeled with the type of mix it contains and the date the mix was created. When stored this way, dry pancake mix can usually last for 3 months without any decline in quality.









The safest option is to label the jar with a date range. The beginning date should be when the mix was created and the end date should be your “use by” date.
Make sure that you check the expiration date of each ingredient used. If one of your ingredients expires sooner than 3 months, the entire batch of pancake mix will also expire with it.
Use a glass jar or plastic container. Make sure the lid has a tight seal, and thoroughly wash and dry both the jar and lid before pouring your pancake mix in.

, You should attach an index card with the preparation instructions written on it to the jar of pancake mix. This is true regardless of whether you plan on keeping the mix for yourself or giving it away to someone else.









For the homestyle pancake mix, combine 1 cup (250 ml) water with 1 cup (250 ml) dry mix, stirring until the lumps disappear.
For the dry buttermilk and sour cream pancake mixes, whisk together one egg, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) melted butter or oil, and 3/4 cup (175 ml) water for every 1.5 cups (375 ml) dry mix used. Stir the liquids together separately before whisking them into the dry pancake mix.
For the liquid buttermilk pancakes, whisk together 2 egg whites and 2 cups (500 ml) buttermilk in a separate bowl. In another bowl, mix 2 egg yolks and 4 Tbsp (60 ml) melted butter. Combine the two egg mixtures thoroughly before whisking them into 2 cups (500 ml) of prepared pancake mix.
Ladle the batter of each mix onto a hot, oiled griddle or skillet and cook for several until bubbles form and the edges dry. Flip once and continue cooking for another 2 to 3 minutes or until done.

Smooth the dollops into flat disks using a knife, mini rubber spatula, or cake decorating spatula.

Aim to make the disks about 2½ inches (6 centimeters) wide and ⅕ inch (0.5 centimeter) thick.
It might be a good idea to made a few extra Nutella disks in case some break.

, They are ready when they turn firm. While the disks are freezing, you can start preparing the pancake batter. You can use your favorite recipe, or try the one in this method.

You can peel the disks off of the parchment paper, but you should leave them in the freezer so that they don't thaw.

, Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the baking powder, sugar, and salt. Stir everything together with a whisk., Pat the dry ingredients flat, then make a small hole in the middle. Crack an egg into the hole, then add the milk. For extra flavor, add some vanilla extract as well., Keep whisking until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. Do not over-mix it, otherwise the pancakes will turn tough., Place about ½ teaspoon of butter into a small, nonstick frying pan, Melt the butter over medium heat, then wipe it off with a paper towel. Leave a very thin layer of butter behind.

While the butter is melting, take out 1 to 3 Nutella disks out of the freezer. Leave the rest in the freezer.
You can also try using cooking spray instead., You have to work quickly for this step, so have everything you need on hand. Pour about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of pancake batter onto the pan. Quickly place a Nutella disk on top.

This is the secret to getting golden-brown pancakes!

, Plan on using a little less than ¼ cup (60 milliliters). Use a rubber spatula to help smooth the pancake batter over the disk. Make sure that it is completely covered., Let the pancake fry a little first. After about 2 minutes, it will start to form bubbles around the edges. Once that happens, slide a spatula under it, and flip it over., This will take another 1 to 2 minutes.As soon as the pancake is done, move onto the next one., Frozen Nutella thaws quickly, so it is important that you work in small batches. If the Nutella thaws, it will become difficult to work with and give you very messy pancakes. Only take 1 to 3 Nutella disks out of the freezer at a time.

This recipe has enough batter to make 6 or 7 pancakes.
If a pancake bursts, scrape off the leaked Nutella before moving onto the next pancake.
You will have to re-grease the pan after every couple of pancakes. Remember to wipe the excess butter off!

, You can eat them just as they are, or top them with some sliced strawberries or strawberry jam."

If you have a different pancake recipe that you prefer to use, feel free to prepare it instead.

, Pat the surface of the dry mixture first, then create a well in the middle. Crack an egg right into the well, then pour in the milk. Whisk everything together until the batter is smooth. Stop whisking as soon as the lumps disappear; don't over-mix., Set a skillet on the stove and set the heat up to medium-low. Once the skillet is hot, lightly grease it with cooking spray or a little bit of butter.

If you are using butter, let it melt, then wipe most of it off. This will prevent the pancakes from getting splotchy., Let the pancake cook until the bubbles start to form. This will take about 2 minutes.While waiting, snip the bottom corner off of the bag. If you are using a piping bag, then snip the tip off., Start piping the Nutella from the outer edge of the pancake and work your way towards the center. Don't get too close to the outer edge, however, or the Nutella will burn and stick to the pan., Slide a spatula under the pancake and lip it. Cook the pancake for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until it is golden on both sides., Wipe the pan after each pancake that you make. Every few pancakes, add more cooking spray or butter to the skillet; be sure to wipe the butter off, however!, You serve them as they are, or garnish them with slices strawberries or bananas."

When flipping, don't push down on the pancakes.,
Finish cooking your pancake according to the time normally required.",How to Make Lighter Pancakes," Follow the instructions for making the batter according to your favorite recipe. There are lots of choices for pancake recipes available here.;
, This will depend on the type of pancake you're making:

For the fluffy, fatter pancake style: Make a quick introduction of air to the pancakes by whisking really well.






For the batter of thinner, crepe-like pancakes, try this: If you have more time, set the batter aside for a half hour to an hour prior to cooking. This extra time allows the starch in the flour to soften or break down considerably, leaving a much lighter batter.







, After you put the butter in the pan, add the pancake batter in suitable amounts.

, While it may feel right to push down after you flip to help it cook, it won't help the lightness or faster cooking. It'll just deflate the pancakes and reduce their airiness.

, While your skillet heats, start making some batter. The back or side panel of a boxed mix will have specific quantities for mixing, though usually it's 3 parts water to 4 parts powder. Milk can also be substituted for water in certain mixes. Make sure you don't over mix your batter and it doesn't sit too long before it's poured onto the pan, or your pancakes won't be fluffy.

, If desired, this is the time to add chocolate chips or any other bonus toppings to your pancakes, but do not add fruit during this step. If you add fruit now it may burn and melt on the pan, making a huge mess and stink. Try brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

, By now your pan should be hot enough. Take some water on your fingers and flick it onto the middle of the pan. If it sizzles away quickly, it's hot enough to cook on. If it doesn't sizzle away, it's not ready and you should crank up the heat a bit.

, Add butter or margarine to grease the pan for easy flipping.

, Now it's time to pour. Use a small ladle and pour directly into the center of the pan. Once it's poured, this is the time to sprinkle any blueberries or fruit on top.

, Wait until the pancake's whole first side is cooked. You'll see bubbles start to rise and the edges will dry out on the pancakes. That's how you know it's time to flip. Be sure, use a fork or spatula to check that it's golden brown underneath.

, Now it's time to flip. If you've added enough butter, this should be easy. In one quick motion, push your spatula underneath the pancake and lift it up, quickly splatting it back down in the same spot it was. This takes some practice. Do not press down on the pancake after flipping it. It will deflate it and make it not fluffy.

, Once the last side is cooked, serve directly off the pan. If your making a large batch, keep the pancakes warm in a slightly heated oven. Dress with syrup, butter or whatever else you'd like. It's up to you!

Figure out the size of rice cooker you need.,
Figure out what material you need for the inner pot.,
Decide whether you need a gas or electric rice cooker.,
Decide whether you need a rice cooker with a warming function.",How to Pick a Rice Cooker," This depends on how much rice you need cooked in each batch.

1-10 Cup Rice Cooker: Best for home use. This size is very small and will often not be used in a commercial setting. If you cook rice often at home and want to invest in a good cooker, then 1-10 cups is likely your size.
21-30 Cup Rice Cooker: Best for light commercial use. For restaurants that serve rice with only a few dishes and are not extremely busy, a 21-30 cup rice cooker should fit your needs.
31-40 Cup Rice Cooker: Best for medium commercial use. For a mid-sized restaurant with a handful of rice dishes , a 31-40 cup rice cooker should be the right fit.
51-60 Cup Rice Cooker: Best for heavy commercial use. Often, 51-60 cup rice cookers are reserved for restaurants that include rice in almost every dish. Asian and Mexican restaurants almost always opt for the heaviest use cookers.;
,

Aluminum -- inner pots are most often made of aluminum as it is durable, light, and dent resistant. It cannot however be washed in a commercial dishwasher as the chemicals will erode the aluminum.
Stainless Steel -- these can be harder to find but can be washed in the dishwasher (given the inner pot is removable).
Ceramic -- usually only small, residential use rice cookers will come with a ceramic inner pot. They don’t often last long in a commercial setting where equipment is constantly being moved around and often dropped.

,

Most slow rice cookers are electric and come with a cord and plug. These are the most common simply because most modern kitchens place their rice cookers on a counter and want to use an electrical outlet.
There are still a number of gas rice cookers out there for those with gas lines rather than outlets in the kitchen. Most use a Piezo Ignition system which does not require an outside power source. If you have a gas rice cooker though, most local codes require it be under a hood. Refer to your local authority before purchasing a gas rice cooker to make sure you are meeting all safety requirements.

,

Rice cookers with a hold feature are great when you have a large capacity cooker that you would like to hold your rice warm for the next few hours. Most slow rice cookers with a hold feature will keep your rice warm for 2-5 hours depending on the model.
Rice cookers without a hold feature are created purely to cook the rice and nothing more, they shut off after the cycle is completed. If you are using large amounts of rice quickly then a hold feature may not be necessary.

1 Maple Board 4″ x 20″ x 1″
1 Cherry Board 4″ x 20″ x 1″;
, This is a simple tutorial, but it does require a fair amount of supplies to do correctly. You should have:

Place the toothed wheel of the can opener on the lid of the can.,
Squeeze the arms closed.,
Twist the handle.",How to Open a Can2," Set the can opener wheel onto the outer rim of the can lid. For some can openers, the wheel is designed to rest on the top of the can, in the groove next to the lip. In others, the wheel will be on the outside of the can, and a flat metal piece will rest in the top groove instead.


If your opener has no wheel, see the tips section below.
On some electric can openers, you will need to lift a protective flap first to reveal the wheel.

, If you are using a hand-operated can opener, close the arms of the can opener together tightly. You should hear a hiss or puncture noise as the wheel punches through the metal.


For an electronic can opener, just hit the On button instead. Some models will even detect the can and start opening it automatically.

, Keep one hand on the arms of the can opener, holding them tight. With your other hand, rotate the bar or key handle on the outside of the can opener. This should cause the can opener to move around the entire rim of the can, with the toothed wheel cutting through the metal as it moves.


You might find it easier to handle the food inside if you leave a small piece of the lid rim uncut. This allows you to use a fork to pry up the open end of the lid and bend it backward, instead of trying to dig out the lid after it's fallen into the food.

Find the grooves in the center of a large can.,
Press on the grooves to make a dent.,
Make a dent on the opposite side as well.,
Squeeze the dents even deeper.,
Rip the can apart slowly.,
Remove metal fragments.",How to Open a Can3," Modern metal cans have a series of ridges and grooves forming a ring around the center of the can. These are weak points, and can be used to rip apart the can at that location.Tear off the label if necessary to get a better look.


This method will not work for small cans without grooves.

, If you have strong hands, you can grip the can on each end, then push your fingers down into the grooves. Otherwise, place the can on the ground and push down against the grooves using the heel of your hand. Keep pressing on the corners of the dent, until the dent is as wide as you can make it. Once the dent crosses, or nearly crosses, the entire width of the can when viewed from above, continue on to the next step.

, Rotate the can 180 degrees, so the dent is now facing downward. Repeat the same denting process on the opposite side, again pushing as hard as you can. You should now have two dents, on opposite sides of the can cylinder.

, Hold the can horizontally, then place the heel of each hand on each of the flat, circular lids. Position them so the heel is at the top of the flat area, near the rim, not in the center. Interlock your fingers together over the dented surface, then squeeze the two ends of the can together by pushing with your hands.Repeat for the other dent.


If this does not work, try placing the can's flat surface on the ground, and pressing down on it with your hand or knee.

, You should now have a can with a major dent on each side, similar to an hourglass shape. Hold the can on both sides of the dents, then bend the two halves apart by wiggling them back and forth. You should hear a hiss as the seal breaks, and the can should come apart soon afterward.

, Since you have literally ripped the center of the can to shreds, small metal pieces may have ended up in your food. Watch carefully for these so you can remove them before you eat, or throw away the food around the outer edge of the can. Spooning the food into another container without a jagged metal edge is recommended."

Don’t overmix the batter, because this can develop the gluten in the flour and make for chewy rather than fluffy pancakes., This will give the flour time to absorb the moisture in the batter. It will also give the gluten time to relax, and this will make for light and fluffy pancakes.If in a hurry, you can skip the resting step, but your pancakes won’t be quite as fluffy.

, This will make one pancake.Repeat for however many pancakes your griddle will hold, leaving enough space between them to allow for flipping.

, When bubbles form and start to pop, after two to three minutes, use a spatula to flip the pancakes.


Once they’ve been flipped, cook the pancakes for an additional two minutes, or until they're golden brown on both sides.,


An oven isn't necessary, but if you're doing a big batch, it's the best way to keep cooked pancakes warm while the others are in the griddle. Pre-heat the oven to 225 F (107 C), and then place the plate or cooling rack and pan in there., When the first batch of pancakes is in the oven, add another tablespoon (14 g) of butter to the hot griddle.

Lift the clamped set of strips of the work surface, drying the wood glue so that it doesn't stick to the table.",How to Make a Cutting Board2," Again, the exact width is up to you, but 3/4"" is a good, workable thickness. Measure out each strip of wood on the walnut, maple, and cherry boards with your pencil.









You want the strips to run lengthwise along each board -- you'll then alternate strips from each type of wood to build the final cutting board.

, Working slowly, cut along your pencil lines. You should end up with three sets of perfectly even strips of wood. They look like square posts.









The number of strips you end up with will depend on the starting width of your wood.
You can play with or adapt this formula -- cutting different widths to get a variable striping on your final board -- if you want.

, The easiest style is to alternate -- cherry, maple, walnut, cherry, maple, walnut, cherry... etc. Rotate the strips so that the nicest side is facing up, and place the wood into a ""dry cut"" of the final cutting board.








, You'll be using wood glue to adhere the wood strips to each other, so turn each piece over so that the side you'll be gluing faces upward.








, Use your fingers or a brush to apply glue to one side of every strip of wood. You want glue covering the entire side. Don't worry about dripping or excess glue now -- you'll clean it up later.








, Rotate the wood back counter-clockwise so that the glue sides are between each piece of wood. Line them up and press them together, making sure they don't buckle or slide.








, This is necessary to help the wood glue dry appropriately. Make sure, as you apply the clamps, that the wood stays level. No pieces should ""buckle"" or push upwards. Ensure that the bottom or top is roughly even as well.








, Lift the cutting board vertical and let it dry for the recommended time on the wood glue bottle.









This should take 1-3 hours, but check the bottle for specifics.

Remove the clamps and use a chisel to remove large chunks of glue.,
Run the board through your planer.,
Use your table saw or miter saw to cut your edges to perfect size.,
Use your orbital sander to give the board a smooth polish.,
Finish the board with some food-grade mineral oil.",How to Make a Cutting Board3," Take the clamps off once the wood glue dries. If there are any big chunks of glue on the board, lightly chisel them off now.








, This gives it an even, perfect surface. You don't need to take much off -- only a few millimeters. Run both sides through for a perfectly smooth board.









Taking off roughly a 1/8 on an inch from each side will generally get out any issues or imperfections., Now that all the strips are attached it is easy to get the board to the perfect size. Set your saw to your final length, here 16"", and cut the ends of the board to your final length.








, After the planer, you shouldn't need to do a lot of sanding. Use 220 grit paper to smooth the board, round the edges, and take out any roughness created by the saw.








, This puts a protective coating on the board and makes it easier to clean and work with. Use a damp rag to wipe off the board, then dry it thoroughly. Working in small circles, apply the food-grade mineral oil to the board, using a rag to apply a thin coating across the entire board. Let it dry and your cutting board is ready to use.









The final board should have a light shine on it. Reapply the mineral oil if it seems rough, woody, or unfinished in places.
Linseed oil and beeswax are two common food-grade oils.

Get creative with your toppings.,
Drizzle a chocolate fudge sauce on top.,
Try a hot chocolate sauce.,
Garnish with marshmallow.,
Transform them into peppermint hot chocolate pancakes.,
Experiment with all kinds of other toppings.",How to Make Hot Chocolate Pancakes2," One of the best things about hot chocolate pancakes is the variety of ways you can garnish them with different sauces and toppings, so you can even turn basic pancakes into a fun breakfast bar event., In a saucepan or double boiler over low heat, mix the chocolate chips and light cream using a whisk. Shut off the stove and allow the fudge sauce to cool until lukewarm. Drizzle the sauce over each pancake or on top of a stack., Combine the maple syrup and hot chocolate powder in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Simmer for five minutes, until the sauce is hot and thick.Drizzle the sauce over each pancake or on top of a stack., Hot chocolate is often served with marshmallows, so why not serve hot chocolate pancakes with marshmallows, too? For a gooier treat, roast or melt the marshmallows on the pancakes slightly with a cooking torch, first.

Alternatively, try spreading marshmallow crème onto the pancakes., Peppermint and chocolate are a wonderful combination for the holidays. To make a simple peppermint chocolate sauce, add 1⁄4 teaspoon (1.2 ml) of peppermint extract to the chocolate fudge or hot chocolate sauce.

Top each pancake with a drizzle of peppermint chocolate sauce and a sprinkle of crushed peppermint candies., If you're making hot chocolate pancakes for a dessert, or offering up a pancake buffet, the sky is the limit on your toppings. Think of the kinds of things you might eat with an ice cream sundae.

Consider topping the pancakes with chocolate syrup instead of the fudge sauce.
A layer of chocolate-hazlenut spread goes great with these pancakes.
Add whipped cream and a layer of chocolate sprinkles.
Whip up a caramel sauce or even a salted caramel sauce and drizzle that on top.
Try some marshmallow and miniature chocolate chips to emulate a s'more.Garnish the hot chocolate pancakes with chocolate flakes or curls for a sweeter flavor.

",How to Maintain Your Butcher Block1,"


You may want to use a spatula or steel scraper, which will also help with removing excess liquid.

,


Use a sponge, water, and liquid dish-washing detergent or mild soap to clean the block on every side.

,,


Use bleach or a mixture of white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.
Add 1 tbsp. (14.78 milliliters) of bleach to 1 gallon (3.78 liters) of water and use a sponge to clean all surfaces of the butcher block.
Rinse the butcher block with water to remove any remaining traces of disinfectant.
Spray your butcher block with undiluted white vinegar and allow the vinegar to completely soak into the surface.
Use a paper towel saturated with 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and gently swipe it across the butcher block to complete the disinfection process.

,,


An excellent oil for cutting boards can be found at the drugstore labelled as a ""lubricant laxative"". It's odorless, tasteless, colorless, and will not turn rancid.
Pour mineral oil directly on your butcher block and gently use a sponge to spread the oil across the entire surface.
Let the mineral oil soak completely into the surface of your butcher block and use a soft rag to wipe away any remaining or excess oil that will not soak in.

,


This procedure will seal the oil into the wood and prevent additional bacteria from contaminating the wood.
Apply small amounts of beeswax to a soft rag and gently wipe it across your butcher block until each entire surface area is covered with beeswax.
Use gentle, circular motions to rub the beeswax into the wood and wipe away excess beeswax with a clean, dry cloth.

,


This will cause the entire surface to wear equally instead of in one specific spot when you cut.

,


Using cleavers with extremely sharp or razor edges may cause your butcher block to splinter or chip.

Buy a charcoal chimney.,
Wad up paper under the bottom of the chimney.,
Pile the briquettes into the chimney.,
Light the newspaper through the lower slots.,
Pour out the coals when the top layer is gray.",How to Light Briquettes1," Visit the outdoor section of your local home improvement store or big-box store, like Walmart or Target. A charcoal chimney is essentially a metal cylinder with a handle on it. Look for a chimney with a sturdy cylinder, a comfortable handle, and slots around the bottom for easy lighting.

You may find a variety of sizes, so consider the size of your grill.;
, Grab a few pieces of newspaper or paper towels and crush them up into wads. Place them on the lower grate of your grill and set the chimney on top of them. Make sure you’ll be able to reach the slots on the bottom of the chimney.Lighter cubes are another option. They are more expensive than paper, but also tend to light more effectively. Find them at the store with the chimney and briquettes.

, Pour the bag of briquettes into the chimney, or load them by hand. Many chimneys will hold about 100 briquettes. If your grill is small, you may only need to fill the chimney half or three quarters full. Use your best judgment., Use a long reach lighter so your fingers aren’t too close to the flame. Stick the end of the lighter through one of the slots in the bottom of the chimney. Hold the flame against the paper and keep the lighter lit until you are sure the paper has caught fire., The chimney burns the charcoal from the bottom up. Wait about 10-15 minutes for the fire to work its way to the top layer of charcoal. When you see ash on the top charcoal, pour it into your grill. Chimney starters are not meant to be left on or in the grill while you cook."

Remove the old cooktop if there is one.,
Make sure there is enough clearance around your chosen location.,
Check that the appropriate junction box exists in your desired location.,

Alter the hole in the countertop to fit the cooktop.,
Detach any removable pieces on your cooktop to make it easier to set in place.,
Install the spring clips.,
Lower the new cooktop into place.,
Connect the wires of the new cooktop to the power supply.,
Install the removable pieces of your cooktop.,
Turn the power back on and test the cooktop.",How to Install a Cooktop1," If you are replacing an old cooktop then you will first have to remove it. Turn off the power to this cooktop at the fuse box. Remove any caulking or attachments on the cooktop. Disconnect the wiring, remembering how the old cooktop is wired, and lift the cooktop out of the opening.


You must be absolutely certain that the power is turned off to your cooktop. You can use a circuit tester to double check by touching one lead on the circuit tester to any wire that is not green or white and the other lead to a white or green (ground) wire. If the light comes on, it means the power is still on.
Make sure you remember how the old wiring was connected because the new wiring will connect in the same way. You can even label wires and take a picture of the wiring before removal to help you remember.
Get someone to help you lift the cooktop out of its location because they can be quite heavy. ;
, Ideally you should have at least 30 inches (76 cm) of clearance above the cooktop and 1-2 feet (30-60 cm) of clearance on the sides. You must also check that there is enough space below the cooktop for your desired model.


Check the manufacturer’s instructions for specific requirements for your cooktop. , Most cooktops will require a 240 VAC junction box. If you are replacing a cooktop then you probably will already have this installed.


If there is no junction box then you should hire a professional to install one for you.
You must also check that the old cooktop has the same amperage as the new cooktop or else the wiring may need to be performed by a professional. Many old cooktops have only a 30-amp circuit while modern cooktops often have a 40-amp or 50-amp circuit., If you have removed a previously installed cooktop then there should already be a hole so you must check the dimensions of the new cooktop to see if it will fit.


Measure the length and width of the cooktop and subtract ½ - 1 inch (1.25-2.5 cm) from each side to account for the lip that will overlap the countertop. , The hole needs to be the size of the cooktop minus the ½ to 1 inch for the lip. If there is no hole currently or if the hole is too small then you will need to cut a hole or make it larger. If the hole is too big then you can screw shims (long flat metal pieces) into the sides around the opening.


You may need to remove tile around the area before cutting through the counter with a saw.
You will need a wet saw to cut through a granite countertop. Alternatively hire a professional for this job because granite can be difficult to cut cleanly. You should also seal the stone before placing the cooktop into its location. , Your cooktop may have removable burners, screens or other parts that can be set aside for now. You should also remove any packaging that may be around the cooktop.

, These hold the cooktop in place. You should hang them from the upper edge of the cutout and then secure them with screws.


If you have a granite counter then you should secure the spring clips using double-sided adhesive tape rather than screws. , Lower the new cooktop into the opening, making sure to draw the wires through the opening first. Press down until it clicks into place in the spring clips.


If you had to remove tile then you will have to reinstall the tiles to lay flush with the edges of the cooktop before laying it into place. You may need to wait for 24 hours for the tiles to set before putting the cooktop into place. , The power must still be off when you do this to prevent injury and shocks. Connect the wires of the cooktop to their corresponding wire in the power supply.


The red and black wires (can also be other colors) are the hot wires which carry electricity to the appliance. Connect the red and black wires on the cooktop to the red and black wires in the power supply box.
The white wire is the neutral wire, which completes the circuit. The white wire on the cooktop will connect to the white wire in the power supply.
The green wire is the ground wire, which grounds the circuit. Connect the green wire on the cooktop to the green wire in the power supply.
Connect all wires together using a wire nut, which is like a little cap. Line up the wires next to each other and then twist the wires around each other. Screw the wire nut onto the twisted wires. The wire nut protects them from touching other bare wires, preventing potential fires., Put back any burners, screens or other removable parts.

, Flip the breaker back on and turn on the cooktop to check that everything is working well. "

Pile the briquettes in a mound on the lower grate.,
Squirt the mound with lighter fluid.,
Allow the fluid to soak into the briquettes for 3-5 minutes.,
Add more lighter fluid to the mound.,
Light the mound in 2-3 places around the outer edge.",How to Light Briquettes2," Make a layer that covers the majority of the grill’s lower grate. Make another smaller layer on top of the foundation. Pile the briquettes until they reach about two inches from the bottom of the upper grate. The main thing is that the briquettes are touching so they keep each other hot.There’s not an exact amount of charcoal that is perfect. Experiment with different sized piles of charcoal to find what you like the most.

, Hold the bottle of lighter fluid about 6-12 inches (15-30.5 cm) from the pile of charcoal. Squeeze the bottle to squirt the fluid. Move the bottle in a back and forth motion to distribute it. Cover all sides of the mound until they are wet.Don't empty the whole bottle onto the pile. Only use enough to cover the mound.

, For the most effective lighting, let the lighter fluid penetrate into the briquettes. If you light the fluid too soon, it will simply burn off of the outside of the briquettes. Be careful not to get the fluid on anything but the charcoal., When the lighter fluid has soaked in for a while, grab the bottle again and squirt more fluid onto the charcoal. Cover all sides of the mound just as you did before. Set the bottle of lighter fluid away from the grill. Wipe your hands off to make sure no fluid got on them., Grab a long lighter or a box of matches. Light the mound of charcoal in two or three places around the outer edges of the mound. Lighter fluid catches fire quickly, so be careful to keep your hands away from the fire.If the entire mound catches fire quickly, there’s no need to light it in more than one spot. Only light extra spots if the fire is spreading across the mound slowly.

Turn on the burners to check that everything is working.,
Reattach the brackets connecting the cooktop to the counter.",How to Install a Cooktop2," A gas cooktop will require a gas line to bring fuel to the burners. If you are replacing an existing gas cooktop then you should already have a gas line installed.


If you do not have a gas line then you should hire a professional to install one for you. It is particularly important for a gas line to be installed properly because leaks can cause fires and be dangerous for people breathing in the gas. , Removing the doors and drawers can help make it easier to access the space under the cooktop. You will also need to remove any items from the cabinets to access the gas line and hose.


To remove cabinet doors you can unscrew the hinges holding them in place. , There will be a small valve where the flexible hose of the cooktop attaches to the built-in gas line of the house. Turn this valve so that it is perpendicular to the hose, or so that it sticks out to the side.


If you do not close the valve properly, it will release gas when you unhook the hose and can cause suffocation and/or fires.
When the gas line is open the handle on the valve will be pointing in the direction of gas flow. It is very important to turn this valve 90 degrees to close the valve. , Many gas cooktops have power cords to provide electricity to light the burners. You must unplug this power cable from the outlet before proceeding. , Even though you have switched off the gas valve, there may still be gas trapped in the hose. Turn on all the burners to release this trapped gas. Do not light them. This will release all the extra gas after a few minutes.


Turn on your range hood while you have the burners on to disperse all the gas that is released. , Take one wrench and set it on the nut of the flexible gas hose and take the other wrench and set it on the nut on the wall hose.


Hold the wrench connected to the wall hose to keep it in place.
Turn the wrench attached to the flexible gas hose counterclockwise to unscrew. Continue turning counterclockwise until the hose is completely detached from the wall pipe.
Some wall pipes will have a special fitting that goes between the wall gas pipe and the flexible hose pipe. Make sure you leave this fitting in place when unscrewing the hose., Remove the burners, screens and any other removable pieces before proceeding. This will make it easier to move the cooktop around.

, Unscrew the brackets from the underside of the existing cooktop.

, Remove the cooktop from the counter and place it somewhere safe. Don’t forget that the hose is still attached when you are pulling it out of place.


Place it upside down when you are setting it aside to keep it from being damaged. , If you will be reusing the hose for your new cooktop then you should unscrew it from the old cooktop. Use two wrenches to unscrew, attaching one to the cooktop and the other to the nut on the flexible hose.


Turn the wrench attached to the flexible hose counterclockwise to unscrew.

, Apply pipe sealant to the threads where the hose attaches on the cooktop. Brush the sealant liberally on all the threads but be careful not to get any sealant inside the hose. Use the wrench to screw the hose to the cooktop.


Make sure the threads on the cooktop are completely covered with sealant because this will prevent gas leaks later on.
Some cooktops come with a regulator to make sure the gas pressure remains constant. If there is one you will attach the regulator to the cooktop threads and the hose to the regulator. Make sure you apply sealant to the threads before screwing the regulator and hose into place. Use a small paintbrush to apply the sealant if your container does not come with one.

, Slide the cooktop into place carefully making sure you do not damage any of the valves on the bottom. You should also put the hose through the opening before sliding the cooktop into place. , Apply sealant to the threads on the fitting on the wall pipe. Then screw the flexible pipe into place using a wrench. Make sure you tighten the pipe securely.


Make sure you get the sealant spread all the way around the threads to prevent leaks., Make a solution of half dish soap and half water to test if there are any leaks. Stir the mix well and then either spray on all the connections or use a paintbrush to apply to all the connections. Turn on the valve to the built-in pipe by turning the valve so that it points in the same direction as the flow of gas.


Check if any bubbles are forming at any of the connections. You should also make sure that you do not smell any gas. Both of these would signal that there is a leak in the connections.
If there is a leak then immediately turn off the valve. Unscrew the connections, apply more sealant, and then reconnect. Test again using the soapy water mixture.
Check several times to make sure there really are no leaks. You must also make sure you check every connection that you have made. , If there are no leaks from your soapy water test then try turning on the burner. It may take a few seconds for the gas to come through and light because you first need to push out the air in the hose.


You may smell a little gas before it lights so make sure the range hood is on before lighting.
If it doesn’t light after 4 seconds, turn off the burner and wait a few minutes before trying again. , Now that the cooktop is definitely working, reattach any brackets to connect the cooktop to the counter. Your gas cooktop is now fully installed.Reattach any cabinets or drawers that you previously removed and replace all the items inside the cabinets.

Choose a cooktop when you want your oven separate from the cooktop.,
Install a downdraft cooktop to avoid having an exhaust hood overhead.,
Choose between a gas or electric cooktop.,
Decide how many burners you need.,
Choose a cooktop that will fit into the space.,
Consider the financial implications.",How to Install a Cooktop3," Cooktops can be useful because you put them in an island or peninsula. They are also helpful when you want to install a built-in oven, which is easier on the back than a normal oven.


Cooktops also allow two people to work with separate appliances at the same time.
Cooktops are also less visible than normal ranges because you can install them virtually flush with the countertop.
Cooktops can also be easier to clean than normal ranges., If you have want to install your cooktop over an island and do not wish to have an exhaust hood then you can choose one that comes with downdraft ventilation.


This kind of ventilation brings the air from the surface to down below the cooktop.
Some cooktops come with telescoping vents that rise above the cooktop while cooking and then can be pushed below the surface between meals. , Traditionally gas cooktops were chosen because they provide an immediate response once lit and they can be seen for adjustments. However, modern electric cooktops also gain heat very quickly and come in very low heat versions.


You should also look at style, size, number of burners, color, cost, materials and safety features when deciding on a cooktop.
Examine the cost of operation when choosing between gas and electric. You can also compare the prices of gas and electricity that will be used for your cooktop. , In most cases of typical family cooking a four burner unit would be sufficient. However, if you host parties or family gatherings, or if you routinely host people at your home, additional burners could be incredibly useful. Decide on how many burners you will need for your particular uses. , If you are replacing an old cooktop, check to see that the new cooktop will fit in the place of the old cooktop. If it is a different size then you should make sure there is space to cut the correctly sized hole for the new cooktop. , Gas stoves can be a little more expensive to purchase but will usually cost less in the long run because fuel is cheaper than electricity.


You should also consider the costs of installing wiring (for electric stoves) or gas lines (for gas stoves) if there is no wiring or gas lines to begin with.

Install a chimney and connect it to your stove, if necessary.,
Consider hiring certified professionals to install and inspect your stove.",How to Install a Wood Stove," You don't want to have to make the decision of where to put your stove as you are wheeling the 500-lb iron behemoth around on a dolly. Designate a site in your house for your stove well in advance of when you plan to buy it. Since stoves are space heaters, generally, you'll want the stove on the first floor of your house where you spend most of your time so that it can warm you effectively throughout the day. To further maximize the efficiency of your wood stove, try to pick a spot in a room with especially good insulation so that the heat from the stove is not lost through the walls or windows.


Keep in mind that every wood stove requires a chimney. Take this into account when choosing a spot for your stove. If you plan for your chimney to extend straight up through the roof, for instance, you may not want to pick a spot for your stove that's directly under one of your second floor's main support beams.;
, Wood stoves can get very, very hot during use. Radiating heat from the stove can pose a hazard to nearby walls and furniture, so wood stoves generally have a specified clearance - a minimum safe distance between the stove and nearby floors and walls. Your stove clearance can depend on where you live, whether your residence's floors and walls are combustible, and the type and size of wood stove you have. If in doubt about your stove's clearance rating, contact your stove's manufacturer. This applies only if your stove is UL or CSA listed - please check the label. If not you may still be able to install it. Check if your locality allows non-listed solid-fuel appliances (this is what wood stoves are officially called). If yes then check next with your insurance company. If all is good you can install your unlisted stove according to NFPA211. This will specify all clearances.

, As you shop for wood stoves, be sure to check that any stove you're considering buying is properly certified as meeting criteria for safety and environmental friendliness. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certifies wood stoves as meeting certain emissions standards. The EPA regularly publishes exhaustive lists of certified wood stoves, but certified stoves should also be labeled with both a temporary paper label and a permanent metal label.

, Generally, the larger a wood stove is, the hotter it can become when it's full of burning wood. Thus, small rooms can become uncomfortably warm from the heat provided by an especially large wood stove. Most wood stove manufacturers list their stoves' maximum heat output per hour in British Thermal Units (BTU) - most popular stoves fall between 25,000 to 80,000 BTU. The average medium-sized house requires only about 5,000 to 25,000 BTU - in other words, the maximum output of a small stove or less - even during winter.However, your home's heating needs may differ based on your climate and the size of your house, so, if you have any questions, contact your manufacturer.


Burning your wood stove at its maximum capacity for long periods of time can damage the stove, so you may want to opt for a stove that's slightly larger than what you'll typically need so that you can use it at sub-maximum capacity most of the time.

, Like many building projects, installing a wood stove may require permission from your local government to ensure that you comply with safety regulations. However, rules will vary from town to town, so, before you buy a stove or start modifying your house, get in touch with the building or planning department of your city or town's government to get a sense for what is and isn't legal. If you need to get a building permit to install your stove, the officials in this department should be able to help you get one.


You may also want to call your local fire marshal, as, in some jurisdictions, installing a wood stove requires an inspection to approve the validity of the installation.
Finally, you may also want to contact the issuer of your homeowner's insurance, as installing a wood stove may change your liability.

, Floor pads are essential for safe wood stove operation, as they ensure that any stray sparks or embers that fall from the stove will only come into contact with the pad, not the floor, reducing the risk of fire. Floor pads are especially crucial in the case of houses with wood or carpet floors directly adjacent to the stove.


Certain laws dictate the use of floor pads - in the United States and Canada, the floor pad must stretch at least 18 inches (45 cm) in front of the stove door and 8 inches (20 cm) from the other sides.

, Installing heat shielding on the walls around the site of your stove can further reduce the risk of damage or fire. Heat shields are often made of sheet metal, which is relatively simple to lay over existing walls. Check your local building codes to find out whether any special permission is needed to mount the shield as well as any other related clearance requirements.


Note that the installation of a heat shield can reduce the clearance requirements of your stove., If you haven't hired professional movers to help you get your stove into position, you'll need to move it yourself. Wood stoves are made from metal and can be incredibly heavy, so be sure to take any and all measures necessary to protect yourself as you move the stove. A sturdy dolly or hand truck that's rated above the weight of your stove is a great way to get the stove to its position without hurting yourself.


Minor adjustments to the stove's positioning at the site of installation may need to be done by hand, in which case you should enlist the help of a friend or family member so that you don't have to bear the full weight of the stove yourself. You may also want to try rolling the stove into position on lengths of sturdy PVC pipe.

, A well-functioning chimney is absolutely crucial for getting the most out of your wood stove. Your chimney should carry smoke and sediment safely outside your house - a poorly-installed chimney may not effectively remove the smoke, leaving your living room a gloomy, smokey mess. Chimneys can be an existing part of the house's construction or can be installed along with the stove, but in either case, the chimney must be well-insulated and made of a non-combustible material. New chimneys installed for wood stoves are often made of a special kind of insulated stainless steel piping.You may need to use a length of stovepipe to connect your wood stove to the chimney. This is fine, but remember that stovepipe is relatively thin and poorly-insulated, so by no means can stovepipe be used as a substitute for an actual insulated chimney.
Generally, the taller and straighter a chimney is, the better. The greater distance that smoke must travel horizontally (through curved sections of stovepipe, for instance), the less effective the chimney will be at removing smoke from the stove.

, Installed properly, wood stoves can be a tremendous boon for your house, but installed improperly, they can be a hassle and even a serious danger. If you encounter any problems while installing your wood stove or you are unsure of how to proceed safely, enlist the help of a professional. Similarly, if, after installation, you have even the slightest doubts about the safety of your stove, schedule an inspection with an expert. The safety of your home and family is well-worth the minor expense of hiring outside help.


The National Fireplace Institute (NFI) is an agency that certifies fireplace and furnace experts. If you have any doubt about who to contact to install and/or inspect your new wood fireplace, search for an NFI-certified expert in your area on the NFI website."

Now try your level on the burners.,

Each burner has three supporting legs besides the connector.,
Use the level to determine which leg is the highest.,
Remove the burner and use a file or grinder to remove some metal.,

Caution: Don't take off so much metal that you remove the tip that hooks into the burner pan.,
Since you have now customized each burner to its spot, you don't want to mix them up.",How to Level Burners on an Electric Range2," They may still be unlevel. The reason is that the top of the range is bowed down in the center. The frame around the edge keeps it level but nothing supports the center. Time and heat have had their way.

Proof: Put the level in the center of the top, pointing front and back. It shows level. Now slide it to the front. No longer level, right? Same in the back, because the top is dished. How about fixing it? You can do this, one burner at a time.

, This is fortunate because it won't wobble if you make adjustments--a three-legged stool never wobbles.

, Place the level on the burner above each leg and identify which is the high one., Take a little bit at a time. You only have to remove metal from the bottom of the leg where it rests on the burner pan, from the tip to a point about 3/4"" back. Start by taking a little at a time and test-fitting after each pass., If you need to remove that much, leave the tip and file a depression behind it where the leg contacts the pan.

, In the future never remove more than one (or one big and one small) burner at a time for cleaning."

Two large bowls, a medium bowl, and one small bowl
Sifter
Jar (if you make a double batch of dry mix)
Whisk
Rubber spatula
Griddle
Silicone pastry brush
¼ measuring cup
Spatula;
, Pancakes are a type of quick bread, meaning that they use baking soda instead of yeast to power the leavening (the rising) process. Leavening happens when the baking soda is dissolved in a liquid and mixed with an acid, because the reaction produces carbon dioxide.


Because the baking soda is so integral to fluffy pancakes, only use baking soda that’s newer than six months., Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar into a large bowl. It’s important to sift the ingredients, because it will combine everything and help prevent lumps in the batter.If you don’t have a sifter, combine all the dry ingredients in the bowl and whisk them together for a minute.
You can proportionally increase the quantities of all the ingredients if you want to make extra dry pancake mix for later.

, If you made extra pancake mix to store for later, measure out 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (11 ounces) for one batch of pancake mix and set it aside for the batter. Then transfer the rest of the mix to an airtight container for storage and keep it in the pantry or cupboard.


This dry pancake mix will be good for the next three months., Measure the butter into a small bowl. Melt it in the microwave by cooking it in 30-second increments and stirring in between. You can also transfer the butter to a small saucepan and melt it over medium heat.


When the butter has melted, set it aside to cool a bit so it doesn’t cook the eggs when you combine all the wet ingredients., Another important element in making fluffy pancakes is whipping air into the egg whites like you would when making meringue. Put the egg whites into a medium bowl and whisk or beat them with a hand mixer.Continue beating the eggs for four or five minutes, until they form stiff peaks.

, Pour the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream into a large bowl and whisk to fully incorporate. Then drizzle in the cooled melted butter and whisk to combine.


You can substitute more buttermilk instead of the sour cream. However, it’s important to use buttermilk rather than milk in this recipe, because the acidity in it will activate the baking soda., Pour the egg whites into the bowl with the other wet ingredients. Gently fold the eggs into the wet ingredients with the rubber spatula, and stop when everything is just combined.


You don’t want to overmix the wet ingredients at this point, because you could pop the air bubbles that are fluffing up the egg whites.

, Use a spoon or your fist to make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the center of the well. Use the rubber spatula to fold the wet and dry ingredients together.Stop when everything is just combined. Some small lumps in the batter is perfectly acceptable.
Overmixing the batter will develop the gluten, and this will result in pancakes that are chewy and tough, rather than light and airy., As soon as the batter is ready, place a griddle over medium heat. As it preheats, use the pastry brush to brush the surface with just enough oil to coat the pan with a thin layer of oil.


Drop a pea-sized dollop of batter into the oil. When it starts to sizzle and cook in three or four minutes, the pan is ready for the pancakes.
If you don’t have a griddle, you can use a wide, heavy-bottomed pan instead. This will prevent the pancakes from burning, and make them easier to flip.Don’t cook your pancakes in butter, because the smoke point of butter is too low, meaning it will burn when you're cooking pancakes over medium heat.

, When the pan is hot and ready, use the ¼ measuring cup to scoop a cupful of batter.Pour the batter into the griddle. As the batter hits the griddle, it will expand into a round pancake shape.


Depending on the size of your griddle, you may be able to cook between two and four pancakes at a time.

, Once you pour the batter, do not touch the pancakes until it’s time to flip. Watch the pancakes as they cook, and wait for bubbles to start forming on the surface of the batter. When those bubbles start to pop and make holes in the batter after about two minutes, the pancakes are ready to be flipped.Flip the pancakes and cook them for another two minutes.
When the first batch of pancakes is ready, remove them from the griddle and pour more pancakes. The batter must be used immediately, and if you wait to cook the pancakes, they will be dense instead of fluffy.Although you cannot store the batter for later use, you can refrigerate cooked pancakes for a couple days if you have leftovers.

, Because you can't make all the pancakes at once, you can keep the cooked ones warm while you cook the rest by placing them in a warm oven. This way, you can still serve all the pancakes at the same time.


Transfer the cooked pancakes to a foil-lined baking sheet or an oven-safe dish. Cover them loosely with foil to keep them from drying out.
Transfer the dish to a 200 F (93 C) oven to keep the cooked pancakes warm while you finish cooking the remaining batches., Everybody likes pancakes served a different way, and there's no right or wrong way to dress and eat a stack of pancakes! Some of the more popular ways include any mixture of the following:Spread a small dollop of butter onto each pancake
Sprinkle cinnamon on top of the stack
Smother the pancakes with maple syrup, corn syrup, honey, or another liquid sweetener
Sprinkle nuts or berries on top
Add a swirl of whipped cream to the top of the stack

, Cooking utensils made from plastic have the potential to melt, or break down slightly into your food when cooking.

, Examples of common storage containers you should replace are clear plastic wrap, plastic sandwich bags, and plastic leftover containers.

, When you slice into items on the cutting board, plastic remnants from the cutting board have the potential to enter and contaminate your food. Glass cutting boards are also a safe alternative to plastic, but can cause your knives to dull at a faster pace. Wood cutting boards are great as well but must be properly sterilized after use.

, Water filters can turn your tap water into healthier water that is free of pollutants and other chemicals, and can help you save the money you normally spend on bottled water.

, A variety of manufacturers also develop BPA-free plastic water bottles for on-the-go convenience.

, The plastic that resides in containers and wrappers may already have contaminated your food before you purchased it.


Bring your own reusable grocery bags if your supermarket does not contain BPA-free plastic bags or containers for produce items. Reusable grocery bags are a green alternative that can lower the risk of your food becoming contaminated by plastic bags.

, Although non-stick coating can make your cooking experience relatively easier, the chemicals present in non-stick coating have been found to cause adverse health effects. Well seasoned cast iron is a great replacement for non-stick skillets.

,
Grab a spread, or filling to put across one side of your pancake.

,
Spread the chosen filling across the pancake, covering the entire circle.

,
Roll the hot pancake up, using a knife and fork.

,
Whilst rolling up, a good idea is to spread excess spread/filling across the area of pancake you are folding up.

,
Once you are finished rolling up, cut the pancake into roughly five or six pieces.

,
To add extra detail, you could sprinkle some icing sugar on top, or add some strawberries on the side to compliment the filling.

First, you must rinse any food residue out of your slow cooker with warm water. If there are any large chunks of food attached to your slow cooker, scrape them away as you rinse., Now it is time for you to gather your self-cleaning ingredients. You are going to need white vinegar, baking soda, and a ½ cup (120 ml) measuring cup., Finally, prepare your slow cooker by filling it with warm water. If there is a line of food residue, be sure to fill your slow cooker above this line., Now that you’ve done a bit of prep work, it is time to let your slow cooker clean itself. Begin this process by adding 1 cup (240 ml) of distilled white vinegar for a 6 quart slow cooker (or ½ cup for a 3 quart) to the warm water in your slow cooker., Next, add your baking soda. It is important to add this very slowly! Add a little bit at a time, let the bubbles die down, and then add a bit more. You will add a total of 1 cup (240 ml) for a 6 quart slow cooker (or ½ cup for a 3 quart). In other words, you will add equal parts vinegar and baking soda.Vinegar and baking soda are naturally abrasive, so these products make excellent cleansers.

, Now, close the lid, plug in your slow cooker, and set it to its lowest setting. (If your slow cooker has only one setting, that is fine.) Avoid using the ""high"" setting, as this can cause the vinegar and baking soda to bubble over., Leave your slow cooker to self-clean for at least three (or up to eight) hours. If your slow cooker has lots of built up grime, it is a good idea to leave it overnight., After a few hours (or as long as overnight), turn off and unplug your slow cooker. Be careful, as it will be very hot. Allow your slow cooker to cool down for 30-45 minutes., Once your slow cooker has cooled, carefully empty the liquid into the sink. Now rinse your slow cooker with warm water once again., After this self-cleaning process, any gunk and food residue should easily wipe clean. Use a sponge and hot soapy water to remove any final traces of food and/or vinegar and baking soda. After this, your slow cooker is ready to use!"

Flip the pancakes over and continue cooking on the other side.,
Remove the pancakes from the heat when they’re golden brown.,
Serve with your favorite toppings.",How to Make Fast and Easy Pancakes," In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 2 teaspoons sugar and a pinch of salt. Stir the dry ingredients together until they’re evenly distributed. Use the bottom of a spoon or ladle to press a small well into the center of the dry mix to make mixing in the other ingredients easier.Baking powder is optional, but will produce fluffier pancakes that rise better during the cooking process.;
, Crack one egg into the well you made in the dry ingredients. Pour roughly ¾ cup of milk into the well. Stir the the egg and milk into the dry ingredients, making sure to beat the egg. For a thicker batter, use slightly less milk.Add the milk slowly and gradually while you stir. If the batter comes out thicker than you like, you can always add another ounce. If you use too much, however, you’ll have to add more flour, which will throw the recipe off.
Some people also like to add about a teaspoon of oil to the batter itself. This can help the ingredients hold together better once they’ve been mixed.

, Whisk the ingredients together vigorously until it becomes a batter. Try to break up as many of the lumps of flour and baking powder as you can. The batter should be smooth and have a thick, creamy consistency when it’s done.Be careful not to overmix your batter. This can make the pancakes slightly tough and rubbery after they’re cooked., Set a timer for 3-5 minutes and give the batter time to rest. As it sits, it will continue to set up and thicken. Stir the batter occasionally to eliminate air bubbles. While you’re letting the batter rest, you can begin preparing your cooking surface.Resting the batter gives the starches time to relax after whisking them together so that the pancake will turn out light and fluffy.
This is a good time to add other ingredients to your pancake batter, such as chocolate chips, blueberries, coconut, etc.

, Find a surface to cook your pancakes on. Choose a griddle or skillet that is flat and large enough to cook several pancakes at once. Place the skillet on the cooktop and have the batter and the rest of your ingredients close by.If the cooking surface you’re using isn’t very large, you’ll either have to make smaller pancakes or cook fewer at a time.
Avoid saute-style pans with sloped edges. These can mess up the shape of the pancake and leave you with no room to flip them., Let the cooktop begin to warm up the skillet or griddle. It’s essential to bring the cooking surface to the right temperature. If it’s too hot, the pancake batter is likely to burn, while if it’s not hot enough it can take much longer to cook and may leave the pancakes spongy in the middle even when they appear done on the outside.The cooking surface will grow hotter the longer it’s exposed to direct heat, so it’s a good idea to turn it down a little after your first round of pancakes are done.

, Pour about 2 tablespoons of canola oil into the skillet, or use 2-3 tablespoons of butter, or a combination of the two. Heat the oil or let the butter melt in the skillet, making sure to coat the entire cooking surface. Wait until just before the butter or oil begins to sizzle before adding the pancake batter.If you’re using oil to cook pancakes, canola or vegetable oil will work best, as they’ll lubricate the skillet and cook the pancakes evenly without influencing their flavor.
Cooking with butter is fine, but it can give the pancakes a denser, crispier outer texture once it cooks in. Wipe out the pan and add new butter after each batch to keep from burning it., Use a deep ladle to pour the pancake batter onto the hot cooking surface. Aim to make each pancake 3-4 inches in diameter. On a large enough cooking surface, you’ll be able to cook up to 4 pancakes at a time. Keep the edges of the batter separated so the pancakes don’t stick together.Keep the pancakes compact. Pancakes that are too big will be difficult to flip.
Don’t use too much batter for a single pancake, or the outside will get done while the inside is still goopy.

, Depending on the heat of the skillet and the size of the pancakes, they’ll need to cook for somewhere between 30 seconds and a minute on each side. Once bubbles begin to form in the wet batter on the top of the pancake, it’s time to turn them over. Look for the edges to solidify and brown ever so slightly before flipping them.Bubbles indicate that the first side of the pancake is done and that heat is trying to escape through the other side.Slide your spatula under each pancake after they’ve been cooking for a few moments to make sure they don’t stick to the skillet.

, Flip each pancake over with a spatula. Let the pancakes cook for another 20-30 seconds on the opposite side. Because they’ve already been partially cooked through, they won’t take long to get done after you flip them. Keep an eye on the underside of the pancakes to make sure they don’t burn.Flip the pancakes over in one fluid motion to prevent breaking them or making a mess.After flipping the pancakes, lift up one edge and peek at the bottom to gauge their progress.

, Once both sides are a nice golden brown, take them out of the skillet and divvy them up amongst your hungry eaters. Start a second batch to use up whatever batter you have left over. If necessary, add a little more butter or oil to the skillet. Otherwise, the outside of the pancakes will be more likely to burn.Some people may like their pancakes slightly more brown or a little undercooked. Cook the pancakes until they’re done enough to suit your tastes.

, Stack your pancakes high and top them with a square of butter or a drizzle of maple syrup or honey. You could also choose to add whipped cream, fresh fruit, nuts, jam, chocolate chips or even crushed candy pieces. Pancakes are a fun, easy morning treat that can be customized to even the pickiest eater’s liking.Give your pancakes a delicious theme, pairing classic fruit combinations like strawberry and banana, or make their flavor profiles more complex with additives like cinnamon, coconut or lemon zest.
There are no rules. Almost anything can go on a steaming hot stack of pancakes!

",How to Use a Waffle Maker," You can go from scratch but that is going to take some time to mix all the ingredients together and probably will be more expensive. You can add cinnamon, vanilla or almond extract for some flavor. Maybe chili powder if you want some heat in your breakfast. You can add a little bit of oil so that your waffles cook crisp, golden brown and release from the iron easier.;
, Once the ingredients are mixed, it's time to heat up your waffle iron. Put the iron on a flat surface that won't have it slide around too badly. Make sure that it is away from the sink or water. Put a paper towel or a plate under the waffle iron in case of leaking batter.

, On the inside of the waffle iron's clam shell design will be our cooking surface. The black portion is a Teflon, non-stick coating so that you can easily remove your waffles. Now this is important! Be careful not to scratch this coating off because your waffles will stick to the iron and flakes of Teflon could get in your food and make you ill (and not the cool kind of ""ill"").

, Even though the waffle iron is non-stick, it is a good idea to grease it with some spray oil. Just a light coating should do the trick. Now, close up the clam shell and plug that bad boy in! If your iron has a light or so on it, you'll see it turn on when you plug it in. The light will either turn off after a bit or turn on depending on the model. This is the indication that the iron is hot and ready to go. Warning, don't touch the cooking surface with your hands or the metal coil that is located in the back of the unit. These are very hot and you can burn your self.

, After the indicator light turns off or on, or say a few minutes have elapsed since you plugged the unit in, open up the clam shell of the waffle iron. Take your mix and slowly pour it in the middle so that you cover half of the lower or nearest cooking surface. Put your mix aside and close the clam shell. You'll have some steam coming out the side and you will probably see the iron's top raise some from expansion of gas inside the batter. The indicator light may turn off/on directly after closing the clam shell.

, Your waffle will be ready when either the indicator light on the unit turns back on or off. Keep an eye on the side of the unit. Too much batter in the iron will leak out the side, but that's what the plate/paper towel is for. If your waffle iron doesn't have a light on it, but you can see the waffle peaking out some from the side, look for it to turn less batter like and more like cake. This means your waffle's top and bottom is golden brown and ready for removal.

, If it isn't fully cooked close the lid and wait a minute. When the waffle appears golden and crisp, gently remove it, trying not to scratch the Teflon coating of the iron. Close the clam shell lid on the iron and plate that delectable waffle. Butter it and smoother it with syrup, enjoy the goodness of its goodness. If you have more batter, cook that up or cover and put in the fridge for tomorrow. You may wonder why we are eating the first waffle before waiting for the others to finish. That's because usually the first waffle will be cold before the second comes off the iron. Might as well enjoy them hot while you can.

, When you are all done cooking, unplug the waffle iron and open up the clam shell to let it cool down. Enjoy the waffles you made. Once the unit is cool and you are full, grab yourself a washcloth or paper towel and wipe down the Teflon cooking surface, make sure to get all sides, top/bottom to prevent gross, charred build up impressed into your next batch of waffles. Wipe the sides off of excess batter spillage and store the unit away.

Try regular sandwich bread.,
Try out a denser loaf.,
Choose pre-sliced bread, if it's available.,
Save old or stale bread for toast.",How to Make Toast1," Whether white, wheat, or rye, traditional soft sandwich bread makes excellent toast. It's always pre-sliced and results in a uniform toast that's perfect for making crunchy sandwiches or as a side to breakfast dishes.


Soft white breads and other sandwich loaves tend to toast much more quickly than more hearty breads. Watch these kinds of bread closely to make sure they won't burn.;
, If basic old white toast doesn't do it for you, try working with a denser crusty bread that'll yield a chewier toast with a crispy edge. Head to your local bakery and look for round loaves you can slice yourself and toast up to see what's good. Consider:


French loaves or baguettes
raisin loaves
challah
nine-grain or multi-grain breads
brown bread

, Because it's difficult to slice bread uniformly, toast is most easily made with pre-sliced bread you can get at the store. Even if you're buying bread at the bakery, you can usually have them machine-slice your loaf before wrapping it up for you.


If you can't get bread that's machine-sliced, slice your own bread using a 'bread' knife. Aim for about 3/4 of an inch thick, slices that will be nice and thick but will also fit in the toast slots.

, If bread becomes too stale to use for sandwiches, don't throw it out. Toast it up! Throwing old bread in the toaster revitalizes it, and might have even been the catalyst for toast in the first place.


Toast was likely invented in ancient Egypt, where pyramid-builders were often paid in bread that would remain left outdoors for long periods of time, becoming stale. To make the bread more palatable, it was livened up a bit over open fires, making the first toasted bread."

, This step is optional but if you like it sweet, spread on a little honey or maple syrup. If you do add either sweetener, spread it on all over the toast to improve the flavor.

Carefully put your slices of bread into the bread slots of the toaster.,
Choose the setting for the darkness of the toast.,
Push down the button to toast the bread.",How to Make Toast2," Trim off excess bread on the ends if the slices are too big to fit in the slots. Make sure the sides of the toast aren't rubbing against the heat coils.









If you cram it in, the ends are going to burn and stink up the kitchen. Make sure the slices aren't too thick or too wide.

, Depending on the type and thickness of the bread, and on how brown or crunchy you want it, set the knob higher or lower. If you are unsure, put on a low setting and if necessary after, repeat at a higher setting.









Toasters, especially cheap ones, are often unreliable in the ""darkness"" knob department. Many people complain that even at the highest setting, you need to toast multiple times. It's best to start it light to make sure you don't burn the toast, then increase if you need to toast it a second time.

, Keep an eye on the toaster to make sure it doesn't burn, then carefully remove the hot toast from the toaster after it pops up when it completes the cycle.

Put the slices of bread flat on the oven rack.,
Turn on the broiler of the oven, or set the heat on the toaster oven.,
Use tongs to flip the bread over half-way through the toasting.,
Remove the toast from the oven.",How to Make Toast3," The best way to evenly toast bread is in a convection oven or toaster oven. You can place the slices of bread on a baking sheet or pan, or you can place them directly on the rack.









Move the oven rack to the highest possible position in the oven to make toast. It's most efficient to use a high heat setting for a quick amount of time, preferably the broiler, which will use less energy by moving the toast closer to the heat source.

, The broiler, which heats the top of the oven only, is the quickest way to make toast. The only problem is that it can also burn quickly, so once you've set your desired temperature, you need to watch the bread closely so it doesn't burn.


If you have a gas stove, you'll likely have a separate broiler, which you can use to make toast. The only difference is that it'll be in a different location, probably below the main oven compartment, or on top of the range.
In most toaster ovens, you can set a timer that will turn off the oven at the appropriate time. It's still a good idea to watch it closely if you don't know your oven well.

, If you've got your bread on a rack, or you're using a broiler, the side facing up is going to toast, but the side facing down will still be soft. When you see the top start to brown, flip the bread over to toast the other side.








, Again, the broiler can quickly burn the toast, so remove it as soon as it looks nicely crisp and brown. It'll be black in another minute.

Put bread flat in a skillet.,
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.,
Flip the bread over periodically.",How to Make Toast4," The best, most even toasting that you can do on the skillet comes from a cast-iron skillet, with no butter or oil to grease it. Just put your bread into the pan dry and let the heat toast the bread.








Adding the butter before it's even toasted? Why not. You can fry your toast in a little butter or oil to crisp it up and give it a golden crust. This is sometimes called ""Texas toast,"" and it's delicious.

, When your bread is in, simply heat the skillet and toast it in the pan. The first side will take a bit longer while the pan heats up, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on it so you don't burn the bread.

, Using tongs or a turner, flip your bread over when the underside is done and start toasting the other side. You might as well turn them regularly to make sure you're getting an even crunch on both sides of the bread.

Heat a grill rack over an open flame.,
Place bread slices or buns directly on the grill rack.,
Turn the bread over frequently.,
Go super-primitive.,
Try out a ""pudgy-pie"" maker.",How to Make Toast5," One of the most under-appreciated and completely delicious ways to enjoy a slice of toast is by throwing some bread or buns on the grill and letting the heat and smoke crisp them up. Try this after grilling burgers, or bratwursts to pick up any meat juices left on the rack, or liven up your next campfire breakfast with smoky toast.If you're using a campsite grill rack, try to clean it up first by scraping it with a spatula or a knife. They can be kind of rusty and stuck with gunk. Let it heat some in the fire to cleanse it, and then scrape off any carbon bits left on.

, You can drizzle a little olive oil onto slices of hearty French bread to get a nice crunch going, or you can just place bread directly onto the rack. Keep a close watch, because it'll toast up very quickly.


Leave the lid off the grill. It'll happen too fast to worry about conserving the heat. If you're over a fire-pit, stand close by and watch the toast. It'll be burned by an extra couple of seconds.

, Toast over the grill can burn or even catch fire very quickly, so it's a good idea to keep it rotating from side to side, as you would a marshmallow. If it gets a little scorched, try not to worry too much.









It's difficult to get bread truly ""toasted"" over the fire, but that smoky scorching is a delicious alternative that's just as good.

, The early Romans made toast by laying out slices of bread on hot rocks close to the fire. It doesn't get any more simple than that. Lay out some bread on a rock and howl at the moon on your next camping trip., The old camp classic is perfect for making toast or grilled sandwiches over an open fire. Basically, a pudgy-pie maker is a metal clamp with long handles that you can use to toast bread over a fire with.









Butter or oil both inside surfaces of the metal, then place your slices of bread (plain white bread usually works best) inside the maker and clamp it closed. Hold over the fire for a few minutes on each side and check it periodically to make sure it's not burning. Enjoy hot.
Making a grape jelly sandwich in the pudgy-pie maker over an open fire is a camp luxury you owe yourself. Like, now.

Take care of business with a Fried Elvis.",How to Make Toast6," Traditionally, at old diners, the cooks would slice dry toast (without butter) in half vertically, and would slice buttered toast on the diagonal, so that the waitresses would could differentiate between them quickly and easily. Plus, everybody knows diagonally-cut toast tastes better, right?









The club sandwich is cut diagonally twice, while toast sticks--slice in several vertical strips, are commonly served with a soft-boiled egg, to make for easy dipping. Mix it up. Cut your toast however you most like to eat it.

, When you've got a perfectly-crispy slice of toast straight from the toaster, it makes a great vehicle for toppings. While you can obviously put anything on your toast you like, there are some classics. Common toast-topping options include:

Nutella
eggs, fried or scrambled

, It's hard to think of something more comforting and delicious to eat for a snack than toast with cinnamon and sugar-sweetened butter. To mix up this delicious topping for your toast, thoroughly combine the following ingredients in a small cup or bowl, and spread onto toasted bread:


1/2 tablespoon of butter, soft
1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, ground
1 teaspoon granulated sugar

, Great for a side to lunch or a snack in and of itself, a toasted cheese or a cheese toast is a simple slice of bread topped with melted cheese. Made traditionally with cheddar, you can use any cheese you like. To make it, the oven is your best bet.


Toast the bread on one side and remove from the oven. Top the untested side with slices of your favorite kind of cheese, or a shredded variety.
Return the bread to the oven so the bread continues toasting on the top side, melting the cheese at the same time. Remove from the oven when the cheese is bubbly and the toast is brown.

, While it may sound strange to the uninitiated, savory gravies are often used to top beans in English cuisine, for breakfast or snack.


Sautéed mushrooms make an excellent side to steaks or chops, especially when topping a slice of grilled toast.
Beans on toast is a staple of the full English breakfast, featuring a basic slice of toast with baked beans on top.
Creamed chipped beef on toast is Midwestern cooking at its finest, and a Military staple commonly referred to with a crude bathroom epithet (Hint: something on a shingle). Think of it as a poor man's biscuits and gravy.

, In his later years, legend has it, the singer favored nothing so much as an enormous white-bread peanut butter, banana, grape jelly, and bacon sandwich, fried up in bacon grease. You think toast is good? Try frying it in bacon grease and topping it with that mess. You're in Fat-Elvis heaven. To make the sandwich:


Fry up a few slices of bacon in a skillet, reserving the grease. Remove the bacon and make a peanut butter sandwich on white bread, topping it with the bacon and a generous portion of sliced banana and your favorite jelly.
Return the whole sandwich into the skillet with the grease in it, frying it evenly on both sides and heating it throughout. When the bread becomes toasty and golden, it's ready to eat. Be sure to use a napkin.

If you use unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt to the pan to add more flavor.;
, A quick browning for a minute on each sides makes the toast extra rich and delicious.If you prefer to keep the middle of the bread soft, you can skip this entire pre-cook step., A spread of mustard or pinch of cayenne adds a kick of heat.

In a regular oven, the ""broil"" setting is worth a try if it's located at the top of your oven, but the high heat can turn the cheese rubbery.Here are your options:









Oven (normal bake): Preheat to 250ºC (480ºF).
Oven (overhead broil): Do not preheat. Move the oven rack to the lowest position to reduce heat.
Toaster oven: Do not preheat. If there's a temperature control, set it to 250ºC (480ºF).

, Any white bread will do. Thick slices are another barrier against burning, but pre-sliced grocery store bread works fine.








, This step is essential to make the toast golden brown and slightly moist., Cook until the butter has melted and the bread is just starting to turn brown. This takes about 2–3 minutes. Remove it from the oven., Select a strong-tasting cheese, such as a sharp cheddar. Use a cheese slicer to make several thin slices. Lay them on the buttered bread, overlapping slightly. Cover every inch of the bread to make delicious bubbling cheese hat, instead of a layer of charcoal.








Grated parmesan works well too.

, Return the bread to the oven. Watch it like a hawk until the cheese has completely melted and started to get bubbling, brown patches. This takes another 3–5 minutes or so, but even one minute too long can turn it black.









This may only take 1–2 minutes if using a powerful broiler.

Just make sure you steer clear of additives that are off-limits if you're kosher.Substitute English muffins for matzo toast when whipping up a classic Eggs Benedict.Use matzo to create a quick low-carb version of French toast or biscuits and gravy.

, For a more inventive take on the traditional treat, experiment with salty, fatty flavors. Top each piece with cheese, cucumbers, lox or fresh herbs like dill or scallions. These types of items will make for a more filling matzo suited for lunchtime.Go easy on the salty toppings if you already salted the matzo when it first came out of the oven.
Since matzo toast is so brittle, eating it open-faced will be the easiest way to go.

, A couple squares of matzo covered in creamy nut butter, granola or fruit slices can make the perfect midday pick-me-up. It could just as easily serve as an alternative to chips with your hummus. Think of the flatbread as a vessel for exploring new ways to enjoy your favorite foods.Matzo has a very mild taste, so get as imaginative as you want when choosing toppings and ingredients you think will pair well from a textural standpoint.

, If you have a sweet tooth, you could even turn your matzo toast into a special indulgent treat. Sandwich the crisp bread with toasted marshmallows and chocolate like s’mores, or knead the raw dough together with cinnamon and brown sugar and bake to make irresistible pull-apart monkey bread. The thin, dense wafers lend themselves perfectly for an after-dinner nibble.It may help to soften the bread with a little water or milk to get it to cooperate in different dessert recipes.Use matzo dough in place of yeasty ingredients so you can enjoy your favorite confections during Passover.

, Add two cups (140g) of flour to the bowl, then gradually pour in one cup (240ml) of water. Stir the mixture slowly with a spatula until it begins to thicken into a sticky dough. Continue mixing the matzo dough into one large ball.If the dough seems overly gluey, stir in more flour one or two teaspoons at a time as needed.
Remember to use cold water. Warm or tepid water may cause the dough to take on a strange consistency.

, Dust your work surface and both hands with a light coating of flour. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and knead it by stretching it out and folding it over on itself repeatedly. Work quickly—as you handle the dough, the flour will begin to break down, eventually causing it to ferment and rise.Try not to knead the dough for longer than about one minute. You’ll be working against the clock to an extent to keep the bread from leavening.If you’re preparing a large batch, ask for help kneading and rolling the dough.

, Cut the kneaded dough ball in half using a dough cutter, or simply pull it apart with your hands. Stretch and knead these smaller sections, then repeat this process two more times so that you end up with eight pieces. Sprinkle a little more flour onto your work surface, then smooth the dough balls flat with a rolling pin.Each of the finished pieces should be 6-8 inches in diameter and rolled as thinly as possible.
After rolling out the matzo, perforate the dough with a fork to prevent air from becoming trapped in it., Matzo needs to be baked at a high temperature to keep it from expanding. Go ahead and begin preheating the oven a little ahead of time so that it will be sufficiently hot by the time you’re ready to pop in the dough.Set the oven to convection heat to ensure that it stays a consistent temperature throughout.

, Use both hands to peel the matzo off the work surface. The dough will be very thin, so transfer it carefully to avoid tearing it. Fit as many pieces onto the baking sheet as you can, making sure the edges don’t overlap.To achieve an ideal texture, try baking on a pizza stone. This will help absorb excess moisture from the dough, resulting in crispier bread.You may need to put the matzo through the oven in rounds if you have dough leftover after the first batch.

, Slide the matzo into the oven on the upper rack nearest the heat source. It won’t take long for the bread to begin browning, so keep a close eye on it. At around the two minute mark, take the baking sheet out of the oven, flip over each piece and bake for another 1-2 minutes.The matzo is done when it’s pillowy and golden-brown in the center with dark edges.Be careful not to let it burn. The thin dough cooks through very quickly, and will likely only require about half as much time on the second side.

, Once the matzo is ready to come out of the oven, brush it with a light coating of olive oil, then sprinkle it with kosher salt and let it cool before eating or storing. You can also drizzle it with honey or a mixture of yogurt and water for a softer, sweeter finish.You can also infuse the bread with more potent flavors like shallots and roasted garlic while it’s still hot from the oven.Adding spices and other flavorings to matzo dough prior to baking is not consistent with kosher laws. Keep this in mind when seasoning the bread.

, Using a sharp knife, cut the crusts off of all four sides of the toast and discard. Some recipes suggest doing this step before toasting the bread, but it will be easier to cut through the bread if you remove the crust after toasting.

, Using a very sharp serrated knife, cut the width of the toast in half through the untoasted center of the bread, leaving you with two very skinny slices of full-sized toast.Be sure you are cutting through the soft center of the bread, not changing the dimensions of the bread itself.
Place your hand on top of the toast as it is laying flat on the cutting board and cut in towards the center.
Rotate the toast while you cut until you have two pieces of toast.
Be sure to do this step while the bread is still warm.

, Using your knife, cut the toasts into the size and shape you would like them to be for serving.Store-bought melba comes in squares or rectangles, but many people prefer the look of triangular toasts.
Determine the size you want based on the purpose for the toast. Small hors d’oeuvres may call for smaller toasts than toasts accompanying soup.

, Continue to toast and cut the bread until you have enough pieces for your event or the number of people you wish to serve.

, The toasts should be placed on the sheet toasted side down, with the soft untoasted side up. Leave a little space between each piece of toast so that you can get to each one with a spatula if necessary., Lightly brush the untoasted side of each piece of toast with melted butter or olive oil. For sweet toast, you may also want to consider using coconut oil for a sweeter flavor.

, Place the toasts in the oven or toaster oven on broil. Be sure to watch the toasts carefully, as they will brown quickly.If you have cut your toast into triangles, the corners may curl up. This is normal, but be sure to remove the toast before the corners burn.
You may need to rotate your baking sheet so that the toasts heat evenly.

, When the tops of the toast are golden brown and the corners have started to crisp, remove the toasts from the heat. Allow them to cool.


You may want to remove them from the cookie sheet with a spatula and let them cool on a plate or on cooling racks.
Use caution when handling hot toasts and the baking sheet. Use an oven mitt or gloves.

, You may wish to pre-top the toasts prior to an event.


Be sure not to overload each toast with too much topping. It is best to have a good bread to topping ratio.
One to three items in a stack make a nice presentation. Try combining harder items with sticky items to keep the stack together without the use of a toothpick. For example, try a soft cheese or a hummus dip topped with an olive or tomato.

, You may also want to serve the toasts with a flavorful dip.


Display the crackers nicely around the dip bowl or stack on a plate next to an individual portion of a dip.
Pair a sweet melba toast with a sweet dip or with a neutral flavor such as brie cheese.
Pair a savory melba toast with a savory dip, pate, or hummus.

, Larger pieces of melba toast make a perfect garnish for a serving of soup or salad in lieu of croutons.

, Though they are best when fresh, you can put your unused melba toasts in an airtight container and store for 3-4 days."

Pay attention to the bottom.,
Consider the size.,
Choose a material.",How to Cook With a Wok1," Woks come in a two bottom styles -- round- and flat-bottomed. Round woks are traditionally used in Chinese cooking, but they don’t work as well on Western stoves. They won’t work at all on electric ranges, and they’re difficult to cook with on a gas range too. Instead, opt for a flat-bottomed wok.If you happen to have a professional style range, such as a Viking or Wolf, you can use a traditional round-bottomed wok with a wok ring to steady it. While most consumer ranges don’t get hot enough for use with a wok ring, a professional model does.
You don’t want your wok to be too flat because it will be difficult to flip the food correctly. Choose one that has a 4- to 5-inch flattened bottom with sloping sides that flare out.;
, While woks come in a variety of sizes, a 12- to 14-inch style is usually the best option for home cooks. If you buy a wok that’s larger, it’s usually too difficult to maneuver in a small kitchen. However, you don’t want to get one that’s too small either because the pan can become too crowded so your food doesn’t cook evenly.A 12- to 14-inch wok is ideal because it provides plenty of space for your ingredients to heat evenly, as well as enough room for flipping and moving the food around when you’re stir frying.

, Woks typically come three materials: stainless steel, cast iron, and carbon steel. Avoid stainless steel options because they are very heavy, require a long time to heat and cool, and often have food stick to them. Cast iron is better, but it can be fragile and take a long time to heat. Carbon steel is the best option for a wok because it heats evenly, is durable, and doesn’t cost as much as other materials.When you’re purchasing a carbon steel wok, opt for one that is at least 14-gauge and 2-mm thick.
Don’t purchase a wok with a non-stick coating. Those types of coating aren’t designed to be used at high heat, but stir frying in a wok requires high temperatures. A carbon steel wok will become naturally non-stick over time.

"
"
Ensure your kitchen is properly ventilated.,
Wash the wok.,
Apply some type of fat.,
Allow the wok to cool.,
Repeat the process.",How to Cook With a Wok2," Seasoning your wok helps create a natural non-stick surface, so food glides easily around when you're cooking. Before you start seasoning your wok, though, it’s important to ensure that the kitchen has adequate ventilation because the process creates smoke. Open all of the windows, and turn on an exhaust fan if you have one.Make sure that there are no flammable materials near the stove while you’re seasoning the wok.

, When you first purchase it, your wok have a factory coating of oil on its surface that protects the material and prevents rust. Before you can season it, you need to wash the oil away so it doesn’t burn off during the processing. Use a steel wool scrubber, dish soap, and hot water to carefully scrub the entire surface, both inside and out the wok.After you’ve washed the wok, make sure to dry it thoroughly before moving on in the seasoning process. Place it on a burn set at low heat, and let it sit for a couple of minutes -- or until you no longer see any water droplets on its surface.

, While the wok is still warm, use a heat-proof brush, such as the kind you would use for barbecuing, to apply a thin layer of fat or oil to the entire surface of its interior. Lard is a traditional choice, but you can also use an oil with a high smoke point, such as grapeseed, canola, peanut, or palm. Once the fat has been applied, place the wok on a burner set at high heat.Avoid using sunflower oil, safflower oil, flax oil, fish oil, or margarine to coat the wok. They leave a sticky coating.
While you’re heating the wok with fat in it, make sure to rotate it on the burner so that it’s heated evenly.
You’ll usually know that you’re done heating the wok when you start to see wisps of smoke coming off the surface.

, After the fat has burned for several minutes, remove the wok from the burner and allow it to cool completely. Once it’s at room temperature, use a paper towel to wipe its entire surface and soak up an excess fat or oil., While your wok is ready to be used after you’ve completed the seasoning process, you’ll get a better cooking surface if you repeat the process several times. You’ll know that the wok is properly prepared when its interior becomes dark and shiny.You can also tell that the wok is fully seasoned when the paper towel that you wipe it down with no longer comes back with brown or black ash.
When you’re heating the oil in the wok, you can also add aromatics, such as scallions, garlic, or ginger, to help with seasoning process.

"
"
Prepare the food.,
Preheat the wok before adding oil.,
Add food in stages.,
Move food constantly.,
Return the aromatics and protein and deglaze.",How to Cook With a Wok3," Because stir frying happens so quickly, it’s a good idea to have all of your food ready to go before you start cooking. Chop and slice all of the aromatics, protein, and vegetables before heating the wok. Place them in bowls right beside the stove top, so you can reach them easily when it's time to toss them into the wok.Try to cut all of the food into the same size pieces, so they'll cook at roughly the same time. Aim for bite-size pieces.

, Before you start adding ingredients to the wok, you’ll need to heat it for several minutes on high. You’ll know that it’s sufficiently heated when you drop a bead of water into the wok and it evaporates immediately. Next, drizzle approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons of your oil of choice down the side of the wok; it may smoke slightly, but be sure to swirl the wok so the entire surface is coated with the oil.While some faint smoke is normal when you add the oil, an excessive amount indicates that you’ve overheated the wok. Let it cool off before continuing.
For stir frying, use an oil that has a high smoke point so it can withstand the high temperatures without burning. Some oils to consider are peanut, safflower, sesame, and light refined olive., You can’t toss all your stir fry ingredients into the wok at once because some take longer to cook than others and you want to layer the flavors. Start with the most intensely flavored ingredients, usually known as the aromatics, so they’ll infuse the oil. When they’re lightly browned, push them toward the edge of the wok, and cook your protein of choice in a single layer. Stir fry the protein until it’s not quite fully cooked, and then remove it and the aromatics to a bowl. Cook the vegetables next, starting with those that have the longest cooking times first and moving on to soft, leafy veggies that don’t need as much time.Garlic, ginger, onions, and chili peppers all make delicious aromatics for a stir fry dish.
For protein, you can use chicken, beef, seafood, or tofu, depending on your preferences.
When you’re adding the vegetables, start with hard, dense options, such as carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli. Add medium weight veggies next, including mushrooms, peppers, asparagus, zucchini, and celery. Finish off with soft vegetables, such as tomatoes, leafy greens, and sprouts.

, When you’re stir frying in a wok, using the right technique is key. To keep the food burning, you need to continue to move the ingredients throughout the process. Use a thin spatula to constantly roll the food over onto itself, placing it between the wok and the food to toss ingredients for even cooking.It’s best to use a metal spatula when stir frying because wooden ones are usually too thick to really fit under the food.

, Once the vegetables are tender, add the protein and aromatics back to the wok. To ensure that you get all of the intense flavors out of the wok, deglaze it with a liquid of your choice. Drizzle the liquid down the sides slowly, and then use the spatula to toss all of the ingredients together so they’re all warmed through.For deglazing, broth, stock, wine, soy sauce, or coconut milk all work well.

Fill a steamer basket or rack.,
Bring water to boil in the wok.,
Insert steamer basket or rack.",How to Cook With a Wok4," When you use your wok for steaming, you need to add a basket or rack to hold the food above the water. The concave shape of the wok makes it ideal for holding a bamboo steamer basket insert that is traditional in Chinese cooking. A metal steaming rack can work well too, though. Place the vegetables, dumplings, or other food that you’re steaming in a single layer in the basket or rack, so they’ll all be steamed evenly.The benefit to using a bamboo steamer basket is that its lid actually absorbs excess moisture inside the wok, so it doesn’t drip back down over the food and make it soggy.
If you are using a metal steaming rack, you can opt for a style that has hooks to secure it over the edge of the wok or one that has legs that will hold it above the water in the bottom of the wok.
If you’re using a bamboo basket to steam food in your wok, you should line the bottom to prevent the ingredients from sticking to it. You can use cabbage or lettuce leaves, or parchment paper to line the basket.
A bamboo steamer basket has its own lid to trap the steam, but if you’re using a metal rack, you’ll need to place the lid on top of the wok.

, Before placing the steamer basket or rack inside, you should add water to the wok and bring it to a boil. You’ll want to fill the wok with approximately 2-inches of water, though it vary depending on how large your wok is. The water level should be about halfway up to the bottom of the steamer basket or rack. Turn the heat up high to bring the water to a boil.Before you bring the water to a boil, make sure that the steamer basket or rack fits securely in the wok and isn’t going to tip over. Remove it before you boil the water, though.
The food in your steamer basket or on the rack should sit above the water, so it doesn’t get overcooked.
You don’t have to use water to steam in your wok. Any translucent, light liquid, such as broth, stock, wine, or juice, can work.

, Once the water has come to a boil, reduce the heat to keep it a simmer and place the steamer basket inside the wok. You should keep an eye on the water level because if too much water evaporates, you may need to add more to properly steam the food. Check on the food every few minutes to determine if it’s done to your liking and remove it from the basket or rack.The steam inside a wok is extremely hot, so be sure to use long-handled tongs when you’re adding and removing food to prevent burns.After using your wok for steaming, there may be a waterline across the surface. You’ll need to re-season the wok to get rid of it.

Add oil to the wok.,
Heat the oil.,
Carefully add food.,
Remove the food when its color is right.",How to Cook With a Wok5," A wok is actually an ideal pan for deep frying because its concave shape means that you don’t need as much oil and there is less chance of the oil boiling over. Two inches of oil is usually enough to deep fry in a wok, but make sure that you never fill it more than halfway.For deep frying, choose an inexpensive, flavorless oil with a high smoke point. Canola, peanut, and safflower oils are all good options. You can also use clean animal fats, such as lard or duck fat, but they tend to more costly.

, You need to ensure that your oil is at the proper temperature for frying before you add your food. The easiest way to accurately determine that the oil is hot enough is to use a thermometer. One designed specifically for deep fryers is the best option, but you can also use a candy thermometer.The proper temperature for deep frying depends on what you’re cooking. Consult your recipe to determine what the proper temperature for the oil should be.
If you don't have a thermometer on hand, you can use a wooden spoon or chopstick to test the temperature of the oil. Dip the handle of the wooden tool into the oil -- if it bubbles steadily, the oil is hot enough for deep frying. If there is particularly vigorous bubbling, though, the oil is too hot, and you should let it cool before frying your food. If few to no bubbles appear, the oil needs to heat longer., Once the oil is properly heated, you can begin to place the food into the wok. Try to ensure that all of the pieces that you add to the oil are the same size, so they’ll cook evenly. It’s also important to dry all of the food thoroughly before adding it to the oil or battering it and placing it in the oil because moisture will make the oil spatter.If you’re frying battered items, make sure to add them to the oil one at a time. Otherwise, they may stick together. Adding a bunch of food at once can also cause the oil’s temperature to drop.
To keep the food at a consistent temperature in the oil, move it around in the oil with a strainer or slotted spoon instead of just allowing it to sit.

, When you notice that your food has become a light golden brown shade, it’s likely done. Use a slotted spoon or metal strainer to remove the food from the oil, so you can scoop up several pieces at once. To keep your food from being too greasy, immediately place it on a paper towel lined plate, bowl, or tray to soak up the excess oil.Don't use plastic utensils to remove the food from the wok. Plastic can melt easily in hot oil.
The best time to season deep fried food is right after you’ve removed it from the oil. That’s because it will absorb the salt, pepper, or other seasoning more easily for deeper flavor.

Clean any crusted or built-up food from the cookware.,
Clean any burn marks from the cookware.,
Clean any water spots from the cookware.,
Cook away any serious burn marks.",How to Clean Stainless Steel Cookware1," If the pan has food crusted onto it, start by soaking it for several hours in warm, soapy water (you could also let it soak overnight). Drain the water, and then scrub vigorously with a scouring pad. This will remove most food build-up.


Do not use steel wool pads or copper-based scrubbers - although they do a good job of removing burnt-on food, they will scratch the surface of your cookware.;
, If your pan has heat damage (for example, from being left on a lit burner for too long), you may be able to clean it off using baking soda. Make sure the pan is completely dry, then sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda onto the surface. Rub the baking soda around the pan thoroughly with a dry cloth or sponge.









You can also add a little water to the baking soda to achieve a paste-like consistency.
If you're really having trouble with burn marks, try a mildly-abrasive cleaner, such as Bar Keeper's Friend. Just sprinkle a generous amount onto the bottom of your pan and add a little water to form a paste. Scrub with a wet sponge, then rinse thoroughly. Your pans will look good as new., Water spots are actually caused by the minerals in the water, not the water itself. These will occur more frequently if you live in an area that has mineral-rich water, but water spots can also result from added compounds like fluoride. If you hand dry your pans, water spots are not likely to be a problem. If they occur, swish some club soda around in each pan. Rinse them off, and then wipe them dry with a clean cloth.








Alternatively, you can try soaking the pan in vinegar, then clean as usual with a mild detergent and soft cloth.

, If the pan's burn marks cannot be scrubbed away with baking soda or soap, you can actually attempt to cook them off. Fill the pan with just enough water to cover the damage, and bring the water to a boil on the stove. Add a few spoonfuls of salt to the water, turn off the heat, and let the pan sit for several hours. Dump the water out and try scrubbing away the damage with a scouring pad. If the stains are really burnt on, you can repeat this process again.








You should only add the salt when the water is already boiling. If you add salt to cold water, it might pit the metal.
Instead of the salt, you could also try adding lemon juice or white vinegar to the pan. Another interesting option is to boil 100% tomato juice in the burnt pan. The tomato's natural acidity is supposed to help remove stains."

Cover the wok with foil.,
Add smoking ingredients and rack.,
Heat the wok.,
Add food.,
Cover the wok.",How to Cook With a Wok6," To prepare it for smoking, you must line the wok with a heavy-duty foil. Make sure that there are at least 5- to 6-inches of foil hanging over the edge of the wok -- it should be long enough that it can cover the edge of the metal rack that you’ll insert to set the food on for smoking. To ensure that the foil is secure in the wok, press it firmly into the base.Make sure that your wok is thoroughly cleaned before smoking in it. If there are any bits of food stuck to it, they’ll burn during the process.

, To give create a delicious smoky flavor, you need to add ingredients to the bottom of the wok to infuse the food. For the best results, try a mixture of tea leaves, sugar, and rice. The tea will provide a flavorful smoke, the sugar will caramelize to give the food color and sweeten it, and the rice helps to keep the set-up smoking.Depending on the food that you’re smoking, you can also add spices to your smoking ingredients. Rosemary, star anise, coriander seeds, bay leaves, garlic, mint, cinnamon sticks, and whole nutmeg are all good options. Citrus peels can also add interesting flavor.

, To get the smoke started, you need to heat up on the materials in the bottom of the wok. Turn your burner to medium-heat and it sit until you see smoke coming from the wok -- it usually takes approximately five minutes. The sugar is typically the first ingredient to burn, but the others soon follow.Make sure to work quickly after the wok starts producing smoke, so your kitchen doesn’t become filled.
Turn on your kitchen's exhaust or vent fan to help with the smoke. If you don't have a fan, it may help to open a window or two.

, Once your wok is smoking, place a metal rack above the rim of the wok -- a cooling rack works well. If you have circular rack that fits inside the wok, check that it’s at least three inches above the bottom. Set the food that you’re smoking on the rack, making sure that none of the pieces hang over the edge of the rack. The items should be spaced out, so there’s room for the smoke to circulate.Place the food on the rack as close to the center of the wok as you can. That will ensure even cooking because the edges of the rack will get hotter than the center.

, Take another piece of heavy-duty foil and place it over the top of the food to trap the smoke. To create an air-tight seal, crimp the edge of the top foil to the edge of the piece lining the bottom. It’s a good idea to wear oven mitts while sealing the foil because it can get very hot. You should heat most foods on medium heat for about 10 minutes. After you turn off the heat, allow the food to sit for another 20 minutes so the smoke has time to die down.Don’t smoke your food for too long or it may develop a bitter flavor.
Keep in mind that some foods need to be cooked with another method after smoking for best results. For example, if you smoke chicken wings, you’ll want to finish them off with broiling.

Heat the pan.,
Oil the pan.,
Place the pan back on the heat.,
Turn off the heat.,
Pour off the oil.,
Maintain the non-stick surface.",How to Clean Stainless Steel Cookware2," Heat your stainless steel pan on the burner over a medium-high heat, until the pan is very hot. This should only take about 1 to 2 minutes.







, Once the pan is very hot, take it off the burner and add a tablespoon of oil (olive, coconut, peanut - whichever you prefer) and swirl it around the pan until the fat melts.







, Continue to heat the oil until it begins to smoke. As the pan heats and the oil melts, the molecules on the surface of the stainless steel will expand and the fat from the oil will become embedded into the pan, thereby coating the pan with a non-stick surface.







, Once the pan begins to smoke, turn off the heat and allow the oil to cool completely. Once the oil has cooled and the surface of the pan becomes reflective and mirror-like, the pan has been properly seasoned.







, When the pan is seasoned, pour the cooled oil off the pan into a jar or cup. Wipe any excess oil from the surface of the pan using some paper towel.







, As long as you do not wash your pan with dish soap, the non-stick surface should last for some time. You will still need to use a little extra oil when cooking though, to prevent the existing oil from burning.








Once the surface of the pan begins to turn brown or yellow, you can re-season the pan using the same method."

Establish a regular cleaning routine.,
Clean the pans after each use.,
Wipe your pans dry by hand.,
Avoid cleaning your stainless steel cookware in the dishwasher.,
Polish your stainless steel cookware.,
Clean stainless steel knives.",How to Clean Stainless Steel Cookware3," Buying good stainless steel cookware is an investment, and it's important to protect that investment by taking care of your pots and pans. If possible, choose a stainless steel cookware set which has copper or aluminum cores or bottoms. These metals are better conductors of heat than stainless steel, so they will prevent hot spots from forming during cooking, minimizing the amount of food that sticks to the pot.







, Cleaning the pans immediately after using them prevents stains and dried-on food from building up. If your pans are unseasoned, you can wash them with dish soap and hot water and scour them lightly with a scouring pad (the kind found on double-sided sponges) if needed.









If your pans are seasoned, just rinse them out with hot water and avoid using soap. Use some tissue paper to remove excess grease, if necessary.
Never use products containing ammonia or bleach on your pans, as these interact badly with the cookware and may cause damage or discoloration. Ideally, you should use a cleaning product designed specifically for stainless steel.

, After washing them, take the time to wipe each pan dry with a clean towel. As an alternative, you can air dry them, but this will allow water spots to form.








, Even if the pans are dishwasher-safe, washing them in the dishwasher will dramatically reduce their lifespan and keep them from looking their best.









However, if you must use the dishwasher, rinse the pots with club soda as soon as you take them out and dry them with a clean, soft cloth. This will prevent water spots from forming., If you want your cookware to really shine, you can polish it with a stainless steel polish. Apply some of the polish to a clean cloth, and buff it into the cookware.









You can remove fingerprints from the outside of stainless steel pots using glass cleaner and paper towel or a soft cloth.
It is sometimes even possible to buff out small scratches on the exterior of the pots using a paste of water and a non-abrasive cleanser or baking soda.

, The best way to maintain stainless steel knives is to wipe off any excess food with a dish towel during and immediately after use. This prevents food from drying onto the knives, making it very difficult to remove.









Be sure to exercise caution when cleaning knives, in order to prevent cuts. Hold the handle of the knife, then draw the dishcloth along the length of the blade, using slow deliberate movements."

Wipe down the kettle with one of these substances, using steel wool, to remove any type of stain, including a grease stain.You can scrub your kettle with a steel wool pad with a few drops of either oven cleaner or ammonia. Scrub it the same way you would scrub metal cookware and keep scrubbing until the stains come off. Then, rinse your kettle completely to remove the cleaner.
However, never use ammonia or oven cleaner together. Some oven cleaners contain bleach, which makes a deadly gas when mixed with ammonia. Do not use ammonia if you used bleach to clean any part of the kettle, including the inside.;
, Bleach is safe to use on kettles made with enamel or porcelain. It can effectively remove a variety of stains.These types of surfaces will scratch easily, so do not use abrasive cleaners. Use a soft rag or sponge to apply a few drops of bleach to your kettle and gently wipe it down until the stain comes off. Avoid harsh scrubbing.
Make sure to use gloves when handling bleach.

But if you prefer, you could use a little dish soap on your sponge while you scrub.Avoid using an abrasive sponge, like steel wool, since this could damage any protective layers of coating that have built up on your wok.

, Once you've scrubbed away any built on food, completely rinse the wok with hot water. Look at the wok again and check for any food remnants you might have missed.Very dirty woks might need another scrub and rinse at this point.

, You'll need to remove all moisture from the wok or it could rust. To dry the wok, put your wok back on the stove over medium-low heat. Keep the wok on the heat until all the water has evaporated. Let the wok cool before you handle it again.You can rub a light coat of vegetable oil over the surface of your wok before you store it.
If your wok rusts, you'll need to scour the rust away and re-season the wok like you did before you first used the wok.

Unplug your waffle iron and allow it to cool.,
Remove excess oil with dry paper towel.,
Brush away large crumbs.,
Loosen the hardened bits with a hot cloth.,
Remove any remaining batter with a rubber spatula.,
Clean the outside of the iron with a damp cloth.",How to Clean a Waffle Iron1," Most modern electric waffle irons come with nonstick plates, and they have to be cleaned without immersing the appliance in water. You definitely don't want to burn yourself trying to clean a piping hot waffle iron. Instead, unplug it before enjoying your waffle.By the time you're finished and ready to clean, it should be cool.;
, If you have a nonstick waffle iron, you may not have used any oil. If you did, however, there maybe little puddles of grease. You can dab these up with a dry paper towel. It may be helpful to fold the paper towel into a point, so that you can push it between the ridges of the iron., Often times, there will be bits of dried batter stuck within the ridges, or even dripping over the sides if you filled the iron generously. Do a once over, brushing away those big pieces with a soft-bristled kitchen brush.It's important that the bristles really are soft, because you don't want to risk scratching the nonstick surface.

, If there is a lot of batter dried to the iron, it can be extremely annoying to loosen and scrape each one, bit by bit. Instead, soften all the batter up first. Grab a dish towel or rag and soak it with hot water from the sink. Ring it out a bit so that it isn't dripping, but still saturated. Place it on the waffle iron, and close it. Let it sit for a few minutes, so that the heat and moisture from the rag loosens up those pesky crumbs., These rubber kitchen utensils might as well have been made for cleaning a waffle iron, because they're ideal.The rubber won't scratch the surface, and it's thin and malleable enough to get in between the rows of the waffle iron. Once the dried batter has been softened by the wet rag, you should be able to use your rubber spatula to scrape the rest of the batter off.


You can also use a sponge to gently remove the loosened batter. Make sure you purchase one that is specifically for nonstick surfaces.

, Make sure that your cloth is damp, not wet.It's important that you don't accidentally get water into the electrical parts of the iron, which could cause you to get shocked next time you turn it on, or break the iron altogether. Clean everything that has batter on it, or looks dirty.

Fill a sink with hot soapy water.,
Scrub the wok.,
Rinse the wok.,
Dry the wok.",How to Clean a Wok2," You can use your usual dish washing detergent to clean a nonstick wok. Place your wok in the water and let it soak if there's a lot of food debris on the wok.The sooner you wash your wok, the easier it will be to clean. Avoid letting your wok sit for long periods of time with food remnants crusted on it.

, Use a soft sponge, scrubber, or wok brush to gently clean any food debris. Avoid using abrasive sponges, like steel wool pads, since these can destroy the nonstick coating.If you don't get the pan completely clean, a layer of oil may bake on the wok making the wok become sticky over time. To remove the sticky layer, simply scrub the wok well.

, Rinse the wok with cold water and check to make sure that you completely removed all traces of food debris. If not, wash the wok and rinse it again.

Metal spoons, tongs, or ladles can scrape the bottom and sides of the wok, scratching the nonstick surface or protective coating you've built up.Choose wooden or bamboo utensils for cooking with your wok.

, If your nonstick wok has stains that you can't simply wash away, apply a lightening paste. Combine 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water. Apply the paste to the stain while the wok is slightly warm. Let the paste sit for 1 hour. Wash the paste off with warm soapy water.Remember to dry your wok well after removing the stains and storing.

, You should always hand wash your wok right after you use it. This means you should transfer the food you've cooked onto serving plates and wash the wok. Never wash your wok in the dishwasher. The high heat of the dishwasher and the harsh detergent will ruin the nonstick coating or protective layer that you've built up.If you can't wash your wok right after using it, you should at least soak it while you eat your meal. This will make it easier to scrub up.

, Lay out a paper towel on a plate. Place the finished bacon on the paper towel to remove extra grease. Let this cool off as you go on to cook the eggs.


Do not pour the grease down the sink! This could wreck your plumbing. Instead, allow the grease to cool, it will become cloudy and eventually solid. Scoop it out with a spoon and throw it in the trash or reuse it for cooking., You'll need eggs, milk or heavy cream, salt and pepper, and grease of your choice. You can also assemble an array of spices if you want like: cream of tartar, oregano, or cayenne powder.

, There are two ways you can prepare scrambled eggs: 1) in a bowl or 2) in the pan. In a bowl you have more control over how scrambled your eggs are and you can add in spices before cooking. Add a dollop of heavy cream into your bowl if you choose creamier eggs.


Any kind of bowl that you'd eat out of will do, it all depends on how many eggs you're making. If you're cooking for a crowd, use a mixing bowl., Next you're going to pop the yolks if you left them in and whisk them until they're blended with the whites. You can use a fork for this. If you like seeing the whites in your finished product, then whisk less. Some people like to fluff up their eggs by adding a bit of milk at this point, which is fine, but you do loose a bit of the egg flavor in lieu of creamier eggs. If you do add milk, the ratio is about 1.5 oz (~43 mL) for each egg, erring on the side of less milk is better., You'll want to heat the pan a little before you throw the eggs on, just enough to feel the heat directly above the pan. Half way between low and medium heat should be good to heat the pan. If you're using oil, pour about an ounce in then tilt the pan to coat the bottom. If you're using butter (salt or unsalted), place enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Oil is better for nonstick pans, but butter will give your eggs better flavor.


To turn up the technique and flavor, use the bacon grease. This could be the easiest method by cooking the eggs directly into the pan you cooked the bacon in., Next you'll pour the whisked eggs onto the pan. Be careful not to overfill your pan. The eggs should cover just the bottom of the pan. If you do overfill, though, it'll just take longer to scramble your eggs and will increase the chance of them sticking to the pan.


Use the spatula to push the eggs about as they cook. They should start to bunch together and begin looking more like scrambled eggs as you cook them.
If you like your eggs closer to over-easy, then remove them before they're completely solid, but after they've began to bunch together.
If you like your eggs harder (more cooked), then continue to push them around until there's no raw egg left in the pan.
You can adjust the heat as you cook if it looks like the eggs are cooking too fast or slow, but you probably won't need anything over medium heat. Be careful of burning, though! If you let any of the eggs sit around too long, they'll get stuck to the pan., Add a pinch of salt and pepper if you want your eggs to have a little extra flavor. You can also add other spices like oregano or ground pepper. Add a little bit of cream at the end if needed. This will make the eggs richer in taste and texture., After each has been cooked to your desire, place the bacon and eggs on a plate. The simple combination of the two will flatter anyone for a great breakfast.

, For an extra kick, shred a bit of your favorite cheese. You could use a sharp cheddar or even something like pepper jack. Sprinkle the cheese of your choice onto the eggs right after they've been plated.

, This is a standard for greasy spoon type restaurants. Toast two slices of white bread. Once they're done, halve both slices. Then butter each piece. Place the four slices on the plate with the eggs and bacon., Sandwich is a great way to combine all of this for a meal on the go. Simply acquire all the finished products and place in between two slices of bread. You can either toast the bread or keep it plain., Condiments go a long way for every meal. It all depends on your personal preference. You could use any of the following to your plate for extra flavor:


Ketchup
Hot sauce
Mustard
Mayonnaise"

",How to Make Pork and Herb Breakfast Sausages," There are a number of types available, here are a couple.


Hand Cranked Grinders. These are the cheapest, and are usually pretty sturdy apparatuses, but they require the user to turn the crank, which in turn spins an auger that feeds the meat into the cutter wheel. They commonly clamp to a table top, to free the user's hands up for other parts of the process. Usually can be completely disassembled for cleaning and blade replacement.
Stand-alone power grinders. These an electrically operated units which are plugged in to the outlet, and do the work for you.
Mixer attachment grinders. These are grinders which attach to the power head of large kitchen mixers like Hobart and KitchenAid products. They are very similar to hand type grinders, with a coupling to connect to the mixer, rather than a crank handle.;
, Since ""perfect"" sausage, or almost anything else, is an individual taste, the choice is up to the preparer, but here we will look at a common recipe for a mild, basic sausage. These are common meats for sausage preparation:


Boston Butt pork roast.
Pork shoulder.

,,, If you open a jar of sage, and do not smell the pungent aroma immediately, either it is stale, or your nose is not working. These are some common spices and seasonings for a breakfast type sausage. The quantity should be appropriate to combine with 2 pounds of fresh meat.

, If you are using a table mounted hand grinder, you may want to place a chair underneath to set your bowl on.

, You will want to add the seasoning as you process the meat, since it is difficult to mix in thoroughly when the grinding is complete.

, Some grinders come with a ""pestle"" like wooded dowel for this, but in any case, never use your fingers to force the meat into the grinder's feed auger.

, If it is too coarse for your taste, you may have to run it through the grinder, or change to a smaller grinding blade. Some grinders come with a variety of blades, and the smaller the holes in the blade, the finer it will grind the meat.

, Feel for chunks of meat or tough tissues that did not grind well, and remove them to either discard or regrind.

, To store, you can layer the finished patties between sheets of wax paper, and either place in sealable freezer bags, or put in an airtight plastic container.

,, You may experiment using some brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, pieces of fruits like apple or pear, or any of a host of other ingredients.

Cut the potatoes into half inch cubes (1.5cm).",How to Make Home Fries (Breakfast Potatoes)1," If you cut them much larger it takes longer to cook them than the instructions written here are designed for, and they may not cook all the way through.


Another popular way to prepare them is to slice them into wedges. This technique works best with small, redskin potatoes.






There is no need to peel the potatoes, but you may do so if you like.





;

"
Get a pot of water to a rolling boil while you cut the potatoes.,
Add the potatoes to the boiling water.,
Boil the potatoes for no more than four to five minutes.,
While the potatoes are boiling, get a deep skillet (frying pan).",How to Make Home Fries (Breakfast Potatoes)2," Make sure not to fill it to the top so the water doesn’t spill over when you add the cut potatoes.

, Scrape the potatoes off a cutting board using a knife. Add the potatoes slowly and carefully so the boiling water does not splash you. It’s best to wear a mitten-style potholder just in case.

, You are essentially partially cooking them here, but not all the way through. Any longer than five minutes, and you will overcook them before they are fried. If your cubes are very small, do not boil them for longer than three minutes.

, Use a cast-iron or non-stick pan and add the oil. Any of the following oils will do just fine: peanut oil, canola oil, sunflower seed oil, or just plain vegetable oil. Olive oil will work but is generally not the best of oil for frying.


The amount of oil you use depends on the size of the pan you are using and how large a recipe you are making. A good rule of thumb is about a half an inch (1.5cm) in the bottom of the pan.
Get the oil nice and hot, but be careful not to get it too hot as this may cause a dangerous grease fire. It’s better to start on the cooler side with the burner on medium and work your way up from there if you are not sure of the correct temperature.

",How to Make Home Fries (Breakfast Potatoes)3," Again, being careful not to spatter hot oil on your hands or arms. Wear a full oven mitt just in case or at least a long-sleeve shirt. Cover the entire bottom of the pan with potatoes but don’t pile them on too high.


If you are cooking a large quantity just cook more than one batch. The potatoes need to be mostly covered in oil.
If the oil is the right temperature the potatoes will boil and sizzle immediately when you put them in the pan. If this does not happen, carefully add heat until they are really frying, and note the temperature setting for next time.

, This is the perhaps the most enjoyable and also the trickiest part of making great home fries. A mixture of salt, rosemary, thyme and occasionally a pinch of lemon pepper make for a great recipe, but none of these are truly necessary. At least a sprinkle of salt is recommended.


As you add your spices, sprinkle them on the potatoes as you stir them to get decent coverage, being careful not to add too much salt or any other ingredient.
Salt and other seasonings can be added later, but like any recipe, they can never be taken out once they are in the mix.

, Keep watch to ensure they do not burn.


If you prefer crispier home fries, leave them on a little longer, but once they start to turn brown it doesn’t take long to burn them.

, Scoop the fully-cooked potatoes onto the paper towels to absorb any extra oil. They will be extremely hot at this point, so give them a minute or two to cool off before serving them.

Repeat the cooking process until all the pancakes have been cooked. Add more butter to the griddle between batches as necessary.

, Because you're cooking the pancakes two at a time, you don’t want the cooked ones getting cold while you wait for the rest. There are a couple of ways you can keep cooked pancakes warm, including:

Keep them in a 225 F (107 C) oven. Store the pancakes in a single layer on a wire rack to keep them crispy.Wrap them in foil and wrap the foil in a towel. Be warned that the pancakes may lose some of their crispiness this way.
Keep them in the warming drawer if your oven has one.

, When all the pancakes are ready, portion them out onto individual plates and serve with any combination of popular toppings, which can include:


Butter
Maple syrup or honey
Jam
Peanut butter
Fresh fruit, such as bananas, blueberries, and strawberries
Whipped cream

Serve the pancakes warm.",How to Make Buckwheat Pancakes2," In a small bowl, combine the yeast, warm water, and 1 tablespoon (13 g) of the brown sugar. Stir the mixture to combine all the ingredients. Set the bowl aside for one or two minutes to let the yeast soften.Yeast pancake batter needs to sit for several hours or overnight before you can cook the pancakes.
Unlike traditional pancakes, which are a type of flat cake, yeast pancakes are more like bread, so the batter needs time to rise.

, Position a sifter over a large mixing bowl. Pour the all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, and salt into the sifter. Sift them into the bowl below. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and whisk to combine.Mix until all the ingredients have been incorporated. Don’t overmix, as you could develop the gluten in the flour, and this can make for chewy pancakes.

, Cover the batter with a clean kitchen towel. Set the bowl aside on the counter and leave it to rise overnight at room temperature. You can also store the batter on top of the refrigerator, or in a cool oven to keep it out of the way., In the morning, uncover the bowl. Add the final 2 tablespoons (26 g) of brown sugar, the baking soda, and the oil. Whisk the batter until all the ingredients have been incorporated.Oils you can use in this recipe include olive, vegetable, melted coconut, canola, or melted butter.

, Add the butter to a large griddle and heat it over medium heat. Let the butter melt and the griddle warm for a few minutes.Drop a pea-sized dollop of batter into the butter. When the batter starts to sizzle, the griddle is ready.

As you're cooking, you may need to add more butter between batches.

, Ladle the batter into the griddle in ½ cup (118 ml) portions. Add two to three pancakes at a time, depending on the size of your griddle. Cook the pancakes for three to four minutes. Use a spatula to flip the pancakes when the bubbles that form on the surface begin popping.After flipping, cook the pancakes for another two to three minutes.
Add more butter as necessary between batches, and continue cooking until all the pancakes are done.

, Keep the cooked pancakes warm in a warming drawer, in a single layer in a 225 F (107 C) oven, or wrapped in foil until all the pancakes are cooked.When all the pancakes are ready, serve them with your favourite toppings.

For extra flavor, consider adding ½ teaspoon (1 g) of cinnamon to the batter.You can also sift all the dry ingredients together into the mixing bowl to avoid whisking.

, Add the non-dairy milk, maple syrup, and vanilla to the dry ingredients. Whisk everything together until it becomes a smooth batter with no lumps.Because buckwheat isn't actually wheat and doesn’t contain gluten, you don’t have to worry about overmixing this batter.

You can use any sweetener you like in place of the maple syrup, including corn syrup, agave, white sugar, or brown sugar.
Good non-dairy milks for these pancakes include almond, soy, and coconut.

, Transfer the blueberries and banana slices to the batter. With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the fruit into the batter. Folding is a gentle method of stirring that will protect the banana and blueberries from getting crushed or mashed.Instead of blueberries, you can use any combination of blackberries, sliced strawberries, raspberries, currants, or other fruit.

, Add vegan butter, margarine, or even coconut oil to a large griddle. Heat the griddle over medium heat. Add a pea-sized drop of batter to the griddle, and let the griddle preheat until the batter starts to sizzle., Drop the batter into the heated griddle by the ¼ cup (59 ml), making sure that each scoop has some banana and blueberries.

Take the pancake off the griddle or frying pan and keep it warm as you make more.,
You can keep the pancakes warm by piling them on a plate and covering them with a towel or piece of aluminum foil.,
Serve the pancake.",How to Make Basic Pancakes2," Frying all of those pancakes can take some time, and by the time you finish making the last one, the first few might turn cold. You can keep your pancakes warm by turning the oven on and setting the temperature to 200°F (94°C). You can keep an oven-safe dish in the oven, and place the pancakes into the dish once you take them off the frying pan. This will help keep your pancakes warm while you finish making the rest of the batch., You can make pancakes over a griddle or in a frying pan. While griddles take up more space than frying pans, you can also make multiple pancakes at one time over a griddle. The surface will need to be very hot before you can start frying the pancakes. Here is how you prepare both surfaces:


If you are using a griddle, lightly grease the surface of your griddle with some butter. Turn on your griddle and set the heat to medium-high. You can tell if the surface is hot enough by sprinkling some water onto it. If the water droplets bounce and sizzle, it's ready.
If you are using a frying pan, turn on the stove first and set the temperature to medium-high. Set the pan on the burner and drop in a small cube of butter (or any kind of grease). Tilt the pan around to spread the butter evenly.

, Once the griddle or frying pan are hot enough, spoon some of the batter onto the surface. Each pancake with require thee to four tablespoons. Consider using a soup ladle.


If you have added other ingredients to your batter, such as chocolate chips or fruit pieces, then lightly stir batter before scooping it onto the griddle or frying pan. This prevents the bulky ingredients from settling to the bottom.

, This will take about four minutes. When the batter starts to bubble and form tiny holes on the top, the pancake is probably ready to be flipped over. Slip a spatula under the pancake and peek at the color underneath. If it's golden, flip the pancake over and let it cook for two more minutes. The pancake is ready when it is golden-brown on both sides.


If you are using a frying pan, you may tilt the pan from side to side to make the pancake bigger and thinner.

, Once the pancake is finished, use a spatula to take it off a griddle. Slide it onto a plate, and spoon more batter onto the griddle or frying pan. If the pancake starts to burn, you may have to add more batter.

, You can also store them in an oven set to 200°F (94°C).

, Once you have made all of the pancakes, you may serve it. The traditional topping is maple syrup, but you can also top it with various other ingredients. Refer to the section on pancake variations for some ideas.

Before you start frying pancakes, add one teaspoon of your chosen flavor to the batter and mix it together.

, You can make your pancakes more flavorful by adding other ingredients into the batter before you fry it. Use about ½ cup of whatever ingredient you choose. You can add more to your liking—just make sure that the batter is still smooth, or it will not spread out properly on the frying pan. Here are some ideas:


You can use berries, such as blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. You can also use sliced-up bananas or grated apples.
You can add some chocolate chips to the batter as well.

, While maple syrup is the most popular pancake topping, you can also use other sweet toppings instead: chocolate sauce, fruit jams, honey, or chocolate-hazelnut spread.

, You can also top your pancakes with nuts, fruits, and other items. Use a handful of whatever topping you choose. Here are some ideas:

To make buttermilk or yogurt pancakes, use butter milk or plain yogurt instead of regular milk.

, You may use fresh, sliced strawberries, or you can prepare a strawberry-sugar mixture. To do this, slice up some strawberries before you start making the pancake batter, and add some sugar to the strawberries. You will need 2 cups of strawberries and ¼ cup of sugar. Mix them together in a bowl and store it into the fridge until you are ready to eat the pancakes., You will need four strips of fried bacon, crumbled, and 1.2 cup of chopped pecans.

This recipe can work any way and cooking is about experimenting anyway, right! Some people like a not-so-sweet pancake so they tend to take down the sugar content, but it is completely up to you!;
, Use an electric whisk to stir the ingredients as this is both easy, quick and the right technique to get that lovely, airy thickness in your pancake. Place the whisk aside as we will be using it again later. If the mix looks too thin, add a little more flour.

, This will be what makes your pancakes rise! Whisk this in as well and after a while you should get your pancake batter!

, You can also use a pan intended for making pancakes, which would be even better! With a small ladle, spoon some of your mixture into the pan. It is hard to say how much you want in because people have certain preferences on their pancake-size, so do it to whatever size you want. For a medium-sized THICK pancake, cook for about one minute on one side and a little bit less on the other side. Add and take some time from the cooking depending on your pancake-size and thickness. Both sides should be a light golden brown.

, You can stick to butter and jam or use maple syrup or a coulis of some sort. You can even chop up some bananas or strawberries to put on top. The decision is up to you. After you have done this, there is only one thing left to do... eat it!

In many cases, a small light will come on when the waffle iron is ready. A good test of the temperature is to let a drop or two of water fall on the plates of the waffle iron. The drops should sizzle and dance for 2-3 seconds before vanishing. If the drops sit there for much longer than that, the waffle iron isn't warm enough yet. If they vanish in less than a couple seconds, the waffle iron may be too hot. ;
, Place the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder into a medium-large bowl. For extremely fluffy waffles, sift the ingredients instead of simply mixing them.

, Use an egg separating tool to separate the yolks from the whites and place them in separate bowls.

You may also separate the eggs by cracking them in half and tipping the yolk from shell half to shell half, letting the white drop to a bowl below.
It's all right to leave a bit of the egg whites in with the yolk, but don't get any yolk in with the egg white. The egg whites won't foam properly if there is even a little yolk in them.


, Use a whisk or a mixer to beat the egg whites until they foam and form soft peaks. Joy of Cooking describes the right stage as ""stiff, but not dry"". , Beat the butter or oil and egg yolks in a separate bowl. Add the milk and vanilla, and continue beating until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. 
, Make a well in the dry ingredients. Pour the egg yolk mixture into the well. Stir the ingredients together until everything is moist. Don't overmix the ingredients, or the waffles will come out dense. You can leave a few lumps in the batter.

, Gently mix them into the batter until everything is a fairly even consistency. Again, don't over-mix. Remember that folding is a very gentle, top-to-bottom sort of stirring.

, Use a pastry brush or a paper towel to oil both the top and bottom plates of the waffle iron. Do this before you make each waffle, or it is very likely that the waffles will stick. , Use 1/2 to 1 cup of batter, depending on your waffle iron. If you're not sure, go a little under the amount you think you will need. The batter will puff up as it cooks. Spoon it evenly into the bottom plate of the waffle iron.


, Allow about 2 minutes for the waffle to form. If you like your waffles brown, cook them for a longer period of time. Don't press on the lid. The lid will press down enough and the waffles will naturally puff a little. Watch the steam production. It will stop or reduce greatly when the waffles are done.
Listen and watch for the thermostat in your waffle iron to turn off and on. Sometimes having it turn off is a cue that the waffles are done.
Waffles get a lot less sticky once they're properly cooked. If the waffle iron is hard to open and you oiled it properly, try giving it another minute. Don't open the waffle iron if you can help it. Try to cook each waffle in one go. If you do open the waffle iron on a waffle that's still a bit too pale, carefully close it again and let it go a bit longer.

, A spatula can help you lift it without breaking the waffle or burning your fingers. Place it on a plate and pour more batter into the waffle iron to make another waffle. Repeat until the batter is gone.
, The real thing is best if you can find it., This is another common topping for waffles, and it makes for a delicious, refreshing treat. Try strawberries, blueberries, bananas, or peaches.

To make a fruit syrup, place cut fruit, a few teaspoons of sugar, and about half a cup of water in a small pot. Heat it on the stove over medium heat. Stir the mixture until it thickens and becomes a syrup you can pour over your waffles.
Fruit can also be cooked directly into the waffle batter. Stir in some blueberries, chopped strawberries, banana slices, or another fruit before pouring it into the waffle iron.

, Serve the waffles with chocolate syrup and whipped cream to make them into a decadent dessert. You can also cook chocolate chips into the waffles by adding them to the batter before you pour it into the waffle iron., Can’t decide between having waffles or bacon for breakfast? Why compromise when your bacon can meet your waffles for an extremely tasty treat? All you’ll need are the ingredients for traditional waffle batter and a package of bacon to create your bacon waffles. Unfortunately, frozen waffles topped with a few slices of bacon won’t make the cut, so get ready to crack a few eggs and whip up the batter.

Combine the dry ingredients and preheat the waffle iron.,
Combine the liquid ingredients.,
Make a small well in the flour, then pour the liquid batter into the powdered mixture and gently fold the batter.,
Butter the waffle maker as you would do with any pan.,
Remove the cooked waffle from the iron.",How to Make Buttery Waffles," It’s important to combine dry ingredients first because the dry ingredients are much lighter than the liquid ones. When you mix them all together instead of separately, the lighter ingredients float to the top.This will ensure that your waffles work out well.;
, Be sure to wait until the melted butter has cooled sufficiently before you mix it into the other ingredients because if it is too warm, it'll cause the flour to form lumps., In addition, you could fold stiff egg whites into the batter to make them much fluffier (stiff egg whites are just egg whites that have been whipped until they create stiff peaks) because the egg whites are fluffy and they create light and airy waffles.A well is a hole in the ingredients. Basically you have to ""dig"" a hole in the dry ingredients and then pour the wet ingredients into the well.

, Spread the waffle batter evenly across the iron (not too much or it will overflow). Wait until the iron begins to steam (each iron may have a different way of telling you when your waffle is done, trust your waffle iron). Keep in mind that if you open the machine too early, your waffle will rip open and a waffle is never as enjoyable when it is not perfect., Serve with your choice of… anything! This includes chocolate, maple syrup, butter, whipped cream, ice cream, caramel, and the like. Waffles taste good with nothing and everything, just be creative and spice things up if you don't want to leave it plain. Serve warm and fresh.

Cut down on basic white flour.,
Use flour substitutes.,
Try it with eggs.,
Replace butter with lighter options.,
Mix the waffle batter.,
Heat and grease the waffle iron.,
Spoon the batter onto the hot waffle iron.,
Cook the waffles until they're golden brown.,
Drizzle the waffles with a light sweetener.,
Top with fresh fruit.,
Play around with other wholesome additives.",How to Make Healthy Waffles," You don’t have to eliminate flour from your waffle batter entirely. Simply reduce the amount of enriched all-purpose flour you use by about half, then fill in the missing portion with other low-carb derivatives like whole wheat, almond or rice flour. When the time comes to chow down, chances are you won’t even be able to tell the difference.Adjust the amount of flour as you see fit for your own personal take on the recipe.
Most of the carbohydrates in traditional waffles come from starchy white flour.;
, If you happen to have an intolerance to gluten, or you’re trying your best to stick to a holistic diet, you can dispense with flour altogether and bring in more nutrient-packed ingredients to do the job. Flax meal, rolled oats or even blended nuts will all work well for this purpose.Other types of grains can give your waffles a complex, nutty flavor.For smoother waffles, make sure your flour substitute has been ground or blended to a fine consistency.

, Not many people know that eggs can be used in place of flour, butter and milk. Combine 2-3 large eggs with a couple teaspoons of baking powder to help them set up. Add a sweetening agent, such as mashed bananas, and you’re ready to go. It’s that easy! Eggs are loaded with protein and good cholesterol, and when cooked they’ll take on a fluffy, spongy texture that’s nearly indistinguishable from traditional waffles made with flour.Whip whole eggs together with the baking powder and salt before incorporating them into your batter mix.
It’s even possible to make a simple carb-free version of waffles using only eggs and a few dry ingredients. Combine egg waffles with savory items like bacon crumbles, turkey sausage or low-fat cheese., A good portion of the calories in waffles come from butter, whether mixed in with the batter or served on top. Instead of butter, give applesauce, Greek yogurt or the infinitely-useful coconut oil a shot. Taking butter out of the equation can spare you the long-term health risks, and the guilt, of high-fat breakfasts.Coconut oil is especially versatile, as it can be used as a spreadable semi-solid at room temperature or a smooth liquid when heated.

, Combine your baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar and flour substitute of choice in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 eggs, a tablespoon of oil and a dash of vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and whisk until they form a smooth, thick mixture.Break up big lumps in the batter, but don’t overstir. This can make the waffles dense and gluey.If you’re using tough, fibrous ingredients like oats or flax, soak them in a shallow bowl of buttermilk to soften them before blending them and adding them to the batter mix.

, Plug in the waffle iron. Coat both surfaces of the iron with light cooking spray and let it begin preheating. Have your batter and a ladle ready nearby.No need to prep with cooking spray if you’re using a newer nonstick waffle iron.
Keep the heat somewhere between medium and high so that it doesn’t get too hot between batches.

, Use enough batter to cover the inner surface of the iron, leaving a little room around the edges for the waffles to cook up. Once the batter begins to bubble, closed the lid of the iron.Make sure you pour the batter on thick enough to cover the grid ridges on the iron, or the waffles won’t hold together.
Most waffle irons will only be big enough to fix one waffle at a time. Portion each ladle of batter consistently so that you have none left over when you’re done cooking.

, The waffles will take about 4-5 minutes to cook to the optimal finish. A perfect waffle will come out golden-brown and crispy on the outside while still being light and airy inside. Repeat until you’ve used up the remaining batter.Take a peek at the waffles periodically to make sure they’re cooking evenly.
Waffle batter can also be refrigerated for a day or two if you don’t plan on using it all right away.

, Bypass the maple syrup, which is almost entirely sugar, and opt for an organic sweetener like honey or agave nectar that’s naturally lower in sugar. Nut butters are another good choice, as they spread well and contain high amounts of proteins and good fats. You’ll still get the warm, sticky sweetness you crave, only without accidentally consuming an entire day’s worth of carbs in one meal.Warm the sweetener in the microwave for a few seconds to make it easier to pour.
Go easy on the sweetening syrups. Even low-sugar alternatives can add up if you use too much., Layer your guilt-free waffles with fresh banana or apple slices, or on a heaping spoonful of glazed strawberries. The sweet and tangy zest of fresh fruit provides a wonderful counterbalance to the mild, earthy qualities of whole grains. And, of course, you’ll be receiving your daily dose of essential vitamins and minerals.If you prefer richer, more decadent toppings for your waffles, try cooking down fresh fruit with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a little bit of honey or stevia into a flavorful compote., Look for other ways to incorporate healthy ingredients into your waffles where less-healthy ones are ordinarily used. For instance, whipped cream or cream cheese can be traded for low-fat cottage cheese, and coconut flakes can be even better than powdered sugar when sprinkled on top.Mix in blueberries, chopped walnuts or dark chocolate morsels to give your waffles some variety of flavor and make them more filling.
Don’t feel like you have to replace every single main ingredient. A little butter or maple syrup is fine in moderation.

",How to Make Bacon Flavored Waffles," You can take one of two approaches––cooking the bacon on a stovetop or in the oven. Both methods produce crisp bacon, although the stovetop method is a little faster.


Heat an ungreased skillet on low and then place the raw bacon slices in the skillet. Line bacon in a uniform fashion so that it cooks evenly.
Brown each side of bacon for approximately five to six minutes. The browning process will vary based on the bacon thickness, type of skillet you use and the stovetop heat.;
,, You want to avoid having residual grease leak into your waffle batter; this will compromise the integrity of the batter and make the waffles taste greasy.

,, Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large mixing bowl. Instead of using a mixer, consider hand-mixing using a large wooden spoon or rubber spatula so you avoid over-mixing.

, Using a different bowl, whisk buttermilk with the eggs and only 2 tablespoons of the canola oil.

, Fold the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well using a large spoon or rubber spatula.

, Try to distribute bacon evenly throughout the mixture so that each waffle will contain an even amount of bacon.

, Brush each side with a small amount of canola oil; the remaining 2 tablespoons of canola oil will be used to coat the waffle iron in to avoid the waffles from sticking.

, Pour approximately ½ cup of the batter into the waffle iron. Amounts may vary based on the waffle iron size. Using ½ cup should accommodate a standard 7-inch (17.5cm) iron.

, Cook for 6 to 8 minutes depending on the heat and your individual waffle iron. The idea is to cook the waffle until it is lightly browned; however, like ovens and stovetops, heat settings and irons will vary.

, No bacon infused waffle is complete without special toppings. Use your imagination, but some mouthwatering ideas include:


Candied brown sugar syrup. Combine ½ cup of brown sugar, ⅓ cup of crushed candied walnuts and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. Sprinkle mixture over each waffle.

Homemade whipped cream. Skip the grocery bought whipped cream and make your own. Combine 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of confectioner’s sugar in a mixer. Pour heavy cream in the mixer and beat until small white peaks form. Beat in vanilla and sugar until well combined and top it on the waffle.
Old fashioned maple syrup and crushed bacon. Sometimes a traditional topping is the best. Consider warming good maple syrup in a small pan before pouring over waffle. Then top with extra pieces of crushed leftover crisp bacon to accentuate the waffle.

Mix cereals together.",How to Use Up Leftover Cereal," Make the cereal either as your main ingredient or as a topping. Any cereal nicely accommodates yogurt in a bowl and a sweet breakfast treat as well. If you're planning on using it as the main ingredient, try putting it in layers with yogurt to get equal amounts in each bite.;
, Try to match sweet desserts with the cereal flavors, for example, chocolate cereal on a chocolate cake.


Rice Krispies is a main ingredient for Rice Krispies marshmallow treats.
Granola can be ""recycled"" and turned into cereal bars.
Use them as doughnut toppings.

, Any ""ringed"" cereal, such as Fruit Loops or Cheerios, would make an outstanding necklace or bracelet. You may not want to keep it for a prolonged time, so share it with the birds as well.

, Cornflakes or bran cereals are great examples. Place the cereal into a small snack or sandwich sized plastic zipped bag. Use a rolling pin to crush it into crumbs; you can also have a kid mash the contents as well. After dipping the food into the egg wash, dip it into the cereal before baking/cooking. These ""cereal breadcrumbs"" can be used as a covering for just about anything, including crab cakes, chicken, or a casserole topping.

, If you use raisins or pecans in muffins, roll them around the cereal sugar in a small bowl. This helps out in the recipe because the ingredients won't sink to the bottom of the dessert while baking.

, Share the love goodness in multiple boxes and add everything to a large container. Your kids may or may not mind by the multiple flavors in their bowl, but that can be solved by adding fresh chopped fruit in there as well.

Butter your toast.",How to Make Buttered Toast1," Any bread works for buttered toast: white, brown, wheat, sourdough, rye, pumpernickel, or another variety. Each one will give you a slightly different flavor and/or texture, so pick your favorite.


Making bread in the toaster is perhaps the faster and easiest way to make bread. Use this method if you are pressed for time.;
, Your toaster probably offers options for how dark and crisp you want the toast to be. If you're not sure, start with a light setting; you can always put the toast in for a second round to get darker, but you can't do anything about toast that's become too dark.

, When your toast is done, take it out of the toaster. If you think it's dark enough before it actually finishes the toasting cycle, pop it up manually to save it from burning.

, Use a butter knife to spread butter over the toast while it is still warm. If you wait until the toast has cooled, the butter will not melt into the bread. Cut the bread into halves or quarters before you eat, if you wish.


Lots of butter will likely make your toast softer as it melts, and less butter will keep your snack more crisp and dry. The amount of butter used is based on personal preference.
Soften the butter before spreading it on your toast. Take it out of the refrigerator 20 minutes before you plan on making toast to help it warm to room temperature. Whipped butter may also work for this. If you're using a stick of butter and don't have time to soften it, cut the butter into thin slices and apply to warm toast. Thicker slices won't melt as well.

Choose your bread.,
Heat the pan.,
Toast the bread in the pan.,
Remove from the pan.",How to Make Buttered Toast2," Thick, dense breads like whole grains and sourdoughs can take longer cooking times. Fluffy, tender breads like challah and brioche can't take as much heat and need shorter cooking times. Choose any bread, like ciabatta, semolina bread, baguette, or rye.Cut the slice thickly if you have a loaf.

, Turn the burner on the stove to low and place 1/2 teaspoon of butter in the pan. Let the butter melt. Make sure to use real butter and not margarine.

, After the butter has melted, place the bread into the pan. Make sure the bread soaks up the butter. Place a lid over the pan and let the bread cook for 2-3 minutes.


After 2-3 minutes, flip the bread over. Make sure the other side of the bread soaks up some of the butter in the pan. Place the lid back on top. Let this side toast for 2-3 minutes.An alternative is to toast the bread in a pan that has no butter in it. Just let the bread brown in the pan and then flip. Butter it after you remove it from the pan., When the bread has browned to your desired level of crisp, take the bread out of the pan. Do not add extra butter after taking it out of the pan.


This method of toasting bread cooks the butter into the bread, giving it a different flavor than if you add the butter after it is toasted. This method ensures there are no uneven chunks of butter on the toast, and helps the toast not to be soggy from too much buttering.
Toasting the bread this way allows for a crisp outside but a fluffy, chewy inside.

, Use a butter knife to spread butter on the bread before you place it into the oven. Make sure to use real butter instead of margarine.


An alternative is to spread the butter on the bread after the bread is finished. However, buttering the bread before you put it into the oven bakes the butter into the bread, giving it a better flavor.
You can butter both sides of the bread or just one side. This is up to you.

, Put the bread into the broiler, or onto the wire rack if you are using a toaster oven. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Make sure to keep watching the bread. If you like your bread lighter, don't let it cook as long; if you like darker bread, let it cook for longer. Turn the bread over when the first side is brown enough. Let the next side cook for 2-3 minutes.If you are using a toaster oven, you probably will not have to flip it over because the bread will cook on both sides.
You don't have to flip it over and cook it on both sides. You can leave one side un-toasted if you wish. It will still be warm and slightly cooked from being in the oven.

, When the bread is to your desired level of toasted, remove it and place it on a plate. If you haven't buttered the toast already, add butter now.

Return to the cooking pot and give it a final wash. Once the water has been sitting in the fryer pot for 30 minutes, pour half of it into the sink.,
Use baking soda if caked-on oil remains.,
Rinse the cooking pot.,
Let dry completely (blotting with paper towel will speed up drying) before using again.",How to Clean a Deep Fryer1," If you use your deep fryer frequently, changing the oil and cleaning it every few days will help prevent a buildup of grime that can be much harder to remove.If you only use your deep fryer every couple weeks or less frequently, clean it after each use.


Do not put your fryer in the sink or dishwasher. Immersion in water may cause an electrical short and damage the fryer.;
, Never clean your deep fryer while it is still plugged in.Let the oil cool completely to avoid burns. Never add water to a container of hot oil, or the mixture could explode.

, If you plan to use the oil again, drain it into a food safe container with a sealed lid and store it in a cool place.Otherwise, find out how you can use cooking oil for other purposes or simply throw it away in a sealed container.


Do not pour oil down your sink. It can clog your drain.

, Put two or three drops of dish washing detergent on the basket for later cleaning., Use damp, but not dripping, paper towels or a sponge to wipe away oil residue and bits of food from inside the deep fryer pot.If the oil has caked on, scrape it off with a pan scraper or spatula, taking care not to damage the finish. Some lids are removable for easy cleaning. Dispose of the oil as before.


Stiff plastic utensils will scrape off the oil without scratching your fryer.

, Most deep fryers have a heating element composed of a pair metal rods. If these are covered in oily residue, wipe them down with paper towels. Be careful not to bend or damage any parts while wiping, especially if there are thin wires.Some models have removable heating elements for easy cleaning, or elements that are attached to a hinge that can be pulled up nearer the fryer's surface. Check your model's manual to see if yours has this feature.

, Use about four drops on the base of the fryer and four drops spread evenly around the sides.Start at the bottom and scrub in circles to create a lather. Continue to scrub with a circular motion up the sides.

, Transfer it from your faucet/tap with a pitcher/jug/kettle or other container, rather than exposing your fryer's electrical components to a wet sink. Use as much water as you normally would oil and no more. Let the hot water sit for 30 minutes.Whilst you wait you can move on to the next step and clean the other pieces.


If your tap water isn't that hot, you may heat some in a kettle or bring the water to a boil in the fryer by plugging it back in - be sure not to leave it unattended and do not allow it to boil dry. Unplug your fryer and wait 30 minutes for the water to cool. Boil for several minutes if there is a large amount of caked on residue., Use a scrubbing-brush (a tooth-brush works well) to remove food particles. Once clean, rinse the basket to remove the remaining soap, blot off remaining water with a paper towel and leave it to dry on a dish rack or towel.

, Check your manufacturer's instructions to see if your filters are removable, and whether you can clean them. Foam grease-filters can be washed in hot soapy water and left to dry. Charcoal odor-filters are not washable and need to be replaced once they become grimy and clogged.If any filters are not removable, you cannot immerse the lid in water. Instead, wipe with a damp cloth with a little detergent, then a plain damp cloth to remove the detergent and oil., Use a sponge or cloth to wipe the sides and bottom with the remaining water, then pour that down the sink as well.


If the water contains a large amount of oil, you may need to put it in a container and throw it in the trash instead of pouring it down the sink.

, If some caked on residue or sticky layer of oil still hasn't been removed, try mixing a little bit of baking soda with warm water to create a thick paste. Put on to a sponge and use this to scrub off stubborn area with a circular motion until it is removed.Only use other abrasive or chemical substances to clean your fryer as an absolute last resort. If you do need to use an oven cleaner or other cleaning product, scrub with soapy water afterward and rinse several times to remove all traces of the chemical before using it to cook., Add clean water without soap and swirl with your hand to pick up all soap particles from the sides and base. Pour out the water and repeat the process until the fryer is free of soap.


If there is a stubborn grease film (run your bare hand over the surfaces to feel for any remaining greasy/sticky patches) rinse again with diluted vinegar. Add 1 part vinegar for every 10 parts water, or 1/2 cup for every quart of water (110 mL vinegar for each liter of water)., Use a towel to dry the outside of the deep fryer, but let the inside air dry. Wait long enough for the fryer to dry completely. This gives any water that accidentally entered the electrical system a chance to drain before you plug the fryer back in."

Clean regularly.,
Filter and replace the oil frequently, especially if used to fry foods like fish and meat (sausages etc).,
Brush the heating coils clean whenever the oil is drained.,
Keep the exterior clean.,
Perform a thorough ""boil out"" clean every 3–6 months.,
Follow the owner's manual to conduct an annual inspection.",How to Clean a Deep Fryer2," Follow the instructions for Cleaning a Deep Fryer to give your commercial fryer a basic cleaning. The frequency of this cleaning will depending on how frequently the fryer is used, and for what purpose, but the more often you do it, the easier it will be to remove the grease residue and caked on food.


Since commercial fryers tend to be large and deep, you should use a long-handled brush with soft bristles to scrub the pot, instead of a sponge.

, For heavy restaurant use, oil often needs to be filtered once or twice a day.While you can filter the oil for reuse by putting it through a coffee filter or cheesecloth, a restaurant operation would probably benefit from a specialized machine that filters quickly at higher temperatures. Whenever the oil grows darker in color, smokes at lower temperatures, or gives off a strong smell, it needs to be replaced completely.Your oil will last longer at temperatures of 375ºF (191ºC) or below, and if you do not add salt directly to the oil., Before the new or filtered oil is added back to the fryer, use a long-handled fryer scrubbing brush to remove bits of food from the coils.This keeps the heating element effective and limits burned food particles in your oil.

, While cleaning the rim and outside surface of your fryer will not help the fryer function longer, it will stop it collecting grime and limit spillovers that make floors and work surfaces slippery.Try to wipe it clean at the end of each day, and apply a degreasing product to the exterior whenever a grease film has built up. Let the degreasing product sit for ten minutes, then rinse off with a damp cloth. Dry with a different, clean cloth., To thoroughly clean your commercial fryer, you should fill it with warm water and heat to a simmer or slow boil.Add a specialized ""boil out"" product according to manufacturer's instructions and maintain the simmer for 20 minutes. Wearing rubber gloves and taking care to avoid burns from splashes, use a long-handled soft-bristled brush to dislodge stuck food.Drain the fryer, then scrub and rinse as you would after a normal clean.


During the followup rinse, add 1 part vinegar for every 10 parts water to neutralize and remove the cleaning product., The manufacturer of your fryer model should provide instructions for performing an annual inspection to make sure all the parts are fitted together tightly and functioning properly.If problems arise and the manual does not provide instructions for a solution, you may need to call an electrician or repairman.

You should go for the ones which have a round shape because it has been observed that while using square shaped wares there are high chances of food getting overcooked.;
, Never go for the cookware which has straight sides since it will not allow even penetration of heat unlike the ones with sloping sides.


, This is one of the most important considerations to be taken care of while selecting the microwave utensils. The microwavable come in different materials. There are those which are made of stainless steel, clay and porcelain and the most popular ones are those which are manufactured from borosilicate and the cheap ones are those manufactured from plastic. Getting the right kind of microwave cookware can be tricky. Therefore, it is always most advisable to go for the choice which is safest and that brings us to borosilicate. Borosilicate glass ensures quality, durability as well as hygiene – pretty much all the aspects which are required in a proper and the best microwavable.


, Many of us have this habit to settle on functionality for the price. Always keep in mind that it is better to purchase slightly expensive products rather buy different kind of cookware to suit different purposes at a lesser price tag.


, While choosing commercial cookware it is very important that you select the ones which are made of best quality materials so that they ascertain quality as well as durability. It is again advisable to go for the ones manufactured from borosilicate glass since they are strong, durable and stain resistant. It is very easy to clean them as well and they are not prone to discoloration since they are made of transparent glass.

Rolled oats are best as they’re whole, natural, and haven’t been through much processing. However, steel-cut or quick oats are okay, too – they just might not have the exact taste you're going for.;
, Use a wooden spoon to stir – some people even use the top of the spoon like they’re stirring their porridge with a pencil. Keep stirring until it starts to bubble.


Never use metal on a non-stick pan. The metal can scrape away the sides, resulting in microscopic bits of the pan getting into your food. Always use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula.

, Once it reaches that bubbling point, bring the heat down to low (this is especially important if you’re using milk to prevent it from scorching). Stir as often as you can to get it to a smooth and creamy consistency.


If you like runny porridge, add a splash of more milk or water until it looks like you pictured it. If you’re making for a group, let each person add more liquid as they see fit to their individual serving once it's all in bowls.

, Most people like to start out with a sweet base to work with. Some people even add butter! As your porridge is finishing, consider adding a few touches to everyone’s dish. Just a tablespoon or so of each ought to do it.


If you're trying to watch your sugar intake or prefer a more savory dish, skip this part. You can always add in whatever you like, later, too.

, There are dozens of ways to spruce up a plain ol' dish of porridge so breakfast can be easy but still delectable. Here are some ideas:

Place leftover cooked rice into a large pot.,
Cover with water or broth by about one inch.,
Bring it to a boil and then simmer for 10 minutes.,
Add the eggs.,
Keep stirring until the porridge is gelatinous and smooth.,
Add soy sauce or other condiments, if you’d like.",How to Make Porridge2," This recipe can also be made with uncooked rice, though it takes much longer. Just make sure there’s enough room in the pot for plenty of water, too.


You can also make this dish with a rice cooker or in the microwave. With those, times may vary. Essentially, congee is just cooked rice with much more water, allowed to stew.

, As most rice porridge is used to get rid of leftover rice, measurements are not a standard of this timeless recipe. However, with cooked rice, you want about twice as much water – enough to cover the rice and then about an inch more.


If the rice is uncooked, you’ll need about 4 times as much water. The rice expands and absorbs the water while cooking.
Broth is good if you're looking for a richer, more savory taste, but it's hardly necessary.

, Keep stirring to nudge the grains apart and to give it a smooth consistency from the get-go. Once it reaches a boil, bring the heat down to low and let simmer.


Cover your pot, resisting the urge to check it more than once or twice. The more you open it, the more the steam and heat escapes, slowing the process.

, Be sure to break up the eggs with a fork or you might end up with bits of yolk floating around in your porridge. In traditional rice porridge, the eggs are blended right into the porridge, giving it flavor instead of texture.


Congee, or rice porridge, isn't about rice porridge with bits of scrambled egg floating about. To be sure it'll turn out smooth, whisk up the eggs beforehand and then add to your porridge.

, As the broth or water breaks down the rice, slowly it will start to congeal and become one mass. The grains will smooth out and the water will seem the thicken. If you see this, you're on the right track!


Be sure to keep stirring – it's best that it's all cooked evenly and nothing is left to harden on the bottom of the pan.

, Soy sauce is a very common addition to congee, and some people like to add a little kick with chili sauce or Sriracha.

Combine 2 cups barley with 6 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt.,
Simmer until the barley is tender, about 45-60 minutes.,
Drain the cooked barley.,
Combine the cooked barley and the rest of the ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat.,
Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 more minutes.,
Divide the porridge between four bowls.",How to Make Porridge3," Bring these ingredients to a boil in a large pan over medium heat. Once they reach a boil, bring down the heat to low. Keeping the temperature up too high will result in the barley burning and the water evaporating too quickly.


If you don't have 4 people to serve, this recipe is easily cut in half. However, don't necessarily modify the toppings too much – if you like it sweet, you may need just as much sugar!

, Barley is a tough nut to crack (figuratively, of course. Literally barley is a grain with just a nutty flavor). Because of it's tougher consistency, it takes longer than oats or rice to make tender. Stir every 10 minutes or so, checking on how it's doing. Every pot will differ slightly in the time needed to cook.


Keep the lid on as much as possible. When 10 minutes is up, take it off and give it a few stirs with a wooden spoon. When the water is mostly gone, the barley is done.

, Even if you're looking for a runnier porridge, drain the cooked barley. The water that's left probably won't taste as good and rich as a cup of milk will.


This is easiest to do with a plastic or metal colander. If you're in a bind, hold the lid up the edge of the pan and tip it over into the sink to dispel the water.

, 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, ½ teaspoon cinnamon will turn your plain barley into a regular breakfast feast. Modify the sweetness as you see fit, of course.


The milk is necessary (the fatter the milk, the creamier the taste), but you can experiment with the brown sugar and cinnamon and explore other things like honey, fruit juice, or yogurt, too.

, This is generally how long it takes until the milk has almost been entirely absorbed. What's more, the barley will take on some of the sweet, cinnamon-y flavor.


When it has a thick, glutinous, porridge-like consistency, it's done! You can add more milk if you'd like it a little thinner.

, Right now you just have basic barley porridge. To spice things up, top each dish with walnuts, a drizzle of heavy cream, and fruit, if desired. There’s no getting tired of that!


If you're the curious type, try yogurt, peanut butter, cocoa, honey, or any other addition that you think would make the porridge a breakfast of champions.

Bake homemade granola bars.",How to Slow Toast Granola," The key to finding the perfect balance between sweetness and crunch is using the right proportions of wet and dry ingredients. Your granola should be about one part rolled oats, nuts or other grains and one part sweeteners and spices. You’ll have a little wiggle room to use more or less of any particular ingredient as you prefer as long as you keep it all roughly equal.Experiment with creating your own spice blends using spices like nutmeg, allspice or flavored sugars and salts.
After you get your ingredients portioned out, it’s just a matter of putting it all together.;
, Spray the bottom and sides of the slow cooker with cooking spray. Pour 5 cups (450g) of raw rolled oats into the cooker, along with ½ cup (80g) of puffed rice cereal, sunflower kernels, flax seeds, almonds or any other nut or grain of your choosing. Stir until the dry ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.For this effortless recipe, you can use the same spoon or spatula for every phase of preparation.

, In a separate mixing bowl, add your honey, oil, and vanilla extract and whisk together until thoroughly blended. Together, the ingredients should produce about ¾ cup (200ml) of liquid sweetener. You should have enough sweetener to entirely cover and coat the oats and other dry components.You can also use another sweetener like maple syrup, simple syrup or agave nectar instead of honey if you feel like switching up the flavor of the granola.Try working in other gooey goodies like peanut butter and applesauce. These types of thick ingredients will blend better if you run them through the microwave for a few seconds first.Though it’s not a necessity, one or two egg whites can protect the granola from the heat of the slow cooker and create a richer texture., Slowly drizzle the liquid sweetening mixture over the oats, nuts and grains, covering as much as you can. Then, use a rubber spatula to churn the wet and dry ingredients together until they take on a thick, gooey consistency.Break up large clumps with the tip of your spoon or spatula so that the granola is nice and crumbly when it finishes cooking.

, Plug in the crock pot or slow cooker and turn up the temperature. The granola will need to cook at a fairly high heat in order to toast the oats and take in the flavors of the sweetener and spices.An added advantage of toasting granola in a slow cooker or crock pot rather than the oven is that it heats very gradually and evenly, so you don’t have to worry about it burning.

, Offset the lid of the cooker so that the granola can ventilate as it cooks. The movement of air through the cooker will allow excess moisture to evaporate so that the granola comes out with a nice tender crunch rather than being soupy or soggy.The simplest way to properly ventilate your slow cooker is to place the lid down sideways. This will leave a small opening at either end for air to flow through.Don’t forget to leave the lid cracked each time you stir the granola.

, Set a timer to let you know when the granola is done cooking, then walk away and go about your business. That’s how easy it is to toast granola in a slow cooker! Just remember to come back every half hour or so to stir everything up so that it doesn’t clump or stick.As the dry oats cook, they will absorb the wet ingredients and spices, infusing them with flavor.
Cook times may vary between different slow cooker models. Keep an eye on the granola as it cooks. You’ll be able to tell when it’s done, as all visible moisture will have been absorbed or cooked out., When your timer goes off, turn off the slow cooker and remove the lid, giving it one last stir. Lift one end of the cooker and use your spatula to scrape out the cooked granola. Spread the granola onto a nonstick baking pan or sheet of wax paper to let it cool until it reaches room temperature, then store or serve and enjoy!The granola will get even crunchier as it cools and dries.
Your slow cooker will likely still be hot, even after it’s been sitting for awhile. Make sure you use oven mitts to keep from burning yourself.

, While the granola is cooling, feel free to toss in a couple handfuls of raisins, dried cranberries or blueberries, coconut flakes, chocolate chips or other miscellaneous extras. These types of additives can lend some delicious complexity to your granola by playing off the sweet and earthy flavors of the grains.Keep your mix-ins fresh by adding them after you cook the granola.
Chill mix-ins like chocolate prior to adding them to the granola to prevent them from melting.

, Whenever a batch of granola is ready to come out of the slow cooker, transfer it to a large piece of Tupperware or some other enclosed container. This will help keep it fresh for a week or longer. Leave the container in the refrigerator or on a pantry shelf at room temperature.If you don’t plan on using your granola right away, you can even freeze it and keep it for up to 2 months.
After a couple of weeks, unused granola can become stale and lose its crispness.

, Pour a bowl of fresh granola and munch on it just like you would regular dry cereal. Granola makes a great nutritious alternative to sugary breakfast cereals that doesn’t come up short on flavor. Add some cold milk and top with slices of fresh fruit, or simply savor it plain.Serve granola with a muffin or toast and jam and a steaming mug of coffee.
The balance of carbohydrates, proteins and dietary fiber make granola a smart way to start your day., Try adding crunchy granola to a yogurt parfait, apple crisp or Acai bowl. With its pleasant crunch and subtle hints of sweetness, granola makes an ideal topping, especially when paired with mix-ins that complement the other flavors you’re enjoying.Health-conscious eaters can substitute ingredients like flax seeds, sunflower kernels and quinoa for starchy oats.Make granola one of the ingredients on a self-serve ice cream bar this summer.

, Combine granola with dried fruit, whole nuts, butter, brown sugar and salt, heat in the oven and cut it into squares.

Instead of milk, try your favorite brand of plain yoghurt (or flavoured if your prefer extra sweetness) for probiotic benefits and a different flavor and texture.

, One excellent method of changing up the texture of your muesli is to soak it overnight in milk, yoghurt, or another softener of your choice. Add equal parts of muesli and milk to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, or a lid, and refrigerate overnight. This can turn the muesli into a cold porridge type mixture that many people really enjoy.Coconut milk makes for a great soaking mixture, adding gentle sweetness and subtle flavor to the muesli. If you're not crazy about the taste, you could also mix it in with a little milk to make it more palatable.

, If you favor a smoothie instead of cereal, muesli makes for a great addition or topping, either before or after mixing it up. It mixes in quite nicely and helps to add texture and nutrition to any smoothie recipe. Try the following simple mixture:


A handful of frozen strawberries, or your favorite frozen fruit
One half cup of yoghurt or kefir
One half cup of shredded coconut
Two tablespoons of muesli

, If you're lactose-intolerant, or just want to mix up your muesli experience with a different texture or flavor, applesauce makes for a great alternative. Try unsweetened natural applesauce, or cook down some over-ripe apples yourself to keep it healthy.

, One of the things some people like about muesli is the thing some people don't like about muesli. The raw oats offer a different texture and nutritional benefits not offered by cooked oatmeal or granola, but also offer the possibility of cooking into a simple porridge, just like basic raw oats.


Boil as much milk and water as you want to yield in cooked muesli, then add half as much muesli to the pot. If you want a cup of cooked muesli, in other words, boil a half cup of water and a half cup of milk, then add a half cup of raw muesli to it.
Lower the temperature and cook the muesli covered for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reaches the desired consistency. Eat it any time it looks good.

, While it may sound odd, another good lactose-free possibility is orange juice, apple juice, or even–brace yourself–some coffee. Think of it like a total-breakfast. You might surprise yourself with how good it actually tastes.

Try the original Bircher-Benner recipe.,
Add sweetener, if necessary.,
Bake or toast the muesli slightly.,
Make muesli bars.,
Add muesli to baking batters.",How to Eat Muesli2," Muesli was originally invented by a Swiss physicians named Maximilian Bircher-Benner. While most modern versions of muesli have a high oat-to-fruit ratio, the original was more fruit and nut heavy. His original recipe for the healthy mixture used the following ratios:


1 tablespoon rolled oats, soaked in 2–3 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon cream
1 large, sour apple, finely grated and mixed in directly before serving
Top with 1 tablespoon ground hazelnuts or almonds

, For some people, basic muesli can be a little bland. If you want to sweeten it up a bit, try adding a small amount of sweetener to your mixture to make it more satisfying. Whatever you use, use it conservatively. All of the following make great sweeteners or light seasoning:


Honey
Molasses
Brown sugar
Cinnamon
Toasted coconut
Lemon Juice
Agave syrup
Maple syrup
Nutmeg

, If you'd like your muesli mixture to be a little more crunchy, try baking it on a cookie sheet at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes, or until the mixture becomes golden brown. It might be helpful to add a small amount of coconut oil, or melted butter to the muesli, to encourage browning.

, One great way of making your muesli mobile is to mold it into bars that you can eat on the go. Mix muesli with a few tablespoons of peanut butter, or your favorite nut butter, to act as a binder, and add whatever add-ins you want. Additional dried fruit, nuts, and other cereals all work great.


Press the mixture into a baking pan, about an inch-thick, and let it chill thoroughly in the fridge. Cut into bars and keep them in the refrigerator for a quick snack.
You can also use melted butter and honey as a binder, pressing the mixture into a pan and letting it firm up.

, Muesli can be used as a replacement for any recipe that calls for rolled oats or oatmeal. Cookies, muffins, and even pancakes can be made a little more healthful and tasty with the addition of a small amount of muesli. Try replacing the oats with muesli in any of the listed recipes below:

Decide on the type of muesli you want to create.",How to Make Muesli1," Muesli can closely follow traditional muesli varieties, or you can depart from the basics and build on it make the exact type of muesli that you enjoy the most. This article presents a few choices but feel free to experiment beyond the recipes to find your own style.


Basic muesli (wheat free)
Bircher-Benner's ""real"" muesli

Swiss style muesli (a variation on the Bircher-Benner muesli)
Toasted muesli
Flavored muesli
Stylized muesli (for example, sultana-nut or raisin-nut muesli, tropical muesli, apricot muesli, chocolate muesli, etc.)

Buy the ingredients.,
Prepare the storage.,
Mix the muesli ingredients.,
Mix well.,
Enjoy your homemade muesli.",How to Make Muesli2," When purchasing the ingredients, look for the best quality. Go to a health food store or market that you can trust has a rapid turnover in its bulk goods. Ask about the origin and quality of the items if this is not evident to you.


Purchase organic grain where possible. The possibilities include: oat flakes (traditional), rye flakes, barley flakes, rice flakes, and spelt flakes.
Look for organic and/or unsulfured dried fruits. These will be better for you and the lack of sulfur is good for people who have a reaction to sulfur, such as asthmatics.
Prefer organic nuts and seeds where possible. It is even better if you can purchase the nuts and seeds in their shells, as this guarantees their freshness. Note that peanuts and cashews are not nuts but still make a great addition if liked.
For the milk and yogurt additions, again organic makes a good choice. If you don't use dairy products, look for alternatives such as soy, oat, and nut-based milks and yogurts.
Don't buy too much. It is best to buy enough ingredients to make enough muesli to last a few weeks, and then to stock up again. This will ensure freshness and enable you to consume the muesli within a short period of time.;
, Muesli needs to be stored in an airtight container to maintain its freshness. Find a suitable airtight container (for example, a plastic cereal container with lid, an extra large resealable freezer bag, or a glass jar with a close-fitting lid, etc.). Store in a cool, dark place.

, It is easiest to mix the ingredients in a large bowl and then transfer it to the container. However, if your container is large enough to shake the ingredients around, you can add direct (see following step). If you're making muesli intuitively, ensure that the bulk of the muesli is grain, with the other ingredients added in quantities that suit your needs. Remember that dried fruit is high in calories and fructose, so keep these to a minimum. Alternatively, follow the more precise amounts outlined in the recipes provided with this article.


Cut larger dried fruit, such as dried apricots or apples, into smaller pieces to make it go further. Smaller dried fruit, like raisins and dried cherries, can go in whole. Dried fruits can also be expensive, and you only need a little piece to flavor a bite of muesli.

, A good method is to leave some space at the top of your container, then close it tightly and slowly turn it upside down. Turn it right side up again and repeat until well mixed.

, You can add milk to it or enjoy it with some yogurt and fresh fruit (prepare those separately). See the following recipes for additional ideas on eating muesli with yogurt and fruit.

You can substitute your favorite nut for the almonds, such as walnuts or cashews. However, it’s important to chop them more finely because most nuts are much thicker than slivered almonds.

, Add 3 tablespoons (64 g) of honey, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of canola oil, 1 tablespoon (14 g) of melted butter, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla to a separate small bowl. Mix the ingredients well so they’re fully combined.If you prefer, you can substitute agave nectar for the honey.

, Once you’ve mixed the liquid ingredients together, pour them into the oats mixture. Mix the ingredients together well so they’re all fully combined.The dough may be slightly sticky when you’re finished mixing.
The dough is often easier to work with if you chill it in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes before putting it in the muffin tin.

, After you’ve mixed the dough together, use a spoon to transfer it to the cups in the greased muffin tin. Fill each cup so they’re approximately two-thirds full of the dough, and use clean fingers to press the dough against the bottom and sides of the compartments to form a cup shape.If you’re having trouble forming the dough into cup shapes, use a shot glass to press the dough into shape inside each compartment of the muffin tin.

, Once you’ve filled all of the cups in the muffin tin, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the granola cups to bake until the top edges start to brown, which should take approximately 10 to 12 minutes.If you’ve used a full size muffin tin to make the granola cups, they will need to cook for 15 to 17 minutes.

, When the granola cups are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Use a spoon to press the sides of each cup against the tin again. Allow the cups to cool completely in the tin, which should take approximately 20 minutes.It’s important to allow the granola cups to cool before removing them from the muffin tin because they crumble more easily when they’re warm.

, When the granola cups have cooled completely, use clean fingers to carefully lift them from the tin. If any of the cups won’t come loose, use a large fork to gently pry them out.Even when they’re cooled, the granola cups are fairly fragile. Handle them as gently as possible.

, If you’re ready to eat a granola cup, add your favorite type of yogurt. Spoon it into the cup carefully to avoid breaking it.If you want to use the granola cups for dessert, you can fill them with your favorite pudding, mousse, or even ice cream.

, After you’ve filled the granola cups with yogurt, sprinkle your favorite toppings over them. Fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, or orange segments, is an ideal option. You can also top the granola cups with your favorite chopped nuts, such as almonds or walnuts, and drizzle a little honey over them.If you want to top your granola cups with larger fruits, such as apples, bananas, or strawberries, dice them into smaller pieces so they’ll fit more easily.
If you’re not ready to use all of the granola cups right away, store them in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for 1 to 2 weeks.
You can also freeze the unfilled cups. Place them in zippered freezer bags, and store for up to 3 months.

Serve hot.",How to Cook Lugaw1," Rinse both the glutinous (sticky) rice and long-grained rice in cool, clean water. Drain the water when done.


Pour the rice into a large glass bowl and add roughly three times as much water to the bowl.
Use your hands to move the rice around the bowl while it is still submerged under the water.
Pour the contents of the bowl through a fine-mesh colander. Discard the water and save the rice.;
, Pour the cooking oil into a medium saucepan with tall sides and a heavy bottom. Set the saucepan on the stove over medium heat.


Allow the oil to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds before proceeding.

, Add the minced garlic and sliced ginger to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes.


The two ingredients should become lightly toasted and notably fragrant during this time.
Watch the garlic and ginger closely to prevent them from burning.

, Place the rinsed rice in the saucepan and pour the stock on top. Stir well to combine.


Scrape the bottom and sides of the pot as you stir its contents. Doing so will minimize the risk of rice sticking to the pan.
Most lugaw recipes use homemade stock, but a high-quality commercial broth can offer just as much flavor. Some cooks even prefer to use plain water instead of stock or broth, but doing so will create a much blander taste.

, If you want to season the lugaw, you should add any desired fish sauce (Patis) and black pepper now.


This step is only optional. You do not need to add either seasoning to the dish.
If you aren't sure how much to use, start by adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) fish paste. You can add more throughout the process as desired to suit your tastes.

, Bring the lugaw to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 30 to 60 minutes, or until the grains of rice become notably puffy.The overall texture of the dish should be very thick when finished.
Stir the contents of the saucepan frequently during the cooking process. Doing so causes the rice to release more starch, thereby creating a thicker lugaw.
If the contents of the saucepan look too thick before the rice has fully expanded, you can add more broth. Add additional broth in 1/2 cup (125 ml) measurements.
You can taste test the lugaw as it cooks, too, adding more pepper or fish paste as needed.

, Once the lugaw is ready, remove it from the heat and immediately ladle it into serving dishes. Enjoy this dish while it is still steaming hot.


If desired, you may want to garnish each serving with roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of rousong or crispy ""pork floss.""If pork floss does not appeal to you, consider garnishing each portion with a little chopped green onion.

",How to Flavor Oatmeal," For this recipe, it is best to start out with unflavored, plain oatmeal, or oatmeal that is flavored with maple and brown sugar. Anything else would take away from this recipe.

, Then, slice vertically to dice the banana pieces. Put these pieces into the oatmeal.

, The nuts will make a good combination with the banana and other fruits which will be added.

, Don't dice them so small that they are reduced to pulp. You want to make the oatmeal look appetizing. Dice them into small pieces, but if you cannot make them very small without making them pulp, then don't dice them any further.

, Add these into the oatmeal too.

, They add a lot of flavor to the oatmeal. Other dried fruits such as apricots and apple will really work too - but be careful, because these can be high in sugar.

To rinse the rice, pour it into a large glass bowl and cover it with three times as much water. Use your hands to gently move and scrub the rice while it is submerged.
Pour the rice and water through a fine mesh colander to drain it. Set the rice aside until needed.

, Pour the vegetable oil into a large stockpot with a heavy bottom. Set it over medium heat on the stove.


Give the oil 30 to 60 seconds to heat up before continuing.

, Toss the minced garlic, diced onion, and sliced ginger into the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes.The three ingredients should become lightly toasted and very fragrant.
Temporarily remove these three ingredients from the pot after you've released their flavors into the oil. Place them in a separate dish and set them aside.

, Place the cut up chicken in the same stockpot and no more than 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 5 to 10 minutes.


Occasionally stir the contents of the stockpot during this step to prevent the chicken from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
Continue cooking until the chicken has released enough liquid to produce an approximate total of 1 cup (250 ml) liquid at the bottom of the stockpot.

, Toss the previously sauteed ginger, onion, and garlic back into the stockpot. Add the soy sauce and fish sauce, as well.


Stir everything together to distribute the flavors more evenly. Cook on medium-high for another 2 minutes.

, Add the remaining water to the stockpot. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.


The chicken pieces must be completely submerged in liquid.
After you reduce the heat, the liquid should still continue at a gentle simmer.

, Cover the stockpot and simmer over low to medium-low heat for 2 hours.Taste test the liquid after you've finished simmering it. If necessary, add more fish sauce or soy sauce to suit your personal flavor preferences.

, Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the chicken pieces from the stockpot. Set them aside in a separate bowl, allowing them to cool to the touch.


When you remove the chicken, take as little liquid as possible with it.

, Pour the clean rice into the stockpot of liquid. Mix well, then increase the heat to medium and simmer for 20 to 40 minutes.


The grains of rice should become puffy and the porridge should thicken up.
If the lugaw becomes too thick during this time, you can add more water. Add extra water to the porridge 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time.

, While the rice porridge simmers, use two forks to shred the cooked chicken off its bones.


Reserve the chicken meat and discard the bones.
The chicken should be relatively easy to shred at this point since it has cooked for such a long time.

, When the lugaw reaches your desired thickness, add the shredded chicken. Mix well to spread the chicken pieces throughout the entire dish.


You should be able to add the entire shredded chicken, but if you want your lugaw to have less chicken in it, you can add a smaller portion of shredded chicken and save the rest for another use.

, Ladle the finished lugaw into individual serving bowls and enjoy while it is still hot.


Chicken lugaw is usually served with slices of hard boiled egg, a sprinkling of minced green onion, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. All of these garnishes are only optional, however.

, Spoon into bowls and stir in the toppings of your choice. In order to avoid overcooking the oats, try these tips and tricks before you cook your first batch of overnight oats:


Try the same recipe in your crock pot or slow-cooker during the day, not overnight. Keep an eye on the oats and begin checking for doneness after 5 hours. This way, you'll learn how long it takes to cook oats using your hardware. If you have a slow-cooker with a clear top, you can eyeball the oats. If you have to open the pot in order to check for doneness, know that this will add approximately 30 minutes to your cooking time.
Plug your crock pot or slow-cooker into an on/off light timer if you don't have a programmable slow-cooker. Set the on/off timer to the time it usually takes you to cook your overnight oats, and you have a life-hacked programmable slow-cooker.

",How to Make Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal1," This recipe will be enough to make two servings.;
, Be sure to cover the pot with a lid so that the steam does not escape. This will take about 5 to 8 minutes.

, You can choose to peel the apple first, or leave it unpeeled. The pieces should be a little smaller than bite-sized.

, During this time, the sugar will caramelize and the apples will soften. Depending on how big the apple pieces are, you may have to cook them a little longer., You can do this using a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Make sure that the apple pieces are evenly mixed in.

, At the point, the oatmeal is ready to eat, but you can give it some extra flavor and texture by adding some yummy toppings. Here are some ideas to get you started:1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons (30 grams) toasted pecans
2 tablespoons (30 grams) granola
½ cup (120 milliliters) milk

Keep all receipts and warranty information.",How to Choose a Toaster Oven," Using an extension cord with a toaster oven is a fire hazard, so it's important to plug the unit directly into the wall. Look around your kitchen to find available space within a foot or two of an outlet.;
, There are models that mount to the bottom of a cabinet if you want to free up counter space, but these can be difficult to install, and typically don't offer as much capacity or as many features for the price.If you want a countertop model but are short on space, find a spot in a cabinet or closet to store your toaster oven when not in use.

, Use a tape measure or ruler to measure the length, height, and width of the space where you plan to place your toaster oven. Be sure to write down these numbers to refer back to while you’re shopping.


If you plan to store it when not in use, you'll want to measure your storage space as well as your counter space.

, If you mainly plan to make toast or heat up leftovers, you don't need to spend money on a large toaster oven with lots of special features. But if your toaster oven is a stand-in for a full-sized oven, you may need to spend more to get a unit with broil or convection capabilities., A compact toaster oven is also a good choice if you tend to only make single servings of food at a time. If space is not an issue, however, a larger unit will expand your cooking options to casseroles, pizzas, and whole roasted chickens.


Look at both internal and external dimensions. The external dimensions should be able to fit in the space you measured in your kitchen, and the internal dimensions should be able to fit your largest or most used baking dish.
Check the capacity, both in terms of how many slices of toast it can make at once and how many cubic feet of space are inside. A capacity of 0.6 cubic feet (.01 cubic meters) is generally enough to roast a whole chicken.The Breville Compact Toaster Oven is a well-rated model that's considered compact (0.8 cubic feet or .02 cubic meters), has a variety of programming options, and can make 6 slices of toast at once., Some models allow you to defrost or reheat food if you need an alternative to using a microwave oven for these tasks. Others allow you to use convection heating (blowing hot air around the food to cook it faster) or rotisserie cooking (rotating meats on a spit). Some of these features may only be found on more expensive models.Choose a toaster oven with a broil setting if you frequently cook meat.
Select one with convection heating if you want to cook food more quickly using less energy.
The Panasonic FlashXpress is a well-reviewed compact model that has fast cook times and offers shade control to get the perfect amount of color on your toast. It does not, however, offer a broil setting., Any good toaster oven will have a rack that you can move up or down to accommodate different pans and foods. There should also be a crumb tray at the bottom that you can slide in and out for easy cleaning., Auto shut-off is a good feature if you think you'll forget to turn your toaster oven off after using it. And cheaper models may have timers that only go up to 30 or 60 minutes, so look for timers that run longer if you want to cook large foods like whole chickens. Other special features to consider are a light on the inside that will allow you to see when your food is done cooking or a curved back that will accommodate a full 12-inch pizza.Some models offer so many functions that they serve as an oven, toaster oven, and microwave all in one, such as the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven. But this comes with a steep price tag at about $600.Budget models run from about $25 to $50, but usually offer few features beyond toasting. The Hamilton Beach Toastation (about $37) allows you to toast bread in the slots on top or toast a sandwich inside the shallow oven below, but there's no timer or broil function on this unit., Once you have an idea of what you want, look up toaster ovens through online sources like Consumer Reports and ConsumerSearch. They will list the various features of toaster oven models available on the market and you’ll be able to read reviews about their actual performance.

, Discount stores, department stores, warehouse stores and cooking product stores are all good places to find toaster ovens. Bargains can be found online, but looking at the model in person will allow you to test out some of the features.


Twist knobs, open the door, and slide the rack in and out to see if you like how it all works together.

, Once you think you know which model you want to buy, see what will be included, such as extra baking, broiling, or roasting pans. These can be purchased individually, so the lack of extra pans should not dissuade you from buying the model you want, but it may help you decide if you're wavering between two options., You never know if the appliance you buy will be defective or break soon after you buy it. If this happens within the warranty window, you should be able to get a replacement or a repair free of charge."

, At this point, your oatmeal is ready to be baked, but you can add some extra goodies for more flavor and texture. Here are some ideas to get you started:2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) vanilla extract
½ cup (75 grams) raisins
¼ cup (60 milliliters) maple syrup

, Choose a glass casserole dish, if you can; the oatmeal will cook more evenly. If you'd like to make individual servings instead, fill a muffin pan with cupcake liners instead. This will be enough to make about 16 muffins.

, Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture, and spread it evenly. If you are making individual servings, scoop the mixture into the cupcake liners instead.

, If you are baking the oatmeal in a muffin tin, bake it for only 30 minutes instead.These oatmeal muffins will be more dry than the oatmeal casserole.

, You can serve the oatmeal as is, or you can add a splash of milk or ½ cup (65 grams) of chopped walnuts over the top first.

Determine what you will juice.,
Consider the price.,
Think about juicing speed.,
Look for easy cleaning.,
Decide if you can handle some noise.",How to Choose a Juicer1," A centrifugal juicer is an excellent choice for juicing most vegetables, and almost any fruit. Most centrifugal juices can juice spinach or other greens, but they are not very efficient at doing so. Additionally, most centrifugal juicers cannot juice wheatgrass. If you plan use primarily juicy fruits and veggies, then a centrifugal juicer may be a great choice for you.;
, Centrifugal juicers are very reasonably priced. This is the primary benefit of a centrifugal juicer (over the more high-end masticating juicers). Centrifugal juicers start for as little as $20, but they may run as expensive as $200. Higher end models can typically handle whole pieces of produce, and yield more juice. Look for a model that fits your budget., Centrifugal juicers work fast. These speedy machines are excellent for preparing yourself a quick glass of fresh juice each morning. If juicing is something you plan to do often, and if you are short on time, a fast-moving centrifugal model may be right for you., The worst part about making juice is cleaning the juicer. Fortunately, with a centrifugal juicer (unlike with most masticating models), the cleaning can be easy! Look for a model that easily snaps apart and rinses clean with minimal effort.A good choice is the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer.Any of the Breville models are also notable easy to clean., One drawback to centrifugal juicers is that they tend toward the noisier side. The noise produced by the average centrifugal juicer is on par with a typical blender, food processor, or coffee grinder. Fortunately, centrifugal juicers are much faster than other models, so your juicing time, noisy though it may be, will fly right by."

Think about your health.,
Decide if you want to juice greens.,
Determine if you’d like to juice wheatgrass.,
Factor in a reduction in food waste.,
Store your juice longer.,
Make pasta or baby food.",How to Choose a Juicer2," If your primary reason for wanting to juice is better health, then a masticating juicer is probably the best choice for you. Sometimes called “cold press” or “slow” juicers, masticating juicers use a low rpm motor which best retains the nutritional value of your fruits, veggies, and greens., Although some higher-end centrifugal juicers can tackle leafy greens (like spinach or kale), the process is extremely inefficient. If you plan to juice a lot of greens, your best bet is a masticating juicer. This slower, low rpm process extracts the most juice from leafy greens., Whereas centrifugal juicers can technically juice leafy greens (albeit inefficiently), they definitely can’t take on wheatgrass. If wheatgrass is something you’d like to include in your juice regimen, you will need a masticating juicer., The biggest drawback to masticating juicers is almost certainly the price. (The typical masticating model will run you upwards of $200.) However, something else to keep in mind when considering the price is the fact that a masticating juicer will give you more bang for your buck (or more juice for your carrot). If you use your juicer often enough, you will recuperate your money over time., Because of the low rpm process used by masticating juicers, very little heat is introduced into the juice. As a result, you can store your fresh juices for up to 48 hours, without losing any of the nutritional value. (Unlike juice produced by centrifugal models, which begins losing nutritional value right away.) This can be a huge perk, and in some ways makes up for the time lost on the slower juicing process. , Many masticating juicers offer extra features. (Sometimes these are included, but other times they cost extra). This may include accessories you can use to mince, grind, and puree. This can enable you to make fresh pasta, homemade baby food, pesto, or other foods.

Determine your budget.,
Consider a hand juicer for value and ease of use.,
Think about a manual press for efficiency and durability.,
Opt for an electric citrus juicer for speed.,
Look for a model with a pulp-selection feature.",How to Choose a Juicer3," Citrus juicers vary widely in price, with simple hand juicers ranging from $5 to $20, manual presses running about $50, and electric citrus juicers running anywhere from $20 to $150. Knowing how much you are willing to spend can help you determine what type of citrus juicer to choose.

, Certainly the simplest and most cost-effective option when it comes to orange juice is a good-old hand juicer. These non-electronic, plastic or metal kitchen tools are perfect if you only need to make a glass or two of juice. They take up almost no space in your kitchen; they are cheap and easy to clean. Many models (such as the ChefVantage Citrus Juicer) come with a measuring cup or pitcher built-in.

, Take a peak inside any gourmet kitchen, and you will likely find a manual citrus press. These durable, often stainless steel tools are efficient at extracting the juices from lemons, oranges, or other citrus fruits. These non-electronic devices are also aesthetically pleasing; a manual citrus press looks great on your counter top., Most electric citrus juicers are sort of like hybrids of centrifugal juicers and manual citrus presses. You place half of your citrus fruit onto a ribbed reamer and press down, activating a motor which causes a spinning motion. This is an extremely quick and effective method for juicing citrus and results in a delicious, high-quality juice., If you’ve ever purchased orange juice from the store, you probably know that there are a lot of different preferences when it comes to pulp. You can aim to satisfy the needs of everyone in your household by selecting an electric juicer with a pulp-selection feature. This feature allows you to choose how much pulp goes into your juice, and it is one benefit of using an electric citrus juicer over a manual one.One choice is the Proctor Silex Alex’s Lemonade Stand Citrus Juicer.
Another option is the Black & Decker CJ625 Citrus Juicer.

Heat up a bowl of oatmeal with your favorite fruits or nuts.,
Add oatmeal to bread or muffins.,
Mix oatmeal into your yogurt or breakfast smoothie.,
Make oatmeal pancakes.",How to Enrich Your Diet with Oatmeal1," A bowl of oatmeal is a tried and true standard, especially in winter months. Because it's so versatile, you can use anything you like to flavor it, meaning oatmeal never has to be boring.Quick oatmeal is just as healthy as steel-cut oats, which take longer to prepare. This means you can feel free to use the quicker variety, although you may want to stay away from the microwaveable instant variety, which typically includes added sugar and sodium.
If you want to sweeten your oatmeal, use honey or a little maple syrup, both of which are healthier sweeteners than refined sugar. You also might try spices, such as cinnamon and nutmeg. You can add fresh or dried fruits, such as bananas, blueberries, or strawberries. Nuts also mix well with oatmeal for breakfast, especially almonds, which add a healthy protein boost.
If you prefer a bowl of cold cereal, you can add a healthy dash of oats by mixing in old-fashioned or quick oats, or buying a cold cereal made with oat bran or oat flour.;
, If you don't feel like a bowl of oatmeal, or you can't handle a hot breakfast during the warmer months, you can still get your morning dose of oatmeal by adding a dash of oatmeal to your favorite bread or muffin recipe.If you're not baking yourself, you typically can find oat bread and muffins at grocery stores or bakeries.
If you're making your own, look for recipes that include various fruits and nuts if you want to add a dash of flavor or variety.

, Oatmeal mixes well in plain yogurt or a fruit smoothie to add filling fiber to these quicker breakfast options. If you mix your oatmeal into yogurt the night before and put the mixture in the fridge, the yogurt will soften the oats overnight

, You can use oat flour to make pancakes the same way you normally would. Substitute oat flour for other flours, or look online for specific oatmeal pancake recipes to find something you might like.Oatmeal pancakes can be a good alternative if you don't enjoy a bowl of oatmeal on its own.
Just as with regular pancakes, you can easily add fruits and spices to sweeten oatmeal pancakes or add flavor.

Avoid glass.,
Choose the right kind of plastic.,
Opt for wood.,
Choose a bamboo board for sustainability.",How to Choose a Cutting Board1," Glass cutting boards are a popular choice because they look nice in your kitchen. However, glass cutting boards have been shown to dull brand new kitchen knives in as little as 10 strokes. If you happen to have a glass cutting board, use it as a serving platter or cheese tray instead.Other hard cutting board materials—like marble, granite, ceramic, and composite—can do similar damage to your knives, and should be avoided.;
, Plastic cutting boards can be a great option. They are affordable, easy to clean, and safe for knives. However, not all plastic boards are the same!Avoid slick or smooth plastic, as this can cause knives to slip.
Acrylic plastic boards can do almost as much damage to your knives as glass.
Plastic cutting boards made of polyethylene or polypropylene are the best choice.
A good choice is the Oxo Carving and Cutting Board for $24.99 (available at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Sur la Table, and JC Penny).

, Wood cutting boards are the classic choice. These are far and away the most popular cutting boards for chefs and amateurs alike. Wood cutting boards are lovely, they last a long time, and they are great for your knives. Wood cutting boards are available in many types of wood, including oak, maple, and teak.Teak is a great option because it absorbs very little liquid, so it will take longer for the board to wear out.
A good choice is the Proteak Edge Grain Teak Cutting Board for $92.59 (available on Amazon).

, Bamboo cutting boards are very similar to wood boards. They last a long time, they are wonderful for your knives, and they are lovely to have out in your home. Additionally, bamboo boards are a sustainable, environmentally friendly choice, since bamboo is a fast-growing, highly renewable resource.Bamboo boards are lighter in weight than wood boards.
Bamboo boards don’t need to be oiled as often as wood boards.
A good choice is the Totally Bamboo 20-7930 3-Piece Cutting Board Set for $15 (on Amazon).

Buy or make oatmeal cookies.,
Substitute rolled oats for flour in baked goods.,
Make your own granola.,
Add oatmeal to a fruit smoothie.",How to Enrich Your Diet with Oatmeal2," If you're looking for a sweet treat, oatmeal cookies are a quick and easy staple that may be one of the healthiest cookies you can eat. Traditionally raisins are included, but you can add whatever dried fruit, nuts, or other flavors you like.If you're not much of a baker yourself, you can find oatmeal cookies at any grocery store. Try to buy the ones from the store's bakery rather than the commercial cookies found in the center aisles, which may have artificial flavors, preservatives, and added sugar.
Oatmeal cookies typically are gluten-free, but if you're buying packaged cookies in the store and you're on a gluten-free diet, check labels carefully to make sure.

, If you're up to experiment, try swapping out the flour in your favorite cake or muffin recipe for a healthier snack (or dessert) than the traditional recipe. You also can find specific recipes online that incorporate oatmeal.Oat muffins often have a more savory flavor, but you also can make them sweeter by adding blueberries or cranberries and sweeter spices, such as cinnamon and nutmeg.
Oat muffins or biscuits also can be eaten alongside a bowl of soup, instead of bread or crackers.

, Homemade granola has a variety of uses. You can bake it into bars, sprinkle it over other snacks or desserts, blend it into smoothies, or shake it into a trail mix with dried fruits and nuts.You can find numerous granola recipes online using oatmeal. Most of them have relatively few ingredients and are relatively simple.
You can make a sweet trail mix with chocolate, dried fruit, and coconut. You also can go the salty or savory route by mixing in seeds and nuts.

, Adding oatmeal to your favorite fruit smoothie has a thickening effect. It also adds plenty of healthy fiber so the smoothie is more filling than it would otherwise be, providing a sustaining burst of energy and nutrition.Mixing oatmeal in your smoothie can be especially helpful for a fuel-up snack before you test your endurance with a long-distance run or bike ride.
Let the oats soak in water or milk for a few minutes before pouring them into your blender with the rest of your ingredients, so they'll blend smoothly.

Thicken your soups with oatmeal.,
Make oatmeal fritters.,
Bake oatmeal bread.,
Use oatmeal in poultry stuffings.,
You can substitute oatmeal for bread in dishes such as meatloaf.",How to Enrich Your Diet with Oatmeal3," If you're making a pureed soup, such as tomato soup, you can use oats rather than the slice of white bread that many recipes call for. You may have to experiment to find the right amount of oats for the type of soup you're making.One slice of bread is roughly the equivalent of a half-cup (45 grams) of oats.For tomato-based soups, use only half the amount of oats you would use in other soups. Otherwise the oats will dull the flavor of the tomatoes and the consistency won't be right.

, A single bowl of oatmeal will make about five fritters, which you can eat for a quick lunch, or as a side dish with dinner. Many recipes online call for cheese and sesame seeds, but you can experiment with many different seeds, nuts, dried fruit, and spices.You'll want to make meatball-sized balls of the oatmeal, which you can then roll in any spices or roasted seeds that you like. Use a splash of water and an egg white to help get your fritters wet and hold them together.
Cook your fritters in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
Once your fritters are done, you can drizzle them with your favorite sauce, sprinkle sea salt or spices on them, or top them with a poached egg.

, You can use either quick or old-fashioned oats to make oatmeal bread. Since it typically also includes all-purpose flour, oatmeal bread is not necessarily gluten-free. If you're sensitive to gluten, you may want to look for gluten-free recipes.Oatmeal bread typically is light and tender, and works well both for sandwiches as well as toast.
If you don't want to bake your own bread, you may be able to find oatmeal bread at the supermarket or at specialty bakeries.

, Most poultry stuffings include bread, but oatmeal can be readily substituted to make a moist, thick stuffing. This version of stuffing originates in Scotland, where it's also called Skirlie.In Scotland, Skirlie is not only used as a poultry stuffing but also as a regular side dish, or mixed in with meat stews or mashed potatoes. You can also simply top it with a poached egg and enjoy it as a savory meal unto itself.
Oats also can be used instead of breadcrumbs to coat meat before frying., Make the dish even healthier by using a lean meat such as lean ground beef, ground turkey, or even bison."

Select two cutting boards.,
Use plastic boards for meat or fish.,
Select wood or bamboo for produce.",How to Choose a Cutting Board2," Most chefs advocate for keeping at least two cutting boards at home: one wood and one plastic. This enables you to keep raw protein away from fruits and vegetables and maintain a sanitary work environment., Bacteria from raw meat are best kept away from your fruits and vegetables. As such, it is best to use a separate cutting board for these foods. Additionally, the oils from fish can sometimes seep into wood fibers and leave a lasting smell on your wood cutting boards. Consider keeping a plastic cutting board at home to use for meat and fish.A thin plastic cutting board can be placed on top of a wood board for ease of use.

, Wood (or bamboo) cutting boards are the best choice for fruits and vegetables. These boards are built to last, and will also help extend the life of your knives.Cooked meats are also safe to carve on your wood (or bamboo) cutting board.

Avoid cutting boards with “feet.” You want to get the most out of your cutting board, and this means being about to use both sides.,
Select the right size.,
Choose between end-grain or edge-grain.,
Consider the level of maintenance required.",How to Choose a Cutting Board3," Stay away from cutting boards that have “feet” on the bottom, or are otherwise not reversible. By using both sides, you essentially get two cutting boards in one., Experts chefs suggest choosing a cutting board that is 15 by 20 inches (38 to 50 cm) in size. This gives you plenty of room to work safely and effectively as you cut., When opting for a wood or bamboo cutting board, you will have the opportunity to choose end-grain (meaning the board is grafted from many small pieces of wood in a checkerboard pattern) or edge-grain (meaning the strips of wood are laid side-by-side).


In bamboo boards, edge-grain boards are sturdier, and have been shown to last longer.In wood boards, end-grain boards are a bit easier on knives.Ultimately, choosing end-grain or edge-grain will come down to the look you want for your kitchen., By and large, wood cutting boards are the best choice for durability, beauty, and protection of your knives (with bamboo as a close second). However, wood (or bamboo) cutting boards can be cumbersome to wash, and they need to be oiled regularly. Plastic cutting boards, on the other hand, are often dishwasher safe and require no additional maintenance. If you do not have the time to regularly maintain your cutting board, plastic may be a better choice for you."

Assess the age of the wood stove.,
Ask the previous owner about the maintenance schedule followed.,
Check the stove for rust and metal fatigue.,
Inspect the fire bricks.,
Check the door for a tight seal.,
Check the stove's body for cracks or leaks.",How to Choose a Good Used Wood Stove," Wood stove designs have been drastically improved in recent years. New stoves heat more efficiently, producing less smoke and ash and consuming wood more slowly. There are several reasons why you should chiefly consider wood stoves that are less than about 15 years old.


Stoves more than a few decades old will likely not be UL-listed or certified by an environmental regulator, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States. This can make the stove illegal to install under many building codes. Check for a UL stamp and an EPA certification on the wood stove before buying.
To get an older stove permitted, you may have to perform extensive repair work. This can prove to be quite expensive, and will generally eclipse any savings over buying a new wood stove.;
, The condition of a used wood stove is largely dictated by how it was used and how carefully it was maintained.


Many stove parts fatigue or wear out as the stove ages. Ask the owner if they have ever replaced any parts, or if any parts do not work or fit as well as they used to.
If the stove uses catalytic combustion (whereby smoke is passed through a ceramic honeycomb-shaped assembly), ask the owner the last time they replaced the catalyst. Catalysts should be replaced every 2 to 6 years, depending on how heavily the stove has been used.
Ask the owner if they have ever over-fired the wood stove. Burning a wood stove too hot causes its parts to fatigue and warp. The owner should be able to assure you that they have monitored the temperature carefully.

, Unlike damage to smaller parts, the body of the wood stove cannot be easily or cheaply replaced. If the stove presents a whitish-gray color around its upper half, the metal is likely fatigued beyond proper use. Rust and scale should also be avoided.

, Used fire bricks will commonly display small hairline cracks, but larger cracks or crumbling bricks may indicate that the wood stove was over-fired or used very heavily. These bricks can be replaced quite inexpensively, but should be examined as an indicator of the stove's prior use.

, The door gasket is one of the quickest components of a wood stove to wear out. To check for a tight seal, shut the door over a dollar bill (or other paper currency). If you can easily pull the dollar bill out without opening the door, the gasket likely needs to be replaced.

, You can use a light bulb to test for cracks in the body of the wood stove. Turn the light bulb on (preferably using a portable work lamp) and place it inside the stove, shutting the door. Walk around the stove and check for any light visible through the stove's exterior. The light bulb can highlight faint cracks as well as indicate the integrity of all seams and seals.

Browse bread makers that make specialty items.,
Pick a product that can make gluten-free bread if necessary.,
Choose a bread maker with a viewing window.,
Consider bread makers that tell you when to add additional ingredients.",How to Choose a Bread Maker2," This is a nice feature if you want to add the ingredients before work, but want the bread to be fresh when you get home. However, you cannot use this feature with bread recipes that call for milk or eggs.

, This can be instead of or in addition to a delayed start option since it keeps the bread warm and fresh if you are not home to immediately enjoy it.

, Some can mix pizza dough or cinnamon rolls. There are bread makers that also allow you to add fruit or nuts to make different types of bread.

, Whether you are allergic to gluten, or are just trying to reduce your consumption of it, look for bread machines with a setting to make dough free of this ingredient.

, This allows you to check on the progress periodically.

, Certain models let you know when to toss in extras, such as fruit, nuts or chocolate chips.

Choose a cooktop that matches your kitchen.,
Consider the warranty.",How to Choose a Cooktop," Find out whether your kitchen uses gas or electric power. This will determine whether you can buy a gas or electric cooktop, unless you want to pay to change the power source.


Consider gas cooktops. They allow you to control the heat easily, with a range of 500 to 15,000 British thermal units (BTUs).
Research electric cooktops. Electric cooktops heat up faster than gas cooktops. However, they respond slower to heat changes. They range from 10,000 to 12,000 BTUs.;
, A cooktop with coils is the more traditional type, but smooth cooktops are becoming more popular because they are easy to clean and have a sleek appearance.

, If you tend to cook often, or make a lot of food at once, consider a cooktop with 6 burners. Otherwise, choose a cooktop with 4 burners.

, Cooktops offer burners in a variety of sizes to fit most pots and pans, with burners ranging from 7 inches (17.8 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm). If you use larger cookware, get an appliance with large burners.

, Sealed burners allow pans to stay near the flame so that they get hot while using minimal heat. Open burners heat up fast, but require more energy to cook with because pans are farther away from the blaze.

, Some cooktops offer a bridge that connects 2 burners so that larger pans can be placed on top and heated through. Other cooktops feature lights that show you when the surface is hot, or small burners ideal for heating up sauces.

, Most cooktops are either 30 inches (76.2 cm) or 36 inches (91.4 cm) wide.

, Some cooktops allow you to lift the surface to catch crumbs, while others feature removable grates to dispose of crumbs.

Locate an area where you can build an outdoor fire.,
Get a metal drum.,
Pick out wood to make into charcoal.,
Fill the drum with the cured wood.,
Prepare to light a bonfire.,
Burn the bonfire.,
Remove the lump coal.",How to Make Charcoal1," You may be able to do this in your backyard, or you may need to secure a different site with a permit. Check your city's ordinances on outdoor fires.;
, This is the container into which you'll put the wood. Choose a drum as large or as small as you'd like, depending on how much charcoal you want to make. Make sure it has a flame-proof lid.

, What type of wood do you want to use for your charcoal? Choose wood that has been cured. Cherry wood, oak wood, or hickory wood all work well.Check around to see if people in your area have wood for sale, or pick up some at a home and garden supply store. You'll need enough to fill up your drum to the top. Chop the wood into 4-inch pieces., Pack the drum tightly with wood, and fill it all the way to the top. Put the lid on the drum. It should close well enough to stay in place, but you don't want it to be airtight.

, Buy or gather extra wood to make a bonfire that will burn for 3 - 5 hours. Build it up on your chosen site. Leave a hole in the middle for the drum. Put the drum in the hole and cover it with more wood., Keep it going for at least 3 hours, more if you're using a large drum packed with wood. Let the fire completely burn out and cool down before approaching the drum.

, When you open the lid, you'll see a fresh batch of pure lump coal. Use it to grill for the rest of the summer.

Remove the charcoal.",How to Make Charcoal2," The small drum must fit in the larger one with plenty of room to spare. Using a 30 gallon (113.6 L) drum inside a 55 gallon (208.2 L) drum works well., Use a metal jigsaw blade to make a square cut in the base of the larger drum. It should be about 12 inches (30.5 cm) by 20 inches (50.8 cm). You'll need this hole to feed fuel into the drum to keep the contents hot.

, This allows the extreme heat to pass into the the smaller drum, cooking the wood inside. Drill 5 or 6 1/2-inch holes in the base of the drum.

, Cherry wood, oak wood, or hickory wood chopped into 4-inch pieces is ideal. Pack the drum tightly, then put the lid on top, cracked so moisture can come out., Place two bricks flat in the bottom of the big drum, one on each side. Stand two more bricks on their long edges on top of the flat bricks. This stand keeps the smaller drum from touching the bottom of the bigger drum, allowing you to feed fuel underneath.

, Make sure it fits well within the larger drum; if it doesn't, use smaller bricks or stones to make a smaller stand. Put the lid on the larger drum, leaving it cracked open for air flow.

, Use wood and kindling to make a fire, feeding the materials through the feeder hole in the bottom of the drum. As the fire gets going, feed it larger pieces of wood.


Keep an eye on the fire; when it gets low, feed it more wood.
You want the fire to get as hot as possible, so keep feeding dense wood.

, After 7-8 hours, the impurities, moisture, and gasses will have burned out of the wood, leaving pure charcoal behind. Let the fire burn out and the entire contraption completely cool before you approach it.

, Empty the small drum into a container and store the charcoal for later use.

Pick a pan with raised ridges.,
Choose a cast iron pan.,
Rinse and dry the pan.,
Cut your food into relatively thin slices.,
Brush oil on the food.,
Preheat the pan on medium high.,
Place your food on the pan.,
Cover the pan.,
Avoid moving food for about one minute.,
Rotate or move your food.,
Flip your food.,
Take the temperature of your food.,
Clean the pan.,
Season the pan.,
Store the pan in a dry location.",How to Use a Grill Pan," Generally, grill pans with dramatically raised ridges are better than those with gentle or shallow ridges. Ultimately, the deeper the ridges, the more dramatic your sear mark. In addition, the larger the ridges, the more grill-like your final product will appear.





;
, Cast iron pans tend to retain more heat than pans with a non-stick surface. In addition, cast iron pans tend to mimic the grill better than nonstick surfaces. Finally, cast iron pans will sear your food better than nonstick pans.

While nonstick pans are easier to clean, they won’t cook your food the same way., Before you use the pan to cook on, quickly rinse it with warm water. This will make sure any dust that accumulated on the pan while it was being stored is washed away. After rinsing, dry the pan with a clean cloth.







, Because you’re trying to simulate the grilling experience without burning your food, you’ll need to slice your food relatively thin. This way, your food will get char marks and a smoky taste but won’t burn while you’re trying to cook the inside., Before placing your food on the pan, carefully brush oil on your food. By brushing food onto the food, instead of the pan, you’ll make sure the food doesn’t stick and you’ll avoid oil burning on your pan.While you can use olive oil, it tends to burn at higher temperatures. As a result, you may want to consider vegetable oil.

, Allow the pan to heat for at least five minutes. By doing this, you’ll make sure the entire surface of the pan is equally hot. This will ensure your food cooks evenly. In addition, it’ll help you get good char/grill marks., When the pan has had sufficient time to heat up, you’ll need to gently place your food in it. Do so with tongs or other grill equipment. Allow .5 inch (1.25 cm) between large items (like pieces of chicken or steak). Make sure to place long pieces of vegetable perpendicular to the grill ridges, so they’ll lie across them instead of falling in.







, While grill pans seldom come with covers, covering the pan may increase the speed in which your food cooks. In addition, it may improve the flavor and enhance the smoky/charred flavor. To cover your pan:Use tin foil.
Sit a glass top over the pan.

, Once you place the food onto your grill pan, you shouldn’t flip it or move it for about a minute. By leaving it in place, you’ll help create those sear/grill marks that add so much character to your food., After a minute or more, you may want to rotate your food. Use tongs to rotate the food slightly if you feel it needs to be rotated. Usually, you’ll rotate it if you don’t think it’s getting evenly cooked on a given spot., Once you’ve rotated your food and allowed it to sit for several minutes, you’ll need to flip it. Flipping it is important so that you cook the food evenly. In addition, flipping your food will help prevent burning.

If you’re cooking steak that is about an inch thick, allow it to sit for 3 to 5 minutes on one side before moving or flipping.
If you’re cooking chicken that is about an inch thick, allow it to cook for 5 to 10 minutes on each side.
Allow shrimp to cook for 2 to 3 minutes before flipping.
If you notice your food charring or burning too much, flip it more. If it continues to burn, turn your heat down., If you’re cooking meat, you should take its temperature before you remove it from the pan. This way, you’ll make sure the inside of the meat has risen to minimum temperatures that will guarantee it is safe to eat. Without taking the temperature, you’ll simply be guessing about whether the food is done and safe.

Shellfish should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).
Poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).
Beef, Pork, Veal, and Lamb should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).
Ground meat should be cooked to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius)., After you’ve allowed the pan to cool, rinse it thoroughly with hot water. Then, take a clean cloth, soak it with hot water, and carefully wipe the pan down. Focus on the grooves in between the ridges. To clean them good, take your finger, cover it with the cloth and wipe along the groove. Rinse the cloth from time-to-time.









After cleaning the grill pan, dry it thoroughly with a towel. allowing it to air dry will invite rust., Before storing it, rub a light coat of vegetable oil into it with a paper towel. Doing this after each use of the pain will improve the seasoning process, increase the effectiveness of your cooking, and prolong the life of your pan.







, When storing your cast iron grill pan, you’ll want to make sure to put it in an area that is dry. If you put it in a humid location – like in an outside storage area – it could wind up rusting. As a result, try to store it in a pantry or another location that is cool and dry."

Engraved on the side of the tank should be the letters TW then a number.,
Weigh the tank on a bathroom scale to find the total current weight.,
Subtract the tank weight from the total weight to find the weight of the propane.,
Each pound of propane contains 21,600 BTUs.,
Find the BTU output of the appliance in question.,
For easy future reference.",How to Measure the Remaining Propane," This number is the empty tank weight. For example, the typical 5 gallon (18.9 L) propane tank might say TW 17.2. The weight of the empty tank in the example is 17.2 lbs.;
, Let's say that the current weight of the tank is 24.2 lbs.

, 24.2 lbs - 17.2 lbs = 7 lbs.

, Multiply the number of pounds by the number of BTUs contained in each to get the total number of BTUs remaining in the tank. 7 × 21,600 ≈ 151,000 BTUs.

, These can often be found on manufacturers web sites. For example a propane grill may burn 12,000 BTUs an hour. To find the remaining running time for the grill divide 151,000 by 12,000. 151,000 ÷ 12,000 ≈ 12.6 hours of run time.

, divide 12.6 hours by the aforementioned 7 lbs to get 1.8 hours of grill run time per pound of bathroom scale measured propane.

Smoke simple BBQ ribs.",How to Use a Charcoal Smoker," A charcoal chimney is a metal cylinder which is used to get charcoal burning before adding it to a grill or smoker. Visit your local hardware store or look for a chimney online. Add the charcoal to the chimney and light it. Let it sit for about 15 minutes.The chimney will have its own instructions which you can follow to make sure the charcoal is lit properly.
If you don’t want to invest in a charcoal chimney, it’s still important to heat the charcoal up in the smoker before you add the meat.;
, On one side of the smoker, make a pile of unlit charcoal chunks. Slowly pour the hot charcoal on top of the unlit charcoal. It’s important to set the charcoal up on one side of the smoker and then put the meat on the other side.Arranging your coals on one side and the meat on the other side of the smoker allows the meat to cook with indirect heat and smoke rather than with direct heat.
Other options include setting piles of charcoal on both sides of the smoker and placing the meat in between them or making a circle of charcoal around the outside with meat in the middle.

, Wood chunks and chips are used to give meat greater flavor. Chunks work better because they smolder for longer. Oak, apple, cherry and hickory woods are often used in smokers. Place the wood in the chimney with the charcoal, but set it off to the side of the charcoal when you add it to the smoker.Other woods can be used, but stick to hardwoods. Softwoods create a sooty smoke and will ruin the flavor of your meat.

, Smokers have a water pan included, but grills generally do not. Use a foil baking pan if you don’t have a water pan. The water pan sits in the center section of the smoker, or on the grate opposite the meat in a grill.Without the water pan, you won't get as much vapor, which helps to evenly cook your meat and vegetables.
Cold water is helpful to offset the initially higher temperature of the grill. The water helps regulate the temperature down to where you want it for the best smoking.

, If your smoker has more than one grate, put the smaller items and vegetables on the top grate. The top grate gets less heat than the lower one. Distribute the larger pieces of meat on the bottom or lower grate.

, You’re creating a flow of air through the smoker, so you want the vent to be right over the meat. By doing this, you set it up so the smoke is pulled through the smoker, and it wafts right over the meat before it exits., Your smoker should have a lower vent, which lets air into the chamber, and a lid vent, which lets the smoker out. Regulate the temperature with the lower vent, depending on the what the smoker needs. If the fire is dying, open the lower vent more. If the temperature is getting too high, close it a little.Generally, the top (exhaust) vent should be left open the whole time. Only close it if adjusting the bottom vent does not change the temp the way you need it to.

, The ideal smoker temperature is about 220℉ (104℃), but don’t let it exceed 250℉ (121℃). You can increase the temperature by adding new coals to the charcoal pile. Reduce the temperature, if necessary, by closing the lower vent a little. This allows less oxygen to enter the smoker.If your smoker doesn’t have a temperature gauge, stick the probe of an oven thermometer through a hole in the lid vent.

, Every time you take the lid off, smoke and heat escape. The best meat comes from a smoker with an even, consistent temperature. Only take the lid off if you need to add charcoal or add water to the water pan.It’s okay to check on the meat to see how it is cooking and make sure there’s enough coals, but only do this once an hour or so. Smoking is a slow and steady process.
Smoking is a fairly hands off process, so rest assured that the meat is cooking without you checking it all the time.

, If the temperature inside the smoker is starting to cool, and adjusting the lower vent doesn’t help, add more coals. It is helpful to keep an extra set of coals hot in the chimney in case you need to add them to the smoker.This works better than adding unlit charcoal on top of the spent coals.
If you don’t have a chimney, use a foil baking pan to keep some extra coals hot.

, Smoking is not an exact science. The amount of meat you’re cooking, the type of meat, and other factors affect the time it will take to get the perfect cook. Longer times at lower temperatures generally makes the meat more tender.There is a point where you've smoked meat for too long. If it cooks so long that it becomes tough all the way through, you'll realize you've cooked it for too long.

, Rub some pork chops with salt, black pepper, brown sugar, thyme, onion powder and cayenne. Let them soak in the spices for a few hours. Then, with your smoker heated to about 275°F (135°C), smoke the chops for 1 hour and ten minutes.Intensify the flavor by adding applewood chips to the coals while you smoke the meat.
Smother the pork chops in barbecue sauce before you serve them.

, Use a whole, raw chicken and smoke it with an open can of beer or soda inserted opening first into the chicken. Stand the chicken upright so the beer moistens it but doesn't spill. Smoke the chicken for 1 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on how much time you have.Add other seasonings like garlic, peppercorn, and lime juice to the can of beer.
Be sure to set the chicken to the side of the live coals, rather than directly over them.

, Choose St. Louis cut spare ribs. Marinate the ribs in your favorite BBQ sauce. Smoke the ribs for about 3 hours at 225°F (107°C). Then wrap the ribs in foil and smoke them for another 2 hours. Unwrap the ribs and smoke for 1 more hour for delicious, pull-apart ribs."

Set the roll tops aside for now.You can use any type of small rolls that you like, such as white, whole wheat, Hawaiian, or English muffins.

, When the rolls are in the baking dish, take 8 slices of colby jack cheese and place one on each roll bottom. Next, set a pre-cooked sausage patty on top of the cheese on each roll.You can substitute any type of cheese that you like for the colby jack in the sliders. Cheddar, American, pepper jack, and Munster are all good options. Vegan cheese alternatives would also work.
For a healthier breakfast slider, substitute a turkey sausage patty for the traditional pork sausage.
If you want to make a vegetarian breakfast slider, you can omit the sausage patty or substitute veggie breakfast patty.

, When the sausage patties are in place on the roll bottoms, spoon enough eggs over the sausages to cover them on each sandwich. Next, take place a piece of cooked bacon that’s been cut in half on each sandwich.You can omit substitute a piece of ham for the bacon if you prefer.
To make a healthier breakfast slider, you can substitute turkey bacon for the usual pork bacon.
If you want a vegetarian breakfast slider, switch the bacon for veggie bacon substitute.

, After you’ve added the eggs and bacon, place a slice of the remaining cheese on top of each sandwich. Next, set the roll tops on top of each slider, pressing down gently.You can add other toppings to the sandwich for more flavor. A splash of hot sauce or spoonful of salsa can give your slider a spicy kick, while a drizzle of honey can add some sweetness. Ketchup and mustard are other options.

, Add ¼ cup (57 g) of butter to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat it on high in the microwave for 30 to 40 seconds or until it melts completely.You can use either salted or unsalted butter for the glaze.

, Once the butter is melted, pour ¼ cup (79 g) of maple syrup into the bowl. Stir the two together until they’re completely combined.If you aren’t a fan of maple, you can leave the syrup out of the glaze. Plain butter will still give the sliders extra flavor.

, When the butter and maple syrup are mixed, cover all of the sandwiches with the mixture. Distribute the glaze as evenly as you can across the baking dish.You can omit the glaze entirely if you prefer. Move straight onto baking the sliders.

, Once you’ve poured the glaze over the sliders, place a piece of foil over the baking dish. Let the sliders sit for 10 to 15 minutes so they have time to absorb the glaze.You can prepare the sliders the night before, and let them sit in the refrigerator overnight. When you wake up the next morning, just bake them as you normally would.

, After the sliders have had time to soak up the butter and maple syrup mixture, place the baking dish in the preheated oven. Allow the sliders to bake for 15 minutes with the foil covering them., After 15 minutes, take the baking dish out of the oven and carefully remove the foil. Put the sliders back in the oven and bake them for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese melts.Keep an eye on the sandwiches to ensure that the tops of the rolls don’t burn.

, When the cheese has melted, remove the baking dish from the oven. Use a spatula to carefully lift the sliders out of the dish, and place them on plates for serving.If you want to make the sandwiches portable, wrap them in foil or wax paper to take on the go.

Clean up.",How to Make a Portable Fan Blower Attachment for an Outdoor Park Grill," Like a traditional street vendor's satay grill, laying the charcoal bed directly on a flat surface and fanning it from above - now automatically - may more efficiently use fuel for high-temperature cooking by preventing combustion on and radiation from its lower side to be largely lost into the grill body. The powerful radiation from its upper surface may outweigh the fan's disruption of convective heat transfer up to the food. A gentle breeze also blows off fire suffocating ash to the back of the grill before it accumulates., Feel free to be creative, but be sure you've provided for (or worked around) each of the basic needs, which include:

a fan to move the air, and a power source, switch, and electrical connectors to support it;
a duct to direct the draft to the charcoal while shielding the fan from heat;
a means of attaching the device to the grill, such as a hook for the front edge of the food grate; and
adhesives, fasteners, or clever forming to hold everything together.;
, You may need to order some items over the Internet. Expect some lead time and keep total shipping charges in mind. The fan typically comes from a computer store, small electronic parts are often cheapest when mailed directly from the country of manufacturing, and pretty much everything else can come from a home improvement store (especially their online inventory)., A low to medium speed 120mm computer fan is quiet, compact and efficient. A speed-selecting switch allows straightforward adjustment of the fire's power and fuel consumption. (Pulse-width modulation or other computer-based speed control is not nearly as simple to implement--you need a physical control.) Be sure any switch is on the intake side of the fan or a cable so it will be easy to reach when the exhaust side is inside a duct.

You'll probably want a wire cutter and stripper to remove the standard computer fan-power or power connector these generally have and prepare the bare connections for splicing. Or, a corresponding power connector and tools to install it on the power source.

There is no need to buy an expensive fan unless it is a special heat-and/or dirt-resistant fan probably meant for something other than computers that you will use heavily in a refined design. A little fan's noise will not be noticeable outdoors and heat and ash will probably kill it well before it would wear out on its own.



, You'll need a typically 12-volt or somewhat lower DC power source (roughly matching the fan; a high voltage system would be dangerous), a switch, some similar-sized wire if the component leads aren't long enough to keep sensitive parts away from fire, and a means of splicing the connections.

An 8-AA enclosed battery holder with integrated switch and tinned leads works well, costs little, and keeps the batteries clean. Connect the wires with the cutter/stripper and, ideally, heat-shrink tubing over a basic soldered connection, or crimp-able connectors or even wire nuts if soldering is impractical. Of course, you'll need matching batteries.

, A galvanized steel household HVAC air duct ""end boot"", smoothly tapering from a wide tubular end to a perpendicular long rectangular, flanged face, will prop against the open side of the grill, direct air broadly over a swath of coals, and allow for easy clean out while protecting the fan from direct radiation, dropped food, or taken-in ash.

Get one prefabricated with at least most of the edges safely bent over. A six-inch round opening can bend to a square that will snugly hold a 120mm nominal size computer fan, which is actually 125mm square. Use a pair of pliers, preferably one without serrations or angular edges such as round-nose pliers, to bend it without weakening kinks.

, Wire from a basic disposable hanger, ideally a relatively tough one such as a gold-colored wire suit hanger rather than a white shirt hanger, works well. Cut it with something tough like diagonal ""pliers"", and bend it with the same pliers as the duct., Crimping and rivets (more bent metal) is perhaps the best strong, heat-proof, relatively convenient way to fasten sheet metal. Drill holes through nonessential areas of plastic parts, such as the battery box to anchor them.

Machine screws and nuts can also work; beware overly long sharp points from sheet-metal screws where you may reach. Flue tape (which is basically glued heavy foil, so carefully avoid slicing with free edges) works well to secure the fan in a mounting cavity, hold down wires, and general light-duty use not directly exposed to coals. It will soften a little under heat. Epoxy putty sticks more strongly but will be damaged by overly strong heat as well.
The duct's flange can simply be bent up and away from lying flat on its back against the sides of the rectangular end for a broader surface to prop square against the grate and bed on the open edge of the grill. Do not unfold the blunt rolled edges of the flange, but you can open one up a little to admit the hanger-wire whose ends can bend into hooks to keep the top side along the grate.

, It will go into the round end, which will have to be bent square (without weakening hard creases) to fit around; the constriction toward the rectangular end will keep it from sliding in, and some tape will keep it from falling out. The problem is more getting it in!

Set the round end over the fan, squaring one of its frame's sides with the rectangular end's opening. Identify the positions aligned with the corners. With the pliers, bend the corners square and flatten the curves between them to neatly enclose the sides of the fan.
Slide it in - this may require force and whacks against the fan's sturdy frame, but protect the weak hub. Be careful not to chop or slice your fingers on sheet metal edges as you push!
Orient the fan to blow into the duct (which generally means the mount will shield the moving parts from heat) and with its power supply and control cables (routed through its frame notches for neatness and protection) facing toward the downward, away-from-the-rectangular-face side when that is directed as the gadget will be in use.
The orientation is a matter of choice, but if you're right-handed, the fan will stay out of the way best if on your left when the rectangular hole is oriented horizontally facing away from you as if on a grill. Secure the fan into the frame by its corners and edges with flue tape, keeping the tape, which may loosen in heat, away from the blades so it does not interfere with them.

, Splice the switched battery holder's leads to the fan's. Twisting and soldering with heat-shrink tubing (slid on and reserved out of the way beforehand) covers is most secure, but quicker methods such as twisting and wire nuts or electrical tape will work for a simple, non-critical gadget. Add wire extensions if there is not enough slack to mount the battery box in a protected location. Match polarity (wire insulation color)., Secure the battery box to the underside of the duct with rivets or epoxy putty and allow to cure. Make sure the door is able to be opened, and if the body is riveted through its inside, that the batteries will seat! Neatly hold down and protect the wires with flue tape. It's conductive, so the wires will need to be insulated., Bend the flanges around the duct's rectangular opening so that they project outward instead of lying back against the opening's outside. Do not open up the final bend in the flanges, which would expose their sharp cut edges., Cut a piece of the wire hanger the length of the duct's rectangular opening plus two or three inches more on each end. Bend it to comprise a straight central portion very slightly longer than the duct's rectangular opening, on each end turning perpendicular and bending over in the plane of the side of the opening so that it will hook over the edge of the food grate. Slightly open the final roll-over of the top-side lengthwise flange on the rectangular opening, slip in the hook bar, and bend the flange edge back down to retain it.,, Remove piled-up ash from the area in the center of the grill where the blower will do its work: a space a little wider than the rectangular opening and extending backwards by somewhat less than a foot to be about square. If there is unburned charcoal, put it here: free fuel!

Remember that public grills should be cleaned before use. Scrape it with at least scrap paper (not your food spatula) and let the heat take care of what won't come off as you prepare the grill for cooking.

, Charcoal burns best where the pieces are facing each other, but the blower helps the process so that a deep pile is not needed. Many little pieces facing each other is better than huge lumps or big briquettes; you can bring the remnants together to burn well or pile on more as they are consumed, but the food cooks so efficiently you likely won't need to. Start what will be enough to cover the foot-square area - or an area not extending so far back if you have little to cook - about an inch deep ultimately. A chimney starter works great, and a big one need not be thoroughly filled. Most of the pieces should be burning on most of their sides but need not be ashed over. Spread them out in the front center as described once they are started. Set the chimney starter on the grill and direct the blower's exhaust toward its underside from a distance to start it very quickly - but stay at arm's length and beware of sparks!, Lower the grate to an inch or so above the coals: the fan will blow back flare-ups so they don't add soot to or ignite the food. Turn on the blower and hang it on the front edge of the grate. The lower part of the rectangular opening or the flange below should rest on the front edge of the grill body, and, especially, not tip forward into the fire. The air should project across the coals and make them burn bright, hot, and, relatively bare of ash. Adjust the fan's speed or take the blower off periodically if the fire burns too hot, but keep the fan on to cool itself whenever the blower is mounted on a fired grill., The food should sizzle over the intense radiant heat. Drippings' flare-""ups"" will breeze inoffensively back. The exterior will cook very quickly, so check the interior for adequate cooking too. Reduce the heat (or, less efficiently, raise the grate) to finish insides without overcooking the outside, but a smoker or oven's wrap-around mild heat is better for slow, thorough cooking: better to grill relatively thin food, or that for which a less-cooked inside is desirable., Ash is corrosive and abrasive, so clean the blower, including the duct's inside if reachable, with a damp soapy cloth or paper towel after use. Watch out for any sharp sheet metal edges."

Oil is optional for cooking pancakes, especially if you are using a non-stick pan.;
, Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl., Pour in the milk and oil. Whisk the mixture until the ingredients are incorporated, but don't worry about a few lumps. Overmixing can actually make your pancakes chewy when you want them fluffy.This basic pancake batter is ready to cook now, but it can also be spruced up! According to your taste, you can also add things like:


Fresh fruit, such as blueberries and banana chunks
Dried fruit, such as raisins and cranberries
Chocolate chips
Nuts and seeds

, Pour a small amount of batter into the center of the frying pan. For larger pancakes, use about one-third to one-half cup of batter per pancake. For smaller pancakes, use one-eighth to a quarter-cup of batter. For small, silver dollar pancakes, use one tablespoon of batter per pancake.

, When the center of your pancake batter is full of bubbles that are starting to burst, the pancake is ready to flip. Continue cooking on the other side for one to two minutes, until it’s golden brown.


To keep your pancakes warm, keep them in a warming drawer, cover them with foil, or place them on a baking sheet and kept warm in an oven on its lowest heat.

, Repeat this process until all the batter is gone and the pancakes are all cooked. Add a splash of oil before adding new batter.

, On a medium or large plate, stack three large pancakes (or four smaller ones) on top of each other. You can also make two stacks of three silver dollar pancakes.


To add toppings between each layer of pancakes, simply top your first pancake according to your preference before stacking another one on it and topping it.
Pancakes can be served and eaten one at a time instead of as a stack.

, A popular way of eating pancakes is by spreading butter on the top pancake and then pouring syrup all over the stack. Instead of butter you can also use coconut oil, margarine, or nut butter. Some of the most common syrups to use are maple, corn, or pancake syrup. You can also use honey, agave nectar, or rice syrups.


You can also add your favorite toppings between the layers of pancakes if you like.

, Pouring syrup all over the entire stack of pancakes can result in soggy pancakes. Some people don't mind the texture, but if it bothers you, fill a small bowl with syrup instead of drizzling it all over your pancakes.


When you are ready to eat, use your fork to dip individual bites of pancake into the syrup.
If there are several people eating, make sure everyone gets an individual bowl of syrup.

, There are many things you can put on your pancakes if you choose. Many people like fruit on their pancakes, in the form of fresh fruit, compote, or jam. You can also add nuts, seeds, or dried fruit for some added nutritional benefits. And then there are the sweet toppings like whipped cream, chocolate chips, and chocolate syrup. Pancakes are a very personal thing, and everyone likes them prepared differently!

, Because your pancakes are stacked and every bite will include several layers of pancake, you want to cut them up into small pieces. Starting at the edge of your pancakes, pierce the layers of pancakes with your fork and hold the stack in place. Use a knife to cut through the layers of pancakes surrounding your fork and cut off a bite.


If you are dipping your pancakes into syrup, dip each forkful into the syrup and let the excess drain off over the bowl.

, When you’ve cut off a small bite, use your fork to lift your pancakes. Hold the forkful over your plate for a moment to allow excess syrup or toppings to fall back onto your plate. Once you've got the pancakes in your mouth and the fork's out of the way, be sure to chew thoroughly before swallowing.


Chew soft foods about 10 times before swallowing, and harder foods (like nuts) up to 30 times.To keep your pancakes in their stacked form, only cut off one bite at a time.
Use a napkin to wipe away any food or syrup from around your mouth.

, For stuffing and rolling pancakes, you’ll need a larger, thinner pancake that’s more like a French crepe. Thin out the batter by adding an extra quarter-cup to half-cup of water so the batter runs easily. Pour one-third to one-half cup of batter (per pancake) into the hot frying pan. Cook as before.


For a sweeter, dessert-style crepe, add about two tablespoons (30 grams) of sugar to the batter., Stuffed pancakes can be made sweet or savory, and make a great breakfast or dinner food. Sweet pancakes can be stuffed with fruit (popular choices are banana, strawberry, and blueberry), whipped cream, nut butters, chocolate or caramel sauce, or any other toppings you’d put on regular pancakes. For savory pancakes, try stuffing them with:


Cooked meat or tofu
Sautéed vegetables, such as mushrooms, onions, and asparagus
Cheese
Cooked potato filling

, Lay a single pancake on a plate. Take one-quarter to one-half cup of stuffing and spread it out in a line in the center of the pancake. Use your hands to roll one side of the pancake over to envelop the stuffing. Tuck the stuffing into the pancake pocket you created when you rolled it over, and continue rolling up the rest of the pancake.

, Place the pancake on the serving plate with the seam underneath (against the plate). Top your pancake with the desired toppings. For sweet pancakes, use butter, syrup, or any other topping you’d put on regular pancakes. For savory pancakes, try toppings like:


Gravy
Grated cheese
Hollandaise sauce
Hot sauce or barbeque sauce

, Start at one end and cut off a single bite at a time. Use your napkin to clean up any excess food around your mouth as you eat.

Put the two tablespoons of whole wheat flour in the 1/4 cup of water, in a plastic or glass cup.,
On the third day, sniff it.",How to Make Sourdough Pancakes1," Mix with a non-metal utensil. Leave it on a windowsill, covered but not airtight for three days.









You may have better luck if you add a little more water and flour each day.;
, If it smells sour, you have a good starter! If it stinks, dump it out, wash that glass, and try again, maybe in a different part of the house.

"
When you get a good starter, get a large glass, glazed ceramic, or plastic bowl, and with a wooden or plastic (non-metal) spoon, mix 2 cups of water with enough flour to make a gooey mix.,
Check your sourdough daily.,
Add more water if necessary to make it a good consistency for pancakes.",How to Make Sourdough Pancakes2," If it's too stiff to stir easily, add more water. Then stir in a tablespoon or more of your sourdough starter (adding all of it is OK too). Leave this in a warm but not hot place.








, When it smells good and sour, and gets more gooey in consistency, you're ready. This will happen overnight in warm areas, and it takes up to 3 days in a cold house.








, If you've never made pancakes before, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it after a few tries and you can't really go wrong.

Put the batter you will use for pancakes in a separate bowl.,
Put some oil (if preferred, non-virgin olive oil) in a cast iron or non-stick griddle or pan, and heat on medium flame to where dropping a drop of water on it makes it spatter.

When the top is bubbling, flip the pancake with a spatula.",How to Make Sourdough Pancakes3," Set aside the original container to feed later (with flour and water) so you will have starter for your pancakes tomorrow. Take the batch you will use for pancakes and add 1/4 cup sugar, a teaspoon of salt, one egg, and a tablespoon of oil (none of these extra ingredients are necessary, but the salt and oil are recommended).








,, Your batter will rise as the baking soda reacts with the acetic acid in the sourdough (this is also optional).









For very sour pancakes, add less baking soda.
For less sour pancakes, add more baking soda. Also realize that adding less soda will make your pancakes rise less, while adding more will make them very fluffy.

, Let it pan fry for a minute or two. Hopefully it will flatten out nicely, like a pancake! If not, thin your batter some more before you try the next one... but continue with this one, all is not lost.








, This takes some practice. If you're really talented, you can flip the pan up with the handle, and catch the inverted pancake. Be ready to clean up the mess if you miss. If, and when, you get the pancake flipped and back in the pan, keep cooking. If it was a messy flip, and the uncooked batter spread out, it won't be pretty but it will still taste good!









If it's too thick to cook completely through after a couple more minutes, take it out and put it in another pan in the oven or microwave, and let it finish cooking there. Go back to the step in which you add oil and more batter, and start again with a new one

Cut the potatoes.,
Season and cook the potatoes.,
Chop the sausage and vegetables.,
Saute the sausage and vegetables.,
Combine the potatoes with the sausage and vegetables.,
Add and cook the eggs.",How to Make a Breakfast Skillet1," Scrub the 2 pounds (0.9 kilos) of baby potatoes and cut them in halves or quarters. They should be in 1-inch pieces. Be careful when using a sharp knife to cut the potatoes. Place the pieces of potato into a large skillet (at least 12-inches in size).








For a healthier breakfast skillet, consider substituting sweet potatoes for the baby potatoes.;
, Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the potatoes in your skillet. Season the potatoes and cover the skillet with a lid. Cook the potatoes over low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until they're tender when you poke them with a knife. For seasoning, just sprinkle these over your potatoes and adjust the flavorings to your taste:








Smoked paprika
Garlic powder
Salt
Black pepper
Fresh thyme, stemmed and chopped
Fresh rosemary, stemmed and chopped

, Slice 10 to 14 ounces (283.5 to 396 g) of sausage into 1








You can use any type of sausage that you like. To speed cooking time, choose a sausage that's already fully cooked.

, Heat another large saute pan or skillet over medium heat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pan. Once the oil starts shimmering, add your sliced sausage and saute it until it browns. Add the chopped vegetables and cook them until they're tender, about 10 minutes.








For extra flavor, you can add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of maple syrup.

, Consider which of your skillets is larger and transfer the food from the smaller skillet into the larger one. For example, if the skillet that has your sausage and veggies is larger, transfer the potatoes into it and stir them in.








If you're worried your skillet won't hold all of the potatoes, sausage, and cooked vegetables, transfer all of the ingredients to a large mixing bowl to stir them together. You can divide them between your smaller skillets to finish cooking them.

, Determine how many eggs you want to cook in your breakfast skillet. Make a small well for each egg you'll be cooking by scooting aside the potato








Depending on how well you like your eggs cooked, try cooking the breakfast skillet for 8 to 10 minutes. If you'd like to scramble the eggs, just crack them into the skillet and stir them constantly as they cook. It should only take 4 or 5 minutes until they're scrambled and set.
Serve the breakfast skillet with hot sauce, maple syrup, or ketchup.

",How to Make a Breakfast Skillet2," Drizzle a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet (about 10 to 14 inches) over medium heat before cooking the base of your breakfast skillet. If you're serving more than a few people, it's important to pick a base that is filling and will easily feed several people. You can cook diced or cubed potatoes as the base of your skillet. Whatever you choose, ensure the food is cooked until it's tender before you add your other ingredients. Good breakfast skillet bases include:Cooked and drained pasta
Cooked and cooled rice
Diced and roasted sweet potatoes
Hash browns
Diced yam or butternut squash

, Once your base has cooked until it is soft, add at least one or two different cubed vegetables. You may need to drizzle a little olive oil in the pan and stir it frequently to keep the food from sticking. Use at least one of these vegetables in your breakfast skillet:Broccoli
Cauliflower
Mushrooms
Kale or spinach
Onions
Bell peppers

, As the breakfast skillet cooks, sprinkle seasoning and herbs to add flavor. You can start with just 1/4 of a teaspoon of the spices and herbs you want to use. Taste the food and adjust the flavor by adding more seasonings to your taste. These seasonings work well in breakfast skillets:Thyme
Rosemary
Garlic
Oregano
Chili powder
Shallots
Ground cumin

, Many breakfast skillets contain meat. You can use any type of sausage, cooked and shredded chicken, bacon, or smoked salmon. If you'd like to stick to a vegetarian breakfast skillet, just use eggs or tofu. To add eggs, you can just make wells in the veggies and crack the eggs into each well. You could also drop the eggs into the skillet and stir them frequently while the skillet cooks. This will scramble the eggs.


If you'd like to top the breakfast skillet with fried eggs, try frying the eggs in a separate pan. This way, you can cook them exactly how you like them and simply place them on top of your cooked breakfast skillet.

, Depending on how you decided to cook your eggs, you may need to continue cooking the skillet. If you'd like your eggs cracked onto the top and cooked till just set, consider covering the skillet with a lid and cooking the skillet over medium-low heat until the whites set. This could take 5 to 10 minutes. If you'd like to use more than 4 eggs or would like them cooked more thoroughly, bake the breakfast skillet in an oven heated to 400 degrees F (204 C) for 10 minutes.


If baking in the oven, ensure your pan is oven-safe.
If you chose to scramble the eggs into the cooked vegetables and base, you won't need to continue cooking the breakfast skillet any further.

Wait for the edges to brown and the top to bubble.,
Lift an edge of the pancake to see if the underside is golden brown.,
Slide the spatula under the pancake so that it’s centered.,
Quickly flick your wrist 180 degrees to one side so the pancake flips over.",How to Flip a Pancake1," When the edges of the pancake begin to crisp up and the top begins to bubble, it’s an indication it’s ready to be flipped.Pay close attention to your pancake to see when this happens.


If you keep burning your pancake, lower the heat when you try to cook the next one.
If the center of your pancake is raw, then it means you're cooking it on too high of a heat. This makes it so the edges burn before the middle gets a chance to cook.Don’t use too much butter or oil when cooking your pancake or it may spit and burn you.;
, The underside of the pancake should be a golden brown color before you flip it. You can check this by carefully lifting up an edge of the pancake with your spatula or a fork. The bottom should now feel more solid, and less like batter.


Make sure to use a nonstick pan, non stick cooking spray, butter, or oil so your pancake doesn’t get stuck to the pan.
Don’t lift one of the corners of the pancake too much or else you might break the pancake.
You may check it often, but use your best judgement. The more you play around with the pancake, the greater chance it’s going to break.
You can shake the pan back and forth to see if it slides around. If it does, it indicates that the bottom side has cooked, and it's ready for flipping.
If the center of your pancake is too wet and under cooked, there's a chance that hot oil, batter, or butter could splash onto your skin so be careful.

, Try to get your spatula in the center of the pancake. Get as much of your spatula as you can covered by the underside of the pancake. Lift it so it clears the rim of your pan and get ready to flip.


Don’t hold it in the air for too long or it will break. You should transition to the flip quickly.
Don’t lift it higher than 4-6 inches off the bottom of your pan. The higher you lift it, the greater chance it’s going to break.

, Using a quick flicking motion, turn your wrist over while holding the spatula. The longer you wait and the more you hesitate, the more likely the pancake will break. Do it quickly and confidently.


If you mess up, scrap the pancake and start over.
Make sure to try to the flip the pancake only once. Multiple flipping will make it tough and chewy."

Use a lighter pan for flipping.,
Shake your pan and wait until the pancake slides around.,
Use both hands and lift the pan 3 inches in the air and tilt it slightly forward.,
Quickly flick your wrists in an upward motion so your pancake flips.",How to Flip a Pancake2," A heavy cast iron pan may be more difficult to use than a lighter pan for flipping pancakes this way. You’ll be using two hands with this technique, so consider the weight of the pan.


A pan that has a higher lip on its sides will be easier to use.

, A good indicator that your pancake is ready to be flipped is if it moves around when you shake your pan. When you’re flipping without using a spatula, it’s important that you know your pancake won’t get stuck.


Shake very lightly when you check on your pancake.
You can use a fork to check the underside if you don’t feel confident.

, The pancake should be resting on the rim of your pan, but not sliding out of it. If the pancake doesn’t move and is sticking to the pan, it’s not ready to be flipped.


A larger rim is better for flipping pancakes., Follow through confidently when you flick your wrist upward. The pancake should flip towards your body and end up on the other side. A similar method is used when cooking stir fry.Only cook the pancake one time on each side. The more you flip it over, the tougher the pancake will become."

For a few good pancake recipes, visit our guide to making pancake batter. This page includes a recipe for gluten-free pancakes.;
, Take a generous helping of butter (about one or two tablespoons should be enough) and place it in the pan. Warm the pan over medium heat on the stove. The butter should quickly melt. Spread it around the pan so that the bottom is evenly-coated.


Wider pans are best for this job — remember that you'll have to have enough room for Mickey's giant ears.
If you don't want to use butter, try margarine or a neutral-flavored cooking oil (like vegetable or canola oil)., When the pan is hot enough that a drop of water will sizzle and ""dance"" as soon as it touches the pan, you're ready to cook. Gather a little batter in a cup or spoon and pour it onto the pan. About 1/4 cup of batter will be enough for a medium-sized pancake.Pour the batter in a single pile and let it gradually widen into a flat circle.


Try to leave room on the pan on one side of the pancake for Mickey's ears.

, Drop two more pancakes about an inch away from the head and let them spread out so that they touch the first one. These are Mickey Mouse's famous ears! You want them to be on the same side of the head, but with an inch or two of space between them. They should touch the head, but they shouldn't touch each other.


The ears should be a little smaller than the first one. Mickey has big ears, but they aren't bigger than his head.

, Cook until bubbles start to form, pop, and stay open on the surface of the batter.Slip a stiff wood or metal spatula under the edge of the pancake and take a peek at the underside. If it looks golden-brown, you're ready to flip. If it's still light-colored, give it an extra minute or two.


The thicker your pancake is, the longer it will take to reach this ""flippable"" point.

, Slide the spatula under the center of the head. If your spatula is wide enough, try to support the ears as well. In a single, confident motion of the wrist, lift the pancake, turn it, and drop it face-down in the pan again.


This is the only hard part of making a Mickey Mouse pancake. The ears make the pancake a little awkward to flip all at once — it's easy to tear one off accidentally. If you're having trouble, WikiHow has a help article on this topic as well.
If you lose an ear when you flip, let it keep cooking on its own. Just before you serve the pancake, move it next to the head again. Drop a small amount of fresh batter between the two and let it cook for an extra minute or so. This can work like ""glue"" to stick the ear back to the head.

, After a few more minutes, use the same spatula trick to check for rich golden-brown color on the underside. If you see it, your pancake is most likely done. Carefully transfer it to a plate, taking care with the floppy ears. Garnish with syrup or whatever topping you please and enjoy!


If you're worried about the pancakes being under-cooked, make a small cut in the thickest part to look for thick, uncooked batter. Serve the pancake with this side down if you think a child will complain about the cut in Mickey's face.

, Each pancake you make will soak up some of the butter (or oil, etc.) you're using to grease your pan. If your pan looks like it's running dry, just give it a quick wipe with a paper towel then add another helping of grease.


Don't neglect this — if you don't grease your pan properly, your pancakes will stick to the pan. This can make them difficult to flip (and can burn them).

, Looking to give your guest or child a sweet surprise? One easy way to do this is to add delicious extras to the batter to create a face for Mickey. For best results, you'll want something sweet and dark-colored (like chocolate or blueberries) so that you can see (and taste) the smile!


Add the mouth and eyes on top of the pancake as soon as you've spooned in all the batter. This will give them time to sink into the batter so they're less likely to fall out.

, To recreate Mickey's cartoon-style eyes, you'll just need a banana and a few berries or chocolate chips. For this, you'll want to wait for the pancake to cook completely on both sides. When you serve the pancake, cut two thin, oval-shaped pieces of banana (cut diagonally through the banana to get the oval shape). Place these two slices in the center of the head to make the whites of Mickey's eyes. Put a chocolate chip or berry in the bottom corner of each eye to make Mickey's pupils.


If you want Mickey to have a mouth too, add a smile with the chocolate chips or berries before you flip the pancake the first time.

, Minnie Mouse's face is very similar to Mickey's, but she almost always wears a red or pink bow. To make this bow, chop a strawberry in half. When you serve the pancake, put the two halves at the top of Minnie's head so that the skinny ends touch to form the bow.

, Mickey's ears and ""hair"" are black. To recreate this, you can use chocolate sauce (or another dark-colored topping) to fill in these parts of the pancake. When the pancake is done, put a small amount of sauce on each ear and spread it around with the back of a spoon to color the ears. Then, color in the edges of the top half of Mickey's head with the sauce to make his ""hairline.""


If you want your pancakes to be as accurate as possible, give Mickey a widow's peak. In other words, make his hair come together in a sharp point at the top of his forehead. You can look at any picture of Mickey or Minnie Mouse to see what this looks like.

, This trick is a little challenging, but it's great for making amazing-looking pancakes. You'll need a turkey baster or a pastry bag so that you can dispense small, detailed amounts of batter. The basic idea is to lay down batter for the darkest parts of Mickey's face first, then lay down batter for the lighter parts. The batter you add first will cook the longest, making it darker than the rest. See below for step-by-step directions:


Put a little pancake batter in a turkey baster or pastry bag.
Draw Mickey's mouth, nose, hairline, and eyes in the pan. For the eyes, don't fill in the ""whites"" yet — just draw the outlines and pupils. Add two scoops of batter where his ears will be. These should touch his hairline.
Let these cook on their own for a minute or two until they get a light golden-brown color.
Add a scoop of batter right in the center of the facial features. This will fill in Mickey's face and the whites of his eyes. It's OK if this batter spills over what you've already laid down. Use a spoon or spatula to get a circular shape for the face.
When the second helping of batter turns golden-brown, carefully flip the pancake over and cook the backside as normal. You should see Mickey's features highlighted in the darker parts of the pancake.

You can get protein powder sweetened or unsweetened. Consider getting the sweetened kind for this recipe. This way, you won't have to add extra sweetener to it.
The salt is not absolutely necessary, but it can help cut the sweetness of overly-sweet protein powder.;
, Pat down the dry mixture first, then make a well. Add the eggs, water, and oil into the well. Whisk everything together until just combined. If the mixture is still too thin, whisk in a little bit more protein powder.


You can also use an egg substitute instead.
For something more flavorful, switch out the water for a low carb milk substitute. You can also try sour cream or butter milk as well.
Consider adding in some tasty extras, such as ground cinnamon, fruit, nuts, or pieces of cooked bacon.

, Heat the pan up first. When it's hot enough to make a fleck of water sizzle, add about ¼ tablespoon of butter or oil. Spread the oil or butter around, then wipe most of it off with a paper towel.

, Use a soup ladle to measure out about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of pancake batter and pour it onto the skillet. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may be able to fit more than one pancake, as long as they do not touch., This will only take 25 to 30 seconds.

Make sure to take into account the countertop and storage space you have available when deciding on the best size. Remember that most models will have a larger footprint on the countertop than the dimensions of the pan since electric frying pans are either footed or connected to a base.;
, The most common shapes available are oblong and square, but there are some circular models. Oblong and square shaped electric skillets generally allow you to cook more items at the same time as they provide more cooking space than round pans.

, Higher sides allow you to deep-fry and braise, and accommodate larger amounts of food. Awkward food shapes such as whole chickens or large roasts will also fit better in a high-sided pan.

,


Buy a model that can reach at least 450 degrees F (232.2 degrees C) if you want to be able to deep-fry. Electric skillets that go up to 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees C) will not get hot enough for deep-frying, but they are hot enough for stir-frying and pan-frying.

, You will be able to use most skillets for frying, sauteing, braising, and deep-frying. Some electric skillets have additional settings and inserts for roasting, grilling, or baking.

,


Choose a glass lid. A glass lid allows you to see the food as it's cooking without lifting the lid and letting heat escape.
Look for a model that has an adjustable steam vent on the lid. If there is no vent, pressure can build up and cause liquid to spill over the sides of the electric frying pan.
Check the height of the lid's dome. A higher dome is ideal if you plan to use the electric frying pan for roasting or for cooking larger food items.

, Not only are heat-resistant handles safer, they also make the electric skillet more convenient since you will not need to use oven mitts while cooking.

, Most electric skillets available on the market are aluminum with a non-stick coating. Some stainless steel options exist, but these are much more expensive.

,


Find out whether the heat control separates from the pan. Generally models where the pan separates from the heat control are dishwasher safe and fully immersible.
Avoid electric skillets that require hand-washing if easy cleaning is a priority for you.

,


Examine the thickness of the pan's bottom and sides. Thin pans may not heat as evenly as thicker walled electric skillets.
Verify that the bottom of the skillet is flat. Any curving of the skillet's surface can affect your ability to cook certain dishes such pancakes where you need individual portions to stay separated from one another.

, A warranty usually guarantees that the manufacturer will fix or replace your skillet if a malfunction occurs.

,


Avoid electric skillets that have multiple reviews describing problems with hot spots or bubbly, easily damaged non-stick coating. These issues indicate the electric skillet is of poor quality.

, Shop in stores or online to find the model you prefer at the best price.

Consult a consumer buying guide.,
Ask your friends about their own mixer before making a decision.,
Watch sale flyers.,
Look at the online resale marketplace.,
Look at mixers in-store.",How to Buy a Kitchen Mixer," Think about your cooking over the last month. Make a tally of the times you needed a mixer and either didn’t have one or had an inadequate one. If you are a person who bakes a lot you will have different needs than the occasional baker. If you like to experiment with new recipes your needs will be different than someone who cooks quick and easy.


Look at your holiday plans and determine if you will be cooking more and may need a mixer.;
, Look around your kitchen and decide where you would keep a mixer. Determine if you have a large enough kitchen with a lot of counter space for a large mixer or a small kitchen where storage is an obstacle. Move some things around on your countertop to get a feel for how a large mixer would look. While some people don't like to have a lot of things on their countertops because it feels cluttered, other people love the look of upscale appliances all around the kitchen.Look in your cupboards to see if you have room to store a mixer. You will want it to be easily accessible.
Mixers come in many different sizes.

A stand mixer usually measures around 14”D x 8-½”W x 14”H (35.5.cm x 31.5cm x 35.5cm).
A hand mixer will be approximately 8""D x 4""W x 6""H (20.3cm x 10.2cm x15.2cm).



, The cost of mixers varies dramatically. You will need to budget for a mixer regardless of the type. You can buy a hand mixer at a discount store for as little as $20.00 and upwards of $150.00. A stand mixer will range from $200.00 to upwards of $500.00.If you are budget restricted you do not have to overspend to get a good mixer. If you are a beginner in the kitchen but love expensive appliances, you can have the look of a pro for the right budget. Make sure you set a budget and stick with it.

, The right hand mixer will be easy for you to use and you may be thrilled with the results. You can use a hand mixer to do many basic tasks including: mixing cake batter, whisking egg whites, and whipping cream. If you only bake a few times a month, it may be perfect for you.A hand mixer is small and lightweight, making it easy for you to handle. You can store it easily because of it’s small size.
Most hand mixers have 2 or 3 speeds for mixing. They typically come with one or 2 sets of small beaters as well. You will find this adequate for many basic mixing jobs.
Hand mixing can be tiring if you have to hold your mixer for a very long time.

, In addition to mixing, whisking and whipping, you can knead dough and prepare pasta ingredients with a stand mixer. You can purchase additional attachments for things like meat grinding and food processing. If you will be mixing more than once a week you may consider a stand mixer.The stand mixer is a large, heavy appliance and you will utilize it best if you give it its own counter space. Weighing 29 pounds on average, you may not want to pull it out of a cupboard every time you use it.Because of the mixer's weight, you will be able to prepare hard to knead doughs without the mixer lifting or tipping. The stand mixer also has a head that locks in place to prevent bouncing and moving while you are mixing.
The attachments for pasta, meat dicing and others make it more versatile for you to use your mixer for more than just baking.
There may be as many as 20 speeds on a stand mixer, so you will be able to manage every job effectively. The larger bowl size of a stand mixer size is conducive to your working on larger projects in the kitchen.
You will find a variety of colors and finishes so your stand mixer can match any decor. A good finish will be easy for you to keep clean. Most stand mixers also come with a splash guard to prevent liquids from splashing out of the bowl and all over you and the countertop.

, You can use a simple, balloon shaped wire whisk for some basic kitchen tasks. You can easily mix ingredients such as eggs, wet cake mixes and whipped cream by hand. If you don't cook very often, a whisk may be all you need.


Whisks are handheld and contour easily to a bowl for whipping.A whisk is typically 8 to 12 inches long (20cm to 30cm), making it very easy for you to store, even if your kitchen is small. You can store it in your utensil drawer or on the countertop in a utensil holder.You can purchase a whisk for as little as $1.00 but a good one will cost between $8.00 and $10.00. If you are choosing a whisk instead of a mixer you may want to choose a better quality whisk.

, Now that you have decided which kind of mixer to buy, consult online marketplaces like Amazon or a magazine consumer buying guide like Consumer Reports. You can compare features within the category. You will also learn about quality differences. Read real reviews to see what people are saying about different models.Be sure to stay within your predetermined budget.

, People have very strong opinions about their tools, so a friend may be happy to help. You can turn it into an evening of cooking with your friend. You will get a good recommendation and you may avoid repeating a friend's mistake purchase.

, Kitchen mixers are frequently on sale, especially during the fall holiday season. Be sure you compare apples and apples as there are so many different models to choose from. Many department stores and kitchen specialty stores issue coupons for discounts on your purchase.


Look for coupons online, both on the manufacturer's website and on websites like RetailMeNot and Coupons.com.

, You may find a nearly new, high quality mixer for sale at a fraction of the price of a new one. Look for something local on Craigslist so you do not have to pay shipping costs. If you do not have experience with sites like Craigslist, be sure to ask an experienced friend to help guide you through a safe buying process.

, Go to a store to see get a feel for different mixers even if you hope to purchase online. The weight, feel and look vary greatly between brands and models, hence why many stores have models out for you to try.

Every type of wok will work for your stir-frying, steaming, or frying needs, except Teflon, which should not be used for frying. The different materials of woks are:Cast iron. This is the traditional material. This type of wok takes more time to heat up, but it cooks food evenly and retains heat longer. Iron is a solid choice, but it also has its drawbacks. Cast iron woks rust easily, so you will need to carefully dry it before and after use. It is also recommended to avoid cooking acidic food and greens in this type of wok.
Aluminum wok. Iron woks are thick and heavy, but woks made of aluminum are light and thin. Aluminum is a great conductor of heat, but it does not retain heat very well. It is also not as durable as an iron wok.
Teflon wok. A Teflon, or non-stick, wok is ideal for steaming, stewing, and boiling. Do not use this type of wok if you plan to deep fry or stir-fry food because the non-stick coating will come off into the food at high temperatures.
Carbon steel. This is possibly the most recommended type of wok. It is typically the most inexpensive choice, and it is the most durable. A carbon steel wok also heats up quickly and evenly, and is almost a non-stick surface if cared for properly.;
, Woks with round bottoms are traditional and most common, but flat bottoms have been introduced in recent years. A round bottom is ideal if you cook on a gas stove. Flat bottom woks are made for electric stoves. Though the choice depends on taste and stove type, most cooks still recommend to use a round bottom if possible.Food can burn easier with a flat bottom wok because heat is distributed mostly throughout the bottom of the pan.
It is easier to use a spatula on a round bottom pan.

, The size of the wok you choose depends on the amount of people you want to feed. Typically, a wok that is 14 inches in diameter is family-sized. For travel, woks come as small as 8 inches. Woks also can be as large as 79 inches, but woks this large are usually only used in restaurants., There are several types of handles, but they all serve the same purpose. The handles are used to lift the wok off of the burner. There are woks that come with two loops on each side as handles, a long metal or wooden handle, and ones that have a long stick on one side and a metal loop on the other. Choose the type of handle based off of which will be easiest for you to lift.The easiest type of handle is considered to be to be a long stick on one side, and a loop on the other.
Chefs typically use a long handle for easy tossing.

, Most cookbooks recommend that you go to the nearest Chinatown to buy a wok. These woks are usually inexpensive and durable. If going to Chinatown is not possible, there are other options. You can go to a department store with a cooking section, a cooking specialty store, or you can purchase one on the internet.If you purchase a wok from the internet, make sure you choose a legitimate website. Also make sure to check the material and reviews.
Look at the online catalog before going to a store if you are looking for a specific type of wok.

, Luckily, the highest recommended woks are the least expensive. Woks bought in Chinatown are typically around $7. Elsewhere, you can find a good and durable wok for about $30. Woks can run as high as $200 or more, but spending that much is usually not necessary., If you buy a wok in person, check the quality and weight. If possible, take the wok in your hands and press slightly on it. The metal should give in very little if aluminum, but usually, it should not give in at all. Pick the wok up to make sure it is not too heavy for you to lift.Consider that the wok will be heavier with food in it.

, Many woks will come with some accessories in the box, but the accessories are typically weak and not made well. You will need to purchase accessories to get the most out of your wok. Necessary accessories to buy are:A domed cover.
Two long-handled Chinese spatulas
A shallow Chinese ladle with a large bowl. This can be either metal or wooden.
Optional accessories are extra-long cooking chopsticks and steamer racks (metal, wooden, or bamboo).

, A wok ring is used to raise the bottom of the pan away from the heat. Some woks come with rings, but often they do not. Wok rings are needed for round bottom woks, but they are not necessary for flat bottom woks. Rings are typically needed for gas stoves, but they are also recommended for electric stoves to lift the wok slightly above the coil.There are two different types of rings. One is made with thick metal with open sides, and the other type is made of enclosed metal with small holes for venting. The former is better suited for gas stoves, and the latter is best for electric stoves.
Woks rings come in many different sizes and depths. Choose one that fits best on your burner. You may need to take a measurement of your burner before purchasing a wok ring.
It is recommended to purchase an extra wok ring for round bottom woks to place on the counter after removing it from the stove.

, New woks come with a protective coating that you will need to scrub off. This coating is put on woks to keep them fresh in the store. To remove it, scrub it with soapy water and dry it with a towel. Then, put it on the stove on medium hear to evaporate any moisture to prevent rusting., You will need to season the wok to add flavor to your cooking. To do this, turn the heat on the oven to the highest setting. Then, pour corn, vegetable,or peanut oil on the bottom of the pain. Spread the oil around with a paper towel held by tongs. Repeat this process frequently until you achieve a thick, black patina on the bottom of the pan.It is also an option to add ginger and/or spring onions to the seasoning process.
Keep your windows open while you season because it will produce a lot of smoke.

, There many ways to cook with a wok, and there are even more potential ingredients. To make stir-fry, make sure your wok is very hot. There should be smoke rising from it to indicate this. Next, add oil to the pan. Then you can add your ingredients. Only stir your ingredients to prevent burning. Spread the food evenly and along the sides of the pan while cooking.Before adding ingredients, flick water onto the wok. It is hot enough to begin cooking if the water evaporates quickly.Add cold oil to wok when it is hot. Do not add cold oil to a cold wok.
Most at-home stoves do not get to a high enough temperature to get the most flavorful food, so it is recommended to cook in batches.

, Clean your wok with hot water and a soft sponge. Some choose to clean with soap, but it is recommended to avoid soap if possible. Once you are done wiping it, put it back on the stove to evaporate any water.If something is sticking to the pan, add salt and scrub it gently with a paper towel.
Wipe the wok with oil and a paper towels for the first few few uses before storing it away.
Your wok will eventually change from silver, to brown, to black. This is a good thing. A permanent, black patina assures a flavorful meal each time you cook."

Lower the pressure inside the cooker.,
Check to make sure that all of the pressure has been released.,
Remove the lid carefully.",How to Use a Pressure Cooker," When the pressure cooker is turned on, heat produces steam which cooks food faster by raising the boiling point. There are two types of pressure cookers. The first is the old style pressure cooker which has a “jiggle top” or weighted pressure regulator that sits on top of the vent pipe on the lid. The second type is the newer style that uses spring valves and a closed system.;
, Also check that the pressure cooker is clear of leftover food. Pressure cookers that have cracked can be dangerous as they could release hot steam and burn you.

, There must always be some sort of liquid in your pressure cooker before you cook anything in it. Most recipes call for water to be used. The cooker should never be more than ⅔ full of liquid as there needs to be room for the steam to accumulate.



For a jiggle top cooker: There must always be at least one cup of water in a jiggle top pressure cooker. This amount of water is generally sufficient for 20 minutes of cooking.

For a valve cooker: The minimum amount of liquid used in a valve cooker is ½ cup.

, Pressure cookers come with a steamer basket that vegetables, seafood, and fruit are generally cooked on in the pressure cooker. The trivet is the basket’s stand. The trivet is placed in the bottom of the pressure cooker and the basket is placed on top of it.

, The box that your pressure cooker came in may have a guide for preparing different kinds of food.


Preparing meat and poultry: You can season your meat before putting it in the cooker. Brown the meat first for maximum flavor. You can do this by heating a small amount of oil, such as canola oil, in the pressure cooker on medium high. Do not put the lid on during this process. Put the meat in the cooker and brown it.You can also brown meat in a pan before cooking it in the pressure cooker.







Preparing seafood: Wash seafood. Place seafood on a pressure cooker steamer basket on the support trivet with at least 3/4 cup (175 ml) of liquid. Always put some vegetable oil on the steamer basket when you cook fish so that it does not stick to the basket.







Preparing dry beans and chickpeas: Soak beans in water for four to six hours. Do not add salt to the water they are soaking in. Drain them and place them in the pressure cooker. Add one to two tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of vegetable oil to the water you add to the pressure cooker if you are using an old jiggle top cooker.







Preparing rices and grains: Soak wheat grain berries and pearl barley in lukewarm water for four hours. Do not soak rice and oats.







Preparing vegetables (both fresh and frozen): Defrost frozen vegetables. Wash fresh vegetables. Place veggies in the steamer basket. Most vegetables are cooked with a 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water in the bottom of the pressure cooker when the vegetable only needs to cook for 5 minutes. Use 1 cup (250 ml) of water if the cooking time is 5 to 10 minutes. Use 2 cups (500 ml) of water if the cooking time is 10 to 20 minutes.Preparing fruit: Wash all fruit before using the pressure cooker. Place the fruit in the steamer basket. Use 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water for fresh fruit. Use 1 cup (250 ml) of water for dried fruit.







, Consult the manual that came with your cooker for a guide of food items and water amounts. You can also find guides online. Each amount of food has a different amount of water needed to go with it.

, Add the amount of water needed to properly cook the specific food you are making in the pressure cooker.’

, Make sure to lock the lid. Place the cooker on a larger burner on your stove. Set the heat to high. The cooker will start converting the water to steam.

, The pressure will begin to rise inside the cooker. When the pressure reaches the designed safety limit, the cooker will begin to simmer the food.


In old jiggle top valves, this will be when steam comes out of the vent and the weighted pressure regulator will begin to jiggle (hence the name jiggle top). Place the safety valve on the nozzle when you see steam coming out of the nozzle.
In new pressure cookers there are marks on the valve stem that indicate the pressure inside the cooker. The marks will appear as the pressure rises.

, Begin timing the cooker at this point as per the recipe you are following. The idea is to maintain the pressure throughout cooking time. If the heat supply is not reduced the pressure may continue to rise and the dead weight or safety valve opens (blows a whistle), releasing steam and preventing the pressure from rising any further. The safety valve is provided to prevent possible rupture of the cooker itself. It is not an indicator of cooking time.

, If you cook the food for longer, it is more than likely develop into the consistency of baby food. You do not want this to happen.

, Do not attempt to lift the lid off of the cooker. Recipes will specify how you should release the pressure. There are three ways to do this.


The Natural Release Method: This method is used for long cooking foods like roasts to continue to cook while the pressure reduces on its own. This takes the longest of any of the methods and generally takes 10 to 20 minutes.







The Quick Release Method: Most old pressure cookers, and all new pressure cookers, have a quick release button the lid. When this button is released, the pressure is slowly released from within the cooker.







The Cold Water Release Method: This is the fastest way to release pressure. Do not use this method if you have an electric pressure cooker. Take the pressure cooker and place it under the sink faucet. Run cold water on the lid until the pressure drops. Do not run the water directly on the pressure regulator or vent. This is the fastest way to release pressure.







, On jiggle tops, move the pressure regulator. If there is no sound of escaping steam, all of the pressure has been released. On a new model, move the valve stem. If there is no sound of escaping steam, there is no pressure left.

, Take the cooked food out of the pressure cooker.

Load the ingredients onto the half cooked dough.",How to Use a Pizza Stone," For cooking pizza and cookies, the top rack in the center is the ideal location. For cooking bread, biscuits, and other items, the middle rack in the center is the better choice.;
, Never put a cold pizza stone in a hot oven, as it can shatter due to thermal shock.In fact, make sure never to expose the pizza stone to rapid temperature shifts. Placing a frozen pizza on a pizza stone is almost as likely to result in a shattered stone as placing a cold stone in a hot oven. You're better off cooking your frozen pizza straight on the rack.

,, Do not grease or oil. For breads and pizza crust, you may want to add a little cornmeal to aid removal.


It can take a little finessing to get used to, but a pizza paddle is a useful instrument, especially for transferring uncooked pizza dough onto the stone. There are three different kinds of peels — short-handled wooden peels, long-handled wooden peels, and metal peels. For the average person cooking at home, the short-handled wooden peel will probably work best.
If you don't want to use cornmeal under your dough, you can also use flour. Rice flour is a great way to ensure the dough doesn't stick to your paddle., You do not have to remove it at all, as it can add to a ""brick oven effect"" that actually helps your oven retain and spread heat more evenly. You can put cooking dishes, pots, pans, cookie trays, and so on right on the stone.

, Of course, only do this once you're sure the pizza stone is cool enough to handle.

, The pizza stone can be cleaned and rinsed entirely with water. With a clean sponge, wipe away any remaining food or grime using only water. Do not try to remove oils that build up — it is fully unnecessary. Leaving the oils on the stone actually helps season the stone, turning it into a slicker, more easy-to-use item.

, A simple once-over is probably more than enough. If you pizza stone happens to absorb too much moisture when it's soaking in the sink, it can crack the next time you heat it in the oven., Stains on your pizza stone are normal and almost unavoidable. Moreover, they're like a badge of honor, or experience points — something that you point to as a vindication of your cooking skills.

, You can house your pizza stone in the oven even as you bake other items. Just bake them on top of the stone itself. For heavier items, like a roast, move the pizza stone to the bottom rack before cooking.

, You should know how much space you have to work with before you select your stone. You'll be kicking yourself if you buy a stone and then realize that your oven isn't large enough for it.

, If you're a bottom line sort of person and only worried about the taste of your pizza, not the look of your stone, you can purchase a quarry stone for around $5 to $10. You can start your search at any home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowe's.


Look for clay or shale tiles, specifically, when you search for your stone. Terracotta tile works really well, as does most any stone that is labeled ""all natural clay and shale.""

, Glazed quarry stones contain lead, which is poisonous and generally to be avoided in all cooking items., Although one larger stone may be more aesthetically pleasing, several smaller stones may be more versatile in the end. You can position several smaller stones on various racks on your oven; they'll absorb heat, meaning that you can turn off your oven and let the heat emanate from the stones without burning extra energy. With several smaller stones, the heat gets more evenly dispersed.

, Enjoy pizza, French bread, cookies, bagels, and much more.

,,,, Cook for about five minutes.

,, The half cooked crust should be much easier to slide off the peel and back into the oven despite the extra weight.

Pour the egg mixture into the well. Whisk the buttermilk and 3 tablespoons of the cold water in another bowl. Pour half of the buttermilk mixture on top of the eggs in the well.

, Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the flour mixture by starting in the middle of the well and whisking outward. Continue to whisk until you have a thick but smooth texture. Add the rest of the buttermilk mixture a little at a time, whisking completely every time you add more. Keep whisking until it is lump free and smooth.

, Take a large, heavy bottomed pan and heat 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil. Use a paper towel to grease the entire bottom of the pan evenly. Pour a ladle of the batter for each pancake. Cook 60-90 seconds on one side. It should be golden brown. Flip the pancake and cook another 45-60 seconds on this side. Cook the rest of the pancakes in the same way until you run out of batter.


The batter should make 10-12 small pancakes.
Keep them warm in a low heated oven while you make the caramelized bananas.

, Cut the bananas into slices length ways. In a heavy, nonstick pan, pour the sugar evenly around the pan and cook on medium heat. Once the sugar has melted, turn the heat to high and cook until it is golden brown.

, Add the butter to the sugar and stir. Add in the bananas to the mixture and coat them in the caramel. Cook for 1-2 minutes. The bananas should be slightly golden and slightly tender.


Use a knife to check the bananas.
If you feel comfortable enough, you can toss the pan slightly to get the bananas covered in the caramel.

, Remove the pan from heat. Pour a generous dash of rum around the pan. Light the pan using a long kitchen match. Put the pan back on the stove. Once the flames subside, stir in the 2 teaspoons of water to help loosen the caramel.


The flames will be kind of high at first. Watch to make sure you do not get burnt.
Never pour the rum in while it is over an open flame. If you have an electric stove, you don't have to remove the pan from the heat. You have to if you cook on a gas stove because the rum might splash onto the flame and cause a kitchen fire., Take the pancakes out of the oven. Put two pancakes on a each plate and add 3-4 pieces of banana. Scoop a small serving of vanilla ice cream on top of the bananas. Drizzle a spoonful of the caramel mixture from the pan on top of the ice cream. Eat right away while it is still hot."

, Crack the eggs in a medium bowl. Pour in the sugar and whisk them together until combined. Then pour in the milk and whisk them all together until combined. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Pour in some of the wet ingredients. Whisk them together. Continue to add the wet ingredients a little at a time, continuing to whisk as you do.

, Melt the butter in a pan. Pour the melted butter into the batter. Stir gently with a spoon until it is combined with the batter.

, Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle pan on medium heat. Coat the pan in nonstick cooking spray or butter. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes. You should see bubbles forming on the top of the batter. Flip the pancake and cook for 1 more minute. The pancake should be lightly golden brown on both sides. Then remove it from the pan. Continue with the rest of the batter. Serve with a generous helping of raspberry compote pour on top of the pancakes.


This batter is made to serve four people.
While you are cooking the rest of the pancakes, keep the cooked pancakes on a plate in a 200 degree oven to keep them warm."

Err on the light side.,
Adjust the toast level to the toast eater.,
Be careful not to burn the toast!",How to Use a Toaster2," If you aren't familiar with the toaster, set the dial to a lower number rather than a higher number. You can always put the slice back in for a bit more heat – but you cannot un-burn a piece of toast!

, If you are making toast for someone else, ask them whether they prefer their toast darker or lighter. If they prefer their toast lighter, then set the dial to the low end: 1 or 2. If they prefer their toast dark, then set it to the high end: 3 to 5.

, If you set the dial to the highest setting, then you are playing with fire. Thick slices may press directly up against the electric heat filaments, which can apply dangerous heat to the food item.

Make sure that the toaster is plugged in.,
Practice toaster safety.,
Clean a toaster when it's not plugged in.",How to Use a Toaster3," Most toasters require access to an electric wall outlet. If the toaster is plugged in, but isn't working, then there may be a deeper electrical failure.

, Do not, under any circumstances, put a metal implement into the toaster while it is plugged in. Likewise, do not reach your hand into the toasting slots while the appliance is hot. The toaster works by firing metal filaments up to high heat using dangerous electrical currents. If you use your hand, you may burn yourself. If you put a fork into the slots, then you run the risk of electrocuting yourself.If the toast gets stuck in the slots: try depressing the lever for a moment, then popping it up manually—quickly, with force—to fling the toast out the top of the toaster.
Unplug the toaster before you try to remove food that is stuck. Then, use wooden tongs to remove the item. Wooden tongs will not conduct electricity!

, Try turning it upside-down to shake out the crumbs that have fallen deep into the slots. Most toasters feature a flat, removable tray that slides in and out of the bottom of the appliance. This tray catches crumbs and burnt bits. Remove the tray and dump out the contents to clear space for more crumbs.

Try using dry rice for tough smells and stains.",How to Use a Mortar and Pestle," Mortar and pestles are usually made in a matching set. The mortar is a small bowl and the pestle is a wand with a curve that's perfectly shaped to grind smoothly against the mortar. The instrument may be made from wood, stone or ceramic, and you'll want to choose your material based on your culinary needs and personal preferences.


Ceramic mortar and pestles are capable of grinding spices very finely, but they're also more fragile than other types.
Wood mortar and pestles are durable, but they're also slightly porous, and subject to stains. It's also possible for the flavor of one spice to stay present in the mortar between uses, tainting the flavor of the next spice you grind.
Stone mortar and pestles also grind very finely, but unless they're conditioned properly, fine particles of stone can get ground into the spices.;
, Do you want to crush large amounts of spices, seeds, and nuts, or only small amounts? You will find varying sizes from palm size to bowl size, and it may even be handy to have two different sizes if you have the space and budget for it.


If you plan to grind a very large amount of spices, getting a spice grinder may be more suitable for your needs. A mortar and pestle is best for just enough spices to create whatever dish or spice mix you immediately want to use.

, If you need something ground into a paste or powder, this is the ideal tool. Items that are good to grind or crush in the mortar and pestle include peppercorns, spice seeds, herb seeds, fresh herb and spice leaves, rice, nuts, other plant seeds, hard candies, sea salt, and so on. Anything used for baking or eating that can be crushed is likely to work in the mortar and pestle.


If you need something chopped, pureed, or blended, you may be better off with another tool, such as a blender or processor. The recipe will often be a guide on this.

, Measure out your whole peppercorns, cinnamon, or other ingredient and place it in the mortar. Fill the mortar no more than ⅓ full with raw spices; otherwise, it will be difficult to get an even grind. If you have too much to fit, it's fine to process the spices in batches.

, Hold the mortar in place with one hand, take the pestle in your opposite fist, and twist it against the ingredients in the mortar so that they are ground against its bottom and sides. Evenly grind, bash or crush all of the spices, using the pestle to mix and grind them until they are all reduced to the same consistency. Continue until the ingredients are as coarse or fine as you want.


See below to learn specific techniques for grinding, crushing or bashing your ingredients. Each technique will result in a different consistency, and can affect the flavor and final outcome of your dish.

, You can either place the freshly ground contents of the mortar into a glass spice jar with a tight-fitting lid, or go ahead and measure out how much you need for your recipe.

, This is the ideal technique for most spices you'll use in baked goods, sauces and other dishes. You can grind to a coarse, medium or fine consistency.


Place your ingredients in the mortar and hold it in place with one hand.
Hold the pestle in your fist with a firm but comfortable grip.
Press the rounded end of the pestle down onto the ingredients and roll it against the mortar while applying firm pressure.
Grind until you've reached your preferred consistency.

, If the item resists or is simply large and needs this approach, use firm but gentle pounding, sometimes called bashing. This will crack the spices, allowing you to switch techniques to get a finer grind.


Grind first. This action will catch the ingredients that crush easily and make the pounding easier.
Pound or bash the ingredients. Use the broad end of the pestle and bring it down gently. Use short, sharp pounds to speed up the process and conserve your own energy.
To avoid mishaps, cup your other hand (or a small cloth) over the top opposite side of the mortar and pestle to catch any of the bashed item that tries to bounce out.
Grind again if needed. Once most of the ingredients have been crushed, a little end muddling may assist to finish off the crushing.

, If your recipe calls for crushed, rather than ground, spices, that means they shouldn't be completely pulverized. Instead, you want to keep them mostly intact. This is also a suitable technique for processing garlic.


Place the ingredients in the mortar.
Roll the pestle across the ingredients so that they crush and burst.
Continue until all of the ingredients have been crushed, but not finely ground.

, The cleaning approach is dependent on the material of the mortar and pestle. Check the instructions that came with the mortar and pestle you bought to ensure you clean it properly. Here are some broad advisories:


For a dishwasher-safe mortar and pestle, simply place in the usual dishwasher cycle.
If it is not dishwasher-safe (such as a wooden set), clean with warm water. Dry it completely before storing.
For a dry grind, it may be sufficient to simply brush out with a clean cloth or paper towel.

, Since most mortar and pestles are a little porous, soap can leave an ill-tasting residue that can get mixed in with your spices next time you grind something.Wiping it out with warm water, then drying it thoroughly should do the trick.

, Sometimes it's difficult to remove smells and stains from strong spices. A good trick is to pour some dry white rice into the mortar, then use the pestle to grind it finely. The rice will probably take on the color and smell of the last spice you processed. Discard the rice, then repeat the process until the ground rice remains white and odor-free after the grinding.

, Remove all ash and grease from your grill, scrubbing with a grill brush to remove any burnt-on fats. Wipe down the cleaned grate with cooking oil.

If you’re working with a gas grill, heat it up before cleaning. Then use a grill brush to scrape off the loosened food and debris.
Cooking with a dirty grill can impart unpleasant flavors to your food.
If you don’t have a grill brush, any metal-bristled brush will work.

, Charcoal grills have vents on the bottom of the grill. These vents allow air to enter the grill and stoke the fire. Opening the vents will make it easier to light the charcoal.

The vent will usually be a circular disk on the bottom of the grill that you can twist to open the air holes.

, Regardless of the type of food, the briquettes should spread out on the bottom of the grill slightly wider than the width of the food, to allow for even cooking. Use tongs or a spatula to spread the charcoal.


For thinner meat, spread the charcoal evenly on the bottom of the grill.
For thicker meat, make the charcoal higher on one side than the other. You will start cooking the meat on the side with more charcoal. When the outside is cooked to your preference, finish cooking the meat on the side with less charcoal.

Know that inexpensive chimney starters are the easiest way to get a strong fire every time.,
Load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper.,
Fill the top of the starter fully with charcoal briquets.,
Light the paper in several place from the bottom and set it on your grill.,
Dump the coals on the grill when the top pieces are covered gray.,
Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire.",How to Create a Strong Burning Charcoal Fire Without Lighter Fluid1," Usually sold for under $30, chimney starters use newspaper and heat convection to evenly light up your charcoal briquets. You can then safely dump them into your grill and get cooking within 15-20 minutes.;
, Between 2 and 4 pieces of paper, depending on the size of the starter, should do. Don't ball it up very tightly, simply crumple it into loose balls so that hot air can fill in the spaces. These will eventually light your charcoals.









If your chimney doesn't have a solid bottom, place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it.

, Take you favorite charcoal and fill the chimney starter all the way to to the top. You should be able to access the paper from the bottom.








, The paper will quickly heat up, and the hot air and burning paper will ignite the bottom coals. Once the paper burns out, the coals will light each other, as hot air is pulled through the bottom of the chimney and through the coals.








The chimney will quickly heat up, so place it on a flame-proof, sturdy surface as the coals heat. The grill, already prepared for you to dump your coals, is a great place, as is a brick patio (though it will potentially leave burn marks).

, This usually only takes 10-15 minutes. Once you dump the coals, you'll be ready to grill.Most chimneys are dumped by carefully turning them upside down over the grill, but higher-end models may have a release switch which dumps the coals from the bottom. Dump the coals where you want them instead of dumping in the middle then trying to move them -- they may break up and lose heat if they are constantly picked up and moved.









If you plan to grill for more than 30 minutes, add 2-3 handfuls of charcoal now to keep the fire going when you need it., Open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire, helping it grow quickly. Keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill, then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly.

Pour the charcoal into the grill.,
Soak the coals with lighter fluid if necessary.,
Light the coals.,
Spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the grill.",How to Light a Grill2," The amount of charcoal will vary based on the size of your grill, but a good rule of thumb to follow is to add enough to form two layers on the bottom of the grill. Once you've added enough, stack the charcoal into a cone or pyramid shape in the center of the grill., Check your bag of coals to see if they require lighter fluid or if they are pre-treated. If they require lighter fluid, carefully pour it onto the cone of coals, focusing on the center. The amount of lighter fluid you should use will vary, but a good approximation is adding 1/4 cup (60 ml) of fluid per 1 lb. (450 g) of charcoal.If your coals are pre-treated with lighter fluid, you don’t need to add additional lighter fluid.
Allow the lighter fluid to soak into the coals for approximately thirty minutes before lighting., Use long fireplace matches to light the cone. Light several areas of the coals to ensure that the fire takes to the whole pile.

You can discard the matches directly into the grill if desired. Allow the coals to burn until they are all grayish-white on the surface.

, Use a long-handled instrument, such as a pair of tongs. Put the grate into place and close the grill’s lid. Let the coals burn until the edges turn grey. This should take about five-to-ten minutes."

Pack charcoal into a chimney starter.,
Add newspaper to the chimney starter.,

Pour out the coals.",How to Light a Grill3," Place the chimney starter on the open grill. Most chimney starters will hold approximately one-hundred coals. How much charcoal you need will depend on how hot your want your grill. For high heat, fill the chimney. For medium heat, fill it halfway. For low heat, fill it one-quarter full., Your chimney starter has a spot on the bottom to add paper. Fill the space with one or two pieces of paper. Any kind of paper works. For example, if you have old newspapers lying around you can use them to start your chimney.

You don’t need to add lighter fluid to the charcoal when you use a chimney starter.

, Use a long match or lighter to set the paper alight. Light it on several spots to ensure the fire spreads. As the paper burns, it will ignite the charcoal in your chimney.Watch the coals to make sure they begin to turn grey. If not, light another piece of paper under your chimney.

, When most of the coals are grey and you start to see flames on top of your chimney, pour the coals out into your grill. Spread the coals evenly across the bottom of the grill with a long-handled instrument, such as a pair of tongs."

Leave the burners on the “High” setting and close the grill’s lid.",How to Light a Grill4," The fitting for the hoses should be tight and you shouldn’t smell gas leaking out. Most propane tanks have a gauge that tells you when they need to be refilled. Refer to your grill’s user manual to make sure that your fuel tank is connected securely and has enough propane in it to cook with., Slowly turn the valve until it is fully open to release the gas. Leave it open for approximately one minute to allow the gas to travel through the fuel line., Using the knob on the front of the grill, turn the first burner to the “High/Start” setting. This will allow the propane to begin flowing through this burner., After allowing the propane to flow through the burner, press the igniter button on the front of your grill to ignite the gas from that burner.If the igniter button does not work, light the burner manually by holding a lit match against it with the gas on. Turn on the gas and hold a match near the ignition burner. Turn the knob to “High/Start.” The burner should ignite.
If the burner does not ignite with the button or a match within ten seconds, turn off the gas and wait a few minutes before trying again. Leaving the gas on can lead to propane accumulating dangerously in the air.

, Turn the knob for each burner to the “High/Start” position. It’s likely that the new burners will ignite on their own from the fire of the first burner. If not, press the igniter button again or light the burners with a long match., Allow the grill to heat up for at least five minutes before cooking anything."

Dent the edge of the jar lid with a firm object, preferably a spoon handle or the dull-side of a table knife's blade.,
Unscrew the lid.",How to Open a Difficult Jar3," Hold your spoon at a 45-degree angle. Use it to strike the side of the jar lid hard enough to make a slight dent. Rotate the jar about an inch and strike it again. Continue to dent the lid until you've gone all around and you hear the seal pop.









Make sure you hold the jar tightly with your other hand, so the jar doesn't fall over and break when you strike it.
Be careful not to strike the jar itself, or strike too hard. The jar could shatter.

, Once you hear the seal pop, hold the jar upright in one hand. Use the other hand to turn the lid to the left and remove it. Check the jar's rim to make sure it did not get chipped before using the contents of the jar.

Hot tap water will also do the trick, especially if the jar is cold to start. Fill a small bowl with enough hot tap water to cover the lid.
Or you can simply run hot tap water over the lid, making sure it doesn't touch the rest of the jar.

, Make sure the lid is submerged, but the jar itself is not covered in hot water. The hot water will make the lid expand temporarily and break the seal. Let the lid sit for one to two minutes, until you hear the seal pop open.

Open the bottom vents and clean out the ash.,
Crumple up 4-5 pieces of newspaper and place them in the center grill.,
Place small, dry sticks on top of your newspaper.,
Place 3-4 pieces of charcoal on top of your pile.,
Ignite the paper from several places.,
Get the charcoal smoking.,
Slowly add more pieces of charcoal to the fire you've made.,
Wait to distribute your coals for cooking until they are mostly covered in white/gray ash.",How to Create a Strong Burning Charcoal Fire Without Lighter Fluid2," You need good, consistent airflow to get your fire going, as the charcoal needs oxygen to burn. Make sure to dump any ash, as this takes up space needed for proper airflow, and to leave the vents completely open.

, Make a small pile of newspaper in the middle of the charcoal grate. You can also use the paper of the charcoal bag too. Paper lights quickly, and the flame from the paper will help the charcoal catch.


If you are struggling to light your fires with newspaper alone, soak half the paper in olive, canola, or vegetable oil. The oil will cause the paper to burn slower, which may give the charcoal more time to catch. This DIY solution, though far from perfect, has a lot of proponents as a natural alternative to lighter fluid., Kindling, which is small wood pieces used to start a fire, has a higher flaming point than paper, which will help light the charcoal. Place a handful of kindling on top and around your paper, making a little nest of sorts. The paper will light the kindling, and the kindling and paper together will light the briquets.


If the sticks easily snap in your hands, making a loud popping sound, they are dry enough to use.
Have a spare handful of kindling nearby as well, in case the fire needs extra fuel.
If you don't have any stick around, use extra paper. You may have to keep feeding it into the fire until the briquets catch, however, so have several pieces handy.

, These are going to start the fire for the rest of your charcoal. Place them near the center and rest them on the sticks. As the paper crumbles below, you want to still have some flames beneath the briquets.


While briquets (the small square pieces of charcoal) will burn for longer, hardwood charcoal is easier to catch and burns hotter initially.

, Use a match or a fire-starter to light several corners of the paper, getting a nice bright fire going. You should notice the kindling starting to catch in the big, leaping flames created by the paper.


If the stick haven't quite caught as the paper is dying out, loosely crumple up 1-2 more pieces and places them on the edges, near the sticks.

, If you see gray or white edges of ash on the briquets and the pieces are smoking, you're in business. This process is slow, but it will eventually start a fire. Keep your lighter fire of kindling and newspaper going until you've got some ash on the outside of the pieces.

, Once you've got the first few briquets smoking you can start adding more pieces, one after the other. A strong charcoal fire does not look like a wood fire -- if you see white or gray ash developing on the outside of the squares, you should be good to go. You will not likely see, however, large licking flames.Keep adding briquets until you have a large pile in the center of the grill. The inner briquets, for now, will be the only hot ones. You should see smoke coming up from the center of your pile. Depending on the size of your grill, you'll need a different amount of briquets:
Small, personal grills can usually get by with 25-30 pieces.
Medium size grills, like the most common 22"" grill, should have roughly 40 briquets.
Large grills may need anywhere from 1-2 bags of charcoal, and will take a long time to get hot using this method.

, The inside of the pile will be glowing bright red with heat. This means you are ready to cook. Add any more briquets you might want if they fire has gotten small, and then place the charcoal in it's desired location with a pair of long-handled tongs. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.

Keep your coals close together for a strong burning fire.,
Add more coals regularly to keep your grill burning.,
Keep the top and bottom vents open for maximum heat.,
Empty the ash as it builds up.,
Consider adding hardwood for added flavor and a hotter fire.,
Seal up any unused briquets.",How to Create a Strong Burning Charcoal Fire Without Lighter Fluid3," You want to keep the coals packed together, where they will conserve heat and burn hot. That said, they also need some airflow to burn best, so don't crowd them so much that they are tightly in a line. A loose pile is perfect. There are several methods of grilling to keep your fire burning strong:



Even Grilling coats the entire bottom of the grill with 2 layers of briquets. There are no spaces and everything is added evenly, allowing the whole grill to reach a consistent, even temperature. Use this if you need to cook a lot of food quickly.

Two-Zone Grilling Allows you to keep half the area open for indirect cooking or warming food. You need to shuffle half the charcoals into an even pile on one half of the grill, making sure there are 2-3 layers of briquets on the ""hot half"" of the grill., The coals will be hot enough, if they are red, glowing, and covered white, to get fresh charcoal burning. Do no wait until you're almost out of briquets. Instead, add the rest of the charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining. You may have to wait 5-10 minutes, when the new coals are covered gray/white, to start cooking again, but this is better than reigniting the grill from scratch.


If you plan on cooking for a long time, you should add 2-3 handfuls of coals every 30 minutes after the first set ignites., The more air you get to the fire, the hotter it will cook. Fire needs oxygen to burn, so the more oxygen you provide the hotter you can get your charcoal fire. If you need to control the temperature, close one or both of the vents partially, usually the upper vent.

, There is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill, and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents. Ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up.

, Chunks of hickory or applewood add fantastic BBQ flavors, and the wood should catch quickly on the hot charcoals. While wood burns quicker and hotter than charcoal briquets, a combination of charcoal and wood or wood chips is often the best way to a professional fire.

, If you don't use a full bag of charcoal, use a clip to seal the top of the bag. The additives in the charcoal can evaporate, making them harder to light next time, especially without lighter fluid."

Use a chimney starter for an even, strong fire with minimal effort.,
Place 2-4 pieces of lightly scrunched newspaper in the bottom of the starter.,
Fill the top of the chimney with charcoal briquets or wood chips.,
Light the paper from the bottom in 2-3 places.,
Dump the coals on the grill the top pieces are covered in gray/white ash.,
Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire.,
Open the bottom vents of your grill and remove the cooking grate.,
Form a ""pyramid"" of charcoal briquettes, with the peak in the center of the grill.,
Squirt a small amount of lighter fluid in the center of your pyramid.,
Let the briquettes with lighter fluid soak for 2-3 minutes.,
Apply a thin second layer of lighter fluid.,
Light the fire safely with a long match or electric lighter.,
Spread the briquettes out once they are mostly covered in gray/white ash.,
Seal up any unused briquets for next time.",How to Create a Strong Burning Charcoal Fire1," Chimney starters are the easiest way to get a good charcoal fire, and you won't need any lighter fluid, either. You put paper in the bottom, fill the rest of the chimney with charcoal, and light the paper on fire. The heat is contained in the chimney, allowing all the charcoal to quickly catch fire before you dump it onto the grill to use for cooking.


Chimney starters are usually between $15-$30, depending on size, and can be found online or in hardware stores.
Most professional BBQ chefs and cooks highly recommend buying a chimney starter, as lighter fluid can influence smoke flavor and is harder to use when making an even heat fire.;
, You only need to ball the paper up loosely, as having it too tight can prevent the flame from getting enough oxygen. The paper will act like a rapid, large match for your charcoal, starting the fire.


If your chimney doesn't have a solid bottom, place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it.

, Fill the entire chimney up with your favorite charcoal, or a mixture of both. Use enough charcoal for your entire grill, as the chimney will ensure that everything is evenly lit. For a normal, 22"" grill this means roughly 40 briquets, but simply filling your chimney to the top should be a close enough estimate., Use long matches or a grill lighter to protect your hands. The paper will burn up quickly, but the concentrated flames and hot air will ignite the bottom charcoal, which will then light the rest of the chimney.Place your chimney on the charcoal grate of the grill or a heat-resistant surface as it heats up. It will get very hot, and can cause a fire if left unattended.







, As the heat rises in the chimney, the coals on top will catch and start to coat with white/gray ash. It usually takes 10-15 minutes to get hot enough. You are then ready to start grilling.Dump the coals in the center of the grill if you plan on keeping the whole grill surface hot, or on one-half of the grill if you want separate areas for direct and indirect cooking.


If you plan to grill for more than a half hour then add several handfuls of charcoal now so that they catch as they others begin to fade.., Open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire, helping it grow quickly. Keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill, then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly.

, Get rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire.


Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly., Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength.


For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking.
For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes.
For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook., You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of ""2 Mississippi"" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle.


You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the ""top"" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot.
A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch.

, Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly.

, Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will ""catch,"" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire.

, Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning.


Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught.

, Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill.


You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes.
If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long.

, Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid."

Look for an electric grill.,
Look at different types of grill pans.,
Look for a grill with an adjustable heat setting.,
Check on the liquid disposal and cleaning.,
Add liquid smoke.,
Keep an eye on timing.,
Care for your indoor grill properly.,
Expand your collection of recipes.,
Take advantage of grilling vegetables.,
Try grilling different types of foods.",How to Grill Indoors," Most people have heard of the George Foreman electric grills and similar brands, which come in many sizes and grill both sides of the food at one time. However, you should shop around to find the one that suits your needs and kitchen space best. For example, there are three main types of indoor grills; a countertop model with one-sided grilling, a countertop model with dual-sided grilling, and a range top that sits on a stove burner and mimics an outdoor grill.Countertop models, like the Hamilton Beach or DeLonghi, are often electric, smokeless, and easy to clean due to their non-stick surfaces.
A range top or stovetop grill, like the Staub Rectangular Grill Pan, can create a lot of smoke if you cook a lot at once. However, they are better for mimicking the look and feel of an outdoor grill, because you can get the same kind of char marks.;
, If you don't want to sacrifice counter space, even momentarily, consider buying a grill pan. These are similar to any normal pan, except they have grooves that mimic the grate of a grill, which allows you to get the same kind of char marks you'd find on an outdoor setup.

Most grill pans are cast iron or stainless steel, like the Anolon Tri-Ply Clad Deep Round Grill. They are also usually non-stick and small enough to be stored in a cupboard with other pans., Some grills come with only one setting, while other grills allow you to raise or lower the heat throughout the cooking process. Being able to adjust the temperature of your grill while cooking will help make sure you cook your food all the way through without burning it.


Most if not all range top grills will adjust the temperature with your stove, however, depending on the width and length, they may heat sections differently.
An electric grill like the Cuisinart Griddler will allow you to change the temperature separately on each plate, which is great if you want to cook two different foods at one time., Most contact or countertop grills come with a slanted surface that allows the fat to drip off or drain through the center. They may also even come with a built-in plate or tray to collect it. However, for range top models like grill pans, there is usually no method for draining excess oils, so cleaning is more difficult.


Countertop grills are usually non-stick and contained, which means you won’t have a lot of oil or fat splattering all over your counter. They are also relatively easy to clean with just hot water and paper towels.Rangetop grills or grill pans, on the other hand, can be a bit messier. Depending on the size or how much food you are cooking, they can cause a lot of smoke - and can spray a lot of kitchen area with oil. However, the cleaning is about the same as a countertop grill.

, Just a small amount of this product will give your food the same smoky flavor you’d get from an outdoor grill. You can use it on anything, too; steaks, burgers, pork chops, chicken, even on vegetables. You can find liquid smoke in most grocery stores, just look in the sections for marinades and barbecue sauces.When using liquid smoke, simply pour a small amount of it over your food. Be careful of using too much, though, as it may add a chemical taste to your food when overused.
Also double-check the ingredients when purchasing, as some companies may add extra seasonings that alter the flavor., Some indoor grills might require you to cook your food a little longer than outdoor grills. This is especially true when it comes to electric grills, as the heating method requires the coils to heat up first. On the other hand, with a range top that uses your stove, the heat source is stronger and more direct. Just keep in mind that if you are using a grill pan over two burners, you are going to have areas that don’t heat as quickly.


Use a meat thermometer to ensure your food is cooking long enough.
The cook time for your food will depend on the cut of meat and what type of indoor grill you're using, however, expect anywhere between 4-10 minutes for beef in a double-sided grill, 4-6 minutes for poultry, and 6-10 minutes for pork. If you are using a one-sided grill, you can expect the time to double., Do not use metal utensils on nonstick surfaces and avoid harsh cleaning ingredients on your iron grill pans. For example, try sticking with just hot water and a light dish soap, as using a harsh scrub brush or steel wool on your indoor grills will wear down the surface and lead to uneven heating in the future.Even if you feel you have an excess of charred residue, simply run your grill under hot water and scrub lightly with a sponge. The nonstick surface will ensure any leftovers come off easily.

, You can find recipes designed specifically for indoor grills on websites, magazines, and books. Check out sites such as foodnetwork.com and epicurious.com, for regularly updated recipes. You can also look for cookbooks on Amazon.com or at your local bookstore.

, Vegetables are an important and healthy component to any meal. Grilling veggies outdoors can be complicated because the grill gets so hot, but on an indoor grill or grill pan, you can control the cooking temperature and time.


Try grilling corn, asparagus, zucchini, or squash. You can even cut up a mix of these and put them together in foil with some oil and spices like rosemary or thyme before putting them on the grill.
Most vegetables should grill in 5-10 minutes.

, Don't limit yourself to just meat and vegetables, instead try grilling pizza, potatoes, and bread. For example, you can grill a pizza dough in just 1-2 minutes - just make sure the bottom of the dough has browned before you add your toppings. You can also make wonderfully crispy garlic bread and grilled cheese."

Look for any damages such as deep dents or areas of heavy rust. Look around the fitting on top of the tank to make sure it is not bent or damaged in any way. Inspect the nozzle for obstruction.;
, The date is on top of the tank along with other important stamped information. If the current date exceeds twelve years of the stamped date, the tank is out of date. Check with your local propane dealer for exchange. For example: a tank that is stamped ""01 98"" expires 02/10. If the date is followed by a letter, call your propane dealer for the date of expiration.

, The tank should be weighed to get credit for the propane that still exists in the bottle and to prevent from over filling. To find the weight of your tank look for the letters ""TW"" stamped at the top of your tank followed by a number. For example: ""TW 16.9"" is the tank weight when it is empty. A number very close to this one might be found on the bottle from your grill. Grills commonly use 20lbs bottles. A tank stamped with ""TW 16.9"" (empty weight of tank) plus 20lbs (amount dispensed into tank) equals the maximum weight of the tank, 36.9lbs.

, (You can find the maximum pounds of propane that can be added to an empty tank by looking for the letters ""WC"" stamped on the top of the tank, this stamp is followed by a number. Look on the chart inside the dispensing station to convert the WC# to the proper dispensing amount or call your local propane dealer for the information.) For example, If your tank is stamped ""WC 95.5"" the maximum amount of propane added is 40lb.s

,, It is located on the neck of the fitting. When the tank is full, a full stream of fluid will spray from the bleeder port. This should occur at the same time the desired weight is achieved. Do not overfill and use neoprene gloves to prevent frostbite. Rubber will not stop liquid propane from causing burns. Neoprene will prevent the burn from happening. Also make sure the neoprene gloves you are wearing are loose enough to shake off with one swing in case you do come into contact with liquid propane.

, Reinspect for any signs of leakage.


You are now ready to use your newly refilled bottle. When you attach your bottle for use, inspect your equipment for signs of leakage before using.

Never attach propane to the grill with the grill cover closed: If the propane is accidentally turned on with the grill cover down, it could accumulate under the cover and explode in a fireball, causing serious harm.


Make sure the gas is turned to the off position before hooking the propane tank up to the grill.
Remove the empty tank from the grill if you haven't already. The grill is now ready for your safe set up!;
, The plastic cap will be perforated, making for relatively easy removal, and should boast a bright color, like red or blue.

, Make sure the coupler is fully screwed in, but not so tight that you won't be able to unscrew the coupler when the time comes to put in a new tank.


Consult your grill's manufacturer's manual as an extra resource. It may contain useful information on the amount of propane you want flowing out of the valve, as well as answer any troubleshooting questions you may have during the setup process.

, Your valve should be in the shape of a triangle and etched with the words ""OPD,"" or overfill protection device., Once that is done, you are ready to turn the grill on again and enjoy a finger-lickin' season of bbq.

Place the grill grate back into the grill.,
Turn your lava rocks over periodically.,
Clean the lava rocks after about six months.,
Replace your lava rocks every year or two.",How to Convert a Gas Grill to Lava Rocks," It's important to clean the grill before you add lava rocks. Take the main grate you cook on out of the grill. You need it out of the way so you can add the rocks. Now is a great time to give the grate a good cleaning if you don’t clean it often. Set the grate off to the side of the grill for now., Most gas grills have a metal shield that covers the burners from grease drippings. Your grill may have one heat tent that runs across the grill, or there may be more than one. Remove them all if there are more than one.For the lava rocks set up, you’ll not be putting the heat tent back into the grill. Store it somewhere you’ll remember it in case you want to put it back on at another time.

, While your grill is more empty than usual, give the bottom and the sides a good scrub. You might use hot, soapy water, or degreaser for heavier buildup. Wipe the burners and the bottom of the grill until they are clean., Visit your local home improvement store, garden store, or big-box store, like Walmart. Look for lava rocks in the landscaping or garden section. Get rocks that are at least a couple square inches (roughly 5 sq. cm) so that they are big enough to sit on a grate.

Stores might sell lava rocks by the pound or in a package. Make sure you get enough to create a single layer across the entire length and width of your grill.

, Buy either a tray that is specifically made for lava rocks or another generic grate similar to the one already in your grill. Make sure it is small enough to fit into the lower part of the grill, but large enough to reach all sides of the grill.A cookie cooling rack might serve the purpose perfectly.

, Line the grate with lava rocks from side to side in all directions. Place the rocks close together so they are touching, but don’t pack them so tight that they are overlapping or piled higher than one layer. Arrange the various shapes and sizes of rocks so they fit together.If the rocks seem pretty dusty, rinse them off with water before you put them into your grill. Dust won't necessarily harm anything, but they may not heat up as well if they're dirty.

, With the lava rocks installed, insert the cooking grate back into its position. The grilling grate should be high enough that it leaves room between it and the lava rocks below it.

If you’ve never taken the grate out before, double check that you’ve put it back in correctly.

, As you cook on your grill, grease drips onto the lava rocks. Since they are porous, some grease will soak in over time. To avoid heavy buildup on one side of the lava rocks, flip them over every month or two, depending on how often you use the grill.If you use the grill daily, you’ll want to flip them every two weeks. If you use the grill once a month, you probably don’t need to flip them until six months after you install them.

, Clean your rocks if they become obviously dirty but you don’t want to replace them. Remove them from the grill, and soak them in hot water with dish soap for about one hour. Then let them soak in clean, cold water for another hour.Grease won't dissolve in water, so the addition of dish soap is important. Even so, you won't completely remove all of the grease from the rocks.

, The lava rocks that you install now are not meant to be permanent. They will need to be changed on occasion. Use your best judgment based on how often you cook on the grill.If you use it every week, replace the rocks yearly. If you only use it a half dozen times a year, leave the rocks in for two years.

",How to Clean Your Barbecue Inside Out," If you're still entertaining and do not fancy this, or simply forget, there are still possibilities. For lidded barbecues, a nice way of softening up grime is to position a water-soaked newspaper or equivalent within and make use of a gentle heat again for half an hour or so. This will basically steam clean the whole inside, and you will laugh as you gently clean away the grime afterwards. Obviously this is simple for gas models, however if you have charcoal try using several small pieces of firewood or even other very easily flammable material to obtain some heat going, or even just a few coals if you must. Keep an eye on the newspaper though and ensure it doesn't burn or you’ll have more mess on your hands! Whether you steam or not, chemical cleansers are also a great option. Remove the grill and place on some newspaper, and squirt liberally with stove solution or other spray on cleansers (like you would use in your kitchen area) and leave for an hour or so.;
, Much softer mess can be removed with a regular soft cloth or skillet scourers. Be cautious with enamel-coated grills, you should loosen dirt really well first and then use a gentle pressure as possible. Lastly, give the barbecue a good wash and leave in order to dry.

, For straightforward grilling with charcoal barbecues, scoop or tip out any coal mess, and clean up the final bits with some damp kitchen roll. Now wipe the surfaces down with a soft cloth covered in spray cleaner, gently scrubbing any stubborn places. In the event that there are areas which have burnt on food you can’t remove, you may have to spray on some stove cleaner and leave for some time but read the cleaner directions to make sure it's suitable for the surface in question (i.e. enamel, painted, metal and so on). Don’t worry about the base where the hot coals sit as this is unlikely to be looking great because scuffs and burns develop here. So long as it is clean and free from aged waste materials you won’t get any nasty odors in the next cookout. Gas barbecues can be a little more tricky. Numerous places could be cleaned out just as with the techniques above, but gas outlets and lava rocks etc add extra work.

, If you're able to now clean around the burners and bars with ease - great. However, you may have to remove some parts to clean them properly, so consult your guide, and remember to not begin removing any gas-ferrying components that you're unclear about. Put them back again when you are done, and scrub the lava rocks/coals in the bucket if requirements be and wash them in fresh water. You may find these need replacing after a year or so if they are gathering grime. Lastly, rinse the interior of the charcoal or gas barbecue with a hose or a bucket of water until it looks nice and sparkly, and replace the actual lava rocks and so on. Replace the actual barbecue grill and stand back to admire your work.

, The outside of the barbecue is easy. Simply wipe it down with a moist cloth, adding a suitable solution - regular cleaning up liquid should be fine, but you can get stainless polishing spray or other material-specific cleaners. Gas control knobs can often be removed to wash, which is essential as you do not want grime to accumulate and cause stiffness. Be cautious with any flaky paint or even chipping enamel – you can always retouch these places but be sure you consult either a guide or the manufacturer first on what precisely to use. Once clean, buff the outside with a dry cloth and add any kind of preservative films you want. Some people recommend wiping down stainless steel models with oil (even baby oil) to keep the weather at bay, but don’t worry too much. It is a good idea to take time to preserve any kind of wooden areas though with a dedicated barbecue wood oil treatment. Please, please watch out for chemical preservatives or treatments you utilize elsewhere in the home. Some may be flammable and also have no place on a barbecue!

, In addition, if the coal area is looking exhausted, add a slim coating of sand which will protect it. Remember to cover your barbecue or place it in the garage if you have 1. You will be grateful you did whenever you roll it looking all gleaming for the next time.

Pack your charcoals together for strong, direct heat.,
Add coals regularly to keep your grill burning hot.,
Keep the top and bottom vents open to get the hottest temperature.,
Empty the ash frequently.,
Adding hardwood charcoal for added flavor and greater heat.",How to Create a Strong Burning Charcoal Fire2," As you cook, use your tongs to keep the charcoals together, as solitary briquettes will quickly lose heat and do little to keep your fire going. You do not want them so well packed that they can't get air, but you also don't want them separated like many little islands.There are two styles of charcoal placement, depending on how you plan to cook:



Even Grilling: Coat the entire bottom surface of the grill with two layers of charcoal. This allows the whole grill to reach a consistent, even temperature. If you're cooking food quickly and don't need any indirect heat (for large, slow-cooking cuts of meat), this is the way to go.

Two-Zone Grilling: Shuffle all of the charcoals into an even pile on half of the grill, leaving the other half bare. This lets you cook foods quickly, directly over the charcoals, but also allows you to cook slower cuts by indirect heat on the opposite side of the grill. You can also keep already cooked food warm, on the empty side of the grill, or smoke them with grill top on., Don't wait until you're almost out of briquets to add more. Instead, add 5-10 pieces of charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining, usually every 30 minutes. Wait 5-10 minutes while the new charcoal ignites and begins to get a white/gray coat on the outside before you resume cooking.If you feel like you need more coals, add them. More coals mean a hotter burning grill. Add slowly, putting on 5-6 at a time, until your grill reaches your desired heat.

, The more air you get to the fire, the hotter it will cook, so opening the vents is key to a hot, strong burning charcoal fire. The more oxygen you give to the flames. the hotter your grill will be. If you need to control the temperature, close one or both of the vents partially. Closing both of them at once can suffocate your fire and extinguish it.Closing the upper vent is also useful for smoking, as it lowers the temperature of the fire and traps the smoke in the grill around your food.

, There is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill, and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents. Ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up.

, Wood burns hotter than briquettes, leading to a smokier flavor and an easier sear. It also burns faster than briquettes, however, leading many cooks to use a combination of the two. This allows you to keep the fire burning for longer but still get a hot, smokey fire going to sear steaks or larger cuts or meat.Try hickory or applewood charcoal for the best, classic BBQ flavor and a strong fire.

Mix the two together well to form a paste.It helps to mix the baking soda with warm water so the two blend more easily together.;
, Once you’ve mixed up the baking soda paste, use clean hands or a rag to carefully apply it to the grill grate. Make sure to cover the entire surface, paying special attention to the dirtiest spots, and let the paste sit on the grate for at least 20 minutes.It’s best to remove the grate from the grill before you apply the paste. That will allow you to cover both sides so you don’t miss any spots.

, If you haven’t cleaned your stainless steel grate in a while, it may need a more intense cleanser to freshen it. Apply a generous coat of oven cleaner spray over both sides of the grate. Place the grate inside a plastic garbage bag, and allow it to sit overnight.You can use the oven cleaner if the baking soda paste doesn't work. It's not necessary to do both unless your grate is extremely dirty and the baking soda leaves residue behind.
Any oven cleaner will work to clean the grate, but you may want to choose a cleanser that is designed for use on both ovens and grills.

, After you’ve let the baking soda paste or the oven cleaner sit on the grate for the designated time, use a wire grill brush designed for stainless steel to scrub the entire surface. Make sure to run the brush between and along the sides of the grate to remove all of the cooked-on residue.Check your grill brush to make sure that it’s in good condition before using it. There shouldn’t be any bristles coming out.

, Once you’ve given the grate a good scrubbing with the brush, use your garden hose to spray it down with warm water. Make sure to remove all of the cleanser and dirt residue, and then dry the grate with a clean towel. Return it to the grill so you’re ready for the next barbecue.If the grill grate is particularly dirty, you may need to repeat the cleaning process more than once to fully remove all of the dirt and food residue.

, When your stainless steel grill grate is clean, you’ll want to keep it that way. Allow the grill to cool down for 5 to 10 minutes after using it, but while it’s still warm, use your grill brush to scrub the grate down to remove any food debris.To limit residue on the grate, always preheat your grill before placing food on it. That will help keep items from sticking to the grate.
Be sure to oil your food before placing it on the grate to help keep anything from sticking to the surface.

, The flame tamers sit directly on top of the burners to form a barrier between the burners and the grate. Food debris can sometimes build up on the tamers, so you should remove them and use a small, dry wire brush to remove any residue. Wipe them down with a clean piece of paper towel afterward.Make sure that your grill is cool and not turned on before cleaning any of the interior components.
If you’re not sure where the flame tamers are in your grill, consult the owner’s manual. They are also sometimes known as heat tents or vaporizer bars.

, When you take out the flame tamers, the burners will be underneath. Food buildup on the burners can led to uneven heating and burner failure. Clean tube, flat, u-shape, and cast burners with a small, dry wire brush, paying special attention to the burner port area where the gas comes out.If you have ceramic burners, don’t clean them with a brush. Turn the grill on for 10 minutes to burn off any food residue, and once the grill is turned off and cool, use tweezers to remove large food debris.
If you’re not sure what type of burners your grill has, consult the owner’s manual.

, The venturi tubes supply the gas to the burners, and can easily get dirty. Remove the entire burner assembly according to the instructions in the owner’s manual, and rub it and the tubes down with a cloth dampened with soapy water. Run a clean, damp cloth over the tube to rinse it.The venturi tubes are narrow tubes that have a series of small holes along the sides and/or ends. They may be curved and connected to the the burner assembly, or they may be straight and easy to detach from the burner assembly.
Consult your owner's manual to see exactly what your grill's venturi tubes look like and where to locate them.

, Clogs in the venturi tube can cause your grill not to work properly, but it’s easy for insects and other debris to build up inside. Use a small wire brush to clean the holes on the tube to ensure that there aren’t any clogs before replacing the tube and burner assembly.Consult the owner’s manual to determine the proper way to put the tube and assembly back. Your grill won’t work properly if it isn’t in place, and it can be very dangerous to lit the grill.
A paperclip or small piece of wire works well to clean the holes in the tube too.
You may want to run water from your garden hose through the tube to determine if there are any clogs.

, It’s best not to use stainless steel cleaners or polishes on the grill because they’re not designed to be used on surfaces that get very hot. Instead, fill a bucket with warm water and add some liquid dish detergent to create a warm, soapy solution.Never use an acidic or abrasive cleanser on stainless steel. They will damage the finish.

, Dampen a microfiber cleaning cloth with the soapy solution that you mixed. Run it over the entire surface of the grill’s exterior, making sure to rub with the grain of the stainless steel to avoid scratching it.Be sure to use a microfiber cloth to wash the stainless steel exterior. Other fabrics may scratch the finish.

, If there are stubborn areas where dirt is stuck on, wet a sponge in the soapy solution. Rub it over the areas, but be sure to move in the direction of the grain to prevent scratches in the stainless steel.While a soft sponge is fine to use on a stainless steel grill, don’t use a scouring pad or steel wool. They will scratch the surface.

, When you’ve finished cleaning the exterior of the grill, spray it down with your garden hose. Make sure to use warm water, though, to get all of the soapy residue off the stainless steel., After you’ve rinsed off all the dirt and soapy, wipe down the grill with a towel to dry it. Use a microfiber cloth, though, and move in the direction of the grain for the best finish.When the grill is dry, you may want to follow up with stainless steel cleaner wipe to give it a more polished appearance.

Throw away any leftover ashes from the ash catcher, if necessary.,
Reassemble the grill.",How to Clean a Charcoal Grill1," This area should be away from your campsite or off to the side of your yard. You'll be brushing ash and encrusted char off the grill at this location, so it should be far from walking paths.


Choosing a cleaning location far from walking paths will prevent ash and char from being tracked around your campsite or home.;
, Take the grate out of the grill. The grate may stain your hands with ash and char. Prevent this from transferring to your skin with gloves. Brush the grate with a wire grill brush to remove buildup from the grate.








In most cases, you should be able to lift the grate out of the grill. Some grills may have slots the grate fits into or catches. Release the catches, if necessary, and slide the grill free.
Use moderate force when brushing your grate and grill. Using excessive force may chip the coating on your grill, which could negatively impact its performance or void its warranty., Use your brush to clear out any encrusted bits on the bottom of the grill and its lid. If you notice peeling paint, remove this with a stiff bristle brush or putty knife. Wipe the exterior of the lid and body of the grill with a rag wet with soapy water.









If you’re using a public grill, you may want to place your hand in a plastic bag and sweep loose buildup into a separate plastic bag to be thrown away., The ash catcher is a receptacle on the bottom of the grill where ashes collect over time. Some public grills may not be equipped with an ash catcher. Brush ashes into a plastic bag and throw these away.








Some ash catchers may detach from the grill for easy disposal. Slide the ash catcher out of grill, dump the ashes in a bag to be thrown away or directly into the garbage.

, If you’ve removed the ash catcher, replace this before anything else. Then slide the grate into place. Press the grate with your hand to ensure it is sturdy and firmly in place. Your grill is now clean. You’re ready to grill.









For the cleanest grilling, line the grate of your grill with aluminum foil. Poke some holes in the foil before lighting the grill.
Using aluminum foil is highly recommended for public grills. You never know what’s been grilled previously."

Using a wet paper towel, wipe down the plates to remove any crumbs or chunks of food still stuck to the plate.Using a wet paper towel also helps remove any non-stick cooking spray you might have used on your grill. This is important since a layer of that cooking spray can prevent your grill from getting completely clean.;
, To make the cleaning solution, mix 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) baking soda with half cup (4 ounces) of warm water. The solution should be thick enough that it won’t just run off the grill, but thinner than a paste.Mixing this solution in a measuring cup can make it easier to pour when it’s time to clean your grill.

, Be sure that your pour it evenly, allowing the solution to run down each groove on the grill., To clean the top of the grill, dip a cloth in the baking soda solution. Wipe down each groove of the grill. You will need to reload the cloth with new solution frequently, depending on how dirty the grill is., Once you’ve applied the solution to both sides of the grill, let it sit on the grill for five to ten minutes. This will allow the baking soda to work into the residue on the grill and break it up., Dip a clean cloth in clear water and wipe down each groove of the grill.

Clean the inside bowl.",How to Clean a Cast Iron BBQ Grill2," You should set your grill over some newspaper or trap outside. When you do things like remove grease from the lid, newspaper can catch dirt and debris as they fall.
, Before you start cleaning the inside of the grill, examine the bottom of the grill. This is where food is likely to fall off during cooking. Put on a pair of gloves and remove any bits of charred, burnt food that are clearly visible., To start cleaning, clean the exterior of your grill. You do not need a specific cleaner. Warm water mixed with soap, such as dish soap, can easily be used to wipe down the exterior of the grill. Put on a pair of gloves. Dip a sponge in a bucket of warm, soapy water and gently wipe down the exterior of your grill. Get out any stains, such as bird droppings, as well as wiping off built up dirt and dust. Then, let your grill dry off.If there is buildup that is difficult to remove, use a mild glass cleaner and a terry cloth after applying soap and water. This should break down anything that isn't coming off.

, When you open your lid, you will notice some built up grease. This a black, tarry substance you should remove from the top of the lid. You should be able to peel off most of the grease with your fingers. Peel off as much grease as you can and then brush any remaining grease off using a stainless steel grill brush., At the bottom of your grill, you should find a handle you can turn that will sift out any excess charcoal into a removable container below the grill. Simply turn the levers until all the leftover charcoal is gone.

Heat up your grate.,
Brush the grate.,
Use your oven.,
Oil your grate.,
Scrape and oil again.,
Dispose of charcoal.,
Cover your grill.",How to Clean a Grill2," Before you begin cooking, light your charcoal briquettes, place the grate over the fire, and place the lid on the grill. Allow the grill to heat up for 10-20 minutes.


Allowing the grill to heat up will melt the grease on the grates and make cleanup easier.

, Take a long-handled grill brush (preferably one with stiff wire bristles) and brush the grate, removing all stuck-on particles. If you do not have a grill brush, you can scrub the grate with crumpled up aluminum foil held with long tongs.Cleaning the grate removes grease, sticky marinades, spices, and melted cheese that can transfer to freshly grilled foods.
Dirty grates can also make meat stick--especially delicate fish. For fish dishes, it is recommended that you cook the fish on aluminum foil that has been placed on top of the grate to avoid sticking and breaking.

, If your oven has a self-clean feature, you can bypass the brushing and scrubbing phase and place the grate directly in your oven.


Remove the grate and other metal pieces (that have been caked in food) from the grill.
Place the pieces directly on the oven racks and set the oven to self-clean mode.
The oven will lock and heat to approximately 900 °F (482 °C). This will burn off all food particles and will clean your oven all at once!, After you've managed to scrape the grill clean, fold a paper towel in fourths to create a cleaning pad. Dip the towel in vegetable or olive oil and use long tongs to spread the oil over the grate.


Oiling your grate prevents food from sticking. Bacon grease or steak fat can also be used to oil the grate and will give extra flavor to the food you cook on it.
Use caution so as not to drip oil on the charcoal below as this can create a ""flare up"", or a small area of intense heat. One of the goals in grilling is maintaining consistent heat for consistent food cooking.

, After you have finished cooking your food, scrape the grill with foil or a grill brush, and re-oil to clean and protect against rusting.


There is some debate about whether you should clean your grate with soap and water or if you should allow some buildup to occur. It may be a matter of preference, but one thing to know is that this is a cooking surface. Never use harsh chemicals or solvents (such as bleach or oven cleaner) directly on the grate as this has the potential to transfer to your food.
When you have completed your grilling season, it is recommended that you leave grease or oil on the grill to protect against rust (which only requires water, iron, and oxygen to occur).

, Allow the charcoal to cool for 48 hours before wrapping it in heavy-duty aluminum foil and placing it in a non-combustible container. This container may be a metal bucket or can.


Be sure the non-combustible container is placed in an area away from combustible materials such as fuel, acetone, wood dust, and paper.
If you must cool the ashes quickly, wrap them in aluminum foil and soak with water completely before placing them in a non-combustible container., A large part of keeping a grill clean is storage. A grill cover protects it from rust and the elements--especially if the grill is left outdoors.


Grill covers protect not only the grill itself but also conceal grill utensils from rust and the elements.
Grill covers can be lighter in weight for warmer months, and some companies make heavier grill covers for more extreme winter protection.
A good, snug fit will keep your grill secure and can even deter animals and pests from setting up shop.

, Most electric grills have a small cup that catches all the juices and grease produced during grilling. This cup should be cleaned after every use.


Remove the cup as per your grill instructions. Empty the contents in the trash.
Wash the grease trap either in the dishwasher (if it is dishwasher safe) or by hand with warm soap and water.

, Use a paper towel to wipe down any excess grease or food. Some models have removable grilling plates. These plates can be washed either in the dishwasher or by hand with warm soap and water.


Consult your model's operation manual for all features and follow written instructions.
Do not submerge the entire grill in water. This is an electrical device containing elements that can be damaged in water.

, If your model does not have removable grill plates, use a soapy sponge to clean the grill plates. Be careful not to use an overly-abrasive scrubber as this can damage the grill's non-stick surface.

, Follow the sponge wash with a damp dishrag to remove any greasy residue and to wash away any trace of soap. Finish by drying the grill plates with a dry paper towel.

, Use a sponge with a couple drops of dish soap to degrease the outside of the grill. Grease often splatters and accumulates on the upper and lowers lips of the grill, so it is recommended that you clean these areas after every use.

Heat up your grill.,
Wet paper towel in oil.,
Apply the oil to the grate with an oven mitt and tongs.,
Oil your grates when the grill is cold, alternately.,
Light your grill after applying oil to a cold grill.",How to Clean a Charcoal Grill2," Clean your grill of all ash and buildup beforehand. Make sure the grate is free of residue. Light the grill according to its user instructions and allow it to heat up. When the grill is hot, you’re ready to apply oil to the grate.








Oiling the grate of your grill will prevent food from sticking to it, allowing you to flip and turn food more easily.
Depending on your grill, it may take some time for the grill to heat up. Allow the grill to heat for a minimum of 10 to 15 minutes for the best results.

, Use a cooking oil suitable for high heats. Some oils you might use include canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil. Apply a moderate amount of oil to a wad of paper towel. There should be enough oil to coat the grate, but not so much that the oil drips from the paper towel.








Using too much oil can cause the paper towel to catch fire. For this reason, only lightly apply oil to your paper towel.Oil can transfer easily to your skin and make a mess. Wear gloves to prevent this while wetting your paper towel with oil.
Prepare your paper towel on a spare dish to prevent oil from getting on cooking or dining surfaces.

, Put an oven mitt on your dominant hand. With your mitted hand, pick up the tongs. Use the tongs to carefully wipe the grate with the paper towel. Cover all surfaces of the grate lightly with oil. Throw the paper towel out after using it.








When the grill is lit, there is a chance the paper towel may catch fire. If this happens, don’t panic. Remove the paper towel from the grill and dunk it in a bucket of water.

, In the same fashion described for oiling a hot grill, apply your oil to a cold grill grate with paper towel. Because the grill is cold, you can do so with your bare hands, though you may want to use gloves to prevent oil from getting on your skin.







, Light your grill according to its user instructions. As the grill heats, it will produce light smoke. This is normal. When the smoke stops, excess oil has been burned away and your grate is ready to grill food.

Grill fish at lower temperatures.,
Use a fish basket.,
Prepare the fish on a suitable griddle.",How to Clean a Charcoal Grill3," This technique can be especially helpful with thick cuts of fish. Combined with a lower temperature, a light coating of refined olive oil or corn oil can also help prevent fish from sticking to the grate of your grill.







, A fish basket is a grill accessory that hinges open to hold cuts of fish inside fine metal tines. Lightly oil the fish with a high temperature cooking oil and insert it into the basket. Use an oven mitt to pick up the handles of the basket and turn the fish when one side is finished cooking.

The handles on many kinds of fish basket, while convenient for turning the basket, can sometimes prevent you from closing the lid of your grill.

, Lay the soaked cloth on the bottom portion of the panini grill. It should completely cover the bottom grill to ensure that the entire grill is steamed. Be sure to keep the cloth away from any exposed electrical components., You’ll hear sizzling sounds when the grill closes and the wet rag meets the hot top of the grill. Check that the cloth is placed so that it it covers the entirety of the bottom and top parts of the grill., Stay near the grill and keep an eye on it. You should see some steam, but if you see or smell smoke, remove the rag immediately., Open the grill and remove the cloth after five minutes. Most of the caked on residue should now be easier to remove. Allow the grill to cool slightly (but not too much, as this will cause the residue to harden again).

Fill a fryer or deep pan with oil.,
Heat the oil.,
Add the bacon.,
Cook for about 5 minutes.,
Remove the bacon and let it cool.",How to Deep Fry Bacon1," Start by turning on your deep fryer, or finding a pan that’s spacious enough to completely submerge the bacon in. Fill the pan or fryer with about 2 cups of vegetable or canola oil. The bottom of the cooking surface should be covered with a couple inches of oil.A deep fryer with a built-in basket will make this type of culinary project much easier, but it is not a requirement.
To ensure that the bacon has the right consistency, the oil you use should be a liquid at room temperature, not a semisolid like coconut oil or shortening.;
, Turn on the fryer or stove and heat the oil until it reaches 360-375 degrees. At this point the oil will be bubbling and popping, so be careful not to stand too close.It might be a good idea to wear a pair of gloves or an oven mitt while frying to prevent oil burns.

, Carefully lower the strips of bacon into the fryer one at a time. Use a fry basket, fork or a pair of tongs to keep your hands away from the hot oil. Add as many pieces as you can comfortably fit in the fryer—that way there will be no need to make multiple batches.If you’re working with a smaller pan or fryer, cut the strips of bacon in half before you drop them in., The bacon will sizzle as it cooks. Keep an eye on both the clock and the bacon itself to make sure it doesn’t get too done. The oil will continue cooking the bacon after you remove it from the fryer, so you’ll want to take it out before it starts turning brown.There is no exact time it will take to fry the bacon. You’ll just have to watch it closely and use your best judgment.
The thickness of the bacon you’re preparing may cause it to cook a little faster or slower.

, Use a pair of metal tongs to extract the bacon strips from the hot oil. Let the excess oil drip off each strips, then set them aside on a layer of paper towels until they’re cool enough to eat. You now have a mound of tasty bacon that’s evenly cooked, perfectly done and ready to enjoy!Dab the bacon with a paper towel if you don’t like it quite as greasy.
Thick-cut bacon will have a chewier, meatier texture when deep fried than thinner slices, which will be especially crispy.

"

Prepare the bacon.,
Mix up a simple batter.,
Coat the bacon thoroughly.,
Drop the bacon in the fryer.,
Cook for 2 minutes on each side.,
Remove from the fryer and serve.,
Finished.

",How to Deep Fry Bacon2," Before bacon can be battered and deep fried, it needs to be heated through to make sure it doesn’t come out undercooked. Lay out your bacon strips on a pan, plate or baking dish, cutting them as needed so they’ll fit in the fryer. Bake, pan fry or microwave the bacon until it’s done, then allow it to cool.


Thick-cut bacon will work best for battering since it will be less brittle and makes for a heartier bite.
Try to get your bacon slightly less done, as it will be cooked a second time later.

, Combine 3 eggs, 2 cups of whole milk and 3 cups of all-purpose flour in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they form a thick batter. Add salt, pepper and other spices to taste. Refrigerate the batter for about 20 minutes to lower the temperature and help it set up.Seasoned salt, garlic salt, onion powder, cayenne pepper and paprika all make great optional flavor additions to fry batter.
The colder the batter is, the better it will fry to a crispy finish and protect the bacon from overcooking., Once the batter has cooled, take it out of the refrigerator and grab your precooked bacon. Dip the bacon into the batter with a pair of tongs, being sure each strip is generously coated on both sides. The bacon is now ready for the fryer.Give the batter a quick stir after it comes out of the refrigerator. If it looks too thick, add an extra splash of milk and whisk again.
If you’re using a thin-sliced bacon, batter the strips by hand so they don’t break.

, Place 2-3 strips of bacon into the hot oil and allow it to start frying. The number of strips you’ll be able to cook per batch will mostly depend on the size of your pan or fryer. Try not to put in too many pieces at one time, or they could stick together or cause the batter to slough off.


Watch out for popping oil when you put the bacon in the deep fryer. Even a small splatter could be extremely painful.

, Give the bacon a little time to absorb the oil and start sizzling. Since the light, airy batter will cause the bacon to float on top of the oil, the slices will need to be turned after a couple minutes. Once the batter begins to puff up and turn a pleasant golden brown, the bacon will be perfectly done.For this method, you’ll be watching the color of the batter rather than the bacon to determine when its done.
Remove the bacon from the fryer before it turns a darker brown. The oil will continue to cook the batter for another minute or two after you take it out.

, Use your tongs to grab the bacon slices out of the hot oil. Place them on a folded paper towel to soak up excess oil and let them cool off until they’re edible. Repeat the deep frying process until you’ve cooked all the bacon you want. The finished product is a salty, decadent snack that you just might find yourself addicted to!Savor the deep fried bacon right away so that it’s still hot, fresh and crispy.
Because of its high fat and sodium content, deep fried bacon should only be enjoyed as an occasional indulgence.,"

As an alternative to freshly made rice, you can also use leftover rice. Once your rice is cooked, set it aside for later.


One cup (200 g) of uncooked rice will make 3 cups (600 g) of cooked rice.;
, In a pan or skillet, cook your bacon over medium heat until it becomes dark and crispy. This process should take around 10 minutes. Set the bacon aside on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb the grease. When you're done cooking the bacon, leave around 2 tsp (9.8 mL) of bacon fat in the pan. You can use this fat later to cook the other ingredients.If you are a vegetarian, you can pick up tempeh bacon, which is a non-meat based product that replicates the taste of bacon as an alternative.Another non-meat based alternative to bacon is oven baked shitake mushrooms with salt.You can also replace bacon with ham or breakfast sausage.

, Take your crisp bacon or bacon substitute and place it on a cutting board once it’s cooled. Chop the bacon into small one inch (2.54cm) pieces using a sharp knife.

Add your scallions to the fat and allow them to simmer for 2-3 minutes, then reduce your stovetop to medium heat.Your scallions should sizzle when you add them to the pan.

, Add the rice to your pan and mix it together with the scallions. Break up any larger chunks of rice and continue to stir the pan for 3-5 minutes, or until the rice has slightly browned. Once you’ve finished heating the rice, move it to one side of the pan.When steam starts coming off the rice, it should be fully heated.

, Whisk eggs in a separate bowl and then add them to the free side of your pan. Continue to mix the eggs together with a wooden spatula until they become the desired consistency.

",How to Make a Breakfast Burrito," Then, use a whisk or fork to beat the eggs until they are evenly mixed. Whisk for no longer than 20 seconds. If you beat the eggs for too long, they may grow dense.Consider adding a few tablespoons of milk or half-and-half to give the egg a fluffier texture. Water also works, in the same increment.
Consider mixing cheese into the eggs. Use shredded cheese of your choice. Cheddar and jack usually work well in a breakfast burrito!;
, You can use whatever you have around, or you can buy vegetables specifically for the burrito. Common breakfast burrito ingredients include:


Fresh bell peppers, roasted peppers, and hot peppers.
Onions: any type, cooked.
Fresh, ripe tomatoes: be aware that juicy tomatoes will make for a messy burrito.
Mushrooms: fresh, clean, any variety.
Potatoes: diced finely and cooked. This makes for a heartier burrito. Most of the other vegetables do not absolutely need to be cooked – but you must cook your potatoes., If you eat meat, use the meat of your choice to lend some heft to the burrito. For a classic breakfast burrito, use traditional ""breakfast"" meats like sausage, bacon, ham, or chorizo. Feel free to use any other meat (chicken, steak, turkey, etc.) that you have on hand.


Cook the meat with the vegetables, unless you are making multiple burritos for both vegetarians and meat-eaters. In this case, keep the ingredients separate.

, Rice and beans are optional for a breakfast burrito, although many consider these ingredients to be essential burrito staples. Feel free to add just rice or just beans!Rice will take more time to cook unless you've prepared it ahead of time. On the other hand, it can be a great carbohydrate filler for your burrito.
Beans are easy. Heat up canned black, pinto, or re-fried beans to load some leguminous love into your burrito. You can heat the beans together in the pan with your cooking vegetables, or you can microwave the beans and add them separately.

, Choose a ripe avocado, peel it, and crush it up into guacamole. Avocado is optional, but it can be a great way to add taste and texture to your burrito. For maximum freshness, wait to open the avocado until you've cooked the other ingredients and you're ready to wrap the burrito.


If you don't use all of the avocado, store it in the refrigerator, covered, with a bit of citrus juice.
If you are making a meatless breakfast burrito, you can use avocado as the ""meaty"" and filling main ingredient. This is a common substitute.

, Bear in mind that some ingredients will take longer to cook than others. Start rice first, and then start cooking the potatoes and beans. Next, cook any raw meat, unless you are using pre-cured ham, sausage, or bacon. Grill peppers, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and other easy-to-cook vegetables at the same time. Start the eggs last – they'll be quick.If you are using pre-cooked or pre-cured meats, then you can simply grill them together with the diced vegetables. Quick-to-cook meats might include sausage, ham, and bacon.

, If you want to keep your eggs, vegetables, and meat separate, then you can scramble the eggs in one pan, and cook the other ingredients in another pan. Otherwise, mix all of the ingredients into the egg bowl, then scramble together in a big pan.


Alternately, mix all of the ingredients into the egg bowl, and microwave the bowl for approximately three minutes. Cooking times will vary, so check once the egg starts to rise. Do not let the egg rise up out of the bowl!

, Put your diced vegetables and meat into a pan, and cook for several minutes on a medium heat. Add spices and seasonings to taste. Again: add egg at this point to cook the ingredients into a scramble.


Consider cooking the meat and vegetables in salsa, for flavor. Pour a half-cup of salsa into the pan with the grilling ingredients.

, Take a large, fresh flour tortilla. Put it down flat on a clean plate or cutting board so that you have a stable surface on which to build your burrito. You can add toppings like salsa, sour cream, and shredded cheese at this point, or you can wait until you've arranged your main ingredients.


Consider heating the tortilla beforehand. Microwave the tortilla for thirty seconds, or heat it directly on the stove using a low heat. Be careful not to burn the tortilla on the stove. You want it warm, but not crispy!

, Add the egg, the veggies, the meat, the rice, the beans, the avocado – whatever you've prepared. Make sure not to make the burrito so full that you cannot fold it shut! Arrange the ingredients in a thin line across the center of the tortilla, leaving at least two inches on each side and at least an inch at each end., If you haven't added toppings yet, put them on top. Sprinkle cheese onto the mount of ingredients. Load sour cream or salsa along the line. This can be a fun way to spice up your breakfast burrito.

, First, fold the wide sides of the tortilla inward. Then, roll up the burrito from the bottom. This should ""seal"" both ends for easy eating.Consider grilling the burrito. For a tasty twist, plop the rolled burrito back onto a pan or grill to char the sides. Grill on a high heat for 20-60 seconds until the tortilla firms up and grill marks appear.

Let the pan cool.,
Select the right container for the oil.,
Strain the oil while pouring it into the container.,
Donate your cooking oil.,
Throw the oil away.,
Freeze your cooking oil.,
Reuse the cooking oil for another meal.,
Save some for rubbing on snow shovels.,
Consider making an oil lamp.,

Use the oil for shaving.,
Check if there is a local recycling center that will take the oil off your hands.

,
Take large amounts to a local restaurant.,
Feed it to your livestock occasionally.,
Use it to make soap.",How to Dispose of Cooking Oil," You should always let the oil cool down before removing it from whatever cooking device you were using. The length of time you choose to let it cool is up to you--you can leave it for an hour, overnight, etc. Hot cooking oil, if accidentally poured on yourself/a friend/your dog can cause severe burns.If you only have a small amount of cooking oil left in your pan, you can simply let it cool and then wipe it up with a paper towel. Do not ever pour oil down your kitchen drain.;
, You will want to use a non-breakable, preferably clean, container. Plastic containers work better than glass jars in that, as with any plastic vs. glass argument, glass will break if dropped. Having said that, Ball jars work well if you are pouring cooled oil into them as they have excellent resealable lids. On the plastic front, peanut butter jars are excellent oil containers.If you are not planning on donating your oil or reusing it, you can also cut the top off of a beer can and pour the oil into that.

, You do not have to do this if you are not planning on reusing or donating your cooking oil. Straining the oil ensures that no small particles of food get into your oil container and cause mold to grow., While this may sound odd, a lot of cities are now asking their residents to donate their used cooking oil. In turn, the city will make your grease into cleaner-burning biodiesel. Biodiesel is a non-toxic and biodegradable fuel that can power your car's engine and help the environment at the same time. San Francisco even uses recycled cooking oil to power some of their bus system!There are designated drop off sites where you can donate your oil. In order to find the one closest to you, run an internet search with the line “cooking oil donation .”

, If throwing it away is the only option, let it cool in its container. Make sure the lid is on tight and then throw it in the trash.

, After you have put your cooking oil into a container, you can freeze it. Freezing it has two purposes--it’s easier to dispose of cooking oil after its solid, and you can reuse it after it has thawed.

, Oil can be used for frying several times over, as long as you filter it between uses (which means straining it to get all the little bits of food out, among other things.)

, When you rub cooking oil on snow shovels, the snow has a much harder time sticking to the shovel (you would too if you were trying to grasp something covered in oil). This is a perfect solution for dealing with sticky, mashed potato-like snow that often shows up in the spring.

, Oil lamps are great to have when the power goes out and you’re stranded in inconvenient darkness for a day and night.

, As surprising as this may be, homemade lava lamps can actually be created with old cooking oil. Though not as useful as a regular oil lamps, lava lamps are still awesome.This is a fun project to do with kids and is a clever way of getting rid of your cooking oil.

, Avoid the chemicals in commercial shaving creams and lotions that may dry and irritate your skin by using cooking oil instead. Keep in mind that you probably shouldn’t do this if you have a tendency to break out.

,, Sometimes they have used oil/grease bins that you can throw your oil into, if you ask nicely.

, Mix cooking oil with stale bread, old rice or any grain product and feed it to your pigs or chickens. They eat almost anything. If you don't have animals, take it to a farmer you know. This is illegal in some areas, though, so investigate your local laws if you choose to try this method., You can only do this if the container only has one type of oil in it. Make sure to ""clean"" the oil by putting the cool, used oil into a saucepan filled with water. Let the water simmer (on medium to low heat), and stir the oil and water together gently. Anything that contaminates the oil, like bits of food, should fall out of the oil layer and into the water layer. To get the oil out, allow the solution to cool, and if need be, place the whole thing into a freezer until the oil layer is solid. Continue to ""clean"" it until no more food or other contaminants are seen.

Garnish and serve.",How to Season a Wok," Use a sponge or cloth and wash the wok in hot, soapy water to remove machine oil, dirt, dust, and other grime. Rinse the wok under hot water. Pat it dry with a towel, and set it aside to air dry while you prepare your ingredients.


Before you season the wok, it’s a good idea to ventilate your space. You'll be heating the wok to a high temperature, and it may let off smoke and fumes. Open a couple windows, and turn on your range fan or a standing fan.;
, Turn the heat on your stove burner to high and place the wok on the heat. Wait for 30 seconds, and then start dripping small amounts of water into the wok. When the wok is ready, the water will evaporate almost immediately on contact.Some newer woks don’t allow the water to evaporate. If that’s the case with your wok, just preheat the wok for one minute.

, Remove the wok from the heat and pour in the oil. Use the handles to hold the wok, and swirl the wok gently to distribute the oil evenly over its inside surface. Return the wok to the heat.


The best types of oils or fats for wok seasoning include peanut, canola, grapeseed, palm, and lard., Add the ginger and scallions to the wok and turn the heat down to medium. Cook the vegetables for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring regularly. As the scallions and ginger cook, use the back of a spoon to mash them against the sides of the wok so they release their flavors.You can add another tablespoon (15 ml) of oil if the vegetables start to dry out during cooking.

, As the wok heats up, the metal may start to become light brownish-yellow, possibly with some shades of blue and black. When this happens, remove the wok from the heat.


If your wok doesn’t change color at all during the cooking process, remove it from the heat after 20 minutes. Not all woks will change color., Remove the scallion and ginger from the wok and set it aside to cool. You can either discard the vegetables, or throw them into a soup or other savory dish.


When the wok is cool enough to touch, rinse it under hot water and clean it with a sponge or cloth. Do not use soap, as this will remove the seasoning layer you just applied.Dry the wok as best you can with a towel, and then place it on the stove over low heat. Allow the wok to warm up for about two minutes, until all the water has evaporated. This will ensure rust doesn’t form.

, The more fatty foods and oil you cook in your wok, the better and more established the seasoning layer will become. You can re-season your wok anytime you like, especially if you feel it isn't as non-stick and flavorful as you'd like. Over time, your wok will develop a black patina, and this is an indication that it’s fully seasoned.When your wok is still new, avoid cooking acidic foods in it until the seasoning layer is fully established.

, After cooking in your wok, set it aside to cool for a few minutes. When the wok is no longer hot to the touch, soak it in clean, hot water. You may only need to soak it for a few seconds, but for tough, baked on food, soak it for up to 30 minutes.Use only clean and fresh water on your wok. Don’t use soaps, detergents, or other cleansers, as these can damage the seasoning.
Don’t put a seasoned carbon steel wok in the dishwasher. Always wash it by hand.

, When the wok has had time to soak, rub it with a clean, wet sponge to remove food particles. If necessary, give it a gentle scrub with the green side of a kitchen sponge or a scratch-free scrubber. Once you’ve removed all the food debris from the wok, rinse it under clean, hot water to remove any leftover particles.


Don’t use scouring pads or abrasive scrubbers on a seasoned wok, as they will damage the seasoning., Pat the wok dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer the wok to the stove and warm it over medium-low heat for a few minutes. When all the water has evaporated, remove the wok from the heat and set it aside to cool.Drying the wok with heat is more reliable than with a towel, and will help prevent rust.

, If you don’t use your wok every day, you can help protect the seasoning in between uses with a layer of oil. With a clean cloth or paper towel, coat the surface of the wok with a thin layer of cooking oil or shortening.Wipe away excess oil with the cloth before storing the wok.

, Pour some liquid dish soap onto the rusted area and scrub it with steel wool until the rust is gone. Rinse the wok under hot water to remove the soap and rust particles. Dry the wok with a towel, then heat it over medium-low heat until it’s completely dry.To re-season the wok, add some cooking oil or shortening to the warm wok. Swirl the oil around, then remove the wok from the heat. Use a cloth to rub the oil into the surface of the wok, and wipe away the excess before storing.
Avoid using steel wool on your wok unless it’s to remove rust, because this removes the seasoning layer as well.

, Cooking in a wok is done quickly and at high heat. This means you must have all your ingredients ready to go before you even turn on the heat, because you won’t have time for preparation once you start cooking. What you'll need to cook a basic stir fry in a wok are:Cooking oil, such as peanut, canola, or grapeseed
Aromatics, such as diced onion, garlic, and chilies
Protein, such as meat, seafood, or tofu, cut into bite-sized pieces
Vegetables, cut into bite-sized pieces
Sauces and liquids, such as wine, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, broth, or coconut oil
Garnish, such as green onions, toasted spices, or nuts
A spatula, serving plates or bowls, and eating utensils

, Place a dry wok on the stove over high heat. After 30 seconds, sprinkle some water into the wok and see if it evaporates immediately. When the water evaporates within a second or two, the wok is ready for oil.


If the water doesn’t evaporate at all, preheat the wok for a minute before adding oil.

, Pour the oil into the hot wok by drizzling it down the sides. Use the handles to pick up the wok, and swirl it around to distribute the oil. Add in your aromatics, such as minced garlic and diced onions.Once the ingredients have been added, stir to coat the aromatics in the oil. Cook for 30 seconds to a minute to let the flavors permeate the wok.

, Add up to one pound (454 g) of meat, seafood, or tofu to the wok at a time. This will ensure the protein browns evenly. If you have more protein than one pound, cook it in batches.When the protein is about three-quarters cooked, transfer it to a plate, leaving the wok on the heat.

, Add the vegetables to the wok and start stirring immediately. Slide your spatula underneath the veggies and use the spatula to lift the vegetables and tumble them on top of themselves. To prevent burning, continue flipping the vegetables in this way continuously.To ensure your vegetables don’t get under or overcooked, add longer cooking vegetables, such as broccoli and carrots, to the wok first. As they start to cook through, add vegetables that require less time, like peppers and mushrooms.

, Return the protein to the wok to complete the cooking process. Then, add your liquid to help remove flavors and stuck-on food from the wok, and to add balancing flavors to the dish.


Add enough liquid to coat the food, but not enough to drown it.

, When the proteins and vegetables are fully cooked and the liquid is heated through, remove the wok from the heat and immediately portion out the food to individual bowls or plates. Top with garnish and serve.

Oil wooden spoons periodically to renew and retain vibrancy.",How to Clean and Disinfect Wooden Cooking Utensils3," Examine your wooden utensils for any signs of warping, cracking, or splitting. Check for any fuzziness that develops from the grains swelling as they get wet over time. Notice any discoloration, such as stains left by cooking with turmeric.








Create a routine “check-up” for your wooden utensils and extend their lifespans by treating stains, sanding rough surfaces, and conditioning the wood.

, If it feels fuzzy, it is probably because the grain of the wood has been raised from the soaking. If it’s just a little fuzzy, take a fine grit sandpaper to gently smooth the utensil. For rougher patches, you should to begin with a courser grain sand paper and finish with a finer grit.








Keep a supply of 100, 200, and 400 grit sandpapers on hand just in case.
If you opt to work from a coarser grit to a finer grit sandpaper, wet the spoon in between sanding sessions. Give it a rinse in hot water, then towel dry and let it sit to further air dry for a half hour or so.
When you sand with the finest grit sandpaper for the final time, wet the paper and the spoon for best results.Steel wool will work in a pinch if sandpaper is not available.

, Conditioning a wooden spoon using one of a variety of options will help extend its life. You can use a paper towel or a small piece of clean cloth to administer the oil to the utensil. Let it sit for about 20 minutes, then wipe thoroughly with a clean, unoiled cloth. You can use a variety of oils:









Mineral oil, a food safe oil that is commonly used by restaurants to increase the longevity of wooden utensils.Coconut oil, preferably that’s not been processed by high heat.Vegetable or canola oil will work in a pinch.
You can purchase a specialty non-toxic oil from a cook’s warehouse or restaurant equipment store.
Oil your wooden spoons up to once every month.

Finished.

",How to Buy an Indoor Grill," An open grill consists of a single grilling surface that is used like an outdoor grill, but is heated by a source such as electricity. A contact grill has 2 grill plates, the food is placed on 1 to cook it from underneath and another is folded on top of the food to cook it from above, simultaneously.


Open grills are most like outdoor grills and can be used to cook a variety of different foods. They are generally better than contact grills at creating grill marks on food, and because the grilling surface is open, you can prepare foods that may be more difficult to prepare in a contact grill where the top grill is hinged above the food, such as thick pieces of meat. Open grills tend to have larger grilling surfaces because they are not as heavy as contact grills, so you can cook larger quantities at once.
Contact grills cook food in less time because it is being cooked from both sides at once. They can also be used as panini presses, which may be an advantage to those who will be using their grill to make pressed sandwiches quite often. Contact grills also come in compact sizes so they may be ideal if they will be used in a small kitchen for 1 or 2 people.;
, Some grills have a lower voltage than others and are not efficient for cooking steaks, chicken and other cuts of meat. The higher the wattage on the grill, the hotter it will be able to get.

, Many indoor grills do not provide heat control so there is only a single temperature. Being able to adjust the temperature may come in useful if you plan on grilling a variety of foods.

, You will need to clean both grilling surfaces on a contact grill, but an open grill may have more crevices to clean between. Some contact grills and some open grills have a removable plate that can be washed in the dishwasher as well.

Go with a charcoal grill if you’re patient and like the unique flavor.,
Choose a gas grill if you have a larger budget.,
Opt for an electric grill if you live in an apartment complex.,
Entertain crowds with a smoker.,
Keep in mind that there are other options.",How to Choose a Grill1," Charcoal grills are the most common type of grill and are the most affordable, usually costing between $100 and $300 for high quality.Many prefer them for the particularly smoky taste that they provide by being fueled with charcoal. Charcoal grills take longer to start up and require cleanup after each use., Gas grills are fueled by liquid propane or natural gas and give you better control of temperature. You can get a good quality gas grill from around $200 to about $400. There are gas grills out there with price tags in the thousands, but even if you really want to impress neighbors, gas grills any more expensive than $800 don’t increase much in quality.This option may be more expensive, but it requires a bit less time and effort., Electric grills are great for those who don’t care to deal with the inconvenience of traditional grilling. Gas and charcoal grills provide more flavor but can require a few different products and steps. With electric grills, you just plug it into an outlet and you’re good to go., Smokers slow cook large amounts of food over a longer period of time, and pack in the flavor. Smokers are much bigger than your average grill and can function electronically or be fueled by charcoal or propane., While charcoal, gas, electric, and smokers are the most popular, there are several other grill types that might fit your needs better. Some other types of grills are:


Hybrid: a grill that can use propane one day and charcoal the next.
Pellet: a grill that functions much like a charcoal grill, but uses mesquite, pecan, apple, or hickory wood chips instead.
Portable: a mobile grill that’s ideal for camping and tailgating, and comes in either gas, charcoal, or electric."

Decide on a good location.,
Decide what kind of pit to go for.,
Draw out your plan.",How to Build a BBQ Pit1," It’s important to have a great location for your BBQ pit. You don’t want it too far away from your house so you have to carry all the food and utensils too far, but you don’t want to put it somewhere where the smoke will blow straight into your or your neighbour’s house.More important than convenience elements, however, are the safety factors which you should bear in mind.









Be sure you place it away from overhanging trees, buildings and fences which could be damaged by the smoke or catch fire.If you are building it on the surface, it should be placed on level ground.;
, There are a huge variety of potential barbeque pits, and you can even be creative in your design. Find one you like and you have the right space for. Check you can afford all the materials and you have the time to work on it. There’s nothing worse than leaving something half-finished.









Rope in a few friends or family members to help, especially if they are quite good with their hands. You can pay them back with grilled meat.

, Barbecue pit plans vary from the very simple, to the very complicated and ornate. If you are building it from scratch, you can find some plans to follow on the internet. If you are not so experienced in building, it might be a good idea to start off with a relatively simple plan. You can lay it out on the ground to get a clear picture of the size and shape.








A rectangular shape with sides that reach up to around waist-height is fine.
You can add more elements, such as a cooling rack, or a smoker.

Throw it in the trash or another container (to throw away later). Grease shouldn't go down the drain because it can cause clogs., Use warm water with dishwashing soap to clean your grill pan. Make sure to only use plastic or nylon brushes and scrubbers. You can also use a dishrag. Scrub it down, and then rinse it clean. Because the surface is nonstick, you should be able to clean it fairly easily this way most of the time.Some people suggest letting it cool first before using water, as the heat difference may damage the surface.

, If you're having a hard time getting your grill pan clean, try submerging the cooking surface in warm water with dishwashing soap. Leave it to sit for at least 30 minutes, though overnight may be more effective. Use a nylon scrubber to clean the grill pan once it's been soaked., If your nonstick pan has a residue on it, vinegar may be able to help. Pour boiling water with a 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of vinegar on top of the grill pan. If possible, let it sit with the vinegar on it. The oil should slide off the pan, and then you can clean it normally."

Finished.

",How to Clean a Grill Pan3," Both cast iron and nonstick skillets are not dishwasher friendly. A cast iron pan may rust in the dishwasher, as it can be stripped of its protective seasoning. While some nonstick skillets can go in the dishwasher, it will wear down the nonstick coating more quickly., Metal utensils can scratch the surface of a nonstick pan. Instead of metal, use plastic, wood, or silicone with your grill pans to help the coating last longer.However, metal is fine to use on cast iron., When washing your grill pan, you may be tempted to reach for steel wool to clean the pan more thoroughly. However, like metal utensils, steel wool can damage the coating on your grill pan, both cast iron and nonstick varieties. Stick to nylon scrubbers., It takes a little time to build up a true seasoning on your cast iron skillets. While you're still building it, don't cook acidic foods like tomatoes or beans in your cast iron skillet. Once you have a good, non-stick surface on your surface, acidic foods are fine., While cast iron grill pans can take high heat, most nonstick grill pans aren't meant to go to high temperatures. If you want to cook something on a high temperature, stick to an outside grill or a cast iron grill pan.,"

If you intend to grill for many people at once, 550 to 650 inches is a good size., Don’t forget to measure the area that you intend to grill in before selecting one. Grills come in all shapes and sizes, and some even have mobile capabilities. Whether you have a huge backyard or an apartment patio, you should be able to find something that suits your space., Smaller cuts of steak, chicken, and vegetables can be grilled with a smaller grill without a problem.

Stay away from unnecessary and complicated features if you’re a novice.",How to Choose a Grill3," Grilling utensils, plates of uncooked food, marinades, seasonings, and more all need a place to go while you’re grilling, and not having a place to put them can be frustrating. Get a grill with sturdy shelves on the sides to satisfy this storage necessity., Being able to tell the temperature of the inside of the grill at all times is a big benefit. Meat is especially sensitive to temperature, so the more aware you are of it, the better the meat will turn out., A grill’s power is measured by how many British Thermal Units, or BTUs, of heat it produces. Frequently, BTUs increase along with grill size. If you’re only grilling for a few, you don’t need to worry as much about this, but it’s an important feature for large quantity grillers.A grill with 12,000 BTUs per burner has the capability of cooking a lot and cooking quickly., A grill cover is a worthy investment because it will lengthen the lifespan of your grill by protecting it from the elements.Go for an unlined vinyl, polyester, oil cloth, or weather-proof nylon cover.


Stay away from felt-lined and flannel-lined grill covers; mice and squirrels like to use the fabric as nesting material.
It is especially necessary to get a cover if your grill is made of stainless steel, because it will protect your grill from tarnishing., Having at least two burners allows you to have one off and one on. It’s better if you can get a grill with even more burners because this will allow you to have different heat zones, which may be useful when grilling several types of food at a time. Stay away from aluminum and cast iron burners because they rust and corrode easily., It can be very challenging to grill vegetables and certain types of seafood, such as shrimp, without having a few fall into the flames or onto the ashes. Getting this accessory along with the grill itself will keep that from happening., Especially if you’re a little new to grilling, think twice before splurging on smoke boxes, electric charcoal starters, and rotisseries. More often than not, these features cause more frustration than they’re worth."

Get your tools.,
Dig a hole the depth of one brick turned vertically.,
Use bricks or cinderblocks to secure the sides.,
Check it is level.,
Use slabs and gravel for optional extra touches.,
Set up the grill.",How to Build a BBQ Pit2," For this most simple of Barbecue pit options, you need little few tools. But before you start be sure to have gathered up a shovel, some bricks or cinderblocks (optional mortar), a grill, a spirit level, and something that you can use to cover the pit when you are not using it. You can also use some gravel, sand, paving slabs or excess bricks.








, The first step to making a basic Barbecue pit is digging a hole (not larger than you can cover with your grill) at an appropriate and safe place in your backyard. A basic pit could be the depth of one brick or cinderblock (whichever you are using) turned vertically. You can make it bigger or smaller depending on you requirements, and you can use it as a smoker too.








A rectangle or square is the easiest shape to use.

, Once you have the hole, knock in the bricks around the edges to give it a solid structure. It’s best to use some mortar to fix it in place and be sure that the bricks will not become dislodged and fall into the hole. You can look at some pictures online to see how it ought to look.









You could even make a pit without putting bricks along the sides, but this is good idea to make it more secure and lasting.

, Lay a spirit level over the top of the pit to check that it is level. If it is too large for your spirit level, you can place a longer plank of wood over it the hole and put the spirit level on top of that. Try laying your grill over the top of the pit to check that it sits on it nicely and does not slide off to one side.








, You can place some slabs around the edges of the pit on the grass to give you an area to place your grill and clearly demarcate the area where the Barbecue is. This is an excellent way to make it more of a feature, and you can be creative with how you lay out it. The fire shouldn’t come in contact with any grass (a wildfire is the last thing you want when having a barbecue).









If you don’t do this you should clear away the grass from the edges of the pit for safety reasons.
You can spread some gravel, or masonry sand in base of the pit to so you are not burning wood directly on the soil., The gridiron is now ready to be added to your project. Now that you have your formation set up, you can lay your grill across the hole. You can add some bricks or cinder blocks around the edges to hold it in place more securely.

Get your tools and equipment.,
Preparing the site.,
Build up your layers.,
Add an optional shelf.,
Add the extra layers of brick and secure the grill.",How to Build a BBQ Pit3," To make an above-ground pit that you can take down again with little fuss, all you really need are some bricks or cinderblocks, and your grill. A steel sheet will be necessary if you are building it up fairly high above ground. This is a job that is very easy to quick to do, but you still need to take care with the construction and follow the safety precautions as you would with a more complex Barbecue pit.









As always, how many cinder blocks or bricks you need will depend on the size of the pit you want to construct.

, Once you have chosen a safe place to put it, you need to do a bit of work preparing the ground. The main job is to clear the space and make sure that the ground is level and flat. If it isn’t level you will end up with a wonky grill, which could end in disaster.







, Now lay out the bricks or cinderblocks according to the size you want and the plan you have drawn up. Be sure to measure everything carefully and check the stability of it all as you go. If it doesn’t seem stable you need to step back and have a rethink. This will most likely be because the ground isn’t sufficiently level for the blocks to sit easily on it.









You can build them up in a simple regular-sided shape, or try a circle. This might require you to cut the blocks, which will require more tools, like a chisel and hammer.

, If you building it up quite high, you don’t want the coals to be too far away from the grill. Think about how low you drop the grill down over the coals when you use a regular stand-alone Barbecue. A good way to take account of this is to add a steel shelf two bricks below where you will be putting the grill.







, Once you have installed the shelf build up two more layers on the same pattern you have been using. You can just lay the grill on top of your top layer, but you could add another layer of bricks around the edges to help keep it in place.

",How to Build a BBQ Pit4," If you decide to build a serious brick Barbecue pit, you will need some good plans and plenty of time and material. You will need to use mortar to fix the bricks or blocks you use, so be sure you are comfortable taking this on. Once you build a fixed aboveground Barbecue pit, it’s not so easy to knock it down again.








, These pits require quite a lot more equipment, expense and technical skills to construct. You will a shovel, mortar mix, cement mix, bricks or cinderblocks, a fire tray (depending on the height of your Barbecue), a grill, as well as a spirit level, water and hand tamps. You will also need metal braces to attach you grill to the bricks.







, A big brick Barbecue is a heavy thing that needs good foundations to support it. It is possible to use a base of stone and sand like the more simple versions, but it is recommended that for a large fixed pit, you prepare you solid foundations. To do this, you will need to dig down around four inches inside the area where you are building the Barbecue, and pour in concrete.








You will need to leave for around 48 hours to set.
It’s also a good idea to have a slight slope so rainwater will run off the concrete rather than collecting on top of it., When the foundations are set, you need to start building up the bricks around the sides using the mortar, trowel, and hand tamper. Take time over this, and keep it nice and neat. Mortar dries relatively quickly, so be sure to have all your bricks or cinderblocks to hand before you start.









Put bricks in the corners first, and work out from there, removing the excess mortar that is squeezed out from between bricks as you go.Fill any gaps with excess mortar.
Each new layer of bricks should begin with a layer of mortar on top of the previous layer on bricks, which the new bricks are placed onto.
Be sure to look at a brick laying tutorial first, if you haven’t done this before., Once you have got your bricks up to the height you want, add one more layer of mortar and affix the metal braces at the appropriate places on the top layer of bricks.This should set fairly quickly, but don’t walk off and leave it. Once it is set attach the grill across the top.

Look at how it is built.,
Consider the burners and heat distribution.,
Consider energy use.,
Should you just want a straightforward gas barbecue that can do a very good job go for a one or two burner design.,
If you want a mid range barbecue go for three burners.,
When you move into the luxury barbecue market things start getting incredibly serious, and far more expensive.",How to Buy a Gas Barbecue," Stainless steel or metal with a “porcelain enamel” finish are the very best constructions, giving a combination of toughness, rust-protection and straightforward cleaning. Contemplate the lid – the heavier the greater – as this normally indicates build quality. Also consider your own DIY skills – welded pre built barbecues are likely to be much more sturdy, but it is possible to buy one and assemble your self if you like which may save you cash In terms of dimension, contemplate if you would like different height grills or additional touches like plate warming areas, utensil storage, table places etc. As expected, extra unique touches equals a lot more cash;
, Gas barbecues rely on a process of gas burners that are covered by warmth distributing materials which also act to burn off drippings to smoke the food. Cheaper designs use lava rocks or ceramic coals for this purpose, and do an ok job, although grease can accumulate and cause flash fires which we all know and hate from charcoal. When you really want the most effective look out for long bars or “flavourisers” that are designed to vaporize drippings quite rapidly to keep away from flares and create a smoky flavour (although you still won’t match charcoal in many an opinion)!


As for the number of gas burners, you get what you fork out for. Less costly one burner versions only enable the flame to be controlled over the entire cooking surface, and can have “cold spots” which may perhaps lead to uneven temperatures. Two/three burner types are genuinely worth it, offering you differing regions of temperature to cook different foods. Even so, if you're seriously feeling flush you may go for even much more burners (£££!), infrared heat sources (a bit over the top) and rotisserie back burners for that Michelin-starred experience. Try to keep away from side burners as these are high priced added touches and you’ll most likely find you don’t use them. You have variable warmth control on the primary grill anyway, and the side space is much better off reserved for your raw meat or a huge glass of beer!

, As burner numbers and size increases, you may expect the quantity of gas you need to power the barbecue to increase. That being said, efficiency is also a consideration, so if you are in doubt search for the BTU (British Thermal Unit) score of the barbecue to see how much gas you will will need. Really don't get too worried about it though the only real time to worry is if a big design has a strangely low BTU rating when compared to comparable sized versions. Far from becoming extra efficient, a substantially lower rating can indicate poor energy output and you’ll have a colder barbecue - this is rare though. The gas applied in most designs, called Propane, is really much less costly than charcoal, and a single canister can last for a number of cookouts.

, Costs and features will vary, but search for a medium size with lava rocks or ceramic coals, and try your best to get a model with as even cooking as feasible. Side burners or storage parts will only push up the price so a quality primary burner is much much more crucial in this range. Also, really do not expect swanky looks, concentrate instead on durability.

, You’ll need to look for stainless steel construction and a large grilling area, but still not be tempted by too many additional touches. In addition, at this selling price go for flavouriser bars instead or lava rocks or ceramic coals – you’ll end up with a significantly better flavour.

, Having said that, have a look around at the 4 burner types from Landmann, Electrolux and Beefeater when you really want some impressive kit. At this size anticipate sleek and solid metal with warranty, infrared rotisseries, enough space to cook for a mob and plenty of envy from your friends.

Leaving the grill burning for 15 minutes allows for any remaining grease or food particles left over from your last use to be burned into ash, and easily removed.;
, When the grilling grates are no longer hot to the touch, (but still warm), turn off the gas supply, and disconnect the gas.Then brush off any loose and ashed particles of food or grease with a steel grill brush. You could also crumple up piece of aluminum foil, and use that to brush off the grates as well.








For a more thorough cleaning, you can remove the grates from the grill, use a sponge dipped in soapy water to wipe them down, and then replace them in the grill once the are rinsed and dried thoroughly, but this is not required after every use.

, Soapy water is the safest cleaning solution for most gas grills.Just make a cleaning solution with water and a squirt or two of mild dishwashing soap. Wipe the exterior of the grill with the soapy water, use a rag dipped in clean water to remove the soap residue, and then dry the exterior of the grill thoroughly.


If you have a stainless steel grill, you can use stainless steel cleaner to clean the exterior. If you have a porcelain grill, you can also use specific porcelain cleaner to clean the outside of the grill., When you’re not using your grill, keep it covered to protect it from outside elements, and prevent it from getting dirtier than it needs to be.

You will need to pour a 4-inch-thick concrete foundation if you don’t have a patio that will work.
Arrange a row of bricks on the concrete base to determine the correct positioning. The barbecue should resemble a capital “E” with the legs of the “E” facing the side you will stand to cook.
Use a carpenter’s square to square all the corners.
Snap chalk lines on either side of the bricks to mark their positions.;
,









Add enough water to give the mix the consistency of mud.

,









Spray the bricks with a garden hose to make the mortar more effective.
Use a trowel to spread a layer of mortar inside the chalk lines on the concrete base, then lay the first course of bricks on it.
Space the bricks ½ inch apart. Add mortar to the ends of each brick before setting it in place.
Check the bricks with a level and tap the bricks with the trowel’s handle to set them deeper in the mortar if they are not.
Remove any excess mortar with the side of the trowel blade.
Build up to 4 courses at the back 2 corners in the same manner as the first course.
Check to make sure the walls remain plumb.
Make sure the vertical mortar lines of the courses are staggered.

Check the fuel lines for visible defects.,
Check the fuel lines for invisible openings.,
Check the ignition system.,
Disconnect the gas.,
Check your fuel level.,
Clean the cooking grates.,
Clean the burner protectors.,
Clean out the burners and venturi tubes.,
Clean the cook box.,
Clean the exterior of your grill.",How to Clean an Outdoor Gas Grill2," If any fuel lines have unmistakable damage (like rips, holes, cracks), replace the parts immediately before your next use of the grill. Also be sure that any fuel lines have a smooth trail. You don’t want any of your fuel lines to be bent, because that will prevent the gas from flowing correctly. Check the exterior of the gas tank for any damage as well; things like dents, erosion, punctures, or any evident signs of damage. If you find areas that have obvious damage, you could potentially have a gas leak.If you are unsure or suspicious about the condition of your gas tank, have it inspected by a professional gas supplier. A professional gas supplier would have the authoritative knowledge to assess and address a possible gas leak.

, Create a mixture of soap and water. Make sure you stir the mixture around so it gets really sudsy. Then, use a paintbrush to brush the soapy mixture onto the fuel lines.Turn on the gas, and brush some more soapy water onto the gas lines. If any bubbles form on the gas lines, that indicates a gas leak. Immediately replace any fuel lines that exhibit signs of a gas leak.


This soapy water test should be done on a monthly basis, but also depending on how often you grill. The more you use your grill, the more frequently you should perform this test.

, Turn the gas off, and test your ignition button to see if it creates a spark. If both the pressure regulator on the gas tank and the ignition system are running normally (meaning the pressure regulator is tracking and maintaining correct gas tank pressure, and the ignition system is sparking and lighting correctly), you can finish testing the grill by turning the gas back on and lighting the grill up as you normally would.








If there is no spark, check the pressure regulator, and be sure it is secured tightly on the tank. Just like your stove at home, you can try to manually light the grill using a grill lighter. Just be sure to keep your arms and face away from the grilling area so you don’t burn yourself when the burners ignite.
If your grill is able to light in that manner, check the batteries in the ignition switch and wipe off the electrodes so there is no battery acid build up. The manual that came with your grill can show you how to properly deal with the batteries and electrodes., As a safety precaution, any time you clean your grill, disconnect the propane tank. That way, you will know for sure that any possibility of a gas related injury or fire is cut out of the equation.


Double check to make sure the gas is turned off at the tank before disconnecting it from the grill. You don’t want gas leaking out from the tank.

, If your fuel tank doesn’t have a gauge, you can check the fuel level by pouring some warm water onto the side of the tank. Slide your hand down the wet area of the tank (starting from the top), and note the temperature difference. The tank will feel cooler where the fuel level begins., Brush the cooking grates with a dry wire brush or a grill stone to keep food, grease, and bacteria from accumulating on the grates.After you have brush the top of the grilling grates, remove them from the grill and scrub the bottom of the grates as well.









Consider spraying a barbecue grill cleaner on the grates before you scrub them with the wire brush. After you scrub them clean, consider spraying vegetable oil on the grates to prevent rust.
If you’re using a grill stone to clean the grates, you don’t need to add any water before scrubbing the stone on the grates.

, Remove the burner protectors from the grill, and use soapy water and an old sponge to give them a good scrub down.The accumulated grease and grime should wash right off, leaving your burner protectors clean, and looking good as new.









Burner protectors are sometimes called flame tamers, heat tents, or vaporizer bars.
If you see a lot of rust or deep pitting (holes from erosion), it may be time to replace these grill parts. Any grill parts you might need can be found at your local home department store.

, The venturi tubes are the pipes that go out from the burners and connect to the grill control valves. These tubes allow the air and gas to mix together, altering the intensity of the flame.Remove the burners and venturi tubes, and place a hose head at one end of the tube.Turn the water on to clear out any debris or insects that could have gotten inside.









Insects often accumulate and nest in the venturi tubes during the grilling off season, usually around late summer and fall.
If your burners are not easily removable (or you’re not confident that you could properly replace your grill burners), use a sponge lightly moistened with water to wipe down the burners.
Failure to re-assemble your grill burners correctly could result in a fire hazard.
If the small holes in the burners are blocked and obstructed, use a small paperclip or pin to poke through the debris and clear the holes. However, if the holes are deteriorated and cracked, replace them with new burners., Remove the cooking grates and use a stainless steel cook brush to brush all the excess grease and debris from inside of the grill into the collecting bottom tray. Then, remove the bottom tray and throw out the collected grease and debris.Some of the debris will be loose and easily disposable, whereas other debris will be caked on. You might need to use a scouring pad or a sharp putty knife to remove the stuck on debris.









Consider washing out the bottom tray to keep things clean and keep grease buildup from accumulating. If you do decide to clean the bottom tray, just wash it out with soapy water, rinse and dry it, and then put it back into position under the burners.

, If you have a stainless steel grill, you can use a stainless steel cleaner to wipe down the outside surface with a paper towel, and keep your grill looking like new.If you have a porcelain grill, you can use a specialized porcelain grill cleaner.

Prepare the wood chips.,
Make a foil smoke pouch.,
Prepare the grill for cooking with the smoke pouch.",How to Add Smoke to a Gas Grill,"

Any variety of hardwood chips can be used for adding smoke flavor to food cooked on a gas grill. Some of the most popular are hickory, oak, cherry and mesquite. Other items like olive pita and pecan shells can also be used. Wood chips can usually be bought wherever grills are sold.



 


Soak about a cup of chips in water for an hour. Although soaking isn't required to make the smoke, the chips will last much longer once they are smoking.





;
,

Drain the chips and place them in a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, about 18 inches (45.7 cm) square. Wrap the chips in the foil, sealing it tightly. Poke some holes in the top of the pouch using a knife or fork to allow the smoke to escape.







,

Place the pouch in the cold grill on top of the flavor bars or lava rocks under the grill grate. The pouch should be placed in the back corner of the grill so it is not directly underneath where food would be placed.






Preheat the grill to high, as you would any time you are preparing to grill.






Once you can see significant smoke coming from the pouch, add the food to the grill and cook according to your recipe.

, Make sure you use actual grill equipment as you will need some length and strength behind you.

, This part is important as cleaning it won’t work if the grill is cold. The hot grill combined with the onion juices will loosen and lift any baked on grime.


Rub onion over the grates several times until you see residual food/grime lift from the grates.
Push food/residue off to one side of the grill or, if possible, off the entire grill and onto the floor.

, Take extra care to protect your hands while doing so, so be sure you don’t make direct contact with the grill.

Measure the handle on your knife.,
Measure a length of cord.,
Cut your cord or leather stripping.,
Soak the cord or strip in warm water.,
Place the cord or leather stripping in the refrigerator overnight.",How to Wrap a Knife Handle1," Before you start covering your handle with a cord or leather, you'll need to determine how much of it need to cover the entire handle. Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the length of your knife handle., If you're using a simple wrap, you'll want the cord to be five times larger than the length of the handle. If you're using a more advanced wrap, you'll want a foot of cord for every inch of the knife handle.For example, if your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long, you'll need at least 50 inches (127 cm) of leather stripping for a simple wrap.
If your knife handle is 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and you want to use a more advanced wrap, have at least 10 foot (3 m) of cord or leather stripping.

, Use a razor blade or scissors to cut out a strip of leather to the length that you need. If you're using leather, the strip should be around 3/8 inches (9.52 mm) wide, so you'll have to cut the strip vertically if it's too wide.Having more cord is better than not having enough because you can always cut away the excess cord.
If you are cutting a strip of leather from rawhide, you'll have to tan the hide first.

, Soak the leather stripping in warm water for 30 minutes. Soaking leather makes it more pliable and makes wrapping it around your knife handle easier. If you're using paracord, the moisture will tighten it as it dries on your knife handle, which makes the wrap tighter. Once your ready to wrap the cord, remove it from your refrigerator and choose a wrap for your knife handle., If you're wrapping your knife handle immediately, you can just start to wrap the knife handle with the wet cord or leather stripping. If you are wrapping your knife handle later, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to keep it moist."
"
Visit a kitchen store or department to purchase kitchen scissors or shears.",How to Use Kitchen Scissors1," When choosing scissors, bear in mind the following requirements:


Look for thick, sturdy blades.
Feel the weight––prefer those that feel heavy and solid.
Serrated edges and finger grips can be a useful feature.
Check that they're washable in the dishwasher for best hygiene.
Go for quality––just as with good kitchen knives, you'll want these to last you for years to come.;

Wrap the cord around the knife handle.,
Tie a knot at the bottom of the knife handle.,
Cut off the remaining cord and use a lighter to seal the ends.",How to Wrap a Knife Handle2," Holding the cord taut, carefully wrap it around the handle near the blade. Place your thumb on the side of the cord to keep it in place as you wrap. Make another loop under your first loop, making sure that the cord is tight as you work., Take some electrical or grip tape and wrap it around the loops that you created. Wrap the tape tightly so that the cord doesn't move around., Start making tight loops around the tape that you laid down. Continue to make tight loops all the way down the handle until you reach the bottom of the handle. As you wrap, make sure that the loops are touching one another., Once you've wrapped your handle, tie a knot at the bottom of your cord to keep the wrapping in place., Finish your wrap by cutting away the excess cord with a knife or scissors. Hold a lighter up to the tips of the cord until they start to melt. This will seal off your knife handle wrapping.This method also works as a ""pre-wrap"" that you can do before wrapping your knife handle with a more complex method. Doing a simple preliminary wrap will make more advanced wraps adhere to the handle better.

Make a knot at the end of the cord.",How to Wrap a Knife Handle3," Find the center of the cord by folding it over on itself. The middle point is where you'll want to start wrapping the handle. Place your knife on top of the cord so that the cord is close to the blade., Wrap the loose ends of the cord around your index finger and thumb. This will make twisting the cord easier. While still holding the cord in one hand, rotate your wrist so that the cord also wraps over itself. The cord should overlap itself to make an X., Continue to twist in the same direction so that your cord gets twisted again. It should look like a knot near the top of your knife handle at this point., Use your finger to keep the fake knot that you created in place while you turn the knife over. You'll have to repeat the process on the other side of the knife., Repeat the twisting steps so that there is an identical makeshift knot on the opposite side of the one that you just created. This is what your wrap will look like all the way down the handle., Continue down the length of the knife handle, twisting the cord over itself so that there are small makeshift knots running down both sides of the knife handle. Make sure that as you do this the rope or cord is as tight as possible. Continue to do this so that the cord is wrapped closely to itself as you make your way down the handle., Once you're done wrapping the cord all the way down the handle, you can feed the cord through any pre-drilled holes at the bottom of the knife before tying your knot. If there are no holes, simply tie a knot at the end of your excess cord. This will keep your handle wrap in place."

Pull the cord out of the loop at the top to remove the paracord wrapping.",How to Wrap a Knife Handle4," Make a loop at the end of your cord or leather strip and place it on the thin edge of the knife handle. The top of the loop should stop right at the bottom of the blade, and the bottom ends of the loop should run the entire length of the handle. Use your fingers to hold the loop in place., Use the piece of rope with excess and wrap it around the handle first, then as you come up, wrap it around the loop you just created. The rope will then go back around the handle in the opposite direction that you were wrapping it before., Continue to wrap the cord around the front side of the handle and then around the loop on the backside of the knife. This will create a wrapped braid down the side of your knife., When you finally reach the blade of the knife, you'll want to feed the remaining excess rope through, not around, the original loop, that you held in place with your fingers., Pulling the excess of rope at the bottom of your handle will tighten the wrap. Do this before you seal the excess at the top to make sure that the wrap is tight. Cut off the excess rope or leather strip at the top of your handle and use a lighter to burn the end of the rope., To quick release the cord from your knife, all you need to do is pull the cord out of the top loop and pull on the excess rope at the bottom of your knife handle. This will quickly undo the cord if you need to use it for something."

Remember that a honing steel will not sharpen a dull knife.,
Hold your steel firmly in your hand, or hold it against a counter top.,
Place the bottom (heel) of the knife edge against the steel as if you were going to cut into it.,
Run the knife down the steel smoothly, as if you were whittling a stick.,
Flip the knife and repeat the process, honing the other side.

,
Repeat 3–6 times per side.,
Wipe the blade clean with a towel or paper towel.",How to Use a Sharpening Steel," Steels are maintenance tools used to help keep an already sharp blade from degrading. If your knives are dull, pitted, or you see visible nicks on the cutting edge, bring your blade to a professional for resharpening.;
, For safety reasons, the preferred method is to place the tip of the steel on a cutting board while you hold the steel vertically.

,


Position the knife (ideally), at a 22 degree angle. This angle is considered standard, although you can adjust this slightly to a lower angle for a sharper edge, or a higher angle for a more durable one.

, Pull the knife down and towards yourself, ending with the tip of the knife at the bottom of the steel. Maintain the same angle as you go, and pull your hand away from the steel gradually, so as to evenly hone from the blade base to tip.

,, Check for sharpness and repeat if necessary. The quality, hardness and pre-existing condition of the blade will determine the ultimate number of strokes required.

, This is important to avoid adding any metal filings that may have been generated from honing into your recipe.

Examine the knife sharpener.,
Insert the blade into the coarsest slot.,
Pull the blade through the slot.,
Pass through the same slot again.,
Repeat the process with the remaining slots.,
Rinse and dry the knife.",How to Use a Knife Sharpener1," There are multiple types of manual knife sharpeners. Some only have one slot, while others may have two or three.


Each slot should have two steel, ceramic, or diamond-coated disks on either side, and these disks are what sharpen the blade of the knife.
Simple knife sharpeners only have on sharpening slot, but others have two or three. If the knife sharpener has multiple slots, the slots should be labeled according to coarseness. The coarsest slot will usually be labeled as ""coarse"" or ""1,"" and the finest slot will usually be labeled with the final number in the sequence or the word ""fine."";
, Position the blade in a straight cutting position in between the two sharpening disks. Keep the base of the blade as close to the disks as possible, and make sure that the blade remains perpendicular to the body of the device.Note that if you only need to touch up the blade of a knife, you may wish to skip the coarsest slot and move onto a finer level. Coarse slots on multilevel sharpeners are usually meant for sharpening blunt knives.

, Using light pressure, pull the blade back in a horizontal motion, drawing the blade through the disks from base to tip.


Some knife sharpeners can be held by hand as you work with them, but it's usually easiest to use your non-dominant hand to hold the knife sharpener down on a table or similar work surface. You can manipulate the knife with your dominant hand.

, Return the blade to its starting position, then lightly draw it through the disks again, working from base to tip.


Note that you'll likely need to repeat this motion several times on this slot. If the sharpener only has one slot level, pull it through four to six times. If it has multiple slot levels, only pull it through this first slot two or three times.
For each pass, start at the base and end at the tip. Do not pull the knife back and forth through the slot since doing so could damage the blade.

, Work through the remaining slots, moving from coarsest to lightest. Draw the knife through each slot using the same technique as the first slot.


Don't skip over any of the slot levels unless the instruction manual tells you to do so. Usually, these levels are designed to sharpen dull blades in intervals, and skipping levels could minimize the product's effectiveness.

, When you're satisfied with the sharpness of the knife, rinse away any shavings under cool, running water. Carefully dry the blade with a clean towel.Once the knife is clean and dry, it should be ready to use again.

Purchase a serrated knife sharpening tool.,
Locate the side of your knife with a beveled edge.,
Place the sharpening rod in one of the serrated scallops (""gullets"").,
Move the rod to match the gullet's diameter.,
Sharpen the first gullet.,
Check for a burr.,
Continue sharpening each groove on the blade.,
File away all the burrs.,
Sharpen any straight-edged portion of the blade.",How to Sharpen Serrated Knives1," Serrated knives need different sharpeners than straight-edged blades. Most serrated knife sharpeners are rod-shaped, usually with a taper to accommodate different sized serrations.;
, Serrated knives generally do not look the same from both sides. On one side, the face of the blade will continue at the same angle until the blade's edge. On the other, the face of the blade will angle down slightly just before the serrated edge; this is called the bevel. Only apply a sharpening tool to the beveled edge.

, Choosing an angle is easier for serrated blades, because you can use the angle of the bevel as a guide. This is typically between 13 and 17 degrees compared to the edge of the blade, which is shallower than you may be used to sharpening knives.If the knife also has a straight edge portion, the bevels are usually ground to the same angle — about 20 to 25 degrees.If you want a better guide, draw on the gullets with permanent marker. You'll know you're hitting them at the right angle if the marker is removed., If your sharpening rod is tapered, locate the rod in the gullet at the point where the rod's diameter is the same size as the gullet's, or slightly smaller.

, Run the sharpening rod along the first groove in several short strokes. Push in one direction away from the edge of the blade, toward the spine. Rotate the rod as you push it for a more even grind.Push only to the point of the rod with the same diameter as the gullet, to avoid enlarging the gullet.

, Run your fingers along the backside of the groove to check for a ""burr,"" or metal shavings. As soon as you can feel a burr, you have sharpened the groove sufficiently. This often only takes a few strokes.


Try running your fingernail along the back edge. If you feel it catch, there's a burr., If the knife's serrations are different sizes, adjust the position of the tapered sharpening rod so that the rod just fills the groove.

, The burrs are the metal shavings that you filed off when sharpening the blade. To remove them, rub the back of the knife against a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper. As an alternative, you could lightly run the sharpening rod against the backside of each groove, being careful not to apply more pressure than necessary to remove the shavings.

, If your knife is only serrated along a part of the blade's length, sharpen the remaining length with a whetstone or other sharpening tool. Don't attempt to use the serrated knife sharpener on the straight portion of the blade.

If you started with a fine or medium grit stone, you may not feel a noticeable burr.,
Test the knife by cutting a piece of paper.,
Clean your sharpening stone according to product instructions.",How to Sharpen a Knife With a Stone,"


Choose a diamond abrasive stone first. This is the hardest material and will take the least amount of work to sharpen a stone.
Next, choose ceramic. This material will take more effort than a diamond abrasive but less effort than other materials.
Lastly, choose hard stone. This is a popular idea, but takes far longer, because it is only slightly tougher than steel.;
, You can choose fine, medium and rough coarse stones.


If you do not let your knives get too dull before you sharpen them, you can make do with a medium or fine grit sharpening stone. If you barely let them lose the edge, a fine grit stone will work best.
If your knives are dull, you must use a rough stone and follow it up with a fine stone. You cannot do it with 1 or the other and achieve a sharp edge.

,


Most manufacturers suggest a 20 degree angle to your sharpening stone.
Use a shallower angle on a coarse stone than you would on a fine or medium grit stone. The coarse stone will shave more off, so you do not want it to reduce the knife width by very far. Fine and medium grit stones will shave less so you can use a 20 degree angle.
Take the size and durability of the knife into account. Thick knives, such as those used for wilderness survival or butchering will need a larger sharpening angle than a small paring knife.

, Keep in mind that the consistency of the stroke is what makes the best knife edge.


If you are having trouble visualizing the angle at which you should hold the knife when sharpening, place the knife at a 45 degree angle, or half of 90 degrees. Then, lower it 1 half of the way to the stone, this is just about 20 degrees. Adjust as needed.

, They will indicate whether oil or water must be placed on the stone before starting.


Sharpening stones use oil to remove the swarf from the stone. These are the small metal filings that are produced during the process. Do not assume that your stone requires oil or water, since many modern stones do not.
Diamond stones and water stones often use water for lubrication. Spray a light coat of water on the stone with a spray bottle.
India and Arkansas stones usually use oil for lubrication. Spray a light coat of oil on the stone.

, It should be a higher counter, so that you can easily move your arm against the stone.

, Adjust the angle at which it touches the stone according to the description above.


Make sure the stone is set up parallel to your body. Your stroke should be parallel rather than towards your body.

, Make sure the entire knife edge will hit the stone.

, This should allow you to grind every part of the blade against the stone.

, You may need 6 to 12 strokes before it starts to develop.


You can notice the burr by carefully feeling for it along the opposite side of your knife's edge. Be very cautious when touching any knife edge against your skin.

,, Use a slightly bigger angle. This will remove the burr and sharpen the stone.

, They are more prominent with a rough grit stone. Do the same number of strokes on each side.

, Repeat the process if it is not sharp enough.

, This will remove the swarf before the next use.

Turn on the machine.,
Pull the blade through the coarsest slot.,
Repeat.,
Work through the remaining slots.,
Rinse and dry the blade.",How to Use a Knife Sharpener2," Plug in the machine and switch the power button to the ""on"" position.


The vast majority of electric knife sharpeners have two or more grinding slots, each representing a different degree of coarseness. The coarsest slot should be labeled as ""1"" or ""coarse,"" and the finest will be labeled with the final number in the sequence or ""fine.""
Each slot contains a grinding wheel or stone, and these wheels actively turn against the blade as you draw it through. Since this method is more intense than that used with manual sharpeners, electric sharpeners may have more success refining severely dull blades.

, Wedge the heel of the blade into the coarsest slot, then lightly pull the blade back through the slot until you skim past the tip of the knife.When inserting the knife, position the base of the blade as close to the slot as possible. Always work from the base through the tip.
You should also push the blade as deep into the slot as possible so that it comes into full contact with the grinding stone.
As you pull the knife through the slot, the machine should automatically guide it through at a 15 to 20 degree angle. The handle will gradually angle up throughout the process.

, Generally, you should make a total of two passes through the first slot and through each of the remaining slot levels.


Pull the knife through the slot following the same procedure as before. Only pass through from base to tip; never push the blade through the machine in a back and forth motion.

, Draw the blade of the knife through each of the remaining slots, working from coarsest to finest.


Follow the same procedure for each slot, and repeat the process twice for each one.
Unless otherwise instructed by the machine's manual, do not skip over any of the slots. Skipping slots may reduce the effectiveness of the machine.

, Even though many electric knife sharpeners collect the shavings using inner magnets, you should still rinse the blade under cool, running water. Carefully dry it with a towel when finished.


If the machine does collect shavings, you may need to periodically empty the collection bin to keep the knife sharpener in working order. Consult the instruction manual for details on how to do this.
Once the knife is clean, it should be sharp and ready to use.

Use a triangle-shaped sharpener.,
Make your own tool from emery cloth and dowels.,
Sharpen with a square stone.",How to Sharpen Serrated Knives2," Like the rods, these tapered triangles are designed specifically for serrated knives. Due to the shape, they tend to work best on knives with V-shaped gullets. The process is almost identical to the rod-shaped method described above, except that you rock the edge of the tool back and forth along the bevel instead of rotating it., If you would rather not buy a single-purpose tool, you can buy a few cheap dowels from a hardware store instead. Find a dowel that sits in the knife's first scallop without wobbling, then wrap a piece of emery cloth most of the way around the dowel. Hold the cloth in place with your finger, and sharpen carefully and slowly. Switch dowels to match the size of the scallops as you move along the knife.Use a round dowel for a knife with round scallops, or a square dowel for V-shaped scallops.

, This is a difficult and unreliable last resort, but it is possible. Hold the knife spine securely against a hard surface and tilt the blade so the beveled edge is on top. Bring the corner of the sharpening stone to the scalloped edge and use it to sharpen the edge, rocking it back and forth to cover the full area of each scallop."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Soak your whetstones in water until no air bubbles pop up anymore.,
Place the stone on a non-slip service to prevent any dangerous issues.,
Begin with the course grit side of the stone, the one with the lower number.,
Tilt the knife so that the blade makes a roughly 22-degree angle with the stone.,
Hold the knife with the handle in your dominant hand so that your index finger is on the edge of the blade, almost where it meets the stone.,
Spread your non-dominant hand fingers on the back of the blade itself, applying even pressure across the whole blade down into the stone.,
Keeping the angle of the knife consistent throughout, push the blade evenly across the whetstone.,
Splash the whetstone with water every few minutes to keep it wet.,
Repeat as many times as necessary, moving your fingers across the blade to sharpen the whole thing.,
Flip the blade over and repeat with the other side, making the same number of passes.,
Switch to the finer grit stone and alternate sharpening each side.,
""Cut"" a wooden cutting board with the knife to even out the cutting surface.,
Hone the blade.",How to Sharpen a Kitchen Knife1," You will need a double-sided (coarse and fine grit) synthetic sharpening stone. You will also need a honing steel, which is typically sold in the form of a lightly-grooved, magnetized iron rod. Both of these materials can be found at your local hardware store.


Sharpening stones have two sides with different grits. The grit measures how rough the stone is, and thus how severely it sharpens. Higher numbers stand for finer grits meaning the lowest number is the roughest surface.;
, The stone is porous, and it needs to fill with water so that the blade doesn't catch. This decreased friction and helps prevent scratches and nicks.You'll want to keep getting the stone wet as you work, so keep some water nearby.

, You can use a damp towel or a silicon baking sheet or hot pad. You do not want the stone moving as you sharpen, as this is the number one way to accidentally end up in the ER.

, Splash some water on top before beginning. You always start with the rougher side of the stone, with the lower grit rating. Many stones start at F 400 (European measurement) or J 1000 (Japanese measurement).








Professional chefs may have multiple stones with many different grits to smoothly craft a point. More variety means you can get a better edge by slowly increasing the resistance.
If you have a broken tip on the knife, fix this before sharpening.


, This can be hard to find, but just do it in pieces. Perpendicular to the stone (blade touching the stone, as if you were cutting), is 90-degrees. Now, angle the blade so that it is halfway between perpendicular and laying on the stone. This is 45-degrees. Now angle the stone to be roughly halfway between this angle and the stone -- you've got it!


A steeper angle always leads to a more durable knife, but too steep and you will risk cracking the edge., This hand provides the control and keeps the edge down on the stone as you work., These fingers are your guides, keeping the knife down and moving it smoothly as you work.


These fingers will naturally slide to help the area you're working on since most stones are not big enough to fit the whole knife.

, This motion should be smooth and fluid, almost like you were lightly slicing off an impossibly thin piece of the stone.








, Friction, when not controlled, is not your friend. Keep the stone wet to prevent accidental damage.









It is often a good idea to wipe any grit off the blade each time your wet the stone again

, With your non-dominant hand, move up to the tip of the blade and focus on that. Then slide down and sharpen the meet of the blade before moving down to the hilt. Try to use the same number of movements for each section.









Don't try and push the blade down into the stone. You want it to stay flush to the stone with every pass, but you don't want to be digging it in., You want both sides to be evenly sharpened, otherwise, the knife will be misaligned. The exact same strategy should be used as the first side.









Feel the opposite side of the knife from the one you've been sharpening. If you feel a little burr or catch on the unsharpened side, it means it's time to flip., Make one pass on the right side, flip the knife, and make another on the left. Both the angle and motion are still consistent, as is the need to keep the stone wet. However, since the finer grit is making smaller, finer changes, you want to ensure that you evenly balance them by alternating sides.








You only need very light pressure down on the knife with the fine grit stone.
Keep the stone extra wet, and wipe the grit from the knife frequently with a damp towel.

, Take your sharpened knife and ""slice"" down the edge of a wooden cutting board, as if you were trying to cut into it. You only need to do it one -- but simply dragging the blade across the cutting board to clean off he cutting edge.







, The next step is to use your steel honing rod (sometimes known as a steeling rod), to make sure the blade is properly aligned. Make sure you use a few passes on each side, and keep honing the blade every time you use it.

"
Pick an angle to sharpen your knife.,
Lubricate your whetstone or diamond stone with a small amount of mineral oil.,
Use an angle guide to control your edge's angle, if available.,
Start off on the rough grit side of the stone.,
For a symmetrical edge, sharpen the knife by dragging it across the stone in the opposite direction you would move it to slice a thin layer off the stone.,
Continue grinding at this angle until your grind goes roughly halfway through the steel.,
Flip the knife over and sharpen the other side of the blade until you create a new edge.,
Flip the stone over and begin sharpening one side the blade, this time using the finer grit.,
Flip the knife and begin sharpening the one side of the knife on the fine grit side of the stone.,
Begin alternating swipes on the fine grit.,
If you wish, further polish or even strop the edge to the desired sharpness.",How to Sharpen a Knife1," If you already know what angle your knife is sharpened at, you'll probably wish to sharpen it at this angle again. Sharpening at a different angle will take significantly more time and may take a few goes before any rough angles are smoothed out.


If you don't know the current angle, ask the manufacturer of your knife or inquire at a knowledgeable knife shop to determine what angle is appropriate for your knife.
If you have to make a gut decision, choose an angle of 10° - 30° per side. Shallower angles make a sharper edge that doesn't last as long; steeper angles are more durable, so 17° - 20° is a good compromise between the two.;
, Look for honing oil, a light kind of mineral oil. Honing oil will both lubricate the whetstone, making it easier for the blade of the knife to pass over the stone, as well as keep the steel shavings (the by-product of sharpening) from clogging the stone's pores.








Check with the manufacturer's guidelines for your stone regarding lubrication. The most common sharpening stones are carborundum stones, and are designed to be used wet or dry, but are destroyed when oiled. However, there are some stones that are specifically designed for oil, and will generally be labeled as ""oil stones"".

, A sharpening guide is a small tool that's placed underneath the knife in order to maintain a constant angle when scraping the knife across the surface of the stone.Otherwise, you will have to control the angle by hand, which is hard and requires a well-formed perception of angles.









One of the most difficult aspects of sharpening a knife is getting the angle right. To make this process a bit easier, try painting the very tip of both sides of your blade with a sharpie pen. Then, throughout the sharpening, inspect whether the marker is being removed during the process., Check the grit on your stone, or the packaging that came with the stone, to identify which is which. In general, whetstones and diamond stones each have different grits on either side. The rough grit side is used to grind the steel down, while the fine grit side is used to sharpen or hone the knife. The grinding process comes first, so you start on the rough grit side.








, This allows a burr to form and prolongs the stone's life.








, This doesn't need to be precise, just well-estimated. For a one-sided edge (""scandi grind"", ""chisel grind"", etc.), do not flip the knife when instructed to do so by this article.








, The easiest way to determine that you have removed enough metal is to sharpen until you have raised a burr, a feature that steel will naturally form when one bevel is ground until it meets another.









Burrs will generally be too small to see, but you can feel it scraping/catching on your thumb if you stroke away (dull side of the knife to the sharp) from the edge. Finer stones produce smaller burrs, but they are still there.

, Your goal here is to smooth over and eliminate the burrs created by sharpening the knife over the coarser grit. This transforms the blade edge from a ground edge into a finer, honed edge.








, Again, make sure you hit both sides of the knife with the fine grit.








, Sharpen one side of the knife with a single stroke, then immediately flip the knife and sharpen the other side. Do this several times for the best result.








, This makes the edge better suited for ""push cutting"" (cutting directly into materials, pushing straight down without sliding the blade across the object) but generally impairs slicing ability: without the ""microscopic serrations"" left by grinding with a stone, the blade tends to not bite into things like tomato skins.

Good for chopping, slicing, and doing any number of other jobs, a good-quality utility kitchen knife is the most versatile tool you can have in the kitchen. Even if the rest of your tools are cheap and dull, a good kitchen knife will keep you cooking.


There's no ""best knife"" or perfect knife for the kitchen. If you're in the market for a good set of knives, consider investing in a single good knife and other cheaper subsidiary knives. You can do most important cutting jobs in the kitchen with a basic kitchen knife, about 5 inches (12.7 cm) long, triangular, and made of stainless steel or other material.;
, Chefs' knives are also sometimes just referred to as ""kitchen knives"" and are heavy-duty blades. For some cooks, a good chefs' knife is the only slicing tool necessary in the kitchen, useful for doing careful small slices into fruit, smashing bulbs of garlic, and chopping onions, not much use for stirring though!Kitchen knives can be made from ceramic, steel or polycarbonate blends in a variety of styles. Western-style kitchen knives tend to be broader and more chopping-oriented, while Japanese-style kitchen knives are sleeker and typically stronger steel.

, Paring knives are another extremely common kitchen implement, usually quite small and used for peeling and slicing, but won't usually be used for chopping or other major knife skills in the kitchen.


Paring knives are good especially for fresh fruits, useful for cutting up an apple, pear, or stone fruits.

, Serrated knives are particularly useful for slicing bread. There's nothing more frustrating than baking a hefty loaf of soft brown bread and smashing it with a kitchen knife, trying to slice it. A serrated knife is also excellent for carving roasted meat joints and other items, making it a helpful addition to the kitchen.

, In a good utility kitchen knife, you want a good balance and weight between the blade and the tang, the steel that extends into the handle of the knife. The best knives should be made from a single piece of steel, and should be well-balanced. Check by trying to balance the knife on your finger, just at the top of the handle. It should feel dense in your hand, so you can let the knife do the work for you.

, Hold a kitchen knife as if you were going to shake hands with the handle. When you pick up a kitchen knife, your index finger should be on the outside of the blade, on the flat side, and your other three fingers should be choked up to the top of the handle, just at the blade. It should be parallel to your body. This is called the pinch grip, and it's the proper way to hold a kitchen knife, offering optimum control and accuracy with your cuts. Because your fingers are closer to the blade, you can control it better and keep it going where you want it to go.








When you're holding the knife, keep the tip and the blade pointed down at all times to be on the safe side. Kitchen knives should be kept extremely sharp, so be careful around them.
Many inexperienced cooks, when picking up a knife, will use a ""hammer grip,"" in which all four fingers are wrapped around the handle, and the blade sticks straight out, perpendicular from the body. You shouldn't look like Jason from Friday the 13th when you're holding a kitchen knife.

, The first step in learning to use a kitchen knife properly is in getting the chop down. While there are a few different styles of chopping food, there are a few basic guidelines that beginners can learn to follow easily. Learning to keep your guiding fingers safely tucked away and make safe cuts is absolutely essentially to kitchen safety.









In the tip-fulcrum method of chopping, the tip of your knife will never really leave the cutting board. You'll use the tip as a fulcrum, to raise the blunt end of the blade up and down, firmly pushing the knife downward into the food you're chopping.
In the wrist-fulcrum method, the black side of the blade, near where you're gripping, will never leave the cutting board, and the point will go up and down from the back pivot point, to cut through the food. This is commonly used when slicing onions or other vegetables.
Never slap your knife onto the cutting board through a vegetable. There's no reason to do this, it's dangerous, and you'll dull the blade.

, Hold the knife in your dominant hand and make your other hand into a claw, fingers curled inward. Practice with a carrot or an onion, and place your claw on top of the food you're chopping. Place the flat side of the blade against the knuckles of your claw, with your knuckles tucked under and out of the way. Guide the food under the knife with your claw hand and pivot the blade with your cutting hand.









Many chefs like to make a show of being able to do this very quickly. It looks dangerous and seems fancy. While it is the ""proper"" method of chopping, having your guide fingers so close to the knife makes many cooks nervous. It is safer than having your fingers out and exposed, but it takes some practice to get used to. Do what feels comfortable and go slow until you get more experienced.

, Trying to cut oblong or rounded produce can be dangerous, which is why it's common practice to create a flat working surface from which to chop, dice, or make whatever cut you need to make on your vegetables and fruits. ""Topping and tailing"" refers to the practice of cutting off the bottom and top ends, which are sometimes somewhat dried out or thin, of produce, to create a flat surface to work from.









Potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and other rounded fruits and vegetables all should be topped and tailed before you get started. Hold the vegetable firmly on its side, and slice the ends off, then discard them. It's usually then common to cut a tomato, say, in half from flat side to flat side, then chop or dice up each half individually.

, Chopped vegetables are cut into bite-sized chunks, while diced vegetables are much smaller, usually a few centimeters square. A good dice is usually fairly uniform, which can be accomplished by scoring vegetables and fruits through before cutting them at a perpendicular angle.









Score vegetables in two directions, at an even interval, then dice by working your knife through the food at a perpendicular angle to your scoring.

, Mincing refers to cutting up tiny vegetables and other produce so small that it should dissolve in the pan when you cook it. Garlic is commonly minced. To mince something, you'll start by dicing it, then run your knife back and forth across the pile several times to get it as small as possible. The end result should be somewhere more coarse than a paste and way smaller than a dice.








, A chiffonade results in small uniform curls of greens and fresh herbs, and it's commonly used to slice up garnishes as a final touch for salads, soups, and roasted meat or pasta dishes. Spinach and basil are probably the most-common vegetables to chiffonade. It's much simpler than the fancy French name suggests.









To chiffonade, you'll roll up each leaf of the vegetable you're cutting into a tight little roll, then chop at an even interval. It should result in pretty, even strips of green that you can use to top your dish.

, The julienne is one of the more advanced cuts you can learn, and it's, to some, a cool way to spice up a dish or make a garnish. Carrots, beets, cucumbers, and other root vegetables are commonly julienned. Vegetables need to be pretty firm to cut up. You probably wouldn't be able to julienne a tomato.









Cut the food into 1/8th inch-thick planks of an even length, then stack the planks on top of one another and slice into thin strips. Each slice should be about the length of the space between the rivets on your knife.

, Wipe down knives immediately after use with a clean towel to remove food bits and other gunk from the blade of the knife. The longer a knife remains wet and dirty the more the blade and the quality of the steel deteriorates. It's good to keep it clean and dry between uses.









Wash knives individually, using hot soapy water and lots of care. Don't toss a big kitchen knife into the bottom of a wash basin so you'll have to fish around for it. Knives shouldn't need to soak for any reason.
Don’t wash kitchen knives in the dishwasher, especially if the handle is made of wood, or some other kind of material that could become water-logged.

, Honing a blade involves removing the nicks, burrs, and dings in the blade to recalibrate the angle of the edge. This needs to be done with a knife steel, at a 20 degree angle, on a regular basis. If you're using your knives in the kitchen regularly, it's a good idea to hone your blades after every use, or every couple of uses.








, A dull knife is a dangerous knife. Kitchen knives need to be sharpened on a whetstone, at an angle of between 20 and 23 degrees. You can have your knives sharpened professionally for as little as a few dollars a knife, which is usually the best way to do it if you’ve got a few high-quality knives. Always sharpen blades in the same direction, using even pressure and long even strokes.


If you're using your knife more often, it may be more appropriate to sharpen your knives regularly. If you're chopping up carrots with your kitchen knife every day, you should be able to keep it usable by honing it regularly, but you might need to have it sharpened every couple of months.
A sharp kitchen knife should be able to cut through a piece of paper easily. If your knives are dull, the risk of glancing off of slipper vegetables and into your hand is much higher, making it important to work only with sharp knives. Dull knives are still sharp enough to cut your finger, which makes them a lot more dangerous.

, Chopping onto a slate or granite counter top is a fast-track to dinged up knives that you'll do a lot of damage to, never mind how you'll dink up your nice surfaces. Chopping on wood or plastic cutting boards is the best way to keep your knives in good working order.

Understand the difference between honing and sharpening your knives.,
Hold the honing rod down, perpendicular to the counter.,
Hold the blade against the rod at a 45-degree angle to the honing rod.,
Rotate the blade halfway towards the rod to create a roughly 20-23-degree angle.,
Pull the knife quickly towards you to hone it.,
Switch to the other side of the blade and repeat.,
Replace your honing rod when it becomes visibly dull.",How to Sharpen a Kitchen Knife2," The long steel rod that most people consider a ""sharpening rod"" is actually used for honing the blade, which centers the edge for even cutting. Because it makes the blade cut more efficiently, it seems sharper. But real sharpening uses specialty stones to actually fix the edge and doesn't need to be done regularly.










Honing needs to be done regularly. Some chefs hone every single time they use their knives. You should hone the blade immediately after any sharpening.

Sharpening can be done at home or professionally, and only needs to be done once or twice a year., Hold the rod from the top of the handle, with the end on the ground. You can put a dish towel underneath it to help keep it in place.

, This is not the angle you want to sharpen at, it is just a step to help you get the right angle. Start with the blade perpendicular to the rod, then pick your hand up to angle the blade down at a 45-degree angle to the rod.


Start near the handle of the blade.

, This doesn't have to be precisely measured, but you should get used to this angle. If you're struggling, just think about being roughly halfway to 45-degrees. Remember that the blade is pointing down to the counter, not up., Keeping the blade at this 20-degree angle, draw the blade back towards you on a straight line. You should only need 4-5 passes if you hone the blade regularly, but 8-10 if you haven't done it in a while.









You want to use gentle, fluid pressure through each draw. Making it a quick, even motion will help.

, In order to center the blade, you need to hone both sides the same number of times.








, You'll notice the grooves on the rod becoming smooth, and it won't actually help you much anymore. Luckily, these things are cheap."

Rock the knife back and forth on the stone, as if cutting with it, to round out the edge.,
Sharpen the entire knife after fixing the tip.",How to Sharpen a Kitchen Knife3," You want to soak the stones, keep them on a damp cloth to prevent slipping, and continually add water to the stone.


This strategy is only for a broken knife tip, not cracks or issues further down the knife.

, Again, put a damp towel on the table to prevent movement. You'll likely need your opposite hand to hold the stone still as you work.

, Hold the knife near the point and grind the flat, broken tip into a diagonal point. Remember to keep the stone wet, moving back and forth to get rid of the knicks and cracks.

, Now, run the knife back and forth vertically, like you would if you are cutting it. Keep the stone wet, and work the knife until you have a decent (but blunt!) curve to the tip of your knife.

, Do not do this in reverse -- you want to fix the tip, then sharpen the knife. This will bring the entire thing back to the right alignment and sharpness.

Use a honing rod in between sharpenings to keep your blade from degrading.,
Hold the honing rod in your non-dominant hand.,
Hold the knife firmly in your dominant hand.,
Hold your knife at approximately 20° in relation to the honing rod.,
Maintaining a 20° angle, move the knife across the top half of the honing rod.,
Maintaining a 20° angle, move the knife across the bottom half of the honing rod.,
Do a total of 6 - 8 revolutions with your honing rod before each use of the knife.








",How to Sharpen a Knife2," The honing rod, or simply ""steel"" as they're often called, aren't normally used to resuscitate a dull blade from the proverbial graveyard. Instead, they're often used to keep knives sharp in between use.


Using a honing rod regularly delays the need to use a whetstone or a diamond. This is a good thing: Using whetstones and diamonds shave metal from the edge of your blade, reducing the knife's lifespan. The less you use your whetstone, the longer your knives will thrive.
What does a honing rod do? A honing rod realigns the metal in a blade, massaging small nicks, indentations, and flat spots away. Compared to a whetstone, it does not remove any significant amount of metal from the blade of the knife.

, The rod should be held at a comfortable angle facing away from your body. The rod tip should be elevated above the rod handle.

, Your four fingers should be holding onto the handle, while your thumb can be placed on the spine of the knife, far away from the blade edge.

, Your angle doesn't need to be exact, just approximate. Whatever angle you decide to choose, or unwittingly end up choosing, make sure to maintain the same angle throughout the honing process. Changing the angle used during the honing process won't smooth out the metal in the blade as much as using a consistent angle will., Try to start this motion with the heel of the knife touching the rod and end it with the tip of the knife touching the rod.









In order to master this process, you'll need to move your arm, your hand, and your wrist. What's especially important to get the right action is moving the wrist. Without moving the wrist, you won't be able to sweep the entire blade — heel to tip — across the honing rod.

, Using the same sweep of your arm, hand, and wrist, gently move the knife across the lower half of the rod. Use only as much pressure as the weight of the knife itself. After completing both a top- and bottom sweep, you've done one revolution.

Determine your budget.,
Think about your knife needs.,
Decide whether you will purchase individual knives or an entire set.,
Determine what types of knives you need.,
Consider what kind of blade you want.,
Decide if you want a forged, full-tang, or stamped knife.,
Consider the type of handle you want.,
Make a short list of brands that produce the knives you need.,
Go to the store and hold the knives on your list.,
Do some price comparisons, based on the knives you've selected.,
Determine the best place or source to buy your knives.,
Purchase a knife or knife set that has at least a 1 year warranty.",How to Purchase Kitchen Knives," This is one of the biggest purchasing decisions you'll make and having one in mind early can really make shopping easier. Your kitchen knife budget should be based on your kitchen needs, not what some celebrity chef recommends.


Don't feel limited by a small budget. Quality knives come in a wide range of brands and styles.;
, What knives do you currently use every day? If you're having trouble determining what you need, try writing down a list of things you use knives for on a regular basis. For example, slicing bread or tomatoes, coring fruit, filleting fish, etc. Use the list to decide what knives are right for those jobs.

, While there are pros and cons of each, you need to primarily use your budget and knife needs to decide.


If you only use a few knives on a regular basis or have a limited budget, buying knives individually will save you money and give you more control over quality.You'll also save space from not having to store knives that you never use.
If your budget allows and you need a variety of knives, buying a set makes sense. Most knife sets include a utility knife, bread knife, carving knife, paring knife and chef knife. Some knife sets also come with a storage block and a steel for sharpening the knives.

, If you don't know what kinds you need, refer to the list you made in step two. Compare the tasks to the knives listed below.


Serrated - use for slicing things like bread, tomatoes, cake layers, and sandwiches. You'll want to choose a long knife to ensure that it can easily cut through a loaf of bread or cake.Bread - similar to a serrated knife, but is slightly curved to allow a rocking motion for cutting through crust.Paring - a small knife for small tasks, such as coring, trimming, and peeling vegetables and fruit.Chef - chances are most of the things on your list can be accomplished with this larger knife.Dicing vegetables, cutting meat, and chopping herbs are just a few examples of this knife's uses.
Santoku - an increasingly popular knife with hollowed-out indentations on the blade used for chopping, dicing, and mincing.There are also many task-specific knives such as boning, filleting, cheese, cleavers, and steak knives. If you find yourself needing many of these, you might consider buying a knife set.

, Carbon steel blades are very sharp, but require lots of care, as they can rust and dull easily.Stainless steel blades will not rust, but are more difficult to sharpen. High carbon stainless steel seems to combine the best of the blades. It won't rust and stays sharp, though it can be sharpened easily.


Your budget will probably come into play here, as high carbon stainless steel blades are often more expensive than the stainless steel blades or the harder to find carbon steel blades.

, A forged knife has a blade made from a solid piece of metal, while full-tang means the blade continues down through the handle.These knives are typically sturdier and longer lasting than stamped knives, which are punched out of a metal ribbon and fitted into a handle.


Stamped knives are often lighter than forged or full-tang knives, but can be poorly balanced because of this., Knives come with wooden, plastic, composite, and stainless steel handles. Wooden handles can be shaped into a comfortable handle, but they do require lots of maintenance to prevent cracking and bacterial contamination.Plastic or composite handles require little maintenance and can be contoured to provide extra grip, but they too can crack over time.Stainless steel handles are the most durable, but can become slippery while you're using them. These knives are typically heavier., Include knives within your budget, so you're not disappointed if you prefer one that's much too expensive.


Note which knives on your list are available only online or in store. If a store carries them, be sure to list which stores in your area have them.

, You're mainly checking to see how the knife feels. Do you like the feel of the knife handle? Do you think you would be comfortable using the knife? Check to see is the knife feels balanced in your hand for cutting.


It's a good idea to also hold some knives that didn't make your list. You might find that you actually prefer a wooden handle to a metal one, or vice versa.

, Check for local sales, but also include online websites. This should help you make up your mind about which knives to get, if the prices differ dramatically.

, If you choose a store in your area, consider whether they'll be running sales in the near future. If you use an online site, don't forget to figure shipping costs into your purchase.


Regardless of where you choose to buy your knives, learn the company's return policy.

, This warranty lets you know the manufacturer believes the knives to be of good quality, and you have the option of replacing any knives that break or are damaged.


Carefully read any warranty information that comes with your knives, since there are certain actions that can void the company's warranty, such as washing them in the dishwasher, incorrectly sharpening the blades, or taking them apart (if you own stamped knives).

Scrub the rust with an abrasive pad.,
For mild rust, try scrubbing with baking soda.,
Make a salt scrub.,
For bad rust, use a heavy-duty cleaner.,
Rinse the pan and dry thoroughly.,
For pans with severe rust, use professional-quality abrasion.

",How to Remove Rust from a Cast Iron Skillet1," If you have either, a fine piece of steel wool or a copper pad work well for removing rust.However, you can also get good results from non-metal abrasive products (e.g. Brillo, SOS, etc.).If the rust is stubborn, add a little water and some mild dish-washing soap as you scrub.


Normally, it's a bad idea to try to clean a cast iron pan the same way you'd clean other metal cookware, since this can remove the protective layer of seasoning. However, if your pan has rust, this has already occurred, so it's best to clean the rust from the pan and re-season later.;
, If the rust appears to be thin and light, you can often get away with using mild abrasives you probably already have in your kitchen. For example, to use baking soda as an abrasive, sprinkle a small amount onto the surface of the pan along with some water. Stir the baking soda with the water to make a rough paste, then use a rag to scrub the paste into the rusty spots of the pan.


Once you've scrubbed the rusty areas, let the paste sit for a few minutes, then rinse it off with tap water. If any rust remains, repeat as needed or switch to a different abrasive.

, Another easy DIY abrasive uses salt and water. This method works almost exactly like the baking soda one above: make a rough paste of salt and water in the pan, then scrub it into the rusty spots with a rag.


Because the salt crystals are a little larger and rougher than particles of baking soda, the paste will be slightly more abrasive. However, salt is still considered fairly gentle.

, In some cases, simple abrasives won't remove rust on their own. In these cases, harsher chemical cleaners can help. For example, lower-priced toilet bowl cleaners containing roughly 20% hydrochloric acid (HCl) tend to well. HCl completely dissolves rust into a wet powder. In this state, it can easily be removed — consult the product's packaging for disposal instructions.


HCl is a strong acid, so working with it requires great care to prevent chemical burns. Protect your skin, hands, and eyes — wear gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, and safety goggles or other eye protection (which can usually be purchased for fairly cheap at universities with chemistry departments). Always use good ventilation and avoid breathing the product's fumes. Strong acids can irritate the throat and lungs, especially in people with asthmatic or lung conditions.
Beware: HCl will dull coated or plated screws and polished, shiny iron or steel, and such.

, After cleaning, give the pan a thorough rinsing to remove any loosened rust or cleaning products. If you used HCl, consult the product's packaging for disposal instructions instead. When the pan is clean, dry with a clean rag or paper towel. Be sure to get all the water out — missing even a little can cause rust to re-form.


After drying with a towel, try heating the pan on the stove over medium heat for about five minutes. This will remove any last traces of water, leaving you with a completely dry pan. Use care when handling the hot pan.
After removing rust, it is highly recommended that you season your pan. This is an easy process that essentially gives the cast iron a protective layer of fat which prevents future rusting and also keeps food from sticking as it cooks. See the section below for information on seasoning your pan.


,"
"
Preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C).,
Coat the dry pan with cooking oil.,
Alternatively, use another source of fat.,
Put the skillet into the oven for an hour.,
Turn off the oven.",How to Remove Rust from a Cast Iron Skillet2," The seasoning process requires you to basically ""bake"" a layer of fat into the pan so that it stays there semi-permanently. The fat protects the iron surface from oxidation (rusting).To start, warm up your oven.You can proceed to the next few steps while you wait.

, Generally, the easiest source of fat to work with for this purpose is cooling oil (e.g., canola oil, vegetable oil, peanut oil, etc.). Pour a small amount (no more than about one tablespoon) into the skillet and spread it around with a paper towel, coating the entire surface. Many chefs like to coat the underside and handle as well, though this is less important.


Olive oil isn't the best for this task — it has a lower smoke point than most other cooking oils, which means that it's more likely to give off smoke and may possibly set off your smoke alarm., You don't have to use oil — most types of cooking fat will work well. A few ideas are provided below:


One easy solution is to use bacon grease. Cook the bacon in the cast iron pan, drain the excess grease into a pan, and use a paper towel to coat the pan evenly with the remainder.
Lard or shortening also work well. For these fats, use a slightly lower temperature. 275-300 F (135-149 C) usually works well., Place the pan directly on a rack in the middle of the oven upside down (so the cooking surface faces the bottom of the oven. Put a baking sheet underneath to catch drips of excess oil. Let the pan ""bake"" like this for about one hour.

, After an hour, turn off the oven but don't open it. Let it gradually cool — this may take an extra hour or two. When the pan is cool enough to handle safely (use an oven mitt if you are unsure), take it out of the oven. Congratulations — it's now seasoned. It should resist rusting and stick to food less in the future.


If you wish, you can partially re-season your pan whenever you wish by adding a little extra fat after the next few times you cook. Just apply oil, lard, etc. with a paper towel as above, covering the surface evenly with a thin layer. This isn't essential, but it's a wise idea if you accidentally take some of the seasoning off (see below).

"
"
Use the pan.,
Put the skillet back on the heat and pour off all excess fat with the exception of about 2 tablespoons (30 ml).,
Let the skillet get pretty hot, so that drops of water will flash away when sprinkled on the surface.,
Add approximately 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of salt and, with a paper towel bunched up and held in some tongs (Caution: Hot Iron), use the paper towel and the salt to scour the bottom and sides of the pan, until the brown bits are gone (the salt will be dirty).

,
Rinse out with some hot water (Caution: Hot Steam) and return to the heat.,
Finished.

",How to Clean Your Cast Iron Skillet or Pot After Daily Use," It must get dirty before you can clean it, or start with a dirty pan.;
, If no fat is left, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oil. You need some fat/oil to help clean one way or another.

, Make sure that the oil isn’t smoking. Nothing bad will happen if the oil smokes, the pan is just too hot to handle at that point.

,, Add about 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) of vegetable oil and after about 30-45 seconds use a paper towel to spread the oil around and coat the bottom and sides of the skillet, and let cool. Now it’s ready for using again!

Place the cookware in a self-cleaning oven.,
Wash the cast iron cookware with warm water and soap.,
Dry the cookware thoroughly.,
Coat the pot or pan inside and out with lard, Crisco (cooking fat), bacon fat, or corn oil.,
Place both the lid and the pot or pan upside down in the oven at a high temperature (300ºF to 500ºF/150ºC-260ºC, depending on your preference).,
Repeat.,
Maintain the cast iron with ongoing care.",How to Season Cast Iron Cookware1," Run one cycle. Alternatively, place in a campfire or directly on a hot charcoal fire for 1/2 hour, and heat until it turns a dull red. The crust will be flaking, falling and turning to white ash. After allowing the cookware to cool a bit (to avoid cracking the cast iron), use the following steps.









If you have more rust than crust, try using steel wool to sand it off.;
, Scrub using a scouring pad.









If you have purchased your cast iron cookware as new, then it will be coated in wax or an oily coating to prevent rust. This will need to be removed before seasoning so this step is essential. Soak in hot, soapy water for five minutes, then wash off the soap and air dry., It helps to put the pan in the oven at 350F for a few minutes to make sure it's really dry. Oil needs to be able to soak into the metal for a good seasoning and––oil and water don't mix.








, Over time, oils will make your pan sticky. Bacon fat is the best choice. Ensure that both sides of the lid are also coated.








, Heat for at least an hour to bake on a ""seasoning"" cover that will continue to protect the pan from rust and provide a stick-resistant surface.









Place a sheet of aluminum foil or a large disposable foil roaster under the pan, on a lower rack or on the bottom of the oven, to catch drippings.
Let cool to room temperature in the oven.

, For best results, repeat steps three and four and five.








, Every time you wash your cast iron cookware, season it without fail.









Place the cast iron cookware on the stove and pour in about a 3/4 teaspoon of corn oil (or other cooking fat).
Wad up a paper towel and spread the oil across the cooking surface, any bare iron surfaces, and the bottom of the cookware.
Turn on the burner and heat until smoke starts to appear.
If using an electric stove, heat slowly as hot spots can crack the cast iron.
Cover the cookware and turn heat off. Leave until cooled before placing in storage. Wipe off any excess fat before storing. If your cast iron gets sticky from using oil instead of bacon fat, use it over a campfire to make some bacon or other item which renders pig fat, and the stickiness will burn off.
