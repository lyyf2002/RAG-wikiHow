Store the cast iron in a dry place.",How to Clean Cast Iron1," Seasoning cast iron creates a seal over the metal, preventing rust and creating a nonstick surface.









Some cast iron cookware comes pre-seasoned; read the packaging or ask a store clerk if you aren't sure about yours.
If you've had your cast iron cookware for awhile and don't know if it came seasoned, it's best to take the steps to season it, just in case. Read How to Season a Cast Iron Skillet to learn the best technique for seasoning your cookware.;
, Use a plastic scrubber to remove food. Be careful not to scrub too hard, so you don't remove the seasoning. Since the surface is nonstick, a light scrubbing should do.









Do not use soap on cast iron. It's abrasive to the iron's surface, and may remove the seasoning.

, Use a dry dishcloth, and make sure you don't miss any spots, especially on the inside of the cookware.









To be extra sure the cast iron is dry, place it on a hot burner and let it warm up for a few minutes, so any extra water will evaporate.

, Dab a paper towel in olive, grapeseed or canola oil and rub it over the cast iron. This seals the metal and makes sure no moisture causes the cast iron to rust.









If you use your cast iron cookware daily, this step is not necessary. Only coat the cast iron in oil if you're storing it for more than a few days.

, Take care not to stack a wet pot or pan on top of the cast iron.

Use hot water to clean hot pans.",How to Care For Cast Iron," Set your oven to 325°F (163°C) and let it heat up. The process of seasoning cast iron involves coating it with a layer of oil and baking it. Seasoning, or curing, the pan will cover it with a non-stick surface, make the pan easier to clean, and protect it from rust.


Most new cast iron pans come pre-seasoned, but you'll have to season any that haven't been cured by the manufacturer.You can still season a new pan if it comes pre-seasoned, and you should definitely season an old or second-hand cast iron pan before using it.;
, Fill a sink with a small amount of hot, soapy water. Immerse a clean sponge in the soapy water, then wash the cast iron pan. Rinse the pan under hot water and dry it completely with a clean towel.You can also use a dish brush with stiff bristles to clean the pan.
Most people recommend not washing cast iron with soap once it has been seasoned, because the soap can slowly remove the seasoning. However, because you're about to season the pan, use soap now to make sure the pan is clean.

, Dip a clean cloth or paper towel into some vegetable shortening. Rub the shortening over the inside and outside of the skillet to coat the pan with a thin and even layer.It’s best to use a small amount of solid shortening for seasoning, because too much shortening or using liquid oil can leave a sticky residue on the pan.

, Place a cookie sheet or piece of foil on the bottom rack of the oven. Then place the skillet upside down on the middle rack. Bake the empty skillet for an hour.


The baking sheet is important because it will catch any shortening that melts and drips off the pan.

, After an hour, turn off the oven. Leave the skillet in the oven as it cools, about one to two hours. Remove the pan from the oven once it’s cool. Buff the pan by rubbing it with a paper towel or clean cloth to remove excess shortening.When you're finished, the pan should be a smooth and shiny black.

, Over time, this non-stick layer may wear away, especially if you use the pan to cook non-fatty foods. Repeat the seasoning process every few months, or when:The pan loses its luster and becomes dull
The color changes from black to dark gray
Food starts sticking to the pan

, Clean your pan as soon as possible after cooking with it. The longer food cools in the pan, the harder it will be to clean. After cooking with your cast iron pan, hold it under hot running water. While the water is running, wipe the pan out with a clean cloth to remove food particles.For mildly soiled and well-seasoned pans, this may be all you need to clean your cast iron.
If you're worried about bacteria because you aren't using soap, just make sure to preheat your cast iron before adding food. Cast iron heats up very quickly, and even over medium heat the pan will quickly reach temperatures high enough to kill any bacteria., For food that’s still stuck on your pan or baked-on leftovers, sprinkle the inside of a warm pan with a generous layer of coarse salt. Scrub the surface of the pan with a damp dish cloth to remove the stuck-on food.


When the food has been removed, discard the salt and scraps and rinse the pan out with hot water., Remove excess water from the pan by drying it with a towel immediately after cleaning it. Return the pan to the stove and warm it over low heat until all the water has evaporated, about two minutes.Never let cast iron cookware air dry, as this will cause the iron to rust.

, With the pan still on low heat, coat it with an additional layer of vegetable shortening, using a cloth or paper towel to spread the shortening evenly over the pan. Leave the pan on the heat for another 10 minutes.After 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool. Before putting it away, wipe out any excess shortening with a cloth or paper towel.
Fully seasoning a pan is a process that happens over time. As you add more oil to the pan and cook fatty foods in the cast iron, the surface will become more protected and more non-stick.

, Iron is highly susceptible to rust, which can be caused when the metal is exposed to air and water. Seasoning your cast iron pan regularly will help prevent it from rusting. It’s important to remove rust spots immediately if they do begin to form, otherwise they will quickly spread.


Wet a mildly abrasive sponge or scrub pad with soapy water and scrub the rusted spots on the pan. To remove tough rust spots, try a bit of vinegar on the sponge. Rinse the pan under hot water.
Re-season the pan by coating it in vegetable shortening and baking it in the oven for an hour.

, There are a few things you can do to a cast iron pan that will virtually guarantee rust. To prevent rust from forming, avoid exposing the metal to moisture as much as possible:


Never immerse cast iron directly in water. Clean the pan by running water over, rather than submerging it in a full sink.
Always dry cast iron cookware fully after using and washing.
Store the pans in cupboards or from hooks with the lids off. Lids can trap air and moisture against the surface of the pan, and this will cause the metal to rust., The seasoning layer will protect your cast iron from small amounts of acid, so it’s ok to cook mildly acidic foods in your pan for short periods of time. But acidic foods that require long simmering times, such as tomato sauce, should be cooked in other cookware.With a long-simmering acidic food, the acid can find weak spots in the seasoning layer, and this can eat away at the seasoning and start to corrode the metal.
Be sure to remove acidic foods from your cast iron as soon as they're cooked, and wash the pan immediately., Always wash your cast iron by hand, and never put it in the dishwasher. The dishwasher will expose the pan to too much moisture, and this can lead to rust.


You should also avoid metal scouring pads on the cast iron, as these can damage the seasoning layer.Harsh soaps and detergents can also remove the seasoning, so avoid them unless you plan to re-season the pan right away.

, Never pour cold water into a hot cast iron pan, as this can lead to cracking and warping. If your pan is still hot from cooking, only use hot water to clean it."

Decide whether you want to buy a Dutch oven that is made of enameled cast iron, anodized aluminum or stainless steel.,
Look for a Dutch oven that is thick around the sides and the bottom, and an equal thickness all the way around.

,
Find an oven that has ovenproof handles and knobs, which are essential if you will be cooking in the oven.

,
Choose a Dutch oven with a lid that fits properly so that moisture will not be able to escape.

,
Decide on the size of the Dutch oven you want to buy.,
Examine the handles of the Dutch oven you want to buy.",How to Buy a Dutch Oven1," Anodized aluminum is lighter and does not rust, but enameled cast iron distributes heat more evenly and requires less care.;
,,,, If you are cooking for a larger crowd, you will need a bigger pot. An average sized Dutch oven is about 4 to 5 US-quart (4,000 to 5,000 ml). (3.8 to 4.7 l).

, The handles should be easy to grasp when your hands are protected with oven mitts or towels.

"
"
Clean the cookware.,
Rinse thoroughly and dry.

",How to Cure Cast Iron1," It doesn't have to be 100 percent bare metal––scrape it off with a metal implement and then scrub repeatedly with small amounts of baking soda and soap until it stops making the soda black.;
,"
"
Wash it right after use.,
Remove built-up food with salt and vinegar.,
Dry the skillet thoroughly.,
Store the skillet in a dry place.,
Preheat the oven to 350 ºF.,
Wash and dry the new skillet.,
Coat the skillet with fat.,
Put the skillet in the oven.,
Repeat the process.,
Soak the skillet in a vinegar solution.,
Rinse and dry the skillet.,
Coat it with fat.,
Bake the skillet for 2 hours.,
Repeat the process.",How to Care for a Cast Iron Skillet," Try to get to it before the food you cook has a chance to crust over the skillet. This makes cleanup a lot easier. Simply wipe out the food scraps with a sponge and then rinse the skillet with hot water.


You can use a touch of regular dish soap to help dislodge sticky food, but don't use too much. Never use bleach or any kind of harsh cleanser.
Never put your cast iron skillet in the dishwasher.The detergent will corrode the iron.;
, If the bottom of the skillet has a layer of caked-on food, make a mixture of coarse salt and vinegar and use a paper towel to rub it around the bottom of the skillet. It's easier on the iron than a scrub brush would be, and less likely to remove the nonstick seasoning.


You can also burn off caked food. Turn up the oven to 500 °F (260 °C) and put the skillet inside for an hour or so. The food will turn to ash, and you'll be able to brush it off and rinse the skillet.
However, if you use this method you'll need to re-season the skillet, since that will get burned off as well.

, Leaving wet spots on the skillet will lead to rust. After washing the skillet, use a dishcloth to dry it all over, including the handle.

, If you're stacking it with other pans, you might want to line the skillet with a paper towel to make sure that no moisture gets trapped between them and protect the seasoning from getting scratched off.

, To season a brand new cast iron skillet, you rub it with oil and bake the oil into the surface of the cast iron. This builds up a nonstick coating, called the ""seasoning,"" that keeps the skillet from rusting and creates the perfect surface for cooking everything from scrambled eggs to pancakes to cobblers.

, Use hot, soapy water and a scrub brush to scrub the skillet completely clean. This will remove any chemicals or other residues from the skillet so they don't get trapped in the seasoning.


After this first washing, you won't be using a scrub brush on the skillet again, since it will take off the precious seasoning you'll be working to preserve.
Make sure to dry the skillet well, so that it doesn't create steam when you put it in the oven.

, You can use lard, vegetable shortening, or olive oil. Use a paper towel to rub the fat into the skillet all over. The fat will bake into the skillet and fuse with the iron to become a layer of seasoning. You won't be able to taste or smell it once the process is complete.


Try not to miss any spots when you're covering the skillet with fat. If you miss a spot, it won't get a coating of seasoning, and will be more prone to rusting.

, Bake the skillet for 2 hours to make sure the seasoning gets fully formed. After 2 hours, remove it from the oven and set it on a heat safe surface to cool.

, Spread another coating of fat onto the skillet and bake it for another 2 hours, then let it cool. If you'd like, you can repeat it one more time to make extra sure that the seasoning won't strip off when you cook your first meal in the skillet. After this initial seasoning, the oil you use when you cook food will keep the skillet in good shape. Every time you cook a meal, the nonstick surface will improve., This will eliminate the rust, and it works no matter whether you have a few spots or the entire skillet has gotten rusty. Get a big pot large enough to hold the skillet. Fill it with a solution of half white vinegar, half water. Place the skillet in the pot and make sure it's completely submerged. Soak it for at least 3 hours so the vinegar has time to dissolve the rust.


When you remove the skillet, check for rust. If you still see rust spots, use a scrub brush to scrub them away.
Don't soak the skillet for more than 4 hours, or the iron will start to degrade. You just want to soak it long enough to take off the rust.

, Rinse off all of the vinegar, then use a dish towel to completely dry the skillet.

, Just like you would for a brand new skillet, use a paper towel to rub lard, olive oil or vegetable oil all over the skillet. This will become the skillet's new seasoning., Put it in an oven preheated to 350 °F (177 °C). After 2 hours, remove the skillet and let it cool completely.

, Coat it in another layer of oil, bake for 2 hours, and allow it to cool again. The once-rusty skillet should now have a protective layer of seasoning.

Rinse the skillet out with hot water after cooking.,
Bring the water to boil.,
With a wide spatula, lightly scrape the bottom and sides of the pan to dislodge any remaining food scraps.,
Dump the dirty water in the sink.,
Wet a couple paper towels and quickly wipe the surface of the skillet.,
Apply a thin coating of fat, such as vegetable oil or shortening, to the surface of the skillet.,
Store in a cool, dry place and cover with a paper towel instead of a lid to prevent moisture from building up inside the pan.

",How to Clean a Cast Iron Skillet1," If your skillet is still hot, this is the best time to clean it. If your skillet has a distinct ""lip"" so that it holds water, you can pour water directly onto the hot pan--something you should not do with other kinds of cookware. It will hiss and steam dramatically, but this is fine. Take care not to get too close to the hot steam lest you risk a burn. Rinse it out once to remove many of the large pieces of food. Then fill it again so that the water fills the cooked on area.The exact amount is not important, but;
, If your skillet still needs cleaning, or is cold, you can heat the pan up again. Carefully place the cast iron skillet back on the burner and heat the water up until it reaches a boiling point. Boil the water for several minutes to help dissolve food scraps.

, Do this while the water is still boiling, but only briefly. Too much contact with metal objects risks stripping the pan's seasoning., Return the cast iron skillet to the burner and turn the burner off.


Use caution when transporting the skillet back and forth between the range and the sink. Because cast iron is an excellent conductor of heat, the handle, as well as all other portions of the skillet, will be extremely hot. Use a cloth or oven mitts to transport the skillet.

, If done correctly, the bottom of your paper towel should contain a dark layer of residue.

, Vegetable sprays work especially well for this purpose. Apply or spray a dab of fat into the bottom of the pan; with a paper towel, wipe the fat into the bottom and the sides of the pan. This process should turn the pan's surface into a smooth, glossy finish.

Roll out the cookie dough into a log shape.,
Select a cookie disk.,
Remove the ring from the cookie press barrel.,
Set the cookie press vertically on top of an ungreased cookie sheet.,
Refill your cookie press when it is empty.,
Finished.

",How to Use a Cookie Press," This shape makes it easier to insert the dough into the cookie press barrel. You don't need to roll the dough out to a specific thickness, but it should be small enough to easily insert small amounts into the press. Place the dough into the press, and push down the plunger or crank the handle, depending upon your press.;
, Many cookie presses come with about 12 to 14 disk templates that feature various designs. These disks are mainly constructed out of either metal or plastic.

, Place your chosen cookie disk on top of the barrel, and replace the ring. The ring secures the disk to the press.

, The disk portion of the press should be touching the cookie sheet. Squeeze the trigger, and a cookie shape will come out. Gently lift the cookie press to have the dough separate from the press. Repeat this step until the cookie sheet has enough cookies.


Make sure that the cookie sheet is ungreased. Pressed cookies must adhere to the cookie sheet otherwise they will not separate from the cookie press.
If you have a battery-powered cookie press, instead of pulling a trigger you will need to press a button.

, Some cookie presses have clear barrels, which makes it easier for you to see when you run out of cookie dough.

Use the self cleaning oven to strip down the cast iron cookware.,
Take the utensil out of the oven after the 10 minute drying time is complete.,
Place the cast iron cookware in the oven.,
Finally, after the cast iron cookware is finished seasoning for 1 hour or so, take it out of the oven.",How to Season Cast Iron Cookware2," Place the utensil in your self cleaning oven on the shortest cleaning cycle (usually 3 hours on most models). It will come out looking like the day it came out of the mold.









Allow it to cool overnight.
Wash the residue off with water only in the sink, using a stiff abrasive pad.
Dry the cast iron utensil off with a paper towel, and immediately place the cookware back in the oven at 350ºF/180ºC for 10 minutes or so.

, Lightly brush the utensil with a paper towel coated with Crisco (or other solid cooking oil). Liquid vegetable oil will do in a pinch, but it's better to save the liquids until after the initial seasoning.









It is important in this step only to lightly coat the cast iron with a thin coating of oil, just enough until it barely glistens. Do not allow any puddles or pools of liquid as this will cause problems at a later time.

, Set to 500ºF to 550ºF/260ºC to 290ºC degrees. Have the cooking side of the cookware facing the bottom of the oven. This allows for any excess oil to drain off to the sides, and prevents pooling during the seasoning process.









The higher heating temperatures allow for the oil to truly ""cook"" as opposed to just ""gumming up"" at lower temperatures. Cook undisturbed for 1 hour.
Note: During this step, it will be best to turn off any smoke alarms in the immediate area as the cookware may smoke quite a lot. Ceiling fans also aid in ventilation.

, Immediately wipe it down with another extra-light coating of Crisco. Allow it to completely cool before storing.

Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water together.,
Submerge the cast iron in the solution for 30 minutes.,
Wipe the cast iron with a sponge.,
Rinse and dry off your cast iron.",How to Clean Old Cast Iron3," Vinegar is acidic and will destroy your cast iron if it's exposed to it for too long. This method should only be used for very rusted cast iron items. Combine equal parts of warm water with white vinegar in a tub or sink that's big enough to fit the cast iron item you are cleaning., Submerging your cast iron in the vinegar and water solution should soften up some of the rust and will allow you to remove it. Do not let your cast iron sit in the vinegar solution or you could damage the cast iron.If your entire cast iron item isn't submerged, it will create an uneven color.

, Wipe the rust with a cloth or a sponge. If the rust comes off, then you can stop soaking your cast iron. If the rust is still embedded in the cast iron, continue to soak the cast iron and check back frequently until the rust starts to rub off. Finish scrubbing the cast iron until it's clean and there is no more rust., Once all the rust has been removed and the cast iron is clean, run it under cold water to rinse off any remaining debris or solution. Use a dry cloth to completely dry down the cast iron."

Make a solution of white vinegar and water.,
Submerge the cookware in the solution.,
Rinse the cookware and dry it thoroughly.,
Coat the cast iron lightly in cooking oil.,
Season the cast iron again before cooking.",How to Clean Cast Iron3," Find a container large enough to hold your cookware. Fill it 3/4 of the way with a solution of half vinegar, half water.








, Allow it to sit for three to four hours, checking it's progress along the way. The vinegar should dissolve the rust.









If the rust isn't fully dissolved after four hours, remove the cookware from the solution and use a nonmetal brush to brush off the remaining rust.
Don't leave the cookware in the solution for more than four hours, as it will start causing the metal to degrade.

, To make sure it's completely dry, heat it through on the stove, or bake it in the oven for a few minutes.








, Dab a paper towel in olive, grapeseed or canola oil and rub it over the cast iron before storing.








, Since you burned off the protective layer of seasoning, you'll have to re-season the cast iron before using it again. Otherwise, it won't provide a nonstick cooking surface, and it may begin to rust.









Coat the cookware in olive oil and bake in a 350-degree oven for one hour. You'll have to cook with the cast iron several times before it's fully seasoned, but this method will start the process.
Stores that sell cast iron usually carry seasoning products to apply to your cookware. Try one of these if you'd prefer not to season your cast iron yourself.

Decide whether you would like a Dutch oven that is made out of aluminum or cast iron.,
Think about the size of the Dutch oven you want to buy.,
Inspect the Dutch oven you are buying to make sure that there are not any cracks or fractures.,
Find a Dutch oven that has a lip around the edge of the lid because you may need to place coals on top of the Dutch oven when cooking, and a lip will prevent ash from falling into your food.,
Examine the bail of the Dutch oven you want to buy and make sure that it consists of thick, heavy wire that will not break when the pot is lifted while full of food.,
Check the legs of the Dutch oven.,
Consider purchasing a Dutch oven that has been pre-seasoned.",How to Buy a Dutch Oven2," Cast iron distributes heat more efficiently and evenly, but aluminum is lighter, which may be an important factor if you will be hauling the oven often or for long distances. Most traditional Dutch ovens are made of cast iron.

, If you are buying a Dutch oven for general purposes, rather than to cook something in particular, you may consider getting a 12 inch (30.5 cm) oven, which will hold enough food for a few people.

, You will also want to observe the thickness of the Dutch oven to make sure that it is consistent.

, The pot should have a handle on the lid that will allow it to be opened with a lid lifter.

, The bail is a loop made of wire on both sides of the Dutch oven that is used to lift it onto a fire.

, They should be at least 1 inch (2.2 cm) long and not have any cracks or deformities. The legs should be strong and sturdy.

, A pre-seasoned oven is more convenient than seasoning your own, and does not generally need to be seasoned regularly.

Use a clean cloth or paper towel to wipe off extra oil or shortening.,
Choose between oven or stove curing.",How to Cure Cast Iron2,"


Vegetable oils like sunflower, safflower, ""light"" olive oil and canola are suitable. These oils are ideal because of their chemistry and high smoke point - they will produce the hardest temper. Shortening and lard can also help you successfully cure cast iron. Shortening or lard might work best while curing.

,


It's important to not warm the cookware so much that it makes it unable to be touched. Warming up your cookware before the application of oil or shortening can make the application easier.

,


You can do this by placing a bit of oil or shortening onto a cloth or paper towel and rubbing it across the cookware's surface. Be sure to cover all sides of the cookware, including the exterior parts.

,
Reheat the cookware for at least 1 hour.

,
Let the cookware cool down to room temperature before removing it again.

,
Consider repeating the seasoning process a few more times.",How to Cure Cast Iron3,"


Many people who season their cast iron cookware line a cookie sheet or the bottom of their ovens with aluminum foil so that the oil that drips off of the cookware will not touch the oven itself.

,


You can choose a temperature anywhere between 350 to 500 Fahrenheit (176 to 260 Celsius). The perfect temperature depends on the size of your cookware and the amount of time you intend to cure it for.

When increasing the heat slightly ceases to make the pan smoke, remove the pan from heat but leave the heat on.,
After the pan has cooled, apply another thin coat, cover, and let sit for an hour at the ideal temperature you found.,
Finally (and from now on after every time you cook), scrub it out with a plastic brush and regular table salt.",How to Cure Cast Iron4," This could be a lid from the actual cookware or one borrowed from something else, such as a wok.

, Start with a low heat and make sure the pan is evenly seated.

, If there's no smoke, increase the heat slightly.

, You found your ideal curing temperature.

, Do this a total of two more times (three coats in total).

, Then rinse thoroughly, towel dry, and apply a thin coat of your favorite cooking oil. The salt helps clean, sanitize, and preserves the temper by providing iodine which anchors the oil esters.

Wear the proper safety equipment.,
Scrape off the rust with steel wool or wire brush.,
Vacuum up any loose dust and dirt.,
Apply a cast iron polish to the oven.,
Scrub the oven with a damp cloth or sponge.,
Dry off the oven.",How to Clean Old Cast Iron4," Before you work on the stove, make sure that it's off and not hot. If you are removing rust from the cast iron, make sure that you wear gloves and a facemask. Also, make sure the stove is in a well-ventilated area and open up all the windows if you are cleaning it indoors., Go back and forth over rusted areas on the stove with a #00 or #000 steel wool or a wire brush until the rust starts to come loose. Continue to do this over all the rusted areas of the cast iron until you've removed all the rust you can.You can also use a 150 to 400 grit sandpaper instead of steel wool.

, Use a vacuum attachment or a shop vac to remove all the dust particles and debris that you were able to sand off the cast iron. Continue to go over the entirety of your oven until all the dust has been removed., Put some cast iron polish into a rag or cloth and rub it onto the surface of your oven. Apply a thin coat of cast iron polish over the entirety of the oven. This should change the hue of the oven and make it appear shinier. Once you've applied the polish, let it dry for a 24 hour period.You can purchase cast iron polish at fireplace stores or online.

, Make sure that the polish has dried completely before washing off your oven. Use a dry cloth and dab the surface of the oven to test that it has fully dried. If it is dry, scrub the cast iron with a damp cloth. If there is still rust or dirt remaining, you may have to repeat the process of scraping and polishing the oven to get it completely clean., Use a dry terry cloth or cotton rag to completely dry off the oven. Once it's dry, put some dry kindling in the oven and bring it outside. Light a fire and bring the oven to 300°F (148.88°C). Continue to heat it until the oven no longer smokes. Once it stops smoking, your oven is safe to use again.If you are heating the oven indoors, make sure you have plenty of ventilation because the polish smoke is hazardous to your health.

Avoid causing thermal shock to glass bakeware.,
Avoid using glass bakeware if it's chipped, cracked, scratched, or broken.,
Add liquid to glass bakeware when cooking vegetables.",How to Use Oven Safe Glass Bakeware1," It is important to carefully read all of the instructions and safety tips that come with your glass bakeware before using the item. These instructions should clearly outline how to use the dish properly. Make sure that you follow these instructions in order to avoid breaking the glass through misuse., Glass bakeware is specifically designed for oven and microwave use only. If used incorrectly the glass bakeware may break and cause a mess and/or injury to those around.Do not use this bakeware for broiling or cooking on the stovetop. You should also avoid using glass bakeware when cooking with a grill, toaster oven, or barbecue.

, When cooking in an oven wait until the oven is fully preheated before placing the food in the oven. This will help to ensure that cook times are accurate.When using Anchor bakeware, do not bake in oven temperatures over 425 °F (218 °C)., Thermal shock occurs when glass bakeware undergoes a significant and sudden temperature change and may result in the cracking or chipping of the dish. Here are a few things to keep in mind while using oven safe glass bakeware:Do not add cold liquids to a hot pan.
Do not put hot glassware into dishwater.
Do not place a hot dish directly onto counter tops. Instead, place on an oven mitt, pot holder, or towel.
Do not move glassware from the freezer directly into the oven.

, If your glass bakeware has a noticeable scratch or chip it could expand and break when heated. Dispose of all cracked bakeware. Similarly, you should avoid using bakeware that has been dropped or heavily struck by cooking utensils. This bakeware may be weakened by improper use and is more likely to break., If you are cooking vegetables in your glass bakeware use some form of liquid, such as water or vegetable stock, to ensure the vegetables do not stick to the bottom of the pan.Add liquid prior to heating. Adding liquid later could result in thermal shock.

Fill the sink with dish soap and water.,
Soak the silicone bakeware in grease-cutting dish soap.,
Scrub with a nonabrasive sponge.,
Repeat the process.,
Rinse and dry the silicone bakeware.",How to Clean Silicone Bakeware1," Stopper your kitchen sink and fill it with very hot water – as hot as you can tolerate. Pour in a few drops of anti-grease dish soap and mix it in so that the water suds up. The grease-cutting dish soap is designed to tackle hard to clean stains like the ones famously acquired by silicone bakeware.


Make sure you use very hot water. Lukewarm or cold water will not be quite as effective at cleaning your silicone bakeware.;
, Place the silicone bakeware in the hot, soapy water and let it soak. Leave the bakeware in the sink for at least thirty minutes, though you may need to leave it for a bit longer (one hour) for really tough stains.While your preference might be to use a more natural dish soap, those ingredients won’t be nearly as effective for the tough stains you’ll find on your silicone bakeware.

, Apply some more of the grease-cutting dish soap and scrub the silicone bakeware with a nonabrasive sponge. Really get in there and scrub hard to remove the stains.You may have to spend quite a bit of time and energy getting rid of these stains.

, To get the stains out, you may need to repeat the process several times. It will take some real elbow grease to get some of these stains out of your silicone bakeware. Try using the grease-cutting dish soap again and scrubbing it over and over.Try to use even hotter water the second time. If you use rubber gloves, you’ll be able to use hotter water while cleaning your silicone bakeware.

, When you have finished scrubbing the stains on your silicone bakeware, you should rinse off any remaining soapy residue in the sink. Then place the bakeware upside down on a towel or drying rack to let the water run off.


Make sure you allow the silicone to dry completely before you begin using it again. This usually takes at least an hour or two.

Choose between a rod or a roller.,
Consider a wooden rolling pin.,
Check out marble rolling pins.,
Try a stainless steel rolling pin.,
Look at non-stick rolling pins.,
Check out glass rolling pins.,
Decide on a suitable length.,
Check for the following things before you're satisfied with a choice:


The handling feels good to you and it's easy to use
The balance feels right
The surface won't stick to the dough or heat it up
It's easy to clean.

,
Consider having several rolling pins of different kinds.",How to Choose a Rolling Pin," A rod (also known as a French rolling pin) is one piece of wood that is either a straight dowel, tapered from the center, or tapered at the ends. The roller is a round cylinder of wood attached to an internal axle, with two handles at the end to push on to make it roll. Both have a different feel and you may prefer one over the other, or even find that they work well for different tasks in the kitchen. The only way to know is to try one of each style.


The rod is easier on your hands and wrists. You place your palm on each end of it and roll using even pressure across the dough. On the downside, your hands touch the dough; some people enjoy this ""dough feel"" as a technique in itself, but touching too much risks heating the dough from your hand warmth, so you need to work quickly. The rod is usually cheaper than a rolling pin and it has another benefit of not having any crevices which could attract random pieces of dough.
The rolling pin is used by holding the handles and rolling the cylinder across the dough. The downside is that you need to place more force on the dough and as a result, the dough is not stretched as evenly as with a rod because you're exerting pressure in uneven ways.
Some rolling pins are one piece with handles, a cross between both types of rolling pins.;
, Wooden rolling pins are traditional and can be made from a variety of wood types, including fragrant wood (such as huon pine from Tasmania). The larger the wooden rolling pin, the heavier it will be (see ""Tips"" for benefits of weight).


Many wooden rolling pins stick to the dough. This can be a real hassle, especially if adding a lot of flour makes the pastry over-floured. However, some woods are better than others; look for an oilier wood that will not stick as much.
A wooden roll cannot be chilled for pastry that needs to stay really cool.
Wooden rolling pins can mark more easily than other types of rolling pins.

, These rolling pins are heavy but they remain cold (especially if chilled first) and therefore don't transfer any heat to the dough. On the downside, while these rolling pins are marvelous to look at, they are very heavy and can really squash delicate pastry. If you do get one, be sure its internal axle is very solidly attached and not likely to wobble off course.


Marble is prone to chipping. It is usually purchased with a wooden stand supplied; be sure to always use this stand when chilling and storing the rolling pin.

, These look very ""chef"" and hold cold well. They are always easy to clean and they are usually very well balanced. On the downside, they're heavy and they may feel too cold to the touch.


Some metallic rolling pins can be filled with water in the same manner as glass ones.

, A non-stick rolling surface will make it easier to roll over the dough. There are plastic, silicone, and other non-stick surface rolling pins. Check that it can be chilled if needed and that its surface is safe. The beauty of silicone rolling pins is that they don't stick and they're really easy to clean.

, Glass rolling pins are made so that cold water can be poured inside them to keep them chilled for rolling the dough.


Read the instructions accompanying a glass rolling pin for water temperature. If the water is too cold, the rolling pin will sweat and the liquid will be transferred to the dough.

, The length won't be such an issue unless you're making wide sheets of dough, such as for pasta. In this case, you need a long rolling pin, longer than the average sizes.


The standard length for a French rolling pin is 20"", while 12"" (30cm) is the standard for wooden, metallic rolling pins. Marble rolling pins tend to be 10""(25cm) in length. Rolling pins longer than 32"" can cause bowing.
Don't choose a longer one for normal dough work; it will be too unwieldy to work with.

,, This gives you the opportunity to change rolling pins between baking recipes and to show them off on display.


There are also specialty rolling pins that imprint decorative designs. These are for the serious baker with a specific design in mind, such as marzipan, pasta, shortbread, gingerbread, fondant, etc.

Avoid using soaps and detergents.,
Never put the skillet in the dishwasher.Different process, but same reasons.,
Try to avoid using steel wool to clean your cast iron cookery unless in dire need of cleaning.",How to Clean a Cast Iron Skillet3," Soaps and detergents are great at cleaning most cookery, but they should be avoided when it comes to cast iron pots and pans. The sulfides in most detergents bind to the oils in the skillet and strip them, leaving your skillet as naked and vulnerable as it was on the first day of its life. It still can be re-seasoned, but it ends up being more work than necessary.

, This process can eat through the non-stick coating you've created and promote rust.

, While steel wool is effective at removing food and other buildup, it cuts right through the seasoning and forces you to start at square one again. Far better to stick to the potato method for cleaning (no pun intended).

Store food in glass bakeware.,
Thaw the dish before cooking in the oven.,
Plastic lids are for storage and microwave use only.",How to Use Oven Safe Glass Bakeware2," Your glass bakeware can be used for storing food as well as cooking food. The dish can be stored in the freezer or refrigerator. For example, if you bake a lasagna using your glass bakeware and want to freeze it for later you can keep the lasagna in the glass bakeware and seal it with the plastic lid before placing in the freezer., If you decide to use your glass bakeware to store food in the freezer you need to make sure that you fully thaw the dish before re-heating in the oven or microwave. Failure to thaw the dish could result in thermal shock which may crack or break the dish.

, Many glass bakeware dishes will come with a plastic lid. These lids are not to be used in conventional ovens. Instead, they can be used for storing food in the freezer or refrigerator or when heating food in the microwave. Read the directions before placing plastic lids in the microwave or dishwasher.


If you need to cover food while it cooks in the oven, use tinfoil.

Clean glass bakeware using non-scratch pads.,
Try cleaning with dish soap and baking soda.,
Handle glass bakeware with care.",How to Use Oven Safe Glass Bakeware3," Over time, scratches in the glassware can result in cracked glass and breakage. Clean glass bakeware using non-scratch nylon pads or sponges to prevent scratches.To remove tough baked on food, soak the dish in warm water prior to scrubbing. This will help to loosen the food and make cleaning the dish much easier.

, In order to remove grease stains from your glass bakeware, sprinkle baking soda in the bottom of the pan with a little bit of dish soap. Let the dish soak in warm water for 15 minutes before scrubbing with a non-scratch pad., When cleaning, storing, or cooking with glass bakeware, make sure that you handle the product with care. Avoid scratching the glass with metal utensils, dropping the dish, or banging against other pots and pans. Glassware can crack over time, so handle yours carefully. This way, you can enjoy your bakeware for years to come."

Heat up your silicone bakeware before cleaning.,
Apply baking soda.,
Make a paste out of the baking soda.,
Rinse and repeat.,
Rinse and dry the bakeware.",How to Clean Silicone Bakeware2," For extra tough greasy stains, it can be beneficial to heat your silicone bakeware up in the oven before cleaning. Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Once the oven is fully preheated, put the silicone bakeware into the oven for ten minutes. This will help heat up the food stains that are stuck on the bakeware and make them easier to clean.After you’ve heated up the bakeware, try washing it with grease-cutting dish soap and baking soda.
Be careful not to burn yourself while handling the bakeware when you remove it from the oven.

, Wet down your silicone bakeware in the sink and shake all the water off. You want the item to be damp, but not dripping wet. Identify the places where there are still greasy food stains and sprinkle some baking soda on each spot.Be sure to give a generous sprinkling of the baking soda, not just a light dusting.

, Gently massage the baking soda with a damp cloth so that the water helps the baking soda powder form into a thick paste. You want the baking soda paste to be applied heavily to each stain on your silicone bakeware.


Let the baking soda dry completely, which could take several hours.

, Once the baking soda is fully dried, rinse it off in the sink with hot water. If the stains have not dissipated at this point, you can try washing it with grease-cutting dish soap again or apply the baking soda again.


You may have to repeat this process quite a few times to get your silicone bakeware perfectly cleaned.

, Once you have finished removing the baking soda paste, use some dish soap to wash the silicone. Then rinse all of the soap off in the kitchen sink. You should place the silicone bakeware on a towel or a drying rack and let it fully dry before using the item again.


Be sure not to store your silicone bakeware in the cabinet while it is still wet, as this could lead to mold and bacteria forming on your kitchenware.

"
"
Rinse immediately after use.,
Avoid using abrasive sponges.,
Forego the cooking sprays.",How to Clean Silicone Bakeware3," One of the worst things you can do to silicone bakeware is let the residue sit for long periods of time before cleaning. As soon as you finish baking, you should rinse out the silicone bakeware with grease-cutting dish soap. This will help maintain the integrity of your silicone bakeware and make future cleaning much easier.At the very least, fill the silicone bakeware with water and dish soap immediately after use so you can go back and clean it later.

, Scrubbing silicone bakeware with abrasive sponges will not work any more effectively in cleaning than a regular sponge or cloth will. And it may even damage your silicone bakeware in the process.Using an abrasive sponge can chip off pieces of the silicone and, over time, minimize the nonstick elements of the pan.

, Silicone bakeware is considered nonstick in its own right, so you don’t need to use nonstick cooking sprays with this type of bakeware. It will not help you get items out of the silicone pan any quicker than you would be able to with it.Additionally, using cooking sprays with silicone bakeware will contribute to the sticky, greasy mess you have to clean up later and cause more damage to your pan over time.

Visit a kitchen goods retailer.,
Choose the wire cooling rack according to size.,
Choose a material for your wire cooling rack.,
Check the quality of the wire cooling rack.,
Finished.

",How to Choose a Wire Cooling Rack for Baking," Anywhere that sells kitchen goods for baking, such as cake and muffin pans, will also sell wire cooling racks. Restaurant supply stores will also have them in stock.


Cooling racks are also sold online in kitchen goods storefronts and on auction sites.;
, What you're baking determines the size of rack. While cookies can be fitted onto a small rack easily, a cake or bread will need a rack that definitely fits their size. It's a good idea to get a few, perhaps one square or round one and one rectangular one, so that you have both enough and the right size for the particular baked item.


If you want the cooling rack to sit in a pan, be sure to take the measurements before purchasing the rack.
Another consideration for size is whether it will fit in the dishwasher and/or where you want to store it. These store easily along with cookie and baking sheets, and pizza pans, so if you already have these, estimate the size against them.

, Most wire cooling racks are metallic but there are also wooden cooling racks or chrome-plated racks. Non-stick varieties are helpful for your baked items but not essential; you can always place parchment paper (baking paper) down for any particularly sticky baked foods.


If you plan on using the wire cooling rack for draining washed food, choose one that won't rust.

, As with any purchase of kitchen essentials, be sure to check the quality. Look for neat joins right across the cooling rack, and check to see that there are no sharp or loose parts and no warping.

Use this method for cakes and pans likely to stick.,
Lightly grease with butter.,
Measure the tin with a piece of string.,
Measure the greaseproof paper with the string.,
Cut the paper in half lengthwise.,
Crease a short fold on one side of the paper.,
Cut the creased section into many segments.,
Cut out paper for the base.,
Fit the paper into the tin.",How to Line a Cake Tin1," You don’t need paper for every cake recipe. Paper is recommended for long-cooking cakes, such as fruitcakes. For most other recipes, you can save time and money by using butter and flour instead, as described below.


Regardless of recipe, use paper if your your tin has a history of sticking,;
, This will help stick the greaseproof paper (parchment paper) to the sides of the tin, making assembly easier.Because the cake batter won’t be touching the tin directly, you don’t need to do a thorough job.

, Wrap a piece of string around the cake tin. Cut the string where it wraps fully around the tin.

, Unroll your greaseproof paper and place the string over it. Cut off a piece of paper the length of the string.

, Fold this in half lengthwise, to make a long, narrow rectangle. Crease the fold with your hand. Unfold and cut along the crease. You now have two pieces of paper that can fit around your cake tin’s sides. Set aside one of them for another cake — you’ll only need one.


You can use both to double-line the cake tin, but this is usually unnecessary.

, Take the long side of the paper and fold it over about 2.5 cm (one inch). Crease this fold.

, This small folded area will rest on the base of the pan. To make it fit smoothly without crumpling, cut from the edge to the crease at 2.5 cm (one inch) intervals. You'll end up with a row of flaps.


Cut at a slight angle from the edge to make a better fit., You've prepared the paper to cover the sides. All that's left is the base. Place the tin on the paper and use a pencil to trace around it. Cut out the outline to make a piece that will cover the base.


Since the outside of the tin is larger than the inside, stay slightly within the line you traced.

, Wrap the long piece of paper around the inside walls of the tin. Push the flaps down until they are all lying flat against the base. Place the base paper onto the base of the tin, over the flaps. Press down to make sure it lies flat.


You can leave up to 5 cm (2 inches) of paper above the upper edge. This traps the heat in and browns the cake sides if it rises over the tin. Trim off any excess above that level.

Pull a rack out of the oven, grill, or broiler pan.,
Use a pizza baking stone.,
Use a cool chopping board.,
Chopsticks.",How to Find a Substitute for a Wire Cooling Rack (Baking)," Transfer cookies from the warm cookie sheet to the cold one.;
, A room temperature plate that is large enough to take the cake, cookies, bread, or pastries will work to cool them down. Put a paper towel across the plate first.


Avoid stacking the baked product or you will prevent air from circulating and the baked goods will turn soggy.

, Make sure it's clean and simply leave it out on a flat surface to place the baked items on it.


Covering the rack with parchment paper or similar can be helpful to prevent cookies or other baked items from falling or sagging through.

, If you have a pizza stone, make sure it's room temperature (not warm or hot from baking) and simply slide the baked items onto it to cool.

, Marble or granite chopping boards can be a good cool surface to cool a baked product on.

, If you're cooling a loaf of bread you can use a makeshift cooling rack out of chopsticks set side by side with enough space between them for airflow."

Cool your baking stone overnight.,
Scrape the stone.,
Soak your stone in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes.,
Scrub the stone with a cotton cloth.,
Rinse the stone.,
Allow the stone to air-dry overnight.",How to Clean a Baking Stone1," Make sure to set aside enough time for your stone to cool after you've used it. Never attempt to clean a hot or warm stone. This is important, as cold water could cause a warm or hot stone to crack.

Never pour cool or cold water on a baking stone that has just come out of the oven.;
, Use a nylon scraper to remove all debris from the stone. Slide it down the stone systematically. Pay special attention to any crust, pieces of baked goods, or pizza that might have burned on to the stone.

Make sure the scraper is sharp. You may need to purchase and use a new scraper after you’ve used one a lot.
You can buy a nylon or plastic scraper at a box store or home improvement store., Clean your sink or a basin and fill it with warm water. Slowly slide the stone into the water and allow it to sit. The warm water will loosen any food remnants or other debris on the surface of the stone.

If you can’t submerge the entire stone, make sure to rotate it periodically so the entire stone spends time under water.
Avoid letting the stone sit for too long. If the stone absorbs and retains too much moisture, it could crack next time you put it in the oven., After you've soaked the baking stone, scrub the surface with a cotton cloth. Pay special attention to any debris that may have been leftover after you scraped the stone. Almost all debris should come off after the stone has soaked., Gently place the stone in your sink and rinse it with cool water. Make sure you wash any debris off. If you need to use a cotton cloth to wipe the stone down again, feel free to do so., Before using the stone again, you'll need to make sure that it has dried completely. The best way to do this is to sit the stone out overnight and allow it to dry. That way, when you wake in the morning, your stone will likely be ready to use.

Pat the stone gently with a dry cloth before allowing it to sit overnight.

Grease the pan.,
Cut out a piece of parchment paper.,
Fold the paper along the pencil lines.,
Line the tin.",How to Line a Cake Tin2," Wipe softened butter or shortening over the interior base and sides of the pan.

, Place the tin on greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and trace around the base with a pencil. Fold up the paper on each side, up to the top of the tin. Cut out this large rectangle of paper.


If your batter isn't runny, you can use just one strip of paper instead, covering two opposite sides and the base. Leave an overhang so you can easily pull the cake out., Fold the paper just inside the pencil lines, to compensate for the thickness of the tin. Turn the paper over and fold it back the other way, so the pencil marks face down.

, Fit the paper inside the greased tin, pressing it down onto the base. Fold the corners to get them to fit, creasing them against the side.

Use this method for dry batter or odd-shaped tins.,
Decide how much to grease.,
Grease the tin with butter.,
Dust with flour.,
Tap out excess flour.",How to Line a Cake Tin3," Lining a Bundt pan with paper is not worth the effort. Grease and flour cover the crevices more effectively than paper, and are usually enough to prevent sticking. In fact, you can use this method for regular tins as well, as long as the cake batter isn't too runny.

, Most cakes do well in a fully greased tin. but there are exceptions:If there’s a buttery crust (such as graham cracker crust) touching the tin, there’s already enough fat to prevent sticking.
A light batter such as angel food or chiffon cake will rise higher (and end up fluffier) if it has an ungreased side to climb up. The flour will help with this, but you may still want to leave the upper sides ungreased.

, Soften your butter in the microwave for a few seconds if you took it straight from the fridge. Wipe the stick of butter directly onto base of the tin, or apply it with a pastry brush. Use the advice above to decide how much of the interior sides to grease.


Bundt cakes often stick where the tubes of the Bundt pan meet the base.Pay special attention to crevices and corners like these.
You can use shortening instead.
You can use a non-stick cooking spray, but cheap grocery store brands tend to be less effective. Look for a higher-quality spray or ""cake release spray"" at specialty cooking and baking stores., Sprinkle flour over the base of the tin. Hold one end of the pan and tap the other end repeatedly. This will shunt excess flour over the base, covering the whole area.Rotate the tin and repeat to cover the sides.


Substitute cocoa powder for dark-colored cakes. This isn't necessary if you plan to frost the cake.

, Angle the tin downward and tap out extra flour. If there are any gaps on the surface, cover them with more grease and flour.

Create a baking soda paste.,
Spread the paste.,
Scrub the paste into the surface of the stone.,
Remove the paste with your scraper.,
Rinse and wipe down the stone.,
Allow the stone to air-dry overnight after cleaning.",How to Clean a Baking Stone2," In a small bowl, pour ½ cup (170 grams) of baking soda and 3 tablespoons (15 ml) of warm water. Mix the baking soda and water vigorously. The mixture should resemble a paste-like substance after a little mixing.

You should only use cooking grade baking soda. Avoid using laundry baking soda or baking soda with any sort of scent., Spread the baking soda paste over the entire surface of the baking stone. Make sure to pay special attention to dirty spots. Allow the paste to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.

The paste might appear to dry after 5 minutes – this is okay., After you let it sit, take a clean cloth and scrub in small circles. In addition to the chemical reaction created by the baking soda, its abrasive character should help remove debris and stains.

Use a toothbrush if you need more abrasive power., Take the plastic or nylon scraper and work systematically to remove the paste from your baking stone. Make sure to get as much as you can, as you’ll need to remove it all before you use the stone in the oven., After you've scraped off any remaining paste, you'll need to rinse and wipe the stone again. Do this by running the stone under cool water and wiping it with a damp cloth., You'll need to let the stone sit out and dry for at least one night before you use it again. This is important as the stone could crack if you put it in the oven when it is still wet.

Think about patting the stone with a dry cloth before letting it sit overnight.

"
"
Allow your stone to dry fully before using it.,
Don’t leave your stone in the oven during the self-cleaning cycle.,
Avoid using soap.",How to Clean a Baking Stone3," Whenever your stone gets wet, you should allow a lot of time to lapse before you use it in the oven. This is important, as wet stones could crack in the oven.

Pat your stone with a clean cloth after wetting it.
Place your stone on a drying rack overnight.
Check to see your stone is wet before you use it. If it is, put it aside for another 6 to 12 hours., While you may think that extreme heat in the oven will burn off debris and help clean your stone, you could wind up damaging or splitting your stone.Always check inside your oven before starting a self-cleaning cycle.

, You should never use soap to clean your baking stone. Because baking stones are permeable, they will absorb soap into them. Soap will be very difficult to get out and may alter the taste of baked goods you make in the future.

Don’t place your baking stone in the dish washer.
Try not to put your baking stone in the sink with other dirty dishes."

Know the difference between liquid and dry measures, and use the appropriate one for each task.,
Use a liquid measure for liquids, such as water, milk or oil.,
Use a dry measure for powders, such as sugar, salt, and baking powder.,
Measure a liquid in a measuring spoon by filling it full.

,
Use measuring spoons for dry ingredients by filling and then leveling with the straight edge of a spatula or knife.,
Measure a ""heaping"" or ""rounded"" tablespoon, teaspoon, or (less frequently) cup.,
Measure a ""scant"" cup or spoon by filling the measure not completely full, or by shaking or pouring a little bit out.,
Add measurements if you don't have a measure that size.",How to Use Measuring Spoons and Cups," While they hold the same volume, they are used differently. Measurements are labeled on each measure.;
, Fill the cup to the appropriate line, place it on a level surface, and read it with your eye at the level of the liquid. Water surface curves downward, so use the bottom of the curve for accurate measurement and not the edge that is against the measuring cup. This is helpful for bread recipes in which the exact amount of water is crucial.

, Spoon or scoop the powder lightly into the cup. Run a knife or spatula across the top to level the surface and scrape any excess back into the jar or canister.

,, Many baking powder cans come with a built-in edge for leveling. In a pinch, you can also use the edge of the lid.

, This quantity is not so precise, but it is generally a moderately sized, round mound, or heap of the dry ingredient in addition to that which fills the spoon.

, Again, this is an imprecise measurement.

, For instance, 1 3/4 teaspoons is 1 teaspoon plus 1/2 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon.

Wrap your thumb and index finger around the handle.,
Curl the other fingers onto the handle.,
Keep your hand firm.",How to Hold a Knife1," Place your thumb just beneath the bolster of the handle. Wrap your index finger around the handle from the other side of the knife. Bend both fingers closer together until they meet.


Note that the bolster is the blunt piece of metal in between the sharp portion of the blade and the handle of the knife.
The handle grip is the option most beginner cooks naturally gravitate toward and it typically feels more natural than the blade grip. It also works well for cooks with unusually small hands. On the other hand, this grip style causes the wrist to fall out of alignment with the palm and fingers, thereby limiting the amount of control you have with the knife.;
, Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky finger all the way around the handle, keeping them aligned with your index finger.









Hold your fingers close together to provide the greatest amount of grip and force. Ideally, there should be no visible space in between your fingers while they are gripping the knife.

, Cut food while keeping a firm grip around the handle. No finger should move beyond the bolster as you cut.









Many beginning cooks have the habit of extending the index finger over the blunt top edge of the knife while cutting. Doing so is ill-advised, however. The index finger alone does not provide enough force to help control the blade, and this finger can actually become sore while you chop if you hold it in this manner."

Use bubble wrap.,
Try cardboard.,
Make use of other materials.",How to Dispose of Knives Safely1," If you're going to throw your knife away, bubble wrap is your best option. This safely coats the blade, preventing injury and accident during disposal.


You might want to wrap the knife in butcher paper first. Then, wrap the knife in a few layers of bubble wrap.If necessary, wrap a layer of duct tape around the bubble wrap to keep it secure.;
, You should consider adding an additional layer of cardboard when disposing of a knife. Place it in an old shoebox or other cardboard container before throwing it out. This may also be effective if you plan on donating the knife., If you do not have cardboard or bubble wrap, you can use newspaper, old clothes, socks, or any material you can easily wrap around the blade. Simply wrap the knife in a few layers of your chosen materials. If necessary, wrap some tape around the material to keep the knife in place.

Wipe the knife clean right after each use.,
Clean with the blade pointed away from you.,
Soak the knife for a minute or two if food is stuck on.,
Dry the knife.",How to Clean a Knife1," Kitchen knives will be harder to clean if you allow debris to get stuck on. After using a knife, quickly run the knife under water. Allow any food or debris to brush off and drain down the sink. If there's anything stuck on the knife, quickly wipe it down with a sponge or dish towel. Set the knife aside until you're ready to do dishes., Once you're ready to clean the knife, use a mild dish soap. Be careful to clean the knife with the blade pointing away from you to avoid injury.


Lather a sponge in warm, soapy water. With the blade pointing away from you, gently clean the knife until you remove all food and stains.Be careful not to scrub too fast. If you scrub vigorously or quickly, the knife could slip and you could end up getting cut. Some people feel more comfortable lying the knife on a flat counter top and scrubbing the sides one at a time. This can make injury less likely., Sometimes, food will end up stuck on a kitchen knife despite your best efforts. In this case, soak the blade in shallow water for a minute or two. After this, you should be able to scrub away the food. Do not soak a knife longer than one or two minutes as this can cause rust., Always dry your knife with a dry, clean towel immediately after cleaning. Knives should not air dry as this can cause rust. Dry the knife with the blade facing away from you, just as you did when washing the knife."

Choose a cutting board.,
Secure the cutting board.,
Use the right knife for the job.,
Keep the knife sharp.",How to Chop Food Like a Pro1," You can choose cutting boards made from wood, bamboo, or plastic. Plastic is lightweight and easy to store, but it can be difficult to clean. You'll need to discard any plastic cutting boards that develop knife scars or ridges. Wood cutting boards have natural antiseptic properties that can help keep them clean. You can also use bamboo, but since it's harder than wood, it may dull your knives faster.Avoid chopping on metal, glass, or stone cutting boards. These can dull your knives.
Consider getting two cutting boards. Use one to chop vegetables or fruit and use the other to chop meat.;
, If you choose to use a plastic cutting board or your work surface is a little slick, you'll need to prevent the cutting board from slipping around. This could cause the knife to slip and cut you. To keep the cutting board in place, lay a damp cloth on the work surface. Set the cutting board directly on the cloth. The board should not slide around.








You could also use non-slip mats, wet paper towels, or poster putty underneath the cutting board.

, Most knife sets include a variety of knives that you'll use for different kitchen jobs. To chop, you'll usually want to use an 8 to 10-inch (20 to 25 cm) chef's knife. It has a slight curve, so you can rock the knife back and forth as you quickly chop. The knife should feel a little heavy and balanced when you hold it.








Don't chop food with small knives (like paring knives) since the knife could become stuck in the food or you may cut yourself.
Avoid using it for small jobs, like peeling food or cutting bread.

, Professional chefs sharpen their blades every day because they use them so often. Be in the habit of sharpening your knife blade using a sharpening stone since dull knives are more likely to slip while you're using them. This can increase your risk of cutting yourself. If you don't feel comfortable sharpening your own knives, you can send your knives away to a professional sharpening service.









If the knife blade has been bent off center because of frequent use, you can also use a honing steel to push the blade back into balance."
"
Always cut on a cutting board.,
Sharpen and hone your knife regularly.,
Keep your knife clean while you're using it.",How to Maintain Your Kitchen Knife1," Using marble, granite, or any other solid surface is too hard and unyielding for a kitchen knife. This can dull your knife much more quickly.


Choose a wooden cutting board instead of one made of plastic or any hard, solid material, such as glass.;
, You should sharpen your knife annually. Honing is similar to sharpening, but it focuses more on removing nicks and recalibrating the angle of the blade. You should hone more often than you sharpen.


Some ways that you can sharpen your knife include: using an electric sharpener, sending it to a professional, or using a sharpening stone.
You can find more specific instructions on how to sharpen your knife at this website: http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/knife-skills-how-to-sharpen-a-knife.html.

, While cutting, frequently rinse it off with hot water and wipe it clean to keep food from building up on the blade. This prevents the blade from dulling and working less efficiently."

Pinch the base of the blade.,
Position your middle finger behind the bolster.,
Rest the remaining fingers on the handle.,
Keep everything loose.",How to Hold a Knife2," Grab the blade in between your thumb and index finger. Keep these fingers positioned at the point where the blade connects to the handle.








If desired, you can pinch the base of the blade with your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Some cooks find this position easier to work with than one utilizing only the thumb and index finger.
When using a knife with a notably thin blade, like a utility knife or a boning knife, it might be easier to pinch the base of the blade with your thumb and middle finger while resting the index finger over the blunt top of the blade.
Overall, the professional grip offers greater accuracy and control while cutting.

, Bend the middle finger just behind the bolster of the knife. It should curl all the way around the top of the knife handle.









The bolster is the blunt metal strip connecting the blade to the handle.
When pinching the blade with both the index and middle finger, you will need to position the ring finger behind the bolster.

, Lightly wrap the remaining fingers around the handle of the knife, bending them all the way around the knife without gripping the handle tightly.









These fingers are positioned around the handle for the purpose of support. All of the actual strength used should be channeled into the fingers pinching the blade.

, Your grip should remain just firm enough to hold the knife. Use as little force as possible to accomplish that task while cutting.









Gripping the knife with too much force can cause tension to build in your hand. When that happens, your hand is more likely to tire out, and the accuracy, safety, and speed of your cuts will diminish as a result.

"
"
Grab the knife in your dominant hand.,
Hold the food with curled fingertips.,
Guide the knife with your knuckles.",How to Hold a Knife3," Pick up the knife and hold it using either the handle or blade grip.









Your dominant hand—the one you write with, etc.—should be the same hand used for holding and operating the knife. Your non-dominant hand will be responsible for guiding the knife during the process.
The blade grip is recommended if you feel comfortable with it, but this guiding technique can be used with both the blade and handle grips.

, Place the food being cut on top of your cutting board. Hold it in place with your fingertips.









Place your fingertips on the top surface of the food, then curl or bend your fingers slightly so that the fingertips are hidden beneath your knuckles. Holding ingredients in this manner will keep them stable while also minimizing the risk of cutting yourself.Due to the way the non-dominant hand looks, this is often referred to as the “claw” cutting position.
The food should be held in a stable position. Ideally, you should place it on the board with the flat side down. When there is no natural flat side, it is usually well-advised to begin by cutting off a portion or slice to create a flat space. That flat space should then remain face down on the board for the rest of the process.

, As you cut with the knife, try to guide the blade with the knuckles of your non-dominant hand.









Bring the blade down to the food and hold it at that level for the entire cutting process.
Before you actually begin to cut, lightly press the top knuckles of your index and middle finger to the smooth, flat side of the blade.
While cutting, gradually ease your entire hand back as you move the knife along the length of the food. Your knuckles should stay in contact with the blade the entire time.

"
"
Hold the knife in your dominant hand.,
Point the tip of the knife down.,
Press on the tip with your free hand.,
Rock the blade up and down.",How to Hold a Knife4," Grab the knife in your dominant hand using the blade or handle grip.









You will use your dominant (writing) hand to hold the knife while guiding the direction of the knife with your non-dominant hand.
The blade grip is recommended here, but this technique also works well enough with the handle grip.

, Place the tip of the blade directly on the cutting board.









The ingredient you plan to mince should be positioned beneath the sharp edge of the blade. The tip of the blade should lie completely past the bulk of the ingredient.

, Hold the tip of the blade in place with two or three fingers.









Use your index and middle fingers for most circumstances. If it feels more comfortable to use three fingers, place your ring finger on top of the blade, as well.
Apply enough force with your fingers to keep the blade steady without making it totally immobile.

, To finely mince an ingredient, use your dominant hand to lift the blade up and down while keeping the tip steady with your non-dominant hand. The result should be a distinctive rocking motion.









While rocking the blade up and down, you will also need to gradually move it from side to side.
As you rock the blade, it should run through the bulk of the ingredient at small intervals, creating a rough mince. The longer you rock the blade, the finer the mince will become.

Place the wrapped knife in a cardboard box and throw it away.,
Recycle the knife.,
Contact a professional knife-sharpener.,
Consider donation.,
Sell it for scrap metal.",How to Dispose of Knives Safely2," If you're intent on throwing away the knife, place it in a box before throwing it out. Make sure to seal the box with duct tape before tossing it in the garbage. This minimizes the risk of injury to your garbage person., If your local recycling center accepts metal, you can recycle a knife. If you're unsure about your recycling center's policies, call during business hours and ask. Make sure your knives are wrapped and secure before recycling them., Even if you no longer have use for the knife, it may be worth your time to contact a professional knife-sharpener. Check the yellow pages and the internet to see if you can find a knife-sharpener in your area. A knife-sharpener may be interested in purchasing an old knife as it can be repurposed and used in repairs., You might also want to donate the knife. Even if the blade is dull, someone may be interested in purchasing it to sharpen and re-use. Check with local businesses like Goodwill and the Salvation Army to see if they take knives as donations., Try to figure out what kind of metal your knife is made out of. Most knives are made of steel, iron, or some mixture of metals. Depending on the metal type, you may be able to sell it for scrap. Look online or in your yellow pages and make some phone calls. See if anyone is interested in buying your old knife for scrap."

Wear rubber gloves.,
Gather necessary materials.,
Open the knife completely.,
Scrub the knife with dish detergent.,
Remove rust.,
Dry the knife and apply lubricant.",How to Clean a Knife2," When cleaning a pocket knife, you should always wear rubber gloves. They protect your hands from getting cut by the blade. You'll also be using certain oils or cleaners that can cause skin irritation. You can buy rubber gloves at most supermarkets., You'll need certain supplies to clean a pocket knife. Get the materials ready before you begin the cleaning process.


For the initial washing, use mild dish detergent. The soap you use for day-to-day dish washing is probably fine. Just do not use dish soap intended to be used in a dishwasher as it's too harsh for knives and can cause rust and other damage.You'll need some kind of household lubricant to remove rust. WD-40 tends to work well on pocket knives. You'll also need household oil to lubricate the knife after washing. You should be able to find household lubricant and oil at a hardware store.You will need a soft sponge or a toothbrush for the initial washing. To deal with rust, a nylon pad is necessary. You'll also need a soft, clean cloth to dry the knife when you finish cleaning., When you're ready to clean a pocket knife, open the knife completely. Some pocket knives, like Swiss Army knives, might have multiple utensils attached. Make sure the knife is completely open so all portions are cleaned.

, First, spot clean the knife with regular dish detergent and a sponge. Lather the sponge in warm, soapy water and clean off the blades of the knife. If you notice anything stuck on the knife, squirt dish detergent directly on the spot, let it sit for a few minutes, and then resume scrubbing., If you have rust that needs removing, use the household lubricant. Spray all rusty areas and let the lubricant sit on for one minute. Then, take your nylon pad and scrub the blade until the rust disappears. You may need to add additional household lubricant on stubborn spots. Once you are done, rinse the knife off with clean running water., Dry your knife off with a clean cloth. Then, add a few drops of the household lubricant to the knife. Rub in with another dry cloth until the knife is shiny and clean in appearance."

Do not leave knives in the kitchen sink.,
Dry knives immediately after washing.,
Avoid the dishwasher, especially on expensive knives.,
Store quality knives in their own space separate from the utensil drawer.",How to Clean a Knife3," You should never leave a knife in the kitchen sink. It's a safety issue as you could get cut reaching into the dish water. Knives are also susceptible to damage and rust if immersed in water for too long. Place dirty knives beside the kitchen sink., As stated, leaving knives wet can increase their likelihood of rusting. Always dry your knives immediately after cleaning them., Knives do not do well in the dishwasher. The blade can get dinged and damaged during the washing cycle. Dishwasher detergent is also highly acidic and can cause premature rusting., Quality kitchen knives should not be stored in the utensil drawer. They can bump against other silverware, causing scratches and other damage. Invest in a kitchen board to store your knives or keep them in a separate drawer. If you do store your knives in the utensil drawer, cover them in leather sheaths."
"
Hold your chef's knife with your dominant hand.,
Form a claw with your subordinate hand.,
Protect the thumb on your subordinate hand.",How to Chop Food Like a Pro2," Use your dominant hand to grip the handle of the knife with your index finger and thumb on the blade. Your finger and thumb should be in front of the bolster, the thick part of the blade where it meets the handle. Try not to lay your index finger across the top of the blade. Gripping the blade will give you more control as you chop.








While you can still chop while completely holding the handle with your entire hand, you won't have the best range of movement.
The index finger and thumb should look like they're pinching the sides of the blade.

, The hand that's not holding the knife should hold the food that you're cutting steady. To prevent the knife from cutting your subordinate hand, curve your fingertips in towards your palm, so your hand forms a claw. Set your clawed hand on the food you're cutting, so the food can't move or slide.








This might not feel natural when you start practicing, but it's the best way to prevent kitchen accidents.

, It's important to tuck in the thumb of your helping hand, so you're less likely to cut it. The knuckles on your thumb and fingertips should be closer to the knife blade than the fingertips. This way, your knife will simply bump against the knuckles instead of cutting the fingertips if you chop quickly.








Practice keeping your thumb tucked in. If you notice your thumb sticking out while you're cutting, stop and tuck your thumb in again. Practice while going a little slower until it becomes a habit.

"
"
Practice the cross chop.,
Learn the tap chop.,
Try the rock chop.",How to Chop Food Like a Pro3," If you're just learning to chop, the cross chop is a great and safe technique. Place the food you want to chop on your cutting board and hold your chef's knife with your dominant hand. Open your subordinate hand and lay the palm where it meets the fingers on top of the blade. Keep your fingers open and out while the other hand rocks the blade to roughly chop the food. Continue to chop the food until it's the size you want.








The cross chop is good for chopping foods that will cook down, since the pieces may not be uniform.

, If you'd chop something into slices, hold the item steady with the thumb of your subordinate hand. Extend your fingers towards the end of the food where you'll begin slicing. Curl those fingertips in to protect them from the blade. Raise the blade straight up and bring it straight back down to make a slice. Continue to slowly bring the blade up and tap it back down as you walk your fingertips back.








Keep your thumb away from the blade and continue to hold the food steady.
You won't be rocking the blade as you tap chop.

, To finely chop or mince fresh herbs or small items (like garlic), chop the food for a few seconds, so it's roughly chopped. Gather the food together and lay the fingertips of your subordinate hand on the end of the blade. Use the handle of the knife to rock the blade up and down. The subordinate hand should steady the blade as it rocks. Keep scooping the food into a pile, so you can rock chop it until it's as fine as you'd like.








The rock chop works well with a chef's knife because the blade is slightly curved. This makes it easy to rock the blade as it chops.

Never wash your knife in the dishwasher.,
Don’t leave your knife in the sink.",How to Maintain Your Kitchen Knife2," The heat, moisture, and detergent can dull the knife blade and cause discoloration. Also, knives will sometimes get chipped from rattling around with other dishes in the dishwasher., You should always hand-wash your knife with mild soap and hot water immediately after use to avoid corrosion, scratching, bending, or breaking.If needed, you can let your knife soak in soapy, warm water temporarily after use and before washing. Don't leave it in for more than a few minutes.
Immediately after washing your knife, dry it with a hand towel.If you let your knife air-dry, it will be susceptible to molding or rusting.
When your knife is sharing space with other utensils in the drying rack, it is also more likely to dull."
"
Don’t keep your knife in a drawer with other utensils.,
Store your knives in a kitchen knife block.,
Keep your knife on a magnetic strip.",How to Maintain Your Kitchen Knife3," Breaking, chipping, and dulling are more likely to happen when your knife is stored freely.


If you store your knives in a drawer, invest in a set of knife blade covers to minimize contact with other utensils., This is the most common storage choice. Many knife sets will come with a block, but you can also purchase an empty knife block to store your knives in. This option is safe, allows you to keep all of your knives in one place, and also can help knives keep their edge longer.


If you get your knife block separately from your knife set, you may discover that many of your knives don’t fit in the pre-sized slots., Mount a magnetic knife rack on a wall in your kitchen and store your knives vertically. This method keeps your knives easily accessible while being safely off the counter. Most importantly, magnetic knife racks keep your knife blades stable.


Magnetic knife racks aren’t a possible storage option if your knives are ceramic."

Research brands that you're interested in.,
Once you have a few sets in mind, locate a cutlery store in your area.,
Found a set you like?",How to Choose the Right Knives for Your Kitchen," There are benefits to both. When you buy an entire set, it usually costs less than buying the pieces individually and you get a nice block to store it in. When you buy individually, you have more control over what you're buying and can only buy the pieces you need.;
, Bread knives and paring knives come in handy as well. A cleaver will make life easier if you cook a lot of meat.

, Look them up online and get a good idea of what the sets you like are going to cost. Make sure you go to a site like Amazon that has a lot of review to see what others have to say about the knives you're interested in. One unhappy person shouldn't make or break your decision, especially if there are a lot of other reviews. Hundreds of unhappy people are a good indicator you should look somewhere else.

, Go to the store and check out the knives in person. This is an important step and should not be skipped. You need to actually hold the knives and see how they feel. If they're uncomfortable in the store, they're going to be even more uncomfortable after a long day cooking. Some stores even have demo knives that they will let you cut food items with.

, Now it's time to find the best price. The cutlery stores probably don't have the best price on the set you want, but they may be willing to match or beat the prices you found on the Internet. Prices are almost always negotiable. If the cutlery store isn't willing to work with you, the big-box retailers are usually willing to be advertised prices. If you can't find a better deal in a brick and mortar store, go home and order it online. Just be aware that it can be a hassle returning defective items to some of these places.

Choose a store that stocks a variety of chef's knives.,
Decide on the kind of blade you want.,
Decide on the handle that best fits your hand.,
Determine the price you want to pay for the chef's knife.",How to Buy a Chef's Knife,"


Choosing a chef's knife is a hands-on activity. Find a store that allows you to hold the knife in your hand. Preferably, the store should give you the opportunity to cut food with the knives you are considering.
Knowledgeable salespeople can be a great asset when deciding on a knife. They should be able to answer any questions you have and help to guide you to the knife that fits you the best.;
,


The majority of chef's knife blades are made of high carbon stainless steel. These are durable and hold their edge well (unlike non-carbon stainless steel) and do not discolor (unlike non-stainless high carbon steel). Titanium blades hold their edges well, but can be a little too flexible for typical chef's knife applications. Ceramic blades will hold their edges extremely long, but are brittle and can break much easier than a steel blade.
Blades are created either by being stamped or forged. Forged blades, those that are poured into a mold, are considered more durable and flexible than those that are stamped. Stamped blades, those that are cut from a sheet of steel much like a cut-out cookie, are considered inferior. Recent laser cutting technology, however, has produced some stamped blades that can rival a forged blade.
Chef's knives are usually range from 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.4 cm) long, with the 8-inch (20.3 cm) size being the most popular. Trying different sized knives will help you determine which size you prefer.
The shape of the blade will determine the rocking motion that is the trademark of a chef's knife. Some blades have a more pronounced curve from the base of the blade to the tip, which causes a larger rocking motion. Again, only using a knife will tell you what works best for you.

,


Holding a knife in your hand is the only way to know if you will feel comfortable using it. Knife grips are made of different materials, shaped in diverse ways and balance the knives differently. What feels good in your hand may not to someone else.
The tang is the part of the knife that holds the handle to the blade. It is commonly believed that a full tang--one that runs the entire length of the handle--is preferable to a partial tang. Knives with partial tangs run the risk of having the handle loosen with use.
Using a knife in the store will enable you to make sure that your knuckles will not hit into the cutting surface while using the knife. A wider blade may be needed if this is a problem for you.
When using a chef's knife, the hand not holding the knife is often resting on the spine of the blade--the part of the blade opposite to the edge--which is usually squared off. Testing a knife will help you determine whether the spine is comfortable for that hand.

,


Although there are some high quality knives on the lower end of the price scale, chef's knives can be very expensive. But, by treating the knife as an investment and caring for it properly, a chef's knife can last a lifetime.

Clean your knives after each use.,
Sanitize the knife.,
Skip the dishwasher.,
Keep clean knives dry and oiled.",How to Care For Your Kitchen Knives2," Wash the knife individually while holding the knife so that the top of the blade is pointed away from you. Avoid submerging knives completely underwater and instead use a dishcloth to gently wipe the blade: the dull top side first and then the sharper edge.For a deeper, slightly more aggressive clean, use a sponge instead of a dishcloth.
To prevent hurting yourself while you clean your knife, consider setting the knife on the flat surface of a countertop and wash the knife one side at a time., Wipe knives clean with an alcohol wipe or wash and rinse clean before and after food preparation., It might be tempting to wash knives the easier route with whatever dishes you place in your dishwasher, but due to the humidity, excess water, heat, and harsh detergent, rust and decay for your knives can be a consequence of its use.Knives may also chip within packed dishwashers as a result of objects rubbing against its blade.
Washing your knives by hand ensures a gentle, targeted clean.

, Dry the knife with the same method as you did with cleaning, with the blade pointed away and from top to edge. Apply mineral knives to kitchen knives, particularly carbon kitchen knives, are vital to overall maintenance.


To prevent rust from eating away at the blade and creating contamination, oil your blade with mineral-grade oil 2-3 times a year.
Mineral grade oil can also be used to clean knives by wiping a cloth with oil and using it as a cleaner.

Sharpen your knives.,
Saturate the whetstone.,
Position the stone so that its shorter side is parallel to the end of the counter.,
Apply moderate pressure and drag the knife forward.,
Hone, or steel, your knives after sharpening for alignment.,
Test the sharpness of your knife by doing some vegetable prep.",How to Care For Your Kitchen Knives3," There are a variety of ways this can be done, but the most common ways are using a diamond stone or a whetstone, or water stone. Follow up with a honing steel to align the knife.

, Wet your whetstones, or water stones, by submerging them into water for at least 45 minutes. The surface of the water stone has to be wet while the knife is being sharpened against them.Keep a bowl of water nearby to moisten the stone as needed.
Allow mud to build up on the surface of the water stone. This will benefit the sharpening process by creating an abrasion for the knife’s edge to grind against.

, Hold the edge and the handle of the knife against the surface of the stone.Use your free hand to hold the blade of the knife steady.
Ensure that both of your hands are at a 15-20 degree angle as you prepare to make the first stroke.

, The knife should be sharpened against the grain and slid slowly and evenly towards you and the edge of the counter. The knife should be flat against the water stone and at a constant 15-20 degree angle.At the end of the stroke, the tip of the knife blade should be the last point remaining on the stone.
Once the tip of the knife touches the bottom of the water stone, reset the motions, and begin the stroke again.Repeat the action several times. When one side is thoroughly sharpened, turn over the knife to work the other side against the water stone.
Have your knives sharpened at least once a year, depending upon use.

, To steel a blade, hold the knife flat against a surface and slide it along, gradually raising the back of the blade until it begins to cut into the surface. From there, take your steel in one hand, and hold the back corner of the knife's edge to the end of the steel closest to you.


""Sweep"" the blade towards the tip of the steel, making sure that all of the length of the blade comes in contact with the steel.
Do this “sweeping” technique against the honing steel ten times for each side of the blade.

, Access its efficacy, its level of resistance, its precision in making really thin cuts, etc. If it needs to be sharpened more, start the sharpening process over again until you have the slice you like."

Place a sauce pan on the stove.,
Place a smaller pan or mixing bowl on top.,
Pour water into the large pan.,
Heat water to a simmer.,
Heat the ingredients in the smaller container.,
Remove the small container from the heat.",How to Make a Double Boiler (Bain Marie)1," Choose a medium or large sauce pan to form the base of your double boiler. This should be relatively tall, especially if you'll be using the double boiler for a recipe with a long cooking time.;
, This can be any heat-proof container that fits snugly over the sauce pan, so most of the steam is trapped between them. There should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between the bases of the two containers, and preferably more.


Aluminum, copper, and (non-stainless) steel all conduct heat quickly. These will provide the shortest cooking time and prevent hot spots from forming.Stainless steel, heat-proof glass, and ceramic are best if you are cooking acidic ingredients, since they are non-reactive. They conduct heat more slowly, so be sure to stir frequently to avoid hot spots. Glass also makes it easy to check on the water level.

, Set aside the smaller container now that you've confirmed it fits. Fill the larger pan with about 1–3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) of water, but make sure there is plenty of space between the water and the smaller container. If the two pans fit tightly together and there is not enough space between them, the steam buildup could cause an explosion.Although an explosion is very unlikely, the risk increases for recipes with long cooking times. For these recipes, use containers that do not fit perfectly together, so steam can escape through the gap between them. Lift the pan to allow steam to escape if it starts to rattle.
The longer the cooking time your recipe calls for, the more water you'll need.

, Place the larger pot on the stove and heat until boiling. Reduce heat to medium-low until the water reaches a steady simmer.


Leave the smaller pot on the counter while you wait for the water to boil. If you heat it along with the larger one, the hot surface could burn your ingredients when you add them., Place your ingredients in the smaller container, then place the container over the simmering pot. Cook as directed in your recipe. Stir the ingredients to ensure they heat evenly.


Despite the name, a double boiler should stay at a low simmer. Reduce heat if the water starts to boil, and add a little hot water if it starts to boil low.
If the sauce starts to seize up or stick to the pan, just pick up the smaller container and whisk for a minute to reduce the temperature., Remember that there is trapped steam in the double boiler, and that the base of the small container is very hot. Use pot holders or oven mitts, and tilt the container toward you so steam escapes on the opposite side.

Generally speaking, you should use manual techniques for long, flimsy, and thin blades. Sanding machines work best for the larger ones.;
, An industrial belt grinder is the most effective, but a heavy belt sander can also work. You may want to consider using an orbit sander, as these are common tools and will be easier to control than a belt sander.Regular sandpaper may tear or lose its grit easily when dulling a metal blade. Emery can be used, but silicon carbide or aluminum oxide paper is preferred in a relatively coarse grit, like 40 or 50.

, Wear gloves and a mask to prevent metal shaving from harming your hands and eyes. Be sure the belt of the sander is running away from you. This way, if you lose your grip on the blade, it isn't launched in your direction. Then:


Position the blade above the top of the running sander. Slowly turn the blade into the sanding belt, so tip of the edge of the knife descends to the belt.
Keep a firm hold of the knife, so the motion of the belt doesn't fling the knife from your hand. Allow the sander to run against the tip of the knife to blunt it.
Alternate sides of your knife, so that your blade is dulled regularly on each side. Be careful when switching sides that your clothing does not get caught in the sander.
The motion and the angle of pressure you use with your knife will feel like you are folding the tip of the edge of the blade over., If using a handheld sander or sandpaper to dull your edge, you should clamp your knife extremely tightly in a vise. You may want to remove the knife from its casing so that you can clamp the entire blade in the vise. A loose clamp may result in the knife flying free and doing harm or damage. After the knife is secured:


If you have a directional sander, make sure the belt is running away from you. This way, if the blade comes free of the vise, there's less chance of personal injury.
Slowly lower your sander to the tip of the edge of the blade. Try to approach your blade on a slight angle.
Alternate sides of the blade. It may take some time before you notice your edge start to blunt.
Much like using a stationary sander, this motion will feel like you are folding over the tip of the edge of the blade., While blunting your blade, it's likely that small burrs in the metal have formed. In some cases, slight imperfections may have formed during the dulling process. Run your file back and forth over both sides of the blade to remove burrs, shavings, and smooth the finish of the blade.


If you notice visible irregularities in the metal, you may want to pay special attention to these spots with your file until the knife looks regular and smooth., Run your finger perpendicular to the blade so it brushes against the metal left to right and right to left of the blade. Use caution when doing this. It's possible that you missed a spot while dulling the blade, and you could cut yourself if you're not careful. If the blade has dulled acceptably, use a dab of metal polish to restore the blades appearance. If the blade still feels sharp, it may need another pass with the sander. You may need to replace your sandpaper several times during this process, especially if you have to perform this procedure several times.

Before setting out to purchase knives, consider the type of knife you will need in your kitchen.,
When buying knives, hold each knife in your hand.,
Look at how much steel is in the knife as well as where it is located.,
Feel the weight of the knife.,
Examine the balance of the knife.,
Look at the hilt of the knife.,
Consider the material the handle is made from.,
Consider the blade itself and what it is made of.,
Look at the width of the cutting edge.,
Maintain your knives in good, sharp condition.,
Focus more on quality and not brand.,
Store your knives carefully.,
Shop around for your knives.",How to Select Quality Kitchen Knives," Available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, kitchen knives can meet a huge variety of needs, and the extent of knives needed depends on your cooking style and habits.


A good basic kit for an average domestic kitchen would include:

An all-purpose utility knife (13cm / 5 inches) – used for a range of foods; often a choice for the first knife as it can do many things.
A chef's knife (20-23cm / 7.8–9 inches) – used for chopping, dicing, mincing, and cutting.
A vegetable or paring knife (8cm / 3"") – used for peeling, cutting, and trimming small items of food that you hold in the hand (such as trimming small potatoes).
A bread knife (serrated) – used for bread, cake, fruit, and tomatoes.
A cleaver – used for meat, and a smaller version for chopping herbs, etc. Only buy if you need to chop serious pieces of meat.
A filleting knife – helps to fillet fish. Only buy if you intend on filleting; most people don't bother anymore but buy food ready filleted.
A carving knife – used for getting thin and even slices of meat from roasts, full roasted poultry, etc.
Sharpening steel, knife-honing stone, or electric honer.


Quite often you can buy a knife set which may contain much or all of this range; often these will be cheaper than buying them individually, but the same rules outlined in the following steps should still apply to picking a good set of kitchen knives. Also, the risk with buying a cheap or prepackaged box set is that you might not like the feel of each knife in the set, or grow to dislike the brand, whereas if you had trialled simply one knife first, you can quickly change to another brand if that one doesn't work for you.;
, If you are going to be using this tool, the grip should be comfortable and sit well in your hand. Be aware that what one person finds comfortable does not necessarily mean it will be comfortable for you, so while advice is helpful, do a first hand test for yourself.

, Look for any signs of joining or welding, particularly in the hilt of the knife. This is a weak point in the knife and should be avoided as weak knives are more likely to bend or break at this joining point. The best knives are made from a single piece of steel, hand-forged (although these are rare and often cost prohibitive), while cheap knives tend to be thin with insubstantial hilts and handles covered thickly in plastic.

, A lightweight chopper is good for speed and precision, whereas a heavy knife requires far more work in using it for chopping a lot of light ingredients. However, the opposite applies where solid foods such as nuts, fresh ginger, palm sugar and other harder ingredients are being chopped; for these, a heavy knife is ideal.

, Quality knives tend to have very good balance with not too much weight either in the blade or the handle. The old fashioned way to test is to place your finger at the finger grip at the hilt or blade-end of the handle, holding the knife horizontally with the cutting edge down. A quality, well balanced knife will balance at that point and not fall off your finger. Naturally, utmost care should be taken when doing this test! Only very expensive and high quality manufacturers consider the balance so most knives will simply fall off your finger.


The key reason to consider balance is that a well balanced knife makes any cutting action easier and requires less effort. It is essentially the leverage point – like a seesaw's balance – and it has to be at a specific point or it is unbalanced. If you are using the knife a lot for large quantities of ingredients, a balanced knife offers far less strain on the arm.

, It should be solid, easy to clean and well joined. For most knives it is the most solid part of the knife as it is like a conduit where the strain of pressing on the handle travels through into the blade. If it is thin, is not evident (such as covered in plastic), or there is evidence of a weld or join, then it is not a good sign. If you can see any gap, not only will this increase the weakness of the knife but it can also trap minute portions of food and breed bacteria.

, The handle is often made of wood, plastic, toughened resins and other strong materials. Old fashioned bone handled knives are not a good choice as bone becomes brittle after time. There have been several cases where an antique knife's bone or wood handle has crumbled in the user's hand, causing injury. Low density or soft woods or other low density materials are not recommended for knife handles.

, Arguably the best knife blade is ceramic as it can be sharpened to scalpel quality, hold its sharpness for a long time and does not rust. The key drawback is this type of knife is extremely fragile and can break with ease – and good ones are often prohibitively expensive. Cheap ceramic knives should be viewed with high caution.


Good knives are often made of non-stainless steel (carbon steel), which gives a good edge fairly quickly, but care should be taken so they will not rust. Carbon steel knives are easy to sharpen at home but need vigilance to prevent rusting.
Stainless steel is what many cheap modern knife blades are made of, but they often tend to go blunt quickly and take a very long time to sharpen again. Aim to purchase high-carbon stainless steel knives; they require sharpening but they won't rust. With less carbon content than rust-prone older carbon steel knives, these ones hold their edge better and are harder.If you're on a budget, an inexpensive stainless steel is a good choice until you can afford a high-carbon stainless steel knife.
Forged blades are better than stamped ones because the forging renders the metal stronger.
Avoid knives that claim to never need sharpening. They are not very sharp to begin with and they cannot be sharpened, meaning that when they lose their edge (and they will), they have to be disposed of.

, As well as the thickness and smoothness of the blade. The best knives are smooth as though polished with no sign of pitting in the metal. The cutting edge should run the full length from tip to the hilt. The image to the right shows the last 1.5cm (0.59"") or so has no cutting edge at all, so would be useless for heavy cuts such as carrots, which is what the larger knives are often needed for.


Serrated chef's knives should be avoided for general use such as vegetable and meat chopping as they can be very unsafe, being more likely to slip than cut. They cannot be sharpened and they saw rather than slice, unless you apply direct downward pressure (like when cutting a block of hard cheese) which is dangerous. It sounds like a good deal and is often packaged or advertised as an all-in-one knife that both chops vegetables, etc., and cuts bread, but they are not worth the money. You almost never see them in a knife set from a quality manufacturer, so it can be quite indicative the manufacturer is targeting a customer looking for what seems the most economical option. Serrated knives should be included in your set but only for slicing bread or baked products.

, For a good quality set, also invest in a steel and a sharpening stone. The steel maintains a nice cutting edge, but will not give the knife one if it has gone blunt without a lot of work. Stones will restore an edge or improve an existing cutting edge.


A diamond steel can cost a lot more, but will give a very fine edge. They also wear the knife down faster so knives can start to take a curved or sickle shape if care is not taken when sharpening. Very often people sharpen the middle of the blade on a steel, which also often happens most when you sharpen it with high speed (as it can look impressive to sharpen knives that way). Take it slowly and evenly the whole length of the blade, so it wears and sharpens evenly.
Do not use the knife on stone, glass, steel or ceramic cutting boards or surfaces; this can damage the knife and put fine chips in your food as well as being more likely to slip and cause an injury. Wood or rigid (not flexible) plastic is still the best cutting board. The board must be cleaned regularly and if plastic soaked in a 10:1 water and bleach solution once a week in high-use environments on top of regular cleaning.
Most knife handling injuries are caused by blunt knives rather than sharp ones as more pressure is applied to cut and the knife is more likely to slip.

, Of course your aim is to get good quality products at cheaper rates. Be it from high brand or from low brand, after all you have to make the payments.

Try not to let anyone else use your knives if they are your personal set. Ultimately the most knife injuries where bluntness was not the cause was someone using a knife with which they were unfamiliar.

, A knife block is fine, so is a knife roll which is a cloth pouch much like a roll of spanners or wrenches. Some knives come in their own storage box, but many chefs simply wrap the knives in an old apron (ensuring no knife touches another) for storage, with the apron strings securely wrapping the bundle so it does not fall open. Magnetic knife strips are not as ideal, but are fine in an environment where there are no children and should be installed where they will not be knocked and fall off.


Storing them loose in a toolbox or utensil drawer is not recommended.

, The internet can be excellent to find good prices from quality brands and many hospitality wholesalers have buy-direct websites to get robust knives at a very good price. However, be sure to have at least visited a store to get a feel for the knives you want to buy online, or be sure that there is a good returns policy in case you don't like the feel of the knife on receipt. Knives are an investment as a good set can last many years (20 to 30 years or more) so it is best to choose one will last and work well for you as well as making cooking far easier and more enjoyable.

Get a sheet of #180 grit or #240 grit ""Wet-or-Dry"" silicon carbide (black) sandpaper.,
Lay the sandpaper grit side up at the edge of a hard flat surface (table, counter top, or cutting board).,
Firmly hold the knife by the handle and slide the edge across the sandpaper like you are slicing thin layers off the sandpaper.,
Sharpen both sides of the blade the same way and the same amount.,
For knives with curved blades, raise the handle slightly while sliding the edge across the sandpaper so that you sharpen the entire length.

",How to Sharpen Kitchen Knives with Sandpaper," These can be found at any home improvement store, or even Walmart in the Paint-Wallpaper section. Sometimes these are sold in ""Variety Packs"" with several grits, about $3. One sheet will last for months.;
, This will allow you to hold the handle firmly and sharpen the entire edge.

, Always move the knife in that direction, ""on to"" the sandpaper, never backwards, in circles or straight along the edge. An angle of about 20° is best. Do not use a lot of pressure, just steady, even strokes—about like slicing a raw Irish potato.

, Alternate sides: Take maybe three strokes on a side, then change.

Find your sieve.,
Fry or cook the food as usual.

,
Once the food begins to splatter, prepare the sieve guard.,
Check that the handles of both the sieve and the saucepan or pot are facing away from you, toward the back of the stovetop.,
Leave until the cooking is complete.",How to Make a Splatter Guard from a Sieve," Check that it fits across the circumference of the pan or pot that you'll be frying the food in. It should be metallic or heatproof.;
,, Place the sieve face down over the cooking food in the pan or pot.

, Rest the sieve handle on the pan's handle.

, If you need to remove to stir or turn over the cooking food, take care to remove the pan from the heat first and stand back a bit. Replace when you've shifted the food.

Place a large, flat cooking vessel in the oven.,
Place a towel or silicone baking mat in the baking dish (optional).,
Position the smaller containers in the larger one.,
Pour hot water around the sides of the bain marie.,
Heat until the water simmers.,
Remove the smaller containers carefully.",How to Make a Double Boiler (Bain Marie)2," Choose a large roasting dish or other oven-safe container with high sides. This should be large enough to hold your smaller dish (or dishes) with about 1–2 inch (2.5–5 cm) of space around the edge, to allow for water circulation.Place this dish in the oven now, as it will be difficult to transport once filled with water.


Preheat your oven according to your recipe before you begin this process.

, Ramekins and other small containers may slide against the surface of the baking dish when you pour in water. A folded towel or a silicone baking mat will help prevent this. This will also provide more insulation, but that is not typically necessary., Place the pan or ramekins that contain your dish into the large container. If you are using multiple containers, nestle them together in the center to prevent them sliding around.This method is great for custards, flans, cheesecakes and other baked desserts that contain eggs.
To prevent a skin forming on smooth custards, cover the small containers with foil., Heat water to boiling and pour it carefully into the larger pan, until it reaches ⅓ to ½ of the way up the sides of the smaller containers.Pour slowly to avoid splashing water into your food. If available, pour from a kettle or measuring cup spout.

, Follow the baking instructions for your recipe, but check on the bain marie frequently. The water should be barely simmering. If it starts to boil, reduce the oven temperature.If the water level gets low during cooking, pour in hot tap water to replenish it.

, Tongs coated in silicone or rubber make it easy to remove the hot ramekins. You can improve a pair by wrapping wide rubber bands around metal tongs, or just remove the containers carefully with pot holders.Open the oven and leave the larger container there until it's cooled enough to touch.

Fill a large sauce pan partway full of water.,
Bring water to a simmer.,
Place a metal ring at the base of this pan.,
Place the smaller container inside the larger one.",How to Make a Double Boiler (Bain Marie)3," This type of bain marie — the French word for ""water bath"" — provides gentle heat to a soup, sauce, or other dish while you're waiting to serve it. A tall stock pot or other cylindrical pan is best for this purpose.Fill it ¼ to ½ full of water, or enough to reach halfway up the side of the smaller container.

, Heat to a rolling boil, then reduce until the water is simmering.

, Unlike a double boiler, a bain marie does not require a snug fit between the two pans. A metal pastry ring at the base of the pan can support a small container. If you are keeping several small dishes warm, you can even use one large sauce pan for all them, placing each on its own supporting ring.


Alternatively, fold a towel and place it on the base of the large pan. This will insulate the food even better than water alone, and keep small containers from rocking back and forth., The water should reach partway up the sides of the small container, but not enough to spill over the top. Leave the food to warm until ready to serve.

Select your sandpaper.,
Put your knife in a vise.,
Blunt the blade.,
Gauge the blade's dullness with your finger.,
Polish the blade.",How to Blunt a Sword or Knife2," Energy can work for dulling, but aluminum oxide and silicon carbide are best suited to hand blunting your blade. You'll want to choose one that has a coarse grit between 40 and 50. The coarse grade will remove the edge of your blade faster.There may be some specially formulated sandpapers available at your local hardware store. You should inquire with staff about a coarse grit paper suited for taking the edge off metal.

, Holding onto your knife while trying to sand by hand could cause you to slip and cut yourself. Using a vise to hold your knife securely in place is the safest method to hand sand a blade. Be sure the knife is firmly secured, with the blade pointed upwards.


You should avoid leaving your knife in the vise unattended. Even if it only takes you a few days to blunt your blade to the point you desire, someone could trip and cut themselves on the work in progress.

, Take each end of your sandpaper in your hands and hold it over the edge of the blade. Lower the paper until you feel the blade pushing gently up against it. Using firm outward pressure and slight downward pressure, run the paper back and forth over your blade.


Be careful not to apply too much pressure to your paper. Doing do can cause the knife to cut the paper.
Depending on many factors, like the kind of metal your blade is made of, the kind of sandpaper you're using, the age of the blade and more, it may take some time before your blade becomes blunt.

, Use caution when doing this, your blade may still be sharp enough to cut. Throughout the dulling process, you should periodically check your blade by running your finger across it crosswise. Never run your finger along the edge of the blade. Once it reaches the your desired level of dullness, you hand dulling is complete.Be sure to test the entire length of the blade. You may have applied uneven pressure to your sandpaper, which could have resulted in uneven dullness.

, After you have dulled the blade sufficiently, apply a coat of metal polish to the blade. Dab the polish on a piece of cloth and apply it to the blade from top to bottom. This will restore the the appearance of your now dull blade.


Polishing your blade after dulling is especially important if you've dulled the blade for use as a household ornament.

"
"
Wear the blade down with regular use.,
Draw the blade against a harder object.,
Drag the blade against or cut cardboard.,
Polish your blade after blunting it.",How to Blunt a Sword or Knife3," Blades wear down naturally over time. The more you use your blade, the duller it will become. If dulling a blade is your goal but you feel uncomfortable using a sander to dull it, you should make an effort to use the tool as much as you can.


Harder and thicker objects will cause the blade to blunt most quickly. For example, you might cut kindling for fires with the sword you are trying to blunt.

, This is another blunting technique that is similar to using a whetstone. By dragging a blade against a whetstone, you sharpen it, but by dragging a blade against a hard surface, especially a coarse one, you'll cause the blade to lose its edge.You might consider using a rock, cinderblock, or a piece of metal. This can be very effective with smaller blades, and you can even do this as you watch TV.
Be careful when performing this dulling technique. It's easy to lose your grip on the knife or to drop it and potentially hurt yourself.

, Cardboard is a perfect household item you can use for blunting a blade's edge. Scrape the point of the blade's edge against cardboard repeatedly, checking the sharpness with your finger every so often to gauge your progress.


You can also use your blade to cut cardboard to receive the same dulling effect. This way, you can blunt your blade while disposing old boxes., Apply some polish to a cloth and coat your blade with it after you've blunted it sufficiently. This will rejuvenate the blade's appearance and make it look sharp again in spite of being dulled. Now you can display your blade without fear of it causing harm.

Use the right bowl or pan.,
Get two forks.,
Tape the forks together.,
Use the forks like a whisk.",How to Improvise a Whisk1," Before whisking, you want to make sure that the container is much larger than your starting product. This way, there will be enough room for the mixture to move around.You should also be sure to use a container that can withstand the fork. If you are using a non-stick pan, it could be damaged by your fork-whisk.;
, Use two forks that are approximately the same size. They should also have the same length handle.

, Place them on top of one another with a folded paper towel in between the handles. This paper towel will simple add some space between your forks, which helps add air to the mixture like a standard whisk would. Use tape to connect them halfway down the handles.

, Now that you’ve created your makeshift whisk, make sure that you use it correctly. Hold the bowl at an angle with your whisk in the mixture. Make very small circles very quickly, mostly using your wrist. Dip the whisk in and out of your mixture to help incorporate air."

Understand the parts of a moka pot.,
Clean or condition your moka pot for the first time by boiling up some old grounds as a test.,
Brew your coffee:


Add water to the bottom chamber.,
Pour your coffee and enjoy.,

Clean the pot as soon as it cools.,
Possible problems (and their fixes) are:
Steam leaks—tighten the seal better before brewing, make sure it is clean and the threads are engaging properly.",How to Use a Moka Pot," They have three chambers, one for water (A), one for grounds (B) and one for the finished product (C).

The bottom chamber is for the water. It usually has a pressure valve as well.
The middle chamber is for your finely ground coffee. Pack it in lightly.
The top chamber is the collection point for the brewed espresso / coffee.

, Throw the product away. This step is only to clean the machine and test the function of the pressure valve. Repeat this three times to ensure that all the parts are clean., It should be filled to half an inch or 1 centimeter (0.39 in) below the valve.
Add medium-fine grounds to the basket. Do NOT tamp! Make sure that there are no grounds at the edges of the funnel and the bottom chamber.
Place the filled basket in place and screw the top on snugly.
Place the moka pot onto the heat source, and adjust the temperature to the maximum level, such that the flame, if (using a stove), does not extend beyond the edge of the pot. The steam valve should not point toward you. Turn off the heat source when espresso,(black coffee),stops, and allow cream to come out. If you do not turn off the heat source, the coffee, especially if dark-roast, will be burned by the steam in the bottom chamber.

, Do not let children touch the pot when it is still hot. Allow fifteen minutes for pot to cool, or run it under cold water, before cleaning., Do not use a dishwasher; instead wash it out by hand without soap.

Clean the Keurig machine parts periodically.,
Descale every 3-6 months.,
Store your Keurig.",How to Use a Keurig Machine," Lift the lid off the water reservoir, located either on the left side or at the back of your machine. Depending on your model, either pull out the reservoir from the left side of the machine to fill it, or use a cup or mug to pour water into the back reservoir to the desired quantity.


Don’t fill water to above the line on the reservoir that says “MAX FILL.”
It’s best to use filtered or spring water, as hard water from the tap may leave mineral buildup in the machine over time.;
, Put your cup, mug, or small travel mug on the drip tray plate of the machine, under the spout where your brewed beverage will pour out.


For a slightly larger variety of mug, gently remove the drip tray and place the mug on the base underneath., Insert the single Keurig pack, called a K-cup, into the machine by lifting the handle on the front and center of the machine and placing the K-cup inside. Have the foil top facing up.


You don’t need to open the seal on the K-cup or do anything else to it; just place it into your machine as-is. The machine pierces holes in the seal and bottom of the K-cup when you close the lid so water can flow through when brewing.

, Depending on your Keurig model, you will either select the “Brew” button on your machine or choose a mug size to start the brewing process.


If you have the option to choose a brew size, choose “Small Cup” (5.25 oz.), “Small Mug” (7.25 oz.), or “Large Mug” (9.25 oz.) based on the size of your cup or mug.Don’t move your cup or mug or lift the top handle of the machine during brewing.
Depending on your model, the entire brewing process will take approximately 1-2 minutes.

, Take your cup or mug from the drip plate once liquid stops pouring from the machine and ends with a burst of air to push any remaining liquid out.


If your cup or mug overflowed with liquid, select a smaller size on your machine, if applicable, or use a larger cup or mug for future brews.
If your cup or mug doesn’t have enough liquid, select a larger size on your machine, use a smaller cup, or consult the user manual for your machine to learn how to check for blockages or other problems that may have occurred., Lift the top handle to remove the K-cup after it is done brewing, and dispose of it in a trash can.


Be careful when handling the used K-cup, as it will be very hot.

, Clean your Keurig every so often when you notice stains, mineral buildup, or a full drip plate tray.


Clean external parts with a soft damp cloth and soap. Slide out the drip tray to empty and rinse it with water and soap. The K-cup pack holder (the parts under the top handle) can be placed in the top rack of a dishwater in a low-temperature cycle.Always clean parts individually and without submerging your machine into water or other liquid.

, Descale your Keurig every few months to remove calcium or lime scales that develop on your Keurig from the natural mineral quantity in water. Obtain 20-48 ounces of undiluted white vinegar (depending on your Keurig’s size), a ceramic mug, and access to a sink.


Fill the water reservoir with the white vinegar and place the ceramic mug on the drip tray. Then press “Brew” without using a K-cup, and discard the resulting hot vinegar in the mug into a sink. You can repeat with a second vinegar cycle, or with a cycle using just water. Make sure to run a cycle with just water and rinse the water reservoir thoroughly before using your machine again normally., Keep your machine upright in a dry environment that is not exposed to freezing or very high temperatures.

Use the right container.,
Find a pair of chopsticks.,
Whisk your mixture.",How to Improvise a Whisk2," This makeshift whisk will make a big mess if you don’t have a large enough bowl. Make sure your mixture is in a bowl much larger than its volume. Chopsticks are less unlikely to damage your container, but be aware of your whisking so that you don’t scrape the bottom and ruin your container., Chopsticks are a great choice because they often come connected, saving you the step of taping them together. You’ll want to use the ends that have some separation in between them to get the most out of your whisk.


The disadvantage of using chopsticks is that they don’t add as much air to your mixture as a traditional whisk or a makeshift fork whisk would.

, Take your chopsticks as-is and place the separated end in the mixture. Use your wrist to make fast, circular motions and thoroughly combine your mixture. Continue to whisk until the lumps have been eliminated."

, Even if it's new, you have no idea how long it sat gathering dust (or worse) at a store. Also, you'll want to clean thoroughly to remove any ink residues if your shredder performed its intended function in the past. However, an unused shredder is preferable. See Warnings below.

, You'll want room to work with your pasta. To do so, disable the receptacle sensor so the machine still functions. You can do this with duct tape. To do so, use a lubricant such as 10-40 or liquid bleach. If you have a shredder that is supported by the receptacle, you'll need to prop it up with something else (e.g. thick books, soup cans, etc.).

Take a pipe diameter 80 mm or so, wall thickness 2 mm or more, cut two pieces of 150 mm each, put them at the end of a 2500 mm long pipe diameter 75 mm and pass them through the sphere in between the last circle at the ground level and the one previous, tie it well with wires that you will connect tying them hard to various knots on the sphere in the area, the pipes must go out of the sphere 100 mm and in the sphere 50 mm, if you can weld them to the wires is better.

,Where all the arches overlap, inside the smaller circle tie, cut all the arches in the center than tie them so the smallest circle for good,
take newspapers, large quantity, and acrylic glue (vinyl) for wood, or better oralite (urea) based glue (the additive they put in the asphalt to harden it on the roads) since is waterproof.,
Check with the wood jugs out and in for perfection, and use car quality putty or fiberglass resin to fill the gaps until the surface is smooth semi-spherical.,
Remember the 2 meters (6.6 ft) long pipe you used at point 7 to put in line the pipes in the sphere wall?,
Buy self sticking rolled mirror, cut it in stripes of 2 centimeter (0.8 in) wide, perfectly parallel using a sharp cutter and a metal ruler, starting from the center to the edge put a stripe, than 180 degrees put in continuation a second stripe, than ASIDE put another stripe from edge to edge passing near the center, same on the other side, and so on until the whole sphere is covered, make sure no air bubbles are left.,
Build the stand you need a rotating plate, teh most common one for free or almost is a rear wheel from any car at the junk yard, take it all, brakes disk and caliper included, it will help you to keep the stove blocked using the old parking brake system.,
The structure is nothing more than 4 quarter circle arches of 70 mm pipe thin wall (1,5 mm or 2 mm) you stick on the rim welded pipes and rotate under the parabola connection pipes where the central cooking support pipes are coming out.,The lens legs are 4 bent pipes, the support is a round bended square pipe welded with two lateral round pipes to connect to upper legs, and a central diagonal to hold the pivoting pipe.,The support has 2 legs detachable with horizontal metal sheets with holes so you can bolt on pivoting wheels, and move the stove as you need.,
If you want to build it, the elevating system is a simple gear anyone can cut with the flex grinder with two lateral welded discs to keep the gear connection of the half parables together alienated, and can be turned with a pipe long one meter with the other end in a L shape.",How to Build a Parabolic Powerful Solar Stove for Cooking,";
,,,,,,, Keep doing that each 5 centimeters (2.0 in) away from each round until the half sphere is completed to the ground.,,,, Soak newspapers in the glue you choose to use without ruining them, than stretch them on the outer side of the parabola, until it's all covered, let it dry a day, than rotate it outside down and do the same inside, repeat outer and inner layers until you have some 10 layers total. reinforce the pipes area well. Allow to dry a few days, Impermeable the whole thing by painting it with waterproof paint., Cut it in two, and in between the two parts weld a L iron based frame 30 X 30 CM or larger, on which you will place the cooking pot, or the lava stone sheet to grill upon, etc, this is your stove surface.

, This should do for reflecting a lot of sun., Make a support of 3 regular legs to bolt it beneath and another small support (the center of a rim that fits) to make the upper center to which you weld two pipes of 500 mm diameter 60 mm wall thickness 5 mm with their center on opposite sides and parallel among them.

, You put two 100 mm long pipes of 100 out on the ends of the support and weld them to the 2 pipes coming from the rim on one side and the other two to the other pipe the opposite side. Block the outer support to the cooking support with nuts and bolts so your soup won't be in danger. Nor the whole support from the rim up rotates horizontally, and the parabola rotates around the central support. Done.

",How to Cook Food on Your Car's Engine," If you're not going to be taking a trip anyway, engine block cooking is probably the most expensive way to cook anything, so don't plan a trip just to cook. Instead cook a dish that fits your trip. Cooking on your car's engine is essentially the same as braising food, and cooking times are generally a bit longer than in a conventional oven and shorter than in a slow cooker. If you're taking a long road trip, you can cook just about anything—roasts, complete meals with Potato side dishes, etc.—but even a quick commute affords you enough time to heat up a pre-cooked breakfast sandwich, for example, or make some hot dogs. You can find carbecue recipes by searching for ""engine block cooking,"" for example, or you can try to find a copy of Manifold Destiny, the definitive book on the subject. You can also use recipes from your cookbook and just experiment with cooking times. See the Tips section below for some sample cooking times and other considerations.;
, You can follow the pre-cooking preparation directions in any oven recipe.

, Tear off two or three sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil. Don't skimp on the foil, as you'll want to make sure that your food is completely wrapped and that you can fold one edge of the foil over the other—too much foil is better than too little.


Lay out the pieces of foil directly on top of each other, and then spread a little butter or oil (cooking oil, not motor oil) over the top sheet so your meal won't stick to it.
Lay the food in the center of the sheet of foil and then wrap the foil over it. Fold the edges of the foil over each other so that the package is sealed all around.

, You can't just drop the food under the hood and expect it to cook; you first need to find a good, hot spot on the engine for it. Drive for a few minutes to warm up your engine, and then stop. Turn off the engine and open the hood. Find your engine's hot spots by quickly and lightly touching a finger to metal parts on the engine. Sounds like a recipe for burning your finger, doesn't it? Well it is, unless you really do it quickly and lightly. If you can hold your finger in a spot for more than a moment without getting burned, that spot's not hot enough. As a general rule, the best spot—if you can safely get to it—is on or near the exhaust manifold.

, Crumple up a piece of foil into a loose ball or cone. The foil should be about six inches high. Place it on the spot on the engine you've decided to cook on, and then close the hood. Reopen the hood—the foil has probably been compacted a bit.

, Remove the foil you used in the last step and place it next to your wrapped package of food. Compare the height of the foil ""test ball"" to the height of your food package. If the food package is higher than the test ball, your meal will be crushed when you close the hood. If it's more than a little lower, it won't fit snugly and may fall out of place while you're driving.

, Assuming the package is not too high to fit in the cooking area, place it on the engine. If it was lower than the test ball, crumple up a little foil to lay on top of the package. You don't want the food moving from side to side, either, so make sure it's a snug fit all around. You can do this either by surrounding it with additional crumpled foil pieces or by tying it down. Some people will ease the food package under conveniently located rubber hoses, for example, or you can use wire to tie the food down. Use common sense when securing the food. Avoid placing it near moving parts, and don't strain hoses by trying to force the package under them. If you're going to use wire, use baling wire rather than trying to use the wires that are already in your engine compartment.

, As with all cooking, a little trial and error is usually necessary before you get a feel for the proper cooking times. Even if you're following an engine-block cooking recipe, it's a good idea to check on the food a little before the time (or mileage) when it's supposed to be done. If you need to put it back in, remember to reseal and secure the package.

, First, turn off the engine. Second, remember that the engine is hot, and the food will be hot, so use tongs and/or potholders to remove the food—you wouldn't just grab a hot pan out of the oven with your bare hand! Unwrap it and serve. If you've still got some driving to do, skip the wine.

Start with Bake a Potato in the Microwave. If you are baking just one or two potatoes, or a sweet potato, reduce the power so the outside doesn't scorch by the time the inside is done.
Warm a plate of leftovers at low power.
Warm a milky coffee at medium power and check carefully when to stop so the milk retains its goodness.

Make s'mores in a microwave for a graphic demonstration of a microwave's power of cooking food through all at once: the marshmallow rapidly becomes extremely large.
Cook something big (but not huge, leave plenty of space on the sides, and stack loosely so some microwaves can enter into the core of the pile) at full power. For instance, a few pounds of potatoes to be mashed, piled all together plastic wrap or washed and returned to a plastic bag they came in, at full power. (Try fifteen minutes on high for five pounds.)
Microwave chopped-to-size vegetables before frying them to get the inside somewhat soft without having to burn the outside.

Make Microwave Popcorn, whether in a ready-made bag or in a covered bowl with a little oil (look around for a recipe). You might not expect from the rest of this article that it would work well, but it does. Follow the directions carefully; stop microwaving sooner rather than later -- it's better to have a mostly-full good bag rather than a full scorched bag. This generally should be done on full power to make steam to pop the little kernels rather than slowly fizzling the moisture out of them. Try elevating the bag off the microwave floor for more even cooking if you get a lot of uncooked kernels alongside some burnt popcorn.

,


Microwaves penetrate and generate heat at depth within water-bearing food. In contrast, almost all other cooking methods heat the surface only, whether by conduction as in cooking with a fluid such as hot air (roasting), steam (steaming), oil (frying), or water (boiling), or non-penetrating radiation as in broiling. (Convection is merely bulk flow facilitating conduction).

Microwaves do not cook from the ""inside out"", but do cook thin food essentially all throughout at once, and reduce the depth within thick food to which conduction from the rest of the food must carry heat.
Unlike boiling, etc. there is no hot dense fluid to carry heat to the interior of a large pile of food. Don't overstuff the microwave oven, even with somewhat loose items such as a big stack of potatoes.


A microwave generally cannot cook food that does not contain much water, including something that is light and fluffy, well.

Don't microwave something that contains little water for more than a minute or so before the microwave has a few minutes to rest, and put a cup of water in the microwave (which will get hot) with it to absorb the otherwise unused microwaves. This will help keep the microwave from overheating and damaging itself with surplus microwaves.
Generally, don't expect something that is supposed to dry out in the cooking process, such as a cake, to turn out well unless you use a special microwave-adapted recipe.


Microwaves tend to have many hot and cold spots from ""standing waves"". A turntable reduces this problem by moving the food through hot and cold spots. Very thin, flat solid food cannot conduct heat through itself rapidly to the cold spots. In some microwaves small or thin items cook better if they are supported above the floor by, for instance, an inverted bowl under a plate.;
, A cooking method heats only the outside of a food item--or in a microwave, the outer layers, perhaps an inch, enough to cook a two-inch-wide chunk more or less all at once. The heat must flow through the food to cook the rest.


In a microwave, heat must also flow from better-heated to worse-heated spots.
Water-based food--most food, and the only kind that microwaves can cook--cannot get hotter than 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees centigrade) until all of the water in the spot being heated has been boiled away. Applying more heat than sufficient to keep the outside from cooling below that point does not increase the rate at which heat flows into the interior to enable the cooking reactions (and to a very small extent, perhaps, be absorbed by them) by conduction through the watery bulk of the food. It only dries out the outside faster.

You may be familiar with this principle through cooking a steak. One should use high heat only to scorch the surface, then low heat to cook the interior to the desired level of overall doneness without ruining the exterior.
Pressure cookers keep water from boiling until it reaches a higher temperature, and, so, also cook extremely fast. But they are more or less limited to boiling (or, in the case of specialized commercial pressure-fryers for frying chicken, deep frying).


Sometimes it is desirable to cook the food at an even lower heat, to allow the interior to reach the desired temperature and sit at it for a certain period without the outside having to get much warmer. This takes longer because there is a smaller temperature gradient to drive heat flow, but, even with the longer cooking time, can keep the reactions that would overcook the outside at near-boiling temperatures to a minimum.

Consider sous vide. Try showing off with something ""sous microwave"", then seared, but start simple--perhaps by poaching an egg in plastic wrap--and be extra careful that anything involving raw meat or otherwise potentially hazardous is cooked through to a temperature sufficient to kill anything in it. Use a meat thermometer at several points. (There is little risk of something new bad developing in food during a microwaving process itself, because that is pretty fast.)
It is very important not to overheat something containing milk, such as hot chocolate, even to boiling because the milk can irreparably separate.
Watery foods, such as watery soups, can cook well at higher heat levels because they carry heat through themselves by convection. (Thick soups will not convect and will instead bubble locally and spit under excessive microwaving power.)


Consequently, turn down the power if microwaving just a few items of food so the outside and hot spots are not overdone by the time the rest is done. Generally, use half power if heating something other than at least a large mugful of watery liquid or a heap of food a few inches high at least; even less--""defrost"" setting or one-quarter power--for something already cooked and at risk of overcooking such as reheating chicken.
If you have been scorching the outside of items before cooking the inside, just reduce the power at first--you don't necessarily have to increase the cooking time. Remember, the overly-high heat wasn't cooking the food faster, just drying it out.

,


Some cooking methods, such as frying, smoking, or boiling with salt or spices, also add material and thus flavor to the food. Microwaving doesn't add anything, so add all the flavoring (including ""liquid smoke"", smoke particles collected in a very efficient manner and dissolved in liquid) you like to the food before or after cooking. Add conservatively: only a very small fraction of the medium in which something would otherwise be cooked is actually absorbed into the food.
Some cooking methods add water to the food. Some, such as boiling (with water to be discarded) add way too much, so that it leaches out vitamins. Generally all that is needed with items prone to drying out is some plastic wrap with a few holes to prevent pressure buildup, but if something is on the edge of over drying, add just a little water and cover it.
Some cooking methods dry out the outside of the food. Microwaving will liberate steam and re-moisten it, so if a crispy outside is desirable, generally microwave to get the inside mostly done, then cook the outside.

Find a glass or cup that is microwave safe, and fill it three-quarters of the way with water.It’s important to use a cup that you know to be safe for the microwave, otherwise the test may not work.
To be certain, find a cup that has the microwave safe stamp on the bottom.;
, Place both the glass of water and the dish in question side by side in the microwave. Microwave the two items together on high power for one minute.


If the dish is too large to sit side by side with the cup, place the cup on top of (or inside) the dish.
To increase the power on your microwave to high, look for a button that says Power, Menu, or Settings., After a minute in the microwave, use oven mitts or a potholder to remove the cup of water. Then, place your hand on the dish in question to feel how warm it is:The dish is unsafe for the microwave if the dish is warm and the water is cold. A warm dish means it absorbs heat.
The dish is safe for the microwave if the dish is cool and the water is warm. A cool dish means it doesn’t absorb heat.
Note that the dish may feel warm in the center if you had the cup of water in or on the dish.

, In order to keep track of which dishes are microwave safe and which aren't, use a permanent marker to label the bottom of the dish with the results of your test.You can use any labeling method you like for your dishes. For instance, you can mark microwave-safe dishes with a happy face, the letter M, or two wavy lines.
Don’t forget to label dishes that aren't safe for the microwave as well. You can use an unhappy face, an M with a line through it, or some other indication.

, The easiest way to know that a dish or utensil is microwave safe is by looking for the stamp on the bottom. There are typically three things that will indicate a dish is safe to use:The words “microwave safe”
The words “microwave friendly”
Wavy horizontal lines

, Most ceramic, glass, china, and porcelain dishware is safe for use in the microwave. The exceptions are if:The manufacturer states that the dishes are not microwaveable
The dishware has metal paint or decorations, such as gold or silver trim
Lead glaze was used

, There are several manufacturers out there that make heat-proof cookware that is also safe for use in the microwave. Some of the companies that make these items are:


Anchor Hocking
Duralex
Pyrex
Corningware
Visions

, Some paper products are safe to microwave, including parchment and wax paper, and white paper plates, napkins, and towels.To make sure that no inks or dyes leach into your food, don’t use paper products with printed matter, logos, or writing on them.

, Some plastic dishware and wraps have been made especially to be safe for microwaving, and these don’t contain plasticizers that can leach into food.


If you want to microwave plastic dishware, make sure it says it’s microwave safe. If it doesn’t say it, don’t use it.
When you use microwave safe plastic wrap in the microwave, make sure it’s not touching your food directly., Unless you follow a very strict safety protocol, it’s not safe to microwave metal. Putting metal in the microwave can lead to sparking, fires, and a malfunctioning unit. Be sure to watch out for:Dishes and cups with metallic paints
Dishes and cups with decorative metal trim
Wire twist ties
Take-out containers with metal lining or handles
Aluminum foil
Metal utensils

, Lead glaze used to be common for lots of dishware, and is still used in many countries. You should not use dishes with lead glaze to hold or serve food, because the lead can transfer to your food. Lead is extremely toxic and consuming lead is hazardous to your health. If you microwaving dishware with lead glaze, even more lead can leach into the food. Dishes that are likely to have lead glaze include:Clay dishware with a shiny or transparent glaze
Handmade artisan dishware
Dishware with bright and vibrant colors on the inside surfaces
Antique dinnerware
Highly decorative and shiny dishware

, Plastic food containers that are meant for refrigerated items are not meant to be heated, and are certainly not designed for the microwave. This includes containers made for:Yogurt
Butter or margarine
Cottage cheese

, The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service states that while it is safe to microwave white paper products, brown paper products should not be microwaved.This includes brown paper lunch bags and brown paper towels.
The same site recommends not microwaving newspaper.

Avoid non-stick cookware.,
Beware of aluminum.,
Reconsider copper.,
Throw away cookware that is damaged.,
Avoid plastic cutting boards.,
Look for dangers with glazed cookware.,
Find the country of origin for your cookware.",How to Avoid Hazardous Cookware1," Non-stick cookware may be convenient, but it can be very dangerous. Non-stick cookware may release toxic fumes if it is overheated. These fumes can be dangerous if you inhale them. Stay away from Teflon pans.If you overheat Teflon pans, you may develop flu-like symptoms.
The fumes from non-stick pans may also kill pet birds.;
, Aluminum cookware may not be as safe as you’d think. Long-term usage of and exposure to aluminum can cause health problems. Using aluminum cookware often can introduce more aluminum into your body than is safe.Aluminum may damage the brain and block toxins from leaving the body.

, Copper cookware is appealing to the eye, but it may be dangerous when placed in cookware. Copper and nickel are heavy metals that are toxic. They are both used in the shiny finish of copper cookware. Cooking often with this cookware may introduce these heavy metals into your food and body.A build up of these metals in your body may negatively affect your brain and cause chronic illnesses.
If you want to use copper cookware, look for items where copper is only used on the outside. Sometimes, copper is placed between two layers of other metals, such as stainless steel, which is safe. Never buy cookware that has copper on the inside lining.

, Safe cookware can become dangerous if it is damaged. If you have non-stick cookware and the coating is coming off, throw it away. This can be very dangerous and release toxins into your food.If you use ceramic cookware that is cracked or chipped, get rid of it. If the glaze contains lead, being chipped or cracked increases the risk of lead seeping into your food.

, Plastic cutting boards can be a health hazard. When the knife cuts into food, it leave cuts and grooves in the plastic. These open spaces can house bacteria like E.coli and salmonella.Choose wood or bamboo cutting boards instead. Bacteria doesn’t stick to it as much.

, Many glazes contain lead, and sometimes you can't be certain whether the cookware is lead-free or not. If you find ceramic cookware that is lead-free, go with that. For others, you may need to inspect it a bit more closely before using it. Some may say on the bottom it is for decoration only and not for food.Many glazed terracotta dishes, especially from Latin American countries, may contain lead. Use these only for decoration; do not eat from them.
Overly decorated tableware, especially from Asia, can pose a risk. If there are brightly colored decorations anywhere that will touch food, use caution.
Homemade ceramics, even in the United States, may contain a lead glaze. Talk to the person before using it with food.
Antique ceramic tableware poses a threat because it may be from before lead was outlawed.
Decorations on top of the glaze may cause a deterioration of the glaze, exposing dangerous metals such as lead.

, Not all countries have the same laws for cookware safety. Double check the country of origin when choosing cookware. This may influence the types of materials used in the production.


For example, ceramic cookware made in other countries, such as Latin American or Asian countries, may contain lead and be unfit for food use."

Pour 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vegetable oil into the pan.,
Heat the pan on the stove until it begins to smoke.,
Let the pan cool.,
Wipe away the excess oil.,
Repeat once every six months.",How to Season an Orgreenic Pan1," Use your fingers or a soft paper towel to spread the oil over the entire inner surface of the pan, including the bottom and sides.


While Orgreenic recommends the use of vegetable oil, other oils and vegetable shortening could be used, instead. If selecting another oil, opt for one with a high smoking point, like peanut oil, grapeseed oil, or canola oil, over one with a low smoking point, like olive oil.
This technique can be used on all Orgreenic pans, including all stovetop pans, oven pans, and grill pans.;
, Place the pan on the eye of your stove and turn the heat onto a medium setting. Keep the pan on the heat until you can see smoke rise from its surface.


Expect this process to take several minutes. While you might be tempted to heat the oil on high heat, you need to keep the temperature control set to medium so that the oil heats up slowly. Otherwise, the oil may not seep into the surface thoroughly enough.
Every few minutes, turn the pan to redistribute any oil that has begun to puddle or bead.

, Remove the pan from the heat source. Set it aside and allow it to cool back down to room temperature.


Leave the pan out at room temperature as it cools. Do not attempt to cool it down faster by placing it in a refrigerated space, since the dramatic change in temperature can damage the ceramic.

, Use a clean paper towel to wipe away any visible puddles or streaks of remaining oil.


The surface of the pan will still feel a little greasy after you wipe it down, but this greasiness is natural and should not be scrubbed out.

, Your Orgreenic pan should be re-seasoned every six months. You can do so following this same method or by trying one of the other described methods.


If food begins sticking to the surface of your pan before six months have elapsed, re-season your pan ahead of schedule.

Choose cast iron cookware.,
Try stainless steel.,
Cook with glass.,
Try stoneware.,
Go for ceramic.,
Choose BPA-free plastic.",How to Avoid Hazardous Cookware2," Cast iron is a great, safe material for pots and pans. Cast iron is also a relatively non-stick surface. You can heat cast iron to any temperature without any dangerous fumes.You can also place cast iron pots and pans in the oven.
You can also try enamel coated cast iron., Stainless steel pots and pans are safe options. They do not release anything hazardous into your food or the air when cooking. You can also use any cooking utensil on them without harming them. They also contain no carcinogens.These pans are not non-stick, so you have to add butter or oil to help keep things from sticking.
Make sure to check your stainless steel pots and pans, especially if you are buying cheaper ones. Cheap stainless steel cookware may contain nickel and chromium, harmful metals that can seep into food.

, Glass is a safe material for cookware. Glass doesn’t release anything toxic when heated and won’t contaminate your food. It also doesn’t hold flavors or odors in the material.Make sure to use caution when baking with glass. It will break if dropped.
Food will stick to glass if you do not add something to help it keep from sticking.

, Stoneware is safe and nontoxic. After a few uses, it will become non-stick. You don’t have to wash stoneware with soap. You can scrape, wipe, or rinse it instead. Stoneware also will not absorb flavors or odors.Stoneware can crack or break if dropped.
Stoneware is more expensive than other types of cookware.

, Cookware that is made with 100% ceramic is extremely safe. It doesn’t react when heated and isn’t toxic. The surface of ceramic cookware will not corrode. You can use any utensil on ceramic and put it in the dishwasher.Ceramic cookware is expensive.
Make sure you are not purchasing cookware that has a ceramic glaze that contains lead. This generally occurs with pieces made outside of the United States. Research the brand and pieces to make sure it is lead-free.

, Heating food in plastic containers containing chemicals can be dangerous. BPA can cause cancer and negatively affect the brain and heart. Throw out any plastic that is not BPA and only buy BPA-free containers.If you are concerned about using plastic, consider using glass containers instead.

Consider using this technique for the Orgreenic roasting pan, baking pan, or grill pan. For stovetop Orgreenic cookware, opt for the stovetop or sunlight methods.

, You only need to use about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of oil. Using your fingers or a clean paper towel, spread the puddle of oil over the entire inner surface of the pan, coating the bottom and the sides.


Vegetable oil, vegetable shortening, canola oil, peanut oil, and grapeseed oil are all acceptable choices. Avoid using butter or olive oil, however, since these fats have a notably low smoking point.

, Place the pan in the middle rack of the oven and keep it there for a full hour. If you notice smoke coming off the surface of the pan before that time, you can remove the pan early.


Note that smoke may never actually come off the pan when using this method. That is acceptable, as long as you keep the pan in the oven for the full amount of time.
If you place the pan in the oven upside-up, the fat could start congealing inside of it. For that reason, many recommend placing the pan upside-down inside the oven. Place a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil on the rack beneath the pan to catch and oil or fat drippings during the process., Remove the pan from the oven and set it out at room temperature. Allow the temperature of the pan to drop to room temperature before touching it again.


Consider opening the oven door slightly and allowing the pan to cool for a few minutes inside the oven before removing it. Make sure that the oven is off when doing this. After cooling the pan in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, remove it and finish the cooling process at room temperature.
Never attempt to cool a hot Orgreenic pan in a refrigerator or freezer.

, Use a clean paper towel to clean off any excess oil from the inside of the pan.


The surface may still feel greasy but should not feel sticky. The greasiness you feel is normal, though, and should not be scrubbed away.

, Even using the oven method, your Orgreenic pan will need to be seasoned once every six months or so. You can re-season it using this same method or with one of the other described methods.


If food begins to stick to the food before six months pass, re-season the pan earlier than planned.

"
"
Lightly coat the pan with cooking oil.,
Place the pan in a brown paper bag.,
Sit the pan in direct sunlight for several days.,
Wipe away the excess.,
Repeat every six months.",How to Season an Orgreenic Pan3," Pour 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of vegetable oil into the pan. Use your fingers or a clean paper towel to spread the oil over the entire inside surface of the pan, including all of the sides and the bottom.


You only want to use enough oil to coat the surface. Avoid letting the oil puddle up inside the pan.
Consider using flaxseed oil for this method instead of standard vegetable oil. Flaxseed oil is very light, which makes it an ideal choice when applying a light coating to the pan.
This technique is the mildest one and is safe to use with all Orgreenic pans, including all stovetop pans, oven pans, and grill pans.

, Wrap a brown paper grocery bag around the coated part of the pan. The handle can either be exposed or hidden inside the bag; either option is acceptable.


The paper bag will protect the surface of the pan, concentrate the natural heat from the sun inside of it, and catch any oil that drips off the pan.

, Find a sunny window and place the pan, still wrapped inside its bag, upside-down in the sunlight. Leave it there for three to five days.


Placing the pan upside-down will prevent any of the oil from congealing or otherwise making a mess inside the pan.
Touch the outside of the bag each day. The surface should feel notably warm. If the surface is not warm, the sunlight might not be strong enough at that location.

, Remove the pan from the sunlight and from the brown bag. Use a clean paper towel to clean off any visible oil that remains.


The surface may still feel a little greasy, but that greasiness assists the non-stick properties of the pan. Make sure that there are no puddles of oil and no stickiness on the surface, though.

, You will need to re-season an Orgreenic pan every six months. Do so using this method or one of the other listed methods.


Since this method is so gentle, the seasoning may not last as long and there is a good chance that you will need to re-season your pan ahead of schedule. Re-season the pan whenever food starts sticking to it on a regular basis.

Gather your materials.,
Fill your bottom pot part-way with water.,

Use a double boiler to make melt-and-pour soap.",How to Use a Double Boiler," You will need both the bottom pot and the upper pot; you will not need the lid that came with your double boiler, unless the recipe or project specifically calls for one.If you do not have a double boiler, you can make your own using a large pot and a shallow, heat-resistant bowl that can fit over it.


The bowl in your homemade double boiler should fit snugly onto the large pot. There should be no gaps or spaces between the bowl and the rim of the pot.The bottom of the bowl should not touch bottom of the large pot.
If you are making your own double boiler, consider using a glass or ceramic bowl instead of a metal one. Glass and ceramic bowls don't transfer heat as much as metal ones do, which means that they heat slower and more evenly, thus giving you more control.;
, You will need about two inches (5.08 centimeters) of water.Double boilers heat items with steam, not hot water, so the bottom of your upper pot (or bowl if you are using a homemade double boiler) should not be touching any water that you add into the large pot. You may need to add more water or pour some water out in order to get the right amount.


Consider having some extra water nearby. The water level in your double boiler will decrease the longer you cook. You can prevent the water level from going too low and scorching your bottom pot by having a cup of water nearby. When the water level gets too low, refill the bottom pot with more water.

, The upper container should fit snugly over the bottom one. If bottom is touching the water, you have added too much water and will need to pour some out. The amount of water will vary depending on what double boiler you are using, but you should have about two inches of water. This will ensure that you have enough water (and thus steam) to last through most of your recipe or project., The water will make it heavy, so make sure that you are using both hands to carry it.

, Because double boilers generate so little heat, you will most likely need to cut whatever you are heating into smaller pieces. This is to speed up the cooking/heating process.


If the items you are heating already come in smaller chunks, you will not need to cut them up. Examples of smaller items include: chocolate chips, melting chocolate disks, shaved soap, and wax pellets.

, Try to spread the items out evenly across the bottom so that everything gets the same amount of heat.

, You want the water in your large pot to simmer, not boil, unless the recipe or project instructs otherwise.

, You can use a spatula, whisk, or wooden spoon. By stirring the contents, you are making sure that everything gets heated evenly. If you do not do this, some parts may end up undercooked while others might end up getting scorched or burnt.

, If the water level in your large pot is less than one inch (2.54 centimeters) at any point, you will need to add more water.This will allow the water to continue turning into steam and heating your items. Simply lift the upper pot or bowl off your large pot and add some water until you have about two or three inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters), and set the upper pot or bowl back down.

, Once the items have reached the desired consistency, remove the upper pot and pour the contents to a container or mold. If you have made your own double boiler, your upper container may not have a handle; be sure to use a glove or potholder to protect your hand from getting burned.

, Most items will require you to simmer the water, and keep the pot on the stove. Other items will require you to keep the water boiling. Some recipes or projects might instruct you to remove the pot from the stove once the water in the big pot starts to boil. This section will give you more specific instructions on how to heat more common items in a double boiler, including chocolate, soap, wax, and sauces.

, To melt chocolate in a double boiler, you will need to use low heat and a rubber spatula, and stir frequently.If your chocolate does not come in chip or pellet form, you will need to break, crush, or grate it into smaller pieces. This will help it melt faster.


Do not let any water to come in contact with the melting chocolate. Water will cause the chocolate to stiffen or turn grainy. If this does happen, ½ to 1 teaspoon of shortening per ounce of chocolate will remedy the problem.To prevent dark chocolate from scorching, do not let the chocolate's temperature go over 115°F (46°C). To prevent milk chocolate and white chocolate from scorching, do not let the temperature go over 110°F (43°C)., Fill the bottom pot with one to two inches of water and place a cookie cutter into it.Then, put some wax pellets, chunks, or flakes into a pouring pot used for candle making, and place that on top of the cookie cutter. You will not need the upper pot or bowl. Set the stove to medium-low and bring the water to a simmer.If your wax does not come in pellets, chunks, or flakes, you will need to cut the block into smaller pieces. This will make it melt faster.
Once the wax has melted, you may add fragrances and dyes.
Do not leave heating wax unattended. Wax takes a long time to melt, but once it reaches its ""flash"" point, it becomes flammable. Do not let the temperature of the heating wax go above 250°F (121°C)., Grate or shave some store-bought soap into tiny pieces and place them into the upper pot or bowl of your double boiler. You may consider adding one tablespoon of water to the soap. This is to prevent the soap from drying out while you heat it.Once the soap has melted, you may add dyes, fragrances, oils, and any other ingredients that the recipe calls for.


Rebatch soap will never become fully-melted, but have the consistency of oatmeal instead. It will reach this consistency after about 20 minutes.

, Cut the soap base you will be using into chunks. If the soap base has grooves or lines, use them as guidelines when you cut. Place the chunks into the upper pot or bowl of your double-boiler. Once the soap has melted, you may add dyes, fragrances, oils, anything else that the recipe requires.


Consider working with two-pound blocks. Batches of this size are the easiest to work with.Set your stove's heat to medium-low or medium. Be careful not to heat your soap too quickly."

Use high quality pots and pans made of heavy materials.,
Look for pots and pans with nonstick coatings.,
Make sure your stovetop is clean.,

Thoroughly season cast iron.,
Preheat oil in the pan before adding food.,
Use a burner that fits the pot or pan size.,
Heat sauces slowly.,
Stir frequently.,
Rotate the pot or pan.,
Try a “flame tamer.” A flame tamer, also known as a heat diffuser, is a metal plate that sits between your cookware and the burner.,
Deglaze burnt foods immediately.",How to Prevent Burning of Pots and Pans," As the saying goes, “you get what you pay for.” Cheap cookware is made from low quality materials that do not heat as evenly and, as a result, these pans are the quickest to burn. Invest in finer quality cookware, instead.


Three-ply pots and pans made with a stainless steel-aluminum-stainless steel composition are heavy and durable.
It is also easy to prevent burning in cast iron cookware, as long as it is well-seasoned beforehand.;
, Older pans do not usually have a nonstick surface, but many newer pans are made with Teflon, a smooth, conductive material that food does not stick to quite as easily.

, Residue from spilled sauces, sugary syrups, and other food will burn if exposed directly to the heat of the stovetop burner. This will be a hassle to clean off your stovetop, but more to the point, it could also end up burning to the bottom of your pots and pans. Wipe your burners down and scrape off any burnt, stuck-on chunks of food before each use in order to spare your pots and pans.

, It is possible that crumbs or other grime attached itself to the sides and bottoms of your cookware during storage. If these elements come into direct contact with the stove burner, they could end up burning onto the outside of the pan.

, If seasoned correctly, cast iron pots and pans are nearly stick-proof. Fat carbonizes in the pores of the metal. As a result, food cannot attach itself to the pans, which preventing it from burning the metal.


Coat the pan with lard or solidified bacon grease. You must use a solid fat. Do not use vegetable oil.
Put the pan into an oven preheated to 250 °F (121 °C). Bake the pan for 15 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven and dump out excess, liquid grease.
Place the pan back into the oven for another two hours.
Remove the pan, and then repeat the process over once or twice more to make sure that the fat thoroughly seeps into the pores of the pan.

, Any pan, regardless of the material, should be treated with oil before you begin the cooking process. Like solid lard, oil seeps into the pores of the metal when exposed to high temperatures, creating a sort of nonstick coating.


Pour enough oil into the pan to provide a thin coating over the bottom. Heat it over medium to medium-high heat.
Add food only after thin wisps of vapor appear. The oil must be this hot in order to create a seep into the metal thoroughly enough to prevent sticking.

, This is especially important for gas stoves, since flames that lick up along the sides of the pot or pan are more likely to cause liquids and solids to stick to the side. If you do not have a burner that fits the precise size of your cookware, opt for a burner that is slightly smaller over one that is too large.

, Spaghetti sauce, sugary syrups, cheese or dairy based sauces, and many other thick sauces are likely to burn quickly if heated too fast. Bring these sauces up to boiling slowly, starting them on a low to medium heat instead of a high heat. Only allow the liquid to boil as long as necessary according to your recipe's instructions.

, Constant stirring is especially important in preventing sauces from sticking to your pots, but you should also stir, turn, and flip solid foods like meat and vegetables. When food sits in one spot to long, the side that faces the metal is more likely to burn and leave behind a burnt residue.

, Some burners may not distribute heat evenly, especially if you have an old, worn out stove. Rotating your cookware prevents high heat from directing itself on one spot for too long.

, It controls the distribution of heat, leading to even cooking and thereby preventing excessive burning.

, Even if you take as many precautions as possible, you may still end up burning food occasionally. You can reduce the likelihood of this food burning your pots and pans by deglazing the cookware immediately after you finish cooking with it.


Remove your used, empty cookware from the stove while it is still hot.
Add 1 cup of cold water to the pot or pan.
Return the cookware to the stove and heat the water over medium heat.
Use a metal spatula to gently encourage burnt food to lift from the bottom. The heated water alone may be enough in many cases, but a metal spatula can assist you for more stubborn residue.

",How to Organize and Store Pot Lids," Before you begin to find a home for the lids, take inventory of what you currently have and use.


Discard any sets that are damaged, peeling or cracked.
Match a lid to each pot or pan.;
, Determine if every pot and pan has a home in your kitchen. This is also a good time to identify the best fit for pots and pans as some cabinets may be a better home than others.


Use the deep, tall cabinets for your larger stock pots and pans (like woks).
Size up the flow of how you plan to house your pots and pans. Is putting the large stock pots in the cabinet next to saucepans work going to be the best position for how you cook? Think about the pots you use the most and place them in a cabinet that is most convenient to you when you cook.

, Like your pots and pans, not all lids are the same shape and size. For an easy assessment, make three different piles--small, medium and large lids.

, Hold the lids up to the door to give you a rough idea of how many lids may fit.


Take width into consideration when doing your assessment.
Try to match the lid to the pot or pan located in that particular cabinet.
Measure the cabinet doors to help you determine the rack length.

, Head to the home store and pick up mountable towel racks that will mounted on the back of each cabinet door. You should have an idea of the length of the cabinet door and the number of racks needed for your project.


Choose a heavy-duty rack so that it holds the lids in place.
Read the directions on how the rack will be mounted to ensure the system won’t interfere with the cabinet door (i.e. drilling a screw or nail that could puncture the outside of the cabinet).

, Make sure you have a very sturdy fit before sliding your pot lids into place. The lid should slide downward and get caught in the rack by the lid top.

Find the brand.,
Buy it.",How to Find Great Espresso Equipment," The espresso machine, the most important part. For this guy, you need to really dig deep. You need to get pretty down into the info for all of these, but the machine will be all good if you know it.


First decide what you want. If you just want a decent, quick morning shot every day, you might not want professional coffee-house gear. You need to decide on your espresso budget, how often you will use it, your skill level, how automatic you want it, how hard it is to clean, and accessories. You could also look at a top-ten espresso machines list. Make note of what you want.;
, Are you going to buy it from Walmart, or Best Buy (the retail stores probably won't sell top quality), or get it shipped from Italy? One good source for the espresso machine, and possibly everything on this list, is online shopping. Online shopping with shipping, and everything. Ebay will be good.

, Look up something like ""Espresso machine frother semi automatic cheap"". You should use Google. Just type in what specs you want, and hit enter. A lot of times, you will have to dig through some options before you find the right one.

, Here comes the fun part. (If you are going to buy from a retailer, don't order, just go and buy it.) Ordering the espresso machine. Go to eBay, and find whatever company, and model you decided on. Place the order. Now for the next part.

, The key is freshness. Grind your beans within 15 days of roasting, and use your grounds within 15 minutes of grinding. First find out what kind of grinder you want. This will probably never be as specific as an espresso machine. You can choose from electric blade (terrible for espresso), manual blade (again, terrible), electric burr (now that's good), and manual burr (arguably better).

, Don't go Mr. Coffee. They don't know espresso, as much as other brands. You should choose a brand that has good rep. Read reviews. Go to a top ten list.

, Go to eBay again. Unless you want to go to a retail store. Place the order, preferably around the same time you ordered your espresso machine.

Any hot ingredients should be cooled to room temperature before adding them to the food processor.
Chop large ingredients into smaller chunks to help them blend more easily., First, secure the lid onto the food processor. Most food processors won’t run until the lid is firmly in place. Next, begin processing your food. Most food processors have a “pulse” button and a “run” button. These buttons can be used to chop, blend, or liquefy food.


The “run” button blends things continuously. This button is usually used to create mayo, blend ingredients into a smooth soup, or create chunk-free sauces.
The “pulse” button is usually used to chop food. The processor will only run when you’re holding the button down. Press the button in one second intervals until the food is chopped the way you like it.If your processor has more than two buttons, refer to your manufacturer manual for usage tips.

, Some recipes ask you to add certain ingredients slowly throughout the blending process. If your food processor has a tube on the lid, you can add the ingredients while the processor is running. Use the plastic or metal tamper to press food into the processor.If your food processor doesn’t have a tube, turn off the processor and remove the lid to add any additional ingredients.

, Once you’ve completed your recipe, pour it into a serving dish. Next, move the plastic parts and blades into your sink and wash them with soap and water. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the electric part, removing any smears of food or liquid.Let the parts dry before reassembling the food processor.
Never submerge the electric section in water, especially when it’s plugged in. It will ruin the food processor and potentially electrocute you.
Never handle the sharp part of the processing blades.

Insert the S-shaped blade.,
Choose the slicing disk.,
Use the grater attachment.,
Knead dough with the dough blade.",How to Use a Food Processor2," The S-shaped blade is the standard food processing blade that every model comes with. This blade can be used to chop fruits and vegetables, puree soups and sauces, and grind dry ingredients into a powder.


If a recipe doesn’t specify a blade attachment, use this blade.

, The slicing disk is an attachment that sits near the lid of the food processor. This attachment is usually connected to the blade mount with a long, plastic, detachable stem.The slicing disk is used to slice fruits and vegetables into thin, circular pieces. For example:


Slice peeled potatoes into thin disks for scalloped potatoes or potato chips.

Slice a variety of vegetables such as zucchini, sweet potatoes, and carrots into thin slices for veggie chips.
Use the disk to slice raw Brussel sprouts. Add them to a fresh salad for a healthy crunch.

, Like the slicing disk, the grater attachment sits near the lid of the food processor. Some models of food processors combine the grating and slicing attachment. If so, you will have to flip the slicing disk over to use the grating feature. This attachment can be used to grate large amounts of food at once. For example:


Instead of grating a block of cheese by hand, use your food processor to quickly grate the entire thing.
Grate a variety of cabbage, beets, and carrots for your favorite coleslaw recipe.
Quickly shred a few potatoes for a batch of latkes or hash browns., Some higher end food processors come with a dough blade attachment. This attachment is usually placed on the blade mount in the same position as the S-shaped blade.This blade can be used to knead:


Pizza dough
Pasta dough
Pie dough
Bread dough

Blend the Nutella into the frozen banana and serve it immediately.For a stronger Nutella flavor, add several dollops of Nutella.
Top your scoops of banana Nutella “ice cream” with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and cherries.

, Hummus is a creamy bean dip that has roots in Mediterranean cuisine. First, add your hummus ingredients into your food processor and run it until the mixture is smooth. Next, transfer the hummus into a serving bowl. Serve the hummus with a variety of chopped vegetables, pita bread, crackers, and olives. If you don’t have a favorite hummus recipe, consider using:


2 cups (80 grams) of drained canned or cooked chickpeas

3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons of tahini
1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice
1 clove of garlic
1 teaspoon of salt
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, Fresh, all-natural nut butters can be easily made in your food processor. First, add a few handfuls of your favorite raw or toasted nut. Next, run the blender until the nuts are chopped into a fine powder. Add a few tablespoons of an unflavored oil, such as safflower oil. Blend the mixture for another 8-10 minutes to create a smooth, creamy nut butter.


You can use peanuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, cashews, hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, or pistachios.
Once your nut butter is ready, transfer it to a jar and keep it refrigerated., Save time chopping vegetables by using your food processor instead. For a smooth salsa, add all the ingredients at once and run the blender until the mixture is puréed. For chunky salsa, pulse the ingredients until the salsa looks the way you like it.Use onions, jalapenos, and tomatoes to make a chunky pico de gallo salsa.

Add dried or canned chipotle peppers to your favorite salsa recipe for a smoky, spicy kick.
Blend salsa vegetables and cheese together to make a creamy salsa and queso dip.

Clean your blender after each use.,
Unscrew the blade assembly and thoroughly clean the blender.,
Wipe with a soft cloth after cleaning, taking care not to touch the blades.,
Troubleshoot specific problems with your blender.",How to Maintain Your Blender," In most cases, an incorrectly assembled blender just won't work or won't work well, but sometimes, loose parts could fly out or you could damage the blender.;
, Despite the popularity of the ""Will it Blend"" series, you're best off using your blender for its intended use. If you do use a blender for making paper or some other non-food purpose, use a separate, inexpensive blender that you won't mind losing.

, You can leave things in fairly large chunks, but make sure they are at least small enough to fit into the bottom part of your blender. Smaller chunks will blend easiest and handle the best.

, If you're not getting good results, pour out some of what you're blending into a separate bowl or other container, and only blend a little bit at a time. Blending too much is similar to trying to chew with too much in your mouth.

, Add plenty of liquid to the mix that you're blending. A mixture that is too dry will behave like a paste and push up away from the blades. This is not necessarily harmful, but it's not too effective, either. Depending on what foods you're blending, you may add different liquids: water, milk, fruit juice, soup stock, and so on.

, Most blenders also have continuous and intermittent (pulse) modes.

, Some blenders are self cleaning but if not, simply remove the vessel from the base pour water and soap or vinegar into the vessel and run it on ""pulse"" for a few moments. The base of the blender is an electrical device. Under no circumstances should water be placed in this assembly, and it should never be submerged in water. See warnings, below.

, You don't have to do this every time you use the blender, just every few times.

, Make sure the blender has ample time to dry, and reassemble the blender with the rubber gasket or seal on the correct side of the blade assembly.

,


Replace worn, bent, or dulled blades. They can't generally be sharpened.
Replace a broken or cracked pitcher. Most manufacturers offer replacements for sale.
If you have difficulty selecting different speeds, refer to your manual to make sure you are doing it right. Otherwise, service the speed control switch or have it serviced.
If the blades do not rotate, make sure it is plugged in and that the outlet has power. Make sure you have correctly selected a speed and turned the blender on. If you have checked all these things, suspect either the switch or the motor.
If the cutter shaft sticks, remove the jug, turn it upside down, and spray maintenance spray over the blades.
Check under the jug periodically to make sure that the little tabs at the base are all intact. If one or more are broken then you will need to replace the jug.

Place the fruit into the squeezer.,
Bring the handles together.,
Squeeze the handles.",How to Use a Citrus Squeezer," Select a fresh, ripe fruit. Choose a fruit that’s slightly (and evenly) soft, but not mushy. Avoid juicing a fruit that feels hard.The harder the fruit, the more difficult it will be to juice.
The heavier the fruit feels, the juicier it will be!The best citrus fruit has a rind free of blemishes, and a bold, sweet scent.;
, Leave it sitting at room temperature until it is no longer cold to the touch.Warm the fruit in the microwave, on high, for twenty to thirty seconds, if desired. Allow it to cool for one minute.Warm fruit is easier to juice.
Warming the fruit is especially useful if it was refrigerated.

, Hold the fruit against a countertop or other surface. Apply gentle pressure. Roll the fruit back and forth.Rolling the fruit loosens its inner segments, to prepare the fruit for juicing.

, Make the cut a bit off-center.Cut the fruit lengthwise if it will fit that way into your squeezer.If not, cut the fruit crosswise, then slice off pointy tip of the rind (if applicable).You can get more juice out of fruits like lemons and limes by cutting them lengthwise instead of crosswise.
Cutting off the rind tip will give you more leverage for using a manual squeezer.

, Make sure to place the cut side of the fruit facing down. The interior dome of the squeezer should press towards the rind-end of the fruit.Placing the cut side face-down may appear counter-intuitive at first. However, if you leave the cut side facing up, the juice will squirt upwards!

, Hold the squeezer over a bowl. Place the bottom handle in your non-dominant hand. Press down the top handle with your dominant hand, until the handles are close enough together that you can grip them with both hands at once.If you know exactly how much fruit you need to juice, you can skip the separate container and squeeze directly into a pot or other cookware., Place one hand in front of the other. Grip the handles of the squeezer with both hands at the same time. Squeeze several times, until juice stops flowing from the squeezer.The squeezer will invert the rind so that it’s almost inside-out.

Choose a food processor if you love to cook.",How to Decide Whether to Use a Blender or a Food Processor," Blenders are suitable for mixing soft food and liquids into smoothies, soups, sauces, shakes, and liquid-based dips. Use a blender for such kitchen jobs as pureeing, emulsifying, and blending.Blenders are good for a speedy snack such as a protein smoothie whereas food processors tend to be slower paced and get better use when making large meals.;
, Pour one or two cups of milk or water into the blender, followed by the fruits and vegetables of your choosing. Wait at least 10 seconds until the mix is completely liquified. Blenders liquefy fruit well (unless it is really hard fruit).The blades on blenders are not razor sharp. The motor is the powerhouse behind blending the food. Because of the dull blades, a blender is great for blending liquids and substances that are borderline-liquid.

, Pour one and a half cups of warm or hot water into your blender. Add vegetables and spices to the blender according to the recipe you choose. Blend your mixture on high for about one and a half minutes or until smooth., Fill your blender with the fruits, fruit juice, liquor, and ice your cocktail recipe entails, but make sure the fruit you add is fresh and not canned. Cut the fruit into 1-inch pieces, and add them to the mixture first. Add the ice last, mix it up, pour your drink into a cocktail glass, and garnish your cocktail any way you like!Blenders are often found behind the bar as an essential for making cocktails.

, Consider whether you need both or only one piece of equipment in the kitchen for making everyday meals. If you're not a huge cook or eat out a lot, a food processor might not be the right choice for you. It is possible to get by with a blender, as food processors tend to be expensive.

, Food processors are not the best for mixing small amounts of foods. The wider work bowl of a processor makes it more suitable for larger, bulk processing over the blender. Use your food processor when making larger meals that might involve grating cheese, chopping vegetables or kneading pie crusts., Unlike blenders, food processors have razor sharp blades. A food processor is much more versatile and is suitable for dealing with non-liquid, heavier foods.

, Pick the type of blade you would like to use, the S blade is best for chopping vegetables, and attach it on the inside of the food processor. You can prep vegetables, and it's also an easy way to chop onions without crying.The food processor will chop, julienne, pulverize, mash, and split foods. Your blender, on the other hand, will probably start smoking if you force it to try to do these things.

, Attach the grating disc, also called the shredding disc, to the top of the bowl on your food processor. Use this attachment to grate cheese, bread or vegetables., Put nuts without their shells into your food processor when using the grinding blade. The food processor will soon turn the nuts into butter., Pick a food processor that's solid and sturdy if you plan to use it to knead dough. Connect the kneading attachment to knead dough for pie crusts and more., Food processors are pretty much indispensable for a good cook who likes to experiment across a wide range of recipes. If you're always having dinner parties, a food processor would help with the meals.If you can't afford one, wait for the sales when good quality models from the year before can go for very reasonable prices.

Fill the Tall or Short Cup with the desired ingredients.,
Add liquid if you are making a drink.,
Place the blade you will be using on the cup.,
Press the cup blade side-down onto the Power Base.,
Tap or shake the cup to loosen stubborn ingredients.,
Use the re-sealable lids to save drinks.,
Wash the cup and lid on the top rack of any dishwasher.,
Wash the cup, lid, and blade with warm and soapy water.,
Wash the NutriBullet base with a damp rag.,
Clean stubborn, dry residue by blending soap in the NutriBullet.",How to Use a NutriBullet," There is one regular Extractor blade that has four sides, and one Milling blade with only a single blade. The Extractor blade is used to blend all fruits and vegetables into drinks, and the Milling blade is used to turn dry ingredients into powers. You will change this blade depending on what you are making, a drink or a powder.;
, A kitchen counter or table is best. Keep the NutriBullet base away from water when you are using it. Now, plug in the Power Base. This is the part of the NutriBullet you will plug in and will place the cup onto.

, Use fruits and vegetables that you like to make a nutritious drink, or fill the cup with ingredients you want to turn into powder, like nuts or seeds. The Tall Cup NutriBullet has the capacity to hold 24 ounces and the Short Cup has the capacity to hold 18 ounces. Do not fill the cup past the max line.


For nutritious drinks, add 50% fruit and 50% leafy greens. This will make a drink filled with vitamins.
Cut the vegetables or fruits in halves or quarters if they do not fit into the cup.
Fill the cup up with almonds or oats to make a powdery substance you can then eat in yogurt or on top of cereal.

, The amount of liquid you use will determine the consistency of your drink, so use less liquid for a chunkier drink. Never fill the cup past the fill line. You can use water, juice, almond milk, or any liquid of your choice.

, Once you place the ingredients of your drink or powder in the Tall or Short Cup, cap the cup with the Extractor or Milling blade. Press down and twist, screwing the blade on until it is securely attached to the cup.

, There are two notches on either side of the NutriBullet logo on the base. There are also two round protrusions on the cup with your ingredients; line up these notches and protrusions. Then, simply push the cup down, and your ingredients will mix.


Lift the cup up and out to stop it.
Mixing the ingredients should only take a few seconds.

, Sometimes, ingredients will get stuck, especially if you do not put enough liquid in the cup. Tap or shake the cup to loosen these ingredients so everything mixes together.


You can also add more liquid if desired by removing the cup from the Power Base, removing the blade, and then adding more liquid.
Feel free to shake or tap the entire NutriBullet without removing the cup from the base.

, Each NutriBullet comes with two re-sealable lids in case you do not finish your drink. Place them tightly on the cup, then refrigerate for up to 2 days., Do not place the blade or base in the dishwasher, however. Wash the cup and lids on a normal cycle.

, Use regular dish soap and warm water to rinse the cup and blade, but be careful handling the extremely sharp blade.

, Unplug the NutriBullet base before cleaning. Use a damp rag to wipe away any residue.

, Use the Milling Blade for this cleanup. Fill the cup 2/3 of the way with soap, then blend for 30 seconds. Any dry residue should come unstuck. Now, you can clean the NutriBullet in your regular fashion, by hand or in the dishwasher.

Look for the safety lock.,
Check the storage features.,
Make sure that the processor has the blades that you will use most frequently for your style of cooking.,
Decide what additional accessories you will use.,
Prefer a more expensive model if you use a food processor frequently.",How to Select a Food Processor," Play with it in the store to see if it is easy to use. Do the pieces of it appear and feel solid, or do they look as if they might break from difficulty of moving or poor quality? The safety lock feature is complicated and expensive to fix if it breaks.;
, It is really useful to have a storage space for the cord and to have ""on-board"" storage for any attachments, so that they are not lost or damaged during storage.

, Ask the assistant for advice if you are not sure which ones come with the food processor that interests you but generally processor blades include:


Sabatier blade - the standard ""S"" shaped blade
Shredding disc - shreds vegetables and fruits
Slicing disc - slices fruits and vegetables
Julienne disc - creates long thin vegetable and fruit cuts
Dough blade - the paddles are less curved than the sabatier blade
French fry disc - creates chips for frying
Purifier or juicer blades - these vary in type and purpose

, If your food processor already comes with the lot, you don't need to worry about ""added extras"" but if you're in the budget end of the market, your basic model might only come with basic blades and you will need to purchase additional more fancy versions. Ask yourself how likely you are to use additional blades before purchasing them, as they can end up being an expensive waste of money.

, For your extra money, you will get a stronger and more durable motor and gears, the processor will be quieter and more stable and it will be less likely to conk out on you with frequent heavy usage. This is especially important for catering work, as well as heavy home usage. Otherwise, if you are an infrequent user of a food processor, the lower end of the range will serve you well.

Soak a very dirty blender overnight.,
Allow the blender to air-dry.",How to Clean a Blender1," Fill the blender carafe halfway with warm water. Then, add a few drops of liquid dish detergent. Blend on a low setting for about a minute until the carafe is thoroughly sudsy. Then, pour out the soapy mixture and rinse until clean.








Make sure that the lid is secure! If the lid comes off, then you'll get soapy water everywhere!;
, Fill the blender halfway with water and a few drops of dish soap. Then, add half a lemon, coarsely chopped. Blend the mixture for a minute or so. The treatment should wash out the stains and leave the blender carafe looking fresh.








Alternately, use a few drops of white vinegar instead of the lemon. This may not smell as pleasant as the lemon, but it should be about as effective., Use a rough sponge, steel wool, or a toothbrush, depending on the strength of the caked-on matter. Put a bit of water and dish soap into the blender, and then chip away at the stains with your rubbing tool until they disappear.








, Use a mixture of baking soda, vinegar, and dish soap. First, pour a cup of white vinegar into the carafe. Then. add a few drops of liquid dish detergent and about a half-cup of baking soda. Let the mix bubble to the top and subside. Blend the mixture together, and then let it soak into the carafe for at least a few hours.








After a few hours have passed, pour the mixture out into the sink. Rinse out the blender carafe until it is completely clean. If the blender still smells like baking soda and vinegar, consider doing a quick blend-and-soak with only dish soap and water.

, After you clean the inside of the carafe, leave the jug upside-down on a drying rack. At the very least, wait to put the lid back onto the blender jug until the inside is completely dry. A moist interior can lead to condensation and provide an environment for bacterial growth.

Use an appropriate microwave.,
Locate the wall studs.,
Place the mounting plate.,
Locate and drill the correct attachment holes.,
Drill a 1.5"" – 2"" (4-5cm) hole for the power cord.,
Secure the mounting plate.,
Mount the microwave.",How to Install a Microwave1," A recirculating or front-venting microwave can be installed beneath a counter without any further effort. Other types may require more advanced ventilation installation. Be aware of the requirements of your model before you begin installation.


Other types of microwave may be more suited for an over the range installation, require a new ventilation hood, or even necessitate a full new ventilation system.;
, Follow these methods for finding and marking these vertical wall supports. Your microwave will need to be fastened to at least one of them.


If you have one, use an electronic or magnetic stud finder to search for nails.
Alternately, tap lightly on the wall with a hammer. When you hear a solid ""thunk"" instead of a hollow sound, you've likely found a wall stud.
If you're not certain whether you've found a stud, drill a test hole and use a bent wire or coat hanger to search for solid objects in your wall.Once you've located the center of one wall stud, its closest neighbors are usually located either 16 inches or 24 inches to each side.Use a small nail to probe the wall stud(s) and determine the width.Draw a vertical line down the center of the wall studs once you've found them.

, This flat metal plate should be level and the top tabs should butt against the base of the cabinet or cabinet frame.


If your microwave came with a wall template, tape that instead as a drilling guide before you attach the plate.
Use a level to ensure your microwave isn't installed at a slant.
Remove any decorative trimming from the cabinet preventing you from placing the mounting plate correctly.
If the front of the cabinet has an overhang, place the mounting plate below the back of the cabinet by an equal amount. Otherwise the overhang will block access to the microwave. For a microwave that requires base-of-cabinet attachments, you may need to saw off the overhang instead.

, Follow these steps to determine which size holes to drill and where.


The bottom edge of the plate should have an area covered in holes. Use a marker to draw circles in at least two holes. At least one should be completely over a wall stud to support the microwave's weight.
Locate the two or more holes along the upper edge of the microwave. Fill in these with a marker as well.
Remove the mounting plate. Use the circles you drew as a guide, not the mounting plate.
Drill a 3/16"" (5mm) hole through any circle located on a wall stud.Drill a 3/8"" (10mm) hole through any other circle.If your microwave came with a top template, tape it to the base of the cabinet above and drill 3/8""(10mm) holes through attachment points where directed to fasten the microwave to the cabinet base.

, If your microwave came with a base of cabinet template, tape this where the microwave top will be located and drill where instructed for the power cord. Otherwise, select a spot easily accessible by the power cord and out of the way of normal cabinet function.


If there are no electrical outlets within reach of the cord, you will need to install a new electrical outlet. Do not use an extension cord.

, Have an assistant hold the mounting plate securely in the correct position as you fasten it to the wall.


Use lag screws (lag bolts) in the 3/16""(5mm) holes. These will bear most of the microwave's weight, which is why they are used over the wall studs.
Use toggle screws (toggle bolts) in the 3/8""(10mm) holes. The ""wings"" of the toggle screw go through the hole and pull against the wall as the screw is tightened. Pull the mounting plate toward you while tightening toggle screws., With an assistant's help, hang the microwave onto the support tabs on the mounting plate's base.


Snake the power cable through the hole drilled for this purpose before attaching the microwave.
Fasten the microwave to the base of the cabinet above using screws where directed on the top template. Tighten until the top of the microwave and the base of the cabinet are flush.

Use a Q-tip to clean control buttons.,
Finished.








",How to Clean a Blender2," Soak a sponge or towel in warm, soapy water, and then wring it out until it is damp. Gently run the fabric over the base of the blender to clean off any places where food or liquid has spilled. Pay special attention to areas with dried or caked-on blended matter.









Do not wash the base! The base houses the electronic motor and control system for the appliance. These parts will not stand up well to extended moisture exposure. Keep your cleaning efforts purely to the exterior, and absolutely do not submerge the whole base in water.

, The base will be more difficult to clean once blended food and liquids have caked onto the surface. Certain substances might become sticky as they dry, and others might even stain the material!








, If there is a buildup of blended gunk in the cracks around the blender's control interface, then it might be hard to get everything out with a sponge or rag. Dip a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol, then use it to wipe around the gunky buttons. The rubbing alcohol should dissolve caked-on matter and leave your blender a bit more pleasant to use.








The rubbing alcohol should dry quickly and evaporate. If any moisture remains on the blender base, wipe it away with a dry towel.

Remove and clean separately.,
Use polident tablets.This is a good option if the blender blades are extremely dirty.,
Lubricate the gasket.",How to Clean a Blender3," If your blender blades are still dirty after you blend dish soap and clean the carafe, then you may need to wash them separately. Remove the blender jug from the base, and then unscrew the blades from the bottom of the blender jug. Hand-wash them with dish soap and hot water. Scrub with a sponge or toothbrush to remove tough bits.

, Remove the blades from the blender jug. Then, submerge them in water with one of two polident tablets. The polident should clear up any tough stains.If you don't want to remove the blades, you can always just clean them in the carafe. Pour in enough hot water to cover the blades, and then drop in two tablets of polident. Let soak for at least half an hour.
Polident is a commercial tooth-whitening and antibacterial agent. You should be able to find the tablets in drugstores and grocery stores.

, When you're putting the blades back into the blender, take a moment to care for the gasket: the rubber piece that separates the jug from the base. Pour a tablespoon of olive oil or vegetable oil over the gasket to make sure that it remains flexible."

Use a damp rag to clean the power base.,
Allow your power base to fully dry before using it again.",How to Clean a Nutribullet2," Before you clean the power base, it's important that there's no electricity running through your Nutribullet. Completely unplug the Nutribullet.Do not just turn it off, as it can still electrocute you if it gets wet.

, Get a rag wet under warm water and wring it out thoroughly. Use it to go over the surface of the power base and inside the interior. Remove any food that's built up or gotten stuck in the base of the blender.You can also use a citrus cleaner to clean the power base.


Citrus cleaners use the natural oils in citrus to remove deep stains or food buildup.
Citrus will also deodorize your power base.
Never submerge the power base into water.
Never put the power base into the dishwasher.

, Use a dry cloth rag to wash down your power base then allow the rest to air dry before using it again. You should wash your power base once a week, or whenever food spills onto the base.

Check every surface of your microwave for vents.,
Remove the turntable and any other loose objects from inside the microwave.,
Place the microwave in a recessed cabinet or on a shelf.,
Replace the turntable and plug the microwave in.,
Clean the microwave vents every three months or so.",How to Install a Microwave2," You don't need a special model of microwave to place it on a shelf, but you do need to know where the vents are for proper installation


Countertop models usually have vents on the sides and top of the microwave, but back panel vents are common as well.If you are having trouble finding the vents, place the microwave on a table, plug it in, and heat food or liquid inside. Place your hand near each side of the microwave to feel for blowing air.

, This is especially wise if your cabinet is high up, since the table can easily fall out of the microwave during lifting.

, Make sure the vents are not flush against any surfaces or objects. There should be at least an inch of space next to each vent., If the cord will not reach or is in an inconvenient location, temporarily remove the microwave and drill a small hole in the cabinet or shelf to snake the cord through.

, Because the cabinet does not allow as much air movement around the vents, dust will gradually build up and increase the risk of fire.Wipe the vents with a damp cloth while the microwave is turned off.

Microwave a lemon slice.,
Sprinkle baking soda on the microwave floor.,
Scrub the microwave's turntable.",How to Remove Odors from a Microwave," Put diluted vinegar, water, and a spoonful of salt in the microwave. Heat until it steams for at least thirty seconds.

Water can ""superheat"" in the microwave, causing an explosion when you touch the container. Stirring in salt prevents this from happening.If you're worried about this, wet a dishcloth thoroughly in water and vinegar and heat that instead for five minutes.
For light smells, even pure water can help. If your microwave has developed a more pungent odor, you may need a 50/50 mix of vinegar and water, or even more.;
, If you heated a vinegar mixture, dip a clean dishcloth into it and use it to scrub the microwave. Otherwise, just use soapy water — which is particularly effective at removing grime stuck to the walls.

, Cut a thick wedge of lemon and place it on a paper towel in the microwave. Zap it for one minute on full power. Besides covering smells, the citric acid may help loosen grime from the microwave walls.


A shallow saucer of lemon juice will also work.

, Leave the baking soda there overnight, with the microwave door shut. Wipe away the baking soda before using the microwave.

If the walls and ceiling of the microwave are grimy, wet a cloth, sprinkle with baking soda, and give them a good wipe.
You can also buy boxes of baking soda sold as ""odor absorbers"" or ""fridge fresheners"" at the grocery store. These require less cleanup, since you just leave the box open in the microwave.

, If you have your microwave's owner manual, check it to see if the turntable is dishwasher safe. If you're not sure, wash the turntable by hand in hot, soapy water."

Test the microwave.",How to Install an Over The Range Microwave," Before you go through the whole trouble of trying to install the microwave, make sure it has all of the parts it needs. Nothing’s more frustrating that getting right to the last step of installation and realizing you’re missing a bolt or other part you need.The microwave kit should include a list of parts. Go through and check what’s actually in the box against this kit.
If your kit is missing any parts, return to the store you bought it from to exchange it, or contact the manufacturer to order the component you lack.;
, Reading the instructions beforehand will give you an overview of the whole process. That way, you’ll not only understand what each step requires, but also think ahead to what comes next. This will reduce the chances of making a mistake during the installation process.If the instructions ask you to use a technique you’re not familiar with, consider contacting a professional for help.

, Since a microwave is an electrical appliance, you will need to take care to avoid electrocution or other damage. Before you start installation, go to your circuit breaker, and flip the breaker for the range to the “off” position., Most over the range microwaves include a short power cord that is designed to feed upwards into the cabinet that the appliance will sit underneath. Ideally, there will be an electrical outlet inside this cabinet that you can plug the power cord into.Your microwave’s installation instructions will specify whether there are acceptable alternative locations for the electrical outlet.
If there is not an outlet in a convenient location, contact an electrician for assistance installing one before you put the microwave in place.

, In general the bottom of the microwave should be no higher than 54 inches (140 cm) from the floor. In addition, there should be approximately 20 inches (51 cm) to 24 inches (61 cm) between the bottom of the microwave and the top of the range. This will allow you to use both the microwave and the range safely and comfortably.Use a tape measure to verify the height of your microwave.
Measure from the bottom of the cabinet you will install the microwave below to the height of the microwave. Make a mark at this spot.
Measure the distance between this mark and the floor, and the top of your range, to make sure that the microwave will be situated within the acceptable height range.

, The microwave itself will have a fan, and since it sits above the range (where a range hood would normally go), both appliances will have to ventilate outside together. Ordinarily, there are two options: either the appliances will ventilate horizontally through a tube in the wall, or vertically, first through the cabinet above the microwave and then the ceiling or higher up on the wall.Your microwave may have additional fittings which you should set in place in order to allow it to ventilate properly. Check the installation instructions that come with your particular model to be sure.
If you do not already have a ventilation system in place, contact a contractor to have one installed.

, If your kitchen cabinetry and framing are sturdy, they may be sufficient to support a relatively heavy over the range microwave. If the materials are less robust, reframe the area where you will install the microwave with two by fours. Some experts recommend reframing in all cases.Your microwave should come with a kit that has a framing template. Place it where you want the microwave to sit, and follow the guidelines to cut through the drywall.
Remove the drywall and pull out the insulation from the area inside the wall.
Secure two by fours between the wall studs. Check the instructions provided with your microwave for the exact dimensions.
Fill in any empty space with new insulation.

, Your model should come with a template to help guide you when installing mounting hardware. Place this on the wall, and the template should tell you where to place the hardware. Some models also come with a mounting bracket that will have pre-drilled holes so you can easily screw it in place.Use a level to make sure that the template is square and that the microwave will sit properly in place.

, If you didn’t reframe the installation site, you’ll need to attach the mounting hardware to at least one stud in the wall. Use an electronic stud finder, or gently tap on the wall with a hammer. When the taps sound dull instead of hollow, you have located a stud. Mark the site on the wall.Studs are usually 16 inches (41 cm) inches apart on the wall. Once you find one, measure 16 inches to the either side to mark others.
Using your template, make sure that the hardware will be mounted on at least one of the studs. If not, reframe the site or contact a contractor for help.

, Usually, over the range microwaves will be installed using toggle bolts. Predrilling holes for these bolts will make installation easier--just follow the guidelines on your template. If you are using a wall plate, go ahead and install that using the hardware and guidelines given in your model’s instructions.Most likely, you will need a couple of drill bits: smaller ones for the toggle bolts, and a larger one to make a hole to feed the microwave’s power cord through the cabinet above the appliance (if there isn’t already one). Check your model’s instructions, and always use the recommended tools.

, It will help to have another person to help you hold up the microwave. Push it up and bring it up to the bottom of the cabinet. If your model has a wall plate, fit it into the bracket that will help hold it in place. Make sure that someone keeps holding the microwave in place for now., Feed the microwave’s power cord through the hole drilled in the bottom of the cabinet above the appliance. Plug the cord into the outlet within the cabinet, but don’t turn the power back on yet., Feed the bolts (or screws) supplied with your microwave (or recommended by its instructions) into the holes you previously drilled in the bottom of the cabinet. They should slip into slots in the top of the microwave. Tighten them using a wrench (or screwdriver) until the microwave is securely held in place.Carefully let go of the microwave at this point to make sure that it stays in place.

, Slide the exhaust fan supplied with your microwave into place at the ventilation site. Specifications will vary from model to model, so read the instructions provided with yours. Most manufacturers also recommend using an approved sealant around the edges of the fan’s housing to make the connection impervious.You may need to take the fan out and change its direction, depending on the orientation of your ventilation system.

, At this point, you can finally flip the circuit for the range back to the “on” position. Verify that your microwave is getting power, and test it by heating something to make sure that the appliance is working properly.


If your appliance does not seem to work properly, read the troubleshooting section of the manual, if it has one, or contact the manufacturer.

Decide what type of microwave oven you want.,
Choose the size you want.,
Consider wattage.,
Settle on what features are important to you.,
Visit a store that sells kitchen appliances.",How to Buy a Microwave Oven,"


Countertop models are the most conventional kind of microwave. They range in size from 18 inches wide and 11 inches high (45.7 cm wide and 27.9 cm high) to 24 inches wide and 14 inches high (61 cm wide to 35.6 cm high). Countertop microwaves are the least expensive, but they take up the most counter space. They are also the most portable.
Built-in models are placed inside cabinets or worked into the construction of counters. In many cases, built-in microwaves come with an oven and are placed over the stove range. The sizes of built-in models are comparable to that of countertop microwaves, but they are more costly. In the case of over-the-stove designs, the microwaves may have a vent on the bottom to act as a stove hood and ventilation system.
Convection models are more advanced than traditional microwaves in that they are faster and able to bake and roast foods. They are much more expensive than the other two types.;
,


In addition to the width and height of the microwave, you will need to decide on the capacity of the appliance. Microwaves that take up a lot of space do not necessarily have the most inside cubic space. If you are looking for a microwave that can fit certain sized plates or containers, make sure to examine the cubic space of the microwave.

, A higher wattage will cook foods faster. Most microwaves have power that falls between 600 to 1200 watts. Recipes written for the microwave usually specify power of at least 800 watts so the foods cook evenly.

,


Auto settings allow you to push a single button to cook commonly microwaved items such as popcorn or potatoes. Defrost options allow you to enter the type of food and its weight and it will calculate how long and at what power level to run.
The power rating, or wattage, of the microwave determines how much energy the device uses. Larger oven tend to have more wattage than smaller ovens.
The inside of the microwave will either have a turntable-like plate or a glass tray for placing your food onto. Rotating is an important part of microwave cooking, but the type of rotation varies from model to model. There are some models that come with removable cooking racks for browning foods.
The noisiness of microwaves can be determined by examining the ""sones"" rating. If the oven has a low sones rating, it is quieter.

,


Open the microwaves and get a feel for the different designs. If you want to see how one works, ask a salesperson to help you.

Know the type of blender to buy.,
Know what brand of blender to buy.,
Find a store in your location.",How to Buy a Blender," There are many different types, brands, and models of blenders. Jar blenders are most popular because they are simple to operate and cost less. Multifunction blenders such as a hand or immersion blender are more versatile, but cost more. They usually have basic pureeing, mixing and blending features. While most hand blenders are electric, cordless models add more convenience to this widely used kitchen tool.


You should decide what features you would like as well, such as pureeing, stirring, blending, mixing, chopping, grinding, or creaming. You should also consider the power, wattage, and quality of materials in a blender before buying.;
, Now that you know what type of blender you want to buy, you should pick out a few favorite brands that you trust. Black and Decker is a blender brand that makes simple, basic designed blenders for $30-$80 in price. Cuisinart makes complex blenders that can often double as a food processor. These blenders have many interchangeable parts and settings. Prices range from $50-$150. Hamilton Beach blenders can be fancy or plain. This brand is known for its Wave Action System Technology and its Dual Action Blender. Prices range from $20-$100. KitchenAid blenders are high in quality and often last a long time. They produce premium blenders for $60-$270. Vita-Mix blenders are a bit pricey, but can make whipped cream, cookie dough, and guacamole in second. They sell for about $400.

, Finding a store is the next step. Most blenders are sold at department, specialty, or through online stores. Stores like Target, Walmart, Best Buy, or Amazon.com have the widest variety of styles, brands, and colors. Ordering a blender over the phone or through other retailers can be a bit expensive and delivery takes some time.

Defrost foods at a reduced power level.,
Steam foods in short intervals.",How to Cook in a Microwave Oven," Some foods take longer than others to cook. Specifically, larger and thicker foods will need longer than thinner and smaller foods. To prevent large food from undercooking and small food from overcooking, separate the food and cook it separately.Starchy vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes tend to need the longest cooking time, followed by meat, and then smaller vegetables need the shortest time.;
, You can decrease the time a food needs to cook in the microwave by cutting it into smaller portions. Large chunks of meat, for instance, will cook faster if you cut them into strips or smaller portions first.

Foods you may want to chop before cooking include potatoes (unless you're baking them), other large vegetables, and large cuts of meat.

, Foods that have skins can hold in steam, and if there's nowhere for the steam to vent, the food may pop open or splatter. To prevent this, use a fork or sharp knife to poke a few holes in foods with skins, including:Sausages
Potatoes
Sweet potatoes
Hot dogs

, Find a microwave-safe dish or plate for cooking. Spread the food out in a single layer with the thickest part of the food facing away from the center of the dish. This will ensure even cooking time, because food around the outer edges will cook faster than food closer to the center.Microwave-safe dishes will be labeled as such, but glass and ceramic are usually safe to microwave, even if they aren't labelled.Don’t microwave metal containers or utensils.

, For microwave dishes that have lids, put the lid on the dish and leave a crack open for steam to escape. Otherwise, cover the dish with a damp towel or paper towel. Covering food in a microwave is important for a number of reasons, including that it:

Helps to ensure even cooking
Keeps the food moist and prevents it from drying outPrevents the food from splattering

, Close the door of the microwave. To set the microwave, you may have to select Cook Time, then set the timer, and then press Start. Cook small vegetables in one-minute intervals, larger veggies in two-minute intervals, and meat in three-minute intervals. Stir between each cooking session to distribute the heat., Once your food is cooked, close the microwave door and leave the food in there to rest. This will give the food time to complete the cooking process. Vegetables and casseroles should stand for five to 10 minutes, and meat will need 10 to 15., When you cook recipes that were designed for other cooking methods, you may have to make some adjustments to cook them in the microwave. That includes omitting the oil from recipes that call for meat or vegetables to be seared or browned in a pan with oil.

Foods don’t brown in the microwave the way they do in a pan, so the oil is unnecessary, and may change the flavor of the dish., Less evaporation occurs in the microwave than with other cooking methods, so you need less water. When you cook a recipe in the microwave that wasn’t designed for the microwave, reduce the liquid in the recipe by about one-half.This includes soups, stews, and other recipes that have water as an ingredient.

, Cooking food in the microwave brings out the flavor of any spices you use, so you don’t need as much salt, herbs, and seasonings. To adjust recipes, cut the salt and seasoning quantities in half.

Before serving your dish, test it for flavor and add more spices if necessary., Microwaves also cook food faster than other methods do, so you'll need to adjust the cooking time for non-microwave recipes. A good rule of thumb is to cut the cooking time by a quarter. After that time, test the food for doneness, and add more time if necessary., It is possible to cook meat in the microwave, but you have to adjust the approach. Start with meat that’s room temperature. Pat it dry to remove excess moisture. Season with a bit of salt and pepper, if desired. Place the meat on a microwave-safe plate and cook it on medium for five to seven minutes. Flip the meat once during the cooking time.

Don’t use any oil to brown the meat, as microwaves cannot brown food., Toasting nuts is better in the oven or in a pan, but you can use the microwave to do this as well. Spread the nuts out in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate. Toast the nuts on high for six to eight minutes, but stop the microwave every minute to stir them.Smaller nuts like pine nuts may be done after six minutes, but larger nuts, such as walnuts, will need more time.

, There are two tricks to using the microwave to bake cakes and other desserts, and the first is to cook only single servings at a time. The second trick is to reduce leavening agent quantities by a quarter. Make your batter with the reduced quantity of leavening agents, and pour single servings into individual mugs or ramekins.

Leavening agents are ingredients that cause doughs and cakes to rise. They include yeast, baking soda, and baking powder.Cut the baking time by a quarter, and add extra time if necessary.

, Rinse a cup (195 g) of rice under running water. Transfer the drained rice to a microwave dish. Add enough water to cover the rice with an inch (2.5 cm) of liquid. Cover the dish with a lid or damp towel and microwave the rice for nine minutes.

After nine minutes, let the rice stand for three minutes before serving., Microwaves are ideal for safely defrosting frozen foods. Place your frozen food on a microwave-safe plate and heat it using the defrost setting. This will heat the food using only 30 to 40 percent of the power, and will thaw the food rather than cooking it.

Defrosting will require seven to eight minutes per pound of frozen food., The microwave is ideal for steaming vegetables and other foods. Cut your veggies into equal chunks. Place the chunks into a microwave dish, along with a tablespoon (15 ml) of water. Cover the dish with a slightly open lid or damp towel. Microwave the veggies in two-minute intervals until cooked.Stir the veggies between intervals to ensure even cooking.

To choose the right size for you, first establish where you will place your oven. Then, consider how large your kitchen counter is and how much food you expect to be cooking.


Measure the space where you plan to put your microwave prior to purchasing the appliance.;
, The internal capacity of a microwave can range from less than 1 cubic foot to over 2 cubic feet. This will typically be listed on the box when you buy the appliance and can help you determine whether your favorite dishes will fit inside the microwave., Wattage is key here: higher wattage ovens typically cook food faster and more evenly than lower wattage ovens. Larger microwave ovens usually offer a higher wattage (power) than smaller ovens. Wattage is listed on the box the microwave comes in., There are many different kinds of microwaves on the market. Learn about what each type can offer you so you can make an informed decision:Countertop microwave ovens. These take up counter space but are typically cheaper and easier to install than the other two options.
Over-the-range microwave ovens. Microwaves in this category are vented to the outside and typically require installation by an electrician. On the plus side, they free up counter space.
Built-in microwave ovens. These are designed to be built into a wall or surrounded by cabinetry. They are a great option if you don’t have counter space, since they can be installed in a microwave drawer under the countertop and they can glide out when you need to warm your food. They are more expensive, ranging from $350-$1500, but can look more streamlined than the other types.

Some countertop microwaves will have a build-in option.



, Pricing for microwave ovens can vary significantly depending on the type, size, and brand of microwave. For example, a midsized countertop microwave could cost you anywhere from $70-$500. Set a maximum for how much you’re willing to spend and refrain from going over that amount.

, You can find great deals by searching for used microwaves on websites like Craigslist or eBay. Keep an eye out for yard sales as well, since people who are moving will often drop prices just to get rid of the items quickly. Some stores also offer scratch and dent appliances, which may have damage to the exterior but are often cheaper and can look and work like new.


Thoroughly inspect any used microwave you are considering purchasing. Ask the seller if they can demonstrate that the microwave works, and look to buy a microwave from a seller who offers at least a 14-day return policy.

, Prior to purchasing a microwave oven, look up the models you are considering online and read reviews by other users. This will allow you to gauge the efficiency, ease of use, and longevity of the appliance at no cost to you. Look up user reviews of the specific model you’re thinking of buying on Amazon. The manufacturer’s website will often also feature customer reviews.

, Microwave ovens offer a variety of features such as defrosting or specialized cooking buttons such as a popcorn setting or a TV dinner setting. These can take the guesswork out of your meal planning and preparation and thus can simplify the cooking process.

, The advantage of using this type of oven is that you don't have to stop and turn the dish while cooking. The turntable does this for you automatically, allowing your food to cook evenly.

, Microwaves that don't have metal racks often only heat up the top layer of food, so you end up with a dish that is half warm, half cold. A metal rack will elevate the food. The heat will then be distributed evenly around your dish, allowing all of your food to heat. With this feature, then, your food will cook more evenly."

Find a light bulb that reacts to microwaves.,
Darken the room.,
Put a glass of water in the microwave.,
Turn on the microwave.,
Move the object slowly around the microwave.,
Look for a reaction.",How to Check a Microwave for Leaks1," Certain objects react to microwave frequencies:


A straight fluorescent light bulb (not a compact one)A neon ""NE-2"" bulb from an electronics store, powered and hooked up to a voltage divider so it is just barely glowingCheap, consumer-grade microwave testers are often inaccurate, but fine as a first testA professional-grade microwave tester can cost several hundred dollars USD.This is only necessary in professional contexts.;
, If you are using a light bulb, dim the lights so you'll be able to see the bulb glow. Skip this step if you are using a microwave testing device.

, Running an empty microwave exposes the magnetron (power source) to high power levels, which can damage or destroy it. A small glass of water (roughly 275 mL / a little over 1 cup) will reduce this risk, while still leaving plenty of un-absorbed microwaves to test for leaks.This is especially important for older microwaves, which may have lower quality shielding around the magnetron., Set it to run for one minute.

, Hold the light bulb or tester at least 5 cm (2 inches) away from the surface of the microwave, including the handle. Move the object slowly (about 2.5 cm / 1 inch per minute) around the door seal and any areas that look damaged.The microwave's power decreases rapidly with distance. Consider testing it at the distance you normally stand from the microwave, for instance the edge of the kitchen counter.
If the microwave stops before you are done, replace the glass of water and run the oven for another minute.

, If your microwave leaks, the fluorescent tube will glow, or the neon bulb will become noticeably brighter. Electronic testers react in different ways, so check the manual. If the tester displays a measurement, anything about 5 mW/cm2 at a distance of 5 cm (2 inches) is cause for concern.All of these methods are just quick tests, even the consumer-grade tester. These results do not necessarily mean your microwave is dangerous, but it does mean it's worth taking steps to address the problem.

Unplug your microwave from the power socket.,
Prepare the computer.,
Find your computer's IP address.,
Place the laptop in the microwave.,
Ping from the other device.,
Wait for a response.",How to Check a Microwave for Leaks2," Some WiFi networks use roughly the same frequency as microwave ovens (about 2.4 GHz), so the oven's shielding should block the WiFi too.To test whether the oven can do this as intended, you'll need a laptop that fits inside your microwave, plus a second device that can connect to your home WiFi network.


The instructions below assume you are using two computers, but you can use WiFi-enabled phones instead if you know how to use them to ping each other.

, If you're not sure how to change your WiFi frequency, access your router settings and look for the ""802.11 mode"" info (usually under advanced settings):802.11b or 802.11g means you are on a 2.4 GHz network. Continue to the next step.
802.11a or 802.11ac means you are on a 5 GHz network. Some routers give you the option to switch to another standard. If your router does not have this option, this test won't work.
802.11n can operate on either frequency. Look for the frequency setting and set it to 2.4GHz. If the router produces two WiFi networks, one of these is 2.4Ghz.

, Remove the whole electric plug from the wall socket rather than simply turning off the switch. You'll be putting your computer inside the microwave, and the last thing you want is to accidentally turn the oven on.

, Turn your laptop on and connect to the local WiFI connection. Check the energy saver or display settings so the computer won't go to sleep while it's in the microwave.

, You'll need this to send a signal to your laptop. Here's how to find it:


Windows: Open Control Panel. Go to Network and Sharing... → View network connections → select your WiFi connection → click the chevron to expand (if necessary) → View status of this connection → Details. Look for the number next to ""IPv4.""Mac: Open System Preferences. Click Network. Select WiFi on the left and find your IP address on the right.

, Do not turn the microwave on! You're just testing whether the microwave's shielding can block the WiFi signal.

, Open Command Prompt (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac). Type ping, then a space, then your computer's IP address. For example, type ping 192.168.86.150.

, If the ping is answered, the computer has successfully returned the signal through the microwave door. This means your microwave is leaking. If the packets time out, the microwave has blocked the signal from returning. This is not a guarantee that your microwave isn't leaking (since the microwave in operation produces much more powerful waves), but it is a good sign.


Microwaves are legally allowed to leak a certain, safe amount. If your router is in the same room as your microwave or on the other side of a wall, a working ping doesn't necessarily mean a dangerous leak. As a rough estimate, a router with a strong signal strength (-40 dBm) should be at least 20 feet (6m) from the microwave (based on US and Canada regulations)."

Check the seals around the door.,
Take the microwave to a professional repair shop.,
Report a leaking microwave.,
Understand the danger.",How to Check a Microwave for Leaks3," Microwave leaks are often the result of worn or broken elements on the microwave oven's door. If you have detected a leak, look for these common causes:


Cracks on the hinges
Worn areas or cracks on the seal
Dents or breaks in the door itself
Broken door hinges or door that fails to close firmly
Damage to the metal mesh of the door (especially holes wider than 4.7 in / 12 cm)
Broken door latch that does not immediately turn off the oven when you open the door., An electronics repair shop has access to much more accurate microwave testing equipment. Its staff can confirm whether your microwave is safe, and identify the problem in need of repair.


You may be able to convince a repair shop to rent you the testing equipment for a smaller fee.However, these devices do require calibration and training to use, so hiring a professional may give more accurate results.

, If your microwave is leaking, especially if it is new and undamaged, consider contacting the manufacturer. In the United States, all manufacturers are required to pass on your report to the FDA.You can also report it to the FDA directly at this form.


Outside of the US, report the issue to consumer safety organizations or government health departments.

, Microwave radiation is the same kind of ""radiation"" as visible light and radio waves, not the ionizing radiation that can cause cancer or radioactivity. The only known risk of a leaking microwave is the high levels of heat it produces. This is most dangerous to the eye (where it can lead to cataracts) and the testes (where it can cause temporary sterility).Extreme levels of microwave radiation can cause skin burns. If you do not notice any symptoms and you stop using the leaking microwave, lasting damage is very unlikely.

Purchase a dish specifically for microwave browning.,
Place the empty dish into the microwave.,
Place your food browning side down in the dish.,
Set the microwave settings on high.,
Cook for the amount of time suggested in your manual.,
Check for browning.,
Remove from heat.",How to Brown Food in a Microwave Oven1," Browning dishes typically have small feet on the bottom of the dish, are made of glass or ceramic, and have a grid-like pattern on the bottom. These elements make it possible for the microwave to concentrate heat on the grid, browning your food.

Select a trusted brand. While you could use an off brand or unknown brand, it may be harder to find instructions, seek customer support, and find replacement parts.;
, Because browning in a microwave requires specific cooking components (typically a strip of metal caging along the bottom of the dish), you must first heat up these components before placing your food in the microwave.The amount of time required to heat the cookware will depend on your dish. Check the manufacturer’s notes to determine how long the dish needs to warm up.

, Place whichever side of the food you want to brown down in the dish. This will place the food directly over the cooking material and encourage the microwave heat to focus on that spot.

If you want an all-over brown, simply complete these steps on one side, then repeat on the other side.

, To brown in the microwave, your machine must be set on “high.” Lower settings will not concentrate enough heat. If you typically use presets, make sure the presets also provide high heat., Your cooking time will depend on the type of food you are cooking, the dish you are using, and the microwave you are cooking in. Check your owner’s manual to determine the amount of time required to cook--both the owner’s manual for your browning tool and your microwave.

If you do not have your manual, you can search the food online for a general idea of cooking time, and you can contact the manufacturer of your microwave for instructions.

, After the amount of time set in your manual, check your dish for browning. If it has not browned, continue cooking in smaller increments, such as two or three minutes, until browned., When your food has finished cooking, remove the dish from the microwave and promptly remove the food from the browning dish to prevent continued cooking. Let the dish cool for a few minutes before serving, as the food will be extremely hot.

Leaving the food in the dish could mean your food will continue cooking. Immediately removing it from heat will preserve the temperature and texture you are looking for.

"
"
Cook food all the way through first.,
Use a built-in microwave rack feature.,
Select the “grill” setting.,
Cook on high.",How to Brown Food in a Microwave Oven2," To brown food in a microwave without a dedicated browning dish, you must first cook the food through all the way. Browning in a microwave is completed after cooking, rather than during cooking.

Because microwaves cook from the inside out using superheated molecules, browning raw or uncooked food is not possible.

, If your microwave is equipped with a grill rack, use this to place your food on. If not, simply place your food facedown in a microwave-safe dish.

A grill is ideal, as it provides beautiful sear marks for your food, and allows air to circulate more freely than a dish, resulting in a more even cooking experience.

, Use your microwave’s grill, because the grill setting also concentrates heat on the metal portion of the grill and can create a browning effect. If your microwave does not have a “grill” feature, you can place a small amount of foil into the bottom of a glass or ceramic cooking dish to simulate a grill., Finish by placing your microwave on its highest setting and cooking as usual. While it will not brown as thoroughly as an oven, enlisting the help of small amounts of metal will concentrate heat on the outside of your food.

Cook according to the recipe. If you desire a crisper, browner texture, you can cook on high in the microwave, then finish by pan-searing or broiling your food in a standard oven.

Mark the location of the joists.,
Place your rack on a piece of cardboard.,
Make holes on the cardboard where the chains will be hung.,
Place the cardboard against the ceiling and mark where the holes should go.,
Drill the holes.,
Attach the chains and hang the rack.",How to Hang a Pot Rack1," You want to make sure you select a pot rack that fits in the space you have chosen. Before purchasing a pot rack, get a tape measure and measure the area where you're planning to hang the rack. Most people hang pot racks somewhere in the kitchen, often above a stove or counter. See how much space you have and select a pot rack that will fit within that space., After measuring your area, you'll need to find ceiling joists. These are horizontal supporting members above your ceiling. You will need to install screws to fasten the pot rack into the ceiling joists. A dry wall ceiling, on its own is not strong enough to support a pot rack. To find ceiling joists, you can use a stud finder, which you can purchase at any hardware store.A stud finder is a small handheld device that you run across a surface like a wall or ceiling. When a stud or joist is located, the stud finder usually lights up or makes a noise.
Run your stud finder along the ceiling until you locate a ceiling joist. When it lights up, you've found a joist. You should find at least two joists, as you'll be drilling four or more holes in a rectangular shape to hang your pot rack.

, Once you've located the ceiling joists, mark their location. You can use a pencil or place a line of masking tape running along the joists., Take your pot rack out of the its box. Get a large piece of cardboard and place the rack on top of the cardboard. Make sure the piece of cardboard is big enough to fit the entire rack., From here, you want to basically create a template of the rack on the cardboard. You will use this template as a guide to drill holes in your ceiling. Trace the outline of the rack with a pencil. There should be four or more hooks on your pot rack, which is where the chains are hung to secure the rack from the ceiling. Mark where the hooks are located on the cardboard. Use a sharp object, such as a knife or a pair of scissors, to make a small hole where each chain will be hung., Take your cardboard template and place it against the ceiling. Make sure to line the template up on the ceiling so the holes fall on the ceiling joists. Use a pencil to lightly mark where you'll be drilling., Remove the template from the ceiling. Now, you can drill four holes into the ceiling.You will probably need to use a power drill to drill the holes. If you don't have one, you can purchase one at a local hardware store or borrow one from a friend.
You will need to insert an appropriate sized drill bit into your power drill. Refer to the instructions manual that came with your pot rack to see what size drill bit you need. There is no standard size drill bit for hanging pot racks. In depends on your specific rack.
Once you've drilled the holes, you can screw the hooks that came with the pot rack into the ceiling. You may be able to get by using a screw driver, but if the hooks don't go in easily, use pliers to give yourself a better grip.

, Once you've drilled the holes, the process of hanging the pot rack is fairly quick. Attach the chains to the hooks. Then, lift your pot rack up and attach it to the chains.Pot racks can sometimes be very heavy. You may have to get someone to assist you in lifting the pot rack.

Don’t subject your pan to sudden temperature changes.,
Store your pan with care.",How to Clean a Nonstick Pan," Don’t wash your pan in the dishwasher, even if the manufacturer labels it as dishwasher-safe. Clean your pan with a mild, soft soap and a soft cloth or sponge. Rinse the pan with lukewarm, not hot, water.








Dishwashing detergent and hot temperatures can shorten the life of your pan.If you merely wipe the pan down with a towel instead of washing it, stuck-on residue can cook and stain during the next use of your pan.
For example, try using a nylon sponge or brush to clean your pan.;
, Squirt about a teaspoon of dish soap into the pan. Place the pan into a stopped-up sink. Fill the sink with warm water. Let the pan soak for ten to twenty minutes, then hand wash it again.








Dish soap is made to remove bacteria as well as break up grease and residue.

, Mix equal parts water and baking soda to form a paste. Dip a non-metallic brush or sponge into the paste, and gently dab it onto the sides and interior of the pan.Allow the paste to sit for fifteen minutes.Rinse the pan thoroughly to remove the paste.









Never use steel wool or any metallic sponge to scour your nonstick pan.
Baking soda is abrasive, so don’t rub or scrub the pan with it., Pour two tablespoons of vegetable-based oil into the pan. Heat the pan over medium heat. Add three tablespoons of salt into the pan. Lift the pan from the heat and shake the pan until the oil and salt are evenly distributed. Once the pan has cooled, follow up with hand washing.








Use sea salt, if you have it. If not, you can use table salt.

, Don’t put your pan away while it’s still wet. Prevent rusting of your pan by ensuring that it’s completely dry before storing it. Use paper towels or a soft dish rag.







, Coat your cold pan evenly with butter, oil or fat before switching on the heat.Don’t use high heat for cooking with your nonstick pan. Use low or medium heat.








A coating of fat both protects and aids the nonstick surface of your pan.
High heat can ruin the surface of your pan, as well as potentially emit toxic fumes.

, Substitute this ingredient with oil, such as from an oil mister. Non-stick cooking sprays contain additives that build up on nonstick cookware, resulting in food that cooks unevenly.The buildup from nonstick spray won’t burn off during the cooking process, and is difficult to remove., Use cooking utensils that won’t damage your nonstick pan.Don’t use knives, metal cooking utensils, or steel wool on your pan.Never cut your food while it’s still in the pan, or blend it with a metal whisk.For example, use materials that won’t scratch your pan, such as plastic, nylon, silicone or wood.

, Consult with the instructions that came with your pan to see how often, if at all, you should season your pan. Rinse and dry the pan completely. Rub a teaspoon of oil on the inside of the pan with a paper towel.Put the pan in an oven preheated at 300°F (149°C) for one hour. Once the pan has cooled, wipe off the oil with paper towels.If your pan has a nonstick coating, it may wear off with use over time. Seasoning your pan can make it last longer.
For example, you may want to completely season your pan semiannually. Rub it with a small amount of oil every time before you use it.

, Allow the pan to cool naturally after it’s been heated. Don’t run your pan under cold water while it’s hot, or vice versa.Sudden temperature changes can cause nonstick cookware to warp, preventing heat from evenly distributing in the future.

, Hang your pants to store them, if possible, with decent space in between. If you must stack them, do so away from hard corners and sharp objects. Put a paper towel in between your pan and other cookware.Padding your pan with a paper towel will help you to take the pan out without scraping it against other cookware.

Get toggle wall anchors.,
Mark where the pot rack will be hung.,
Place any hinges or brackets on the bolt.,
Drill a hole large enough for the toggle hinge to pass through.,
Pinch the toggle arms together and press the closed toggle through the hole.,
Listen to hear the toggle open inside the ceiling.,
Pull out until the toggle presses against the inside wall.,
Tighten the bolt against the bracket, securing the toggle against the top of the ceiling dry wall.,
Attach the pot rack's hook onto the bracket you installed with the toggle bolt.,
Hang your pot rack.",How to Hang a Pot Rack2," Sometimes, you may be unable to find ceiling joists where you want to hang the pot rack. In this case, you can use toggle bolts to secure the pot rack. These are bolts that anchor through dry wall, allowing you to hang the rack without the support of joists. Toggle bolts are a type of anchor recommended for hanging a pot rack as they can support a fair amount of weight and are fairly easy to install. Most hardware stores sell toggle bolts.Check how much weight toggle bolts can support before making a purchase. It should say on the package how much weight a specific type of toggle bolt can hold. Make sure the bolts are strong enough to support your pot rack. Keep the extra weight of pots and pans in mind, going for bolts that can hold more weight than the weight of your rack. For this to be accurate, you will need to also determine the type of ceiling you have. Some ceilings are 1/2 inch thick dry wall, others 5/8 inch, the latter will hold much more weight than the former. Other ceilings may not be suitable for any installation, such as acoustic tile.

, In order to install a toggle bolt, you'll first need to see where the chains on the rack will be hung. To do so, lay your pot rack on a piece of cardboard. Trace the rack, making a template. Mark where the chains fall and use a sharp object, like a pair of scissors or a knife, to cut small holes where the chains fall.


Place your template against the spot on the ceiling where you intend to hang the rack. Use a pencil to draw a small dot where each chain will fall.

, Your pot rack's hooks should come with some kind of bracket or hinges that the hooks or chains attach to. You should be able to stick one end of the toggle bolt into these hinges or brackets. Make sure to do so before installing the toggle nut., The toggle opens and closes, like a pair of scissors. The idea behind a toggle bolt is that you'll push the toggle through the wall when it's closed. Then, it will open on the other side of the dry wall, anchoring itself to the ceiling. You want to drill a hole in the drywall big enough that the toggle can pass through closed. You should refer to the instructions on your toggle bolt package to figure out the precise size hole you'll need. Then, drill a hole of that size into your ceiling., Once you've drilled your hole, pinch the toggle to get it to get it to close. Press the closed toggle all the way through the dry wall., You should hear a faint click when the toggle pushes through the ceiling. This noise indicates that the toggle has opened up above the ceiling. This process is vital as, once the toggle is opened, it can be anchored against the wall., Now, you can pull the bolt out of the wall. Keep pulling until you feel the bolt stop. Once it stops, this means the toggle is pressed against the dry wall., Now, use a screw driver or a pair of pliers to screw the bolt into the toggle nut. Keep screwing until the bolt is pressed tightly against the drywall ceiling. This will secure the toggle to the dry wall, anchoring the bolt to the ceiling., Now that your toggle is safely installed in the ceiling, you can screw your pot rack's hooks onto the toggle bolt. How you screw on the hooks varies from pot rack to pot rack, and depends on the types of brackets or hinges that came with your pot rack. Refer to the instructions that came with your rack.

, Once the hooks are secure, hang the pot rack up on your wall. Toggle bolts are strong enough to hold a lot of weight. If you installed toggle bolts properly, your pot rack should hang securely from your ceiling.

Do not nail a pot rack into the dry wall without an anchor.,
Wear safety goggles.,
Keep extra weight in mind.",How to Hang a Pot Rack3," You should never nail a pot rack into dry wall. Dry wall cannot carry a lot of weight. If you simply nail a pot rack into dry wall, as you would nail it into a ceiling joist, the rack will inevitably fall. This can cause a lot of damage to your ceiling and kitchen and potentially hurt a pet or person standing near the rack when it falls. Always use ceiling anchors when attaching a pot rack to dry wall.

, You should wear safety googles throughout the process of hanging up a pot rack. Safety goggles can protect your eyes from small bits of paint or debris that may fall from the ceiling during the installation process., When checking how much weight a toggle can hold, do not just consider the weight of the pot rack on its own. Remember, you'll be hanging pots and pans from your pot rack. Make sure the toggle bolt can hold more weight than the total weight of the pot rack.

Pull the pan out of the freezer.",How to Get Caramel off Pots and Pans1," If only a thin, partially translucent layer remains, you may be able to scrape it off without taking any additional steps. If a thicker layer remains, you may need to soak it before scraping.;
, Position the chisel at the nearest end of the pot or pan and move the chisel away from you in short strokes. Apply firm, even pressure.

, Pat it dry with paper towels.

, If additional caramel remains on the bottom of the pan, repeat the scraping and rinsing procedures.

, Leave it there two hours to allow the pan and the burned-on caramel a chance to thoroughly freeze. Frozen food is often easier to chisel away, and caramel becomes especially brittle at below-freezing temperatures.

Finally, when you use the pan again, utilize the oil and salt treatment each time after cleaning.",How to Clean Old Pots5,", You can either throw it into a hot coal fire or put it in a self-cleaning oven for the same period of time as you would clean the oven. This will turn all the buildup into ash, and the pan will be like new again. Note: If you use this method - allow the pan to cool completely before touching. It could be hot enough to melt even a potholder. Let it cool first!

, Rub the pan thoroughly with this mixture with a paper towel until you have a clean paper towel. (This leaves a good finish on the pan, protects it, and keeps food from sticking to it.)

Make sure the whole surface with cooked-on food is covered with water.Warm or cool water may work, but hot is more effective.;
, Use a basic dishwashing detergent and squirt a zigzag across the surface of the pan. A dish soap that is specially formulated to fight grease is most helpful. If you happen to be out of dish soap, this method may still work without it.







, Lay a dryer sheet flat in the water, making sure that it goes under the water and is covered. For pans with especially caked or burnt on food residue, put two dryer sheets in the pan.








If you use biodegradable dryer sheets, this can be an especially green cleaning solution.

, Leave the pan to soak with the water, soap, and dryer sheet for about one hour. If the pan has badly stuck on food, leave it for a few hours, or even overnight. The dryer sheet will loosen the food residue while it soaks., After the pan has soaked for a while, dump the water out of it.

Turn on the heat until the water boils. Turn off the heat and let cool enough that you can safely touch the pan and water.


You can replace the dish soap with a small spoonful (or crumbled tablet) of dishwasher detergent.This may discolor aluminum.Try a different method first when cleaning a cast iron pan, since soap will remove most of your hard work seasoning.;
, If necessary, add more hot, soapy water whenever the old water cools down. Scrub using a tool that won't damage your pan's material:


Enamel, anodized aluminum, or Teflon pan: Use a sponge, nylon brush, or Dobie pad (sponge with protective plastic netting).
Stainless steel, copper, or non-anodized (shiny) aluminum pan: Start with gentle options above, then move on to a scouring pad or copper wool. Use a light touch and scrub under the water level to minimize scratches., If there's still burnt gunk in the pan, cover the pan with a layer of baking soda. Add just enough water to cover it and simmer for 15–30 minutes.Let cool and scrub the stain away.


Baking soda will react with and ruin aluminum.Because of its abrasive properties, it is not recommended for Teflon or other non-stick surfaces either., Boil white distilled vinegar in the pot. Let cool and scrub off the stain. Vinegar won't dissolve grease like soap does, but it's acidic properties can eat through some stains that the methods above won't remove.

, This will probably scratch your pan, but at this point you're running low on options. Pick up some cream of tartar from a grocery store's baking aisle if you don't have any. Sprinkle it over the pan and stir in a few drops of vinegar until you get a thick paste. Let sit for ten minutes. Scrub hard to remove the stain, or add more vinegar and bring it to a boil yet again.Many people use baking soda and vinegar for cleaning, but despite the dramatic fizz, this mixture quickly turns into neutral water.Cream of tartar has similar abrasive cleaning properties to baking soda, but stays stable in vinegar, letting you benefit from acidic cleaning as well.

, Make a thick paste as before, rub it on with a rag or sponge, and let it sit at least ten minutes. This one has been going around the internet for a long time, but actual results aren't always promising.It seems to get the best results on burned sugar, but this is only based on a few anecdotes.

, Fill a spray bottle with water and squirt it on the baking soda. Don’t be afraid of spraying too much water, as much of it will soak down into the baking soda.








If you don’t have a spray bottle, gently pour water onto the baking soda, mixing it slightly to form a paste on the pan.

, Grab enough paper towels to cover the whole area of the broiler pan. Get the towels dripping wet and lay them across the surface of the baking soda. This keeps the baking soda wet longer while it loosens the food residue.








Dampen the towels every so often if you feel they are drying out too quickly.

, Leave the pan sitting for a minimum of 30 minutes while the baking soda does its work. The process is more effective if you leave it for two or three hours, or even overnight for badly stuck on food residue.If you leave the pan sitting overnight, most of the water will evaporate, which is okay.

, Take the pan to the trash can and use a spatula to scrape the used up baking soda out into the trash. It’s better to discard it in the garbage rather than in the sink as it can clog up your drain.








, Take the broiler pan to the sink and rinse off any leftover baking soda, as well as any food residue that remains. If necessary, use a washcloth or scrubbing sponge to gently wipe away anything that is still stuck on the pan.

Wet the broiler pan with warm water.,
Sprinkle Bar Keepers Friend cleaning powder on the pan.,
Let the pan sit for a few minutes.,
Scrub the pan with a sponge or scrubber pad.,
Rinse the pan completely.",How to Clean a Broiler Pan3," Place the broiler pan in the sink or on your table or countertop. If the pan has sides, put enough water to thinly cover the bottom of the pan. If the pan does not have sides or has slats, put enough water in the sink to just barely cover the top of the pan.








Hot water is not necessary, but warm water is more effective than cold water in cleaning broiler pans.

, Lightly sprinkle Bar Keepers Friend over the entire surface of the pan so that at least the worst spots are covered. There is no need to heap the cleaner on, but be sure the pan is totally covered in powder.








Bar Keepers Friend also offers a spray which will do the job, as well.
Find Bar Keepers Friend in the cleaning supplies section of the grocery or big-box store.

, Find something to do for a few minutes while the cleaner works to break up the burnt gunk and food residue on the pan. For pans that are significantly caked in grime, let the powder sit on the pan for ten minutes., Use an old rag, sponge or scrubbing pad to gently scour the entire surface of the pan. Since Bar Keeper’s Friend is stronger than dishwashing detergent, it’s best to use a sponge that you don’t use for your other dishes.








If you only have one sponge, it won’t hurt anything, but rinse the sponge thoroughly after you finish cleaning the broiler pan.

, Once you have scrubbed the entire surface and feel confident that the gunk has been removed, thoroughly rinse all of the Bar Keeper’s Friend off of the pan. It doesn’t hurt to wipe the pan down again with a clean wet rag to remove any cleaner that might be stuck on the pan.

, Some food industry professionals use this to remove food stains. Make sure to select a metal polish intended for the right type of metal. Check the label before buying to make sure it is safe to use on surfaces that will contact food.


Once the stain is removed, wash the polish off thoroughly with hot, soapy water.

, Wear rubber gloves and work outside or in a well-ventilated room, to avoid overexposure to ammonia fumes. Add a small amount of ammonia and attempt to scrub the stain. If this doesn't work, try leaving the pan in a trash bag for 24 hours to give the ammonia fumes time to break down the stain.Ammonia will ruin aluminum pans.

Read all instructions carefully.,
Season the pan.,
Avoid using metal utensils.,
Coat the pan with butter or oil prior to heating.,
Avoid using cooking sprays.,
Cook using low or medium heat.",How to Care for Nonstick Pans1," When you purchase a nonstick pan, it will come with some basic instructions regarding how to use, clean, and store the pan. Before you begin cooking with your pan, read all of the instructions carefully. Many people will accidentally damage their pan by failing to follow basic instructions., Before using your pan, season it in order to lengthen the lifespan of the pan and to actually help improve the way food cooks in the pan. You should also re-season your pan periodically throughout its lifespan.To season a pan, simply rinse and dry the pan using water. Then put a dollop of oil (any type) in the pan and coat the entire surface using a paper towel.

, When you are cooking with a nonstick pan, you should always use plastic, nylon, or wooden utensils. Metal utensils will scratch the surface of the pan and will lead to chips and scrapes in the nonstick coating. This can drastically decrease the lifespan of your pan., You should always add some lubricant to your pan prior to heating, even when using nonstick pans. For instance, you could coat the pan using butter or oil prior to heating. If you add oil or butter after the pan has been heated, it will likely get soaked up by the food you are cooking and not actually aid in preventing food from sticking to the pan., When using a nonstick pan, do not use cooking sprays as lubricant. Over time, the grease from the spray that doesn’t get burned off during the cooking process will build up and create a sticky layer. This layer will often develop around the sides of the pan and is extremely difficult to remove through cleaning.As a result, lubricate your pan with butter or oil instead.

, Another common mistake that people make while cooking with a nonstick pan is placing it on high heat. This can actually damage the pan, causing the nonstick coating to crack. Instead, cook your food over low or medium heat. Cooking using high heat can also burn or dry out your food, so simmering at a lower temperature for a longer period is recommended."

Decide whether you want traditional or enameled cast iron pans.,
Decide whether you want to buy a used or a new pan.,
Decide what type of pan you want.,
Shop for your pan.",How to Buy Cast Iron Pans,"


Consider the fact that traditional uncoated cast iron must be seasoned (covered in oil and baked at a high temperature) to create a nonstick surface. Pre-seasoned cast iron pans are available, but they are generally more expensive than unseasoned pans. Once a traditional cast iron pan is seasoned, it should not be cleaned with soap or put into the dishwasher. Scraping the food out of the pan, coating it with a thin layer of oil, and keeping it away from moisture to prevent rust are the best ways to care for traditional cast iron. These pans can last for decades if properly cared for. A 12-inch (35 cm) uncoated cast iron skillet costs approximately $15 to $70. Pans from well-known manufacturers cost more, but have features like tighter-fitting lids and cooking surfaces less prone to sticking to food.
Choose enameled cast iron if you want pans that are easier to care for than uncoated pans. They don't require seasoning, and can be washed with soap and water. They also can be used to cook acidic foods; using uncoated cast iron to do so can produce a reaction that creates metallic-tasting food. However, the enamel can chip, and the color you choose may go out of style. Unlike traditional cast iron, enamel-coated cast iron cannot be used in a campfire. Enameled cast iron pans are more expensive than uncoated versions; a 12-inch (35 cm) enameled skillet costs approximately $40 to $200. The price varies widely depending on whether the inside of the pan has enamel as well as the outside, and the degree to which you might experience chipping on the enamel over time. Well-known name brands tend to be more expensive, but have enamel that is less likely to chip.;
,


Buy a new pan if you prefer to season the pan yourself. This allows you to make your purchase at any time, rather than waiting for a used pan of the size and shape you want to become available.
Consider buying a used pan. Since traditional cast iron pans can last for generations, there is a strong market for antique pans. If you don't mind using a pan that's been seasoned by someone else's cooking, you can save time and effort in getting your cookware to the point where it's worn smooth enough to discourage food from sticking. Used pans are often well made and well seasoned from many years of use. Prices vary widely; certain brands and models from the early 1900s can cost $100 for a 12-inch (35 cm) skillet. Brands that are no longer made will generally cost more because they are scarce, and unusual sizes or shapes (like muffin-shaped pans) will also cost more because they're harder to find.

, There are 2 common types of cast iron pans: skillets and Dutch ovens. When considering the size of the pan, keep in mind that larger pans will be heavier, so choose the smallest pan possible to meet your needs.


Choose a skillet if you intend to fry or sauté meat. Skillets are also good for making frittatas and oven pancakes. 10.25-inch (26 cm) or 12-inch (35 cm) are the most common and most versatile sizes. Some have an extra handle on the front of the pan to allow you to more easily lift the skillet out of the oven.
Buy a Dutch oven if you want to cook soups, stews, sauces, and roasts or other baked dishes. Dutch ovens are deeper than skillets, and come with a lid. A 5-qt. (4.7 L) or 6-qt. (5.7 L) pan is the most common choice, and will generally hold 8 servings of soup or stew or 6 large baked potatoes. Choose a Dutch oven with legs on the bottom (called a ""spider"") if you want to use your pan over coals or in a campfire.

, Specialty cookware stores, department stores, and camping-supply stores are good places to shop for new cast iron pans. Used pans can be found at estate sales, auction websites, antique stores, and occasionally at yard sales or flea markets.

Avoid using the dishwasher.",How to Care for Nonstick Pans2," For built up grease, you can soak the pan in vinegar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil. This will cause the oil and grease to rise to the surface. Then place an absorbent paper towel on the liquid to soak up the grease. Once the excess grease has been removed, use a gentle sponge or cloth to wipe the surface of the pan. , Never clean a nonstick pan with a metal scouring sponge. This can scratch and damage the surface of the pan, decreasing its life. Instead, use a non-abrasive sponge or cloth. For hard to remove stains, you may need to use a little extra elbow grease!, Some pans will claim to be dishwasher safe; however, avoid putting your nonstick pan in the dishwasher. The harsh chemicals and high temperatures used in the dishwasher can actually warp the pan. The dishwasher will also add more wear and tear to the pan, shortening its lifespan.Instead, clean your nonstick pans by hand using warm water and a gentle soap.

Finished.

",How to Care for Nonstick Pans3," The best way to store nonstick pans is by hanging them from a pot rack. This will store pans without allowing them to rub up against, or touch, any other pots or pans. It will also eliminate the possibility of scratching your pans by stacking them.Hanging pot racks are also a great space saver in the kitchen.
You can purchase a pot rack at Walmart, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, or any store that sells kitchen supplies.

, If you do not have the ability to hang your pans, you can store them stacked. When stacking or nesting pans, make sure that you put a napkin or towel between each pan. This will help make sure that the pans do not scratch each other when you are removing them from the cupboard.A tea towel works best, but you can also use a thinner paper towel.

, Nonstick pans typically last around five years before they need to be replaced. If you have purchased a high quality nonstick pan, it may last slightly longer. Once the surface of the pan becomes pitted or starts to peel, then you should replace the pan immediately.,"

Try to find the freshest chicken available. You may be able to find fresher (and often cheaper) chicken from local butchers and vendors, rather than using supermarket chains. Do some research online to find the best sources in your area. Wherever you buy your chicken, make sure it has a U.S.D.A grade A rating on the package, and check the sell-by date as well.;
, Unpack the chicken (one breast or two chicken thighs is plenty). Cut it into small pieces, around an inch or 2.5 centimeters (1.0 in), using a sharp kitchen knife.


If you buy pieces of chicken thighs, you’ll have to separate the meat from the bones and remove the skin. You might find this easier if you cook the thighs first. The meat will be much easier to separate. Then you can cut it into small pieces and finish cooking.

, Depending on the size of the pan, you may need about a cup of water. You want to make sure the meat is completely covered by the water.


Alternatively, you can bake the chicken in the oven. This method works better for thighs, which are fattier; for breasts, you’re better off using the boiling method described here. If you want to bake, heat your oven to 375–400 °F (191–204 °C), coat the meat with a layer of olive oil, and bake for 20 minutes. Follow the other instructions listed here.

, Carrots or potatoes work well; cut them into slices or cubes and put them in the water along with the chicken. You can also add fruits like apples, apricots, or peaches; cut these into small pieces as well and add them to the saucepan.


In general, a single carrot or two medium potatoes is plenty. You can experiment with different amounts and different combinations of ingredients, though.

, Cook the meat, vegetables, and fruit over medium heat for about 20 minutes (or longer, if you think the meat has not cooked through).

, Chicken must be cooked thoroughly to be safe for consumption. It should be white – there should be no pink inside – and soft and juicy.

, Pierce chunks of produce with a fork. If the fork easily pierces the vegetable or fruit, it is cooked; if piercing with a fork is still difficult, you’ll need to cook longer.

, Once everything is cooked through, remove the ingredients from the pan, draining them and allowing them to cool a bit. Save the cooking liquid.

, Place the food in a blender or food processor, and add a tablespoon of the cooking liquid. Mix until a puree forms.


For smaller babies, add more water and mix longer; you want a puree that’s smooth and easy to swallow. For bigger children, you can make a thicker puree.

, Pack some chicken puree into the refrigerator in an airtight container. It can be stored safely there for only 3 days, so be careful not to refrigerate more than your baby will eat in that time.

, Fill the trays with a spoon and place in the freezer until they are solid.

, Remove the puree from the ice cube trays and put the cubes into freezer bags.

, Write the date and the ingredients in marker on the freezer bags, so you’ll know what’s there and how long it can be kept safely. Your chicken puree can be stored safely in the freezer for up to 3 months.

, When you want to serve the chicken puree to your baby, defrost a small portion, warm it gently, and serve it lukewarm.

Use your fingers or a clean, soapless sponge to rub away any visible residue that doesn’t wash away with the water. Do not use dish soap or scrub too vigorously, though.Dish soap will dull the pot’s shine over time. It will also leave behind a lot of soapy residue, which will require excessive rinsing in order to avoid a soapy aftertaste to your next batch of coffee, especially if the pot is made from aluminum.Dish soap and/or excessive scrubbing will also strip the insides of the coffee’s oils.

Once you have determined this, you can prepare baby food menus just like you would prepare a menu for the rest of your family. An example of a baby food menu might be apples and bananas in the morning, chicken, rice and sweet potatoes at lunch, and green beans and turkey in the evening.

,


Be sure to purchase food items that have no noticeable defects, which can be a sign of substandard food.
Don't purchase too much of a single food item because baby food may spoil before you get the chance to use it.

, You can either boil foods to be used in baby food, steam them, or bake them. Once the food is cooked thoroughly, you can begin the pureeing process.


Make sure all vegetables, meats and grains are thoroughly cooked before using the food item in baby food.
Consider cooking certain fruits that may also benefit from cooking such as apples or pears.

,


Place foods in the blender that pair well together. Realize that everything you put in a blender will combine to make one type of baby food.
Consider your babies taste preferences and prepare baby food accordingly. Some babies prefer single foods in a baby food while other babies like combinations of flavors.
Follow the general baby food preparation rule and mix two parts food to one part water, then puree until well combined. You can add more or less water depending on your desired consistency.

, If you are making baby food ahead of time, it must be stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator. You may also be able to freeze some baby food mixtures if they are frozen in containers which are impermeable to freezer burn. Baby food that is stored in the refrigerator should not be kept longer than one week.

, Include a list of baby food recipes as well as your child's response to the various items you prepare.


If your child does not like the taste of a specific food, you can try to find another food with an equivalent nutrient content.
For example, if your child hates the taste of broccoli, you might consider preparing a spinach baby food instead and gauging your child's response to that food item.

Unplug your machine.,
Take off all removable parts.,
Wash any the removable parts.,
Dry the removable parts.,
Clean the needle.,
Scrub any difficult areas with a toothbrush.,
Wipe down the exterior.",How to Clean a Keurig with Vinegar1," Start by fully disconnecting your Keurig from the power supply. You don’t want to risk damaging the appliance while working with water., Depending on your Keurig model, you should be able to remove the cold water reservoir, lid, drip tray and cover, the K-cup holder, and funnel. Be careful removing the K-cup holder and funnel as there is a needle nearby. Simply grasp the holder from both sides and gently wiggle until it comes free., Place all of these components into a sink filled with warm, soapy water. A teaspoon of dish liquid should be sufficient. Let them sit and soak while you complete the rest of your surface clean. If you haven’t cleaned your Keurig in a while, you might also scrub out the parts with a soft, clean sponge or cloth.If your reservoir has water sitting it it, go ahead and empty this out before placing it in the sink. Take this opportunity to discard any used pods sitting around as well., When you’ve finished soaking them, rinse off each part with water and allow them to air dry on a clean towel. If you are in a hurry, you can dry each piece with a lint-free towel. However, it is still best to only air dry the reservoir and lid to avoid lint sticking to those surfaces., You should now be able to see the needle that punctures your K-cups and allows for the flow of liquid. Get a large paperclip and apply pressure until the single end comes free. Slowly push this free end into the needle holes. Move the paperclip around just a bit to loosen any grime and then slowly pull it out., Take a soft-bristled toothbrush and dip it in a 50-50 vinegar and water mixture. Lightly brush any spots where you see coffee grounds present. Pay particular attention to the areas right around the needle assembly.Removing these grounds is important because they can accumulate over time and lead to clogs and stoppages., Get a soft cloth and dip it into the 50-50 water and vinegar mixture. Squeeze out the excess liquid until the cloth is damp and then brush it over the outside casing of your Keurig. Scrub firmly against any areas that are white, as this indicates hard water deposits.It is a good idea to do at least a surface wipe down of your machine once a week."

Repeat the cycle, as needed.,
Run a final cycle with filtered water.,
Repeat this process every three to six months.",How to Clean a Keurig with Vinegar2," Plug your Keurig in and verify that the power is on. Turn off the Auto Off function as well to prevent your machine from shutting down mid-cleaning., Add a 50-50 vinegar and distilled water mixture into the reservoir. Continue until you reach the maximum filling line. Do not add a K-cup after this stage, it is not needed as your machine will brew directly from the reservoir. You will see the water light turn on indicating that your machine is ready to brew.It is important to use just distilled water, as this will prevent any additional hard water deposits from forming during the cleaning process.If your Keurig refuses to run without a pod in place, go ahead and put an empty one in the holder. This will not impact the cleaning process., Before you start the brew cycle, set a ceramic coffee mug in the middle of the drip tray. Then, select the most substantial brew cycle and proceed. The liquid will drain into the mug and will be quite hot, so watch your hands., Continue to drain out your mug and keep the brew cycle going until the reservoir indicates that more water is needed. At this point, you can add more of the vinegar mixture or you can let the machine sit for a few hours before performing a final drain and rinse., Dump any remaining vinegar solution in the reservoir in the sink. Fill up the reservoir with fresh, distilled water. Run another cycle, using the mug once more to catch the run off. This will also help to dispel some of the vinegar odor from your machine.If you are not sure if your Keurig is truly free of vinegar, then add a pinch of backing soda into your final coffee mug of water. If there is a fizzy reaction, then perform another water brew., If you descale on this schedule, then you will prevent the accumulation of hard water deposits and bacteria. This will make your machine last longer and your coffee may even taste better. Set an alarm on your phone or make a note on a paper calendar to alert you when another descaling is scheduled."

Choose the right bean.,
Get your French press.,
Get a good grinder.,
Gather other supplies.",How to Use a French Press or Cafetiere1," With dozens of beans available at local coffee shops and supermarkets, it can seem impossible to narrow down your search for the perfect coffee bean. Thankfully, a few criteria can help you choose the best bean for your preferred palette.









If you want a coffee with high caffeine levels, choose one that is a light roast. Contrary to popular belief, the darker a roast of coffee does not increase the amount of caffeine it has, but rather decreases it. The darker a coffee bean is, the longer it has been roasted, and the more of the beans’ natural caffeine has been burnt out. So, to help keep you awake longer find a light-roast coffee.
Decide on how rich a flavor you want. Although each roast differs, typically dark roast beans are known for a deep, full flavor. Light roasts are a little less bitter tasting and have sweeter undertones. If you are new to coffee and are afraid of the “burnt” taste of beans, choose a light roast. If you are a coffee connoisseur with years of experience, then a light or dark roast is a good option.
Make sure your beans are a coarse ground. Unlike espresso and drip coffee pots which require a fine ground for coffee, you want to have your beans in larger granules. This means that instead of being the consistency of a powder, your coffee beans will be closer to the consistency of sand.
Always use fresh beans. No matter what method of coffee brewing you use, it is imperative that you always use fresh beans. Old, stale beans lose flavor and give a your cup of coffee a bad taste. Buy your coffee beans in two week batches (enough to last only two weeks at a time), and always grind your beans immediately before brewing.;
, A French press is a type of coffee pot formed by a large glass cylinder with a flat filter attached to a long pull/handle on the lid. This allows you to place your coffee grounds in the bottom, place the filter over the top, and add hot water.









Although some people complain about having a lot of grinds in their coffee as the result of a French press, this more likely has to do with the grind of the coffee itself. If it is too fine or of irregular size, it will go through the filter and into your hot water.
French presses also go by the name of “Cafetiere.”

, Nearly as important as the French press itself is a good coffee bean grinder. Find a conical burr grinder rather than going budget with a cheap version. The grinder is responsible for breaking up the whole coffee beans into the perfect size grains, and in revealing the coffee’s true flavor.








, You will need boiling water to make the coffee and mugs to pour it in, otherwise the rest is up to you! Feel free to add your favorite sweeteners to your coffee whether they be sugar, honey, caramel, or chocolate in addition to half and half cream. Or go purist and drink your cup of coffee black, for a rich, deep flavor.

Turn off the Keurig.,
Remove and empty the water reservoir.,
Wipe the base clean with a damp cloth.,
Scrub the inside of the reservoir with warm, soapy water.,
Rinse the water reservoir thoroughly.,
Dry the reservoir with a clean, soft towel.",How to Clean a Keurig Water Reservoir1," Before you begin cleaning, make sure your Keurig is shut off and unplugged. You’ll be using a lot of water in and around the unit, so you’ll want to safeguard the electrical components. If there’s a K-cup pod in the brewing chamber, take it out and dispose of it.You can turn off your Keurig by flipping the on/off switch on the back of older models, or pressing and holding the power button on newer touch-screen models.Wait until the display and power light are completely off before proceeding.;
, Lift the reservoir tank straight off of its base, then pry off the lid and set it aside. Dump the old water out into the sink. Shake out as much excess moisture as you can.You should get in the habit of changing the water in your Keurig’s reservoir daily, even when it’s between cleanings.

, Once you’ve detached the reservoir itself, quickly spot-clean the area of the unit where it rests. There may be hard water stains or coffee grounds built up on the base. These will get worse with time if left untreated.While you’re at look, look for other parts of the machine that could use a wipe down, like the spout, mug tray or the area around the brewing chamber.You can clean most of the exterior of the Keurig by simply wiping it down with warm water.

, Add a small amount of a mild liquid detergent to a sink full of warm water and stir it by hand. Submerge the reservoir in the soap solution and gently go over the interior with a sponge or clean cloth. Concentrate on the small port and mesh screen at the bottom of the reservoir where the buildup is likely to be heaviest.For especially heavy stains or buildup, allow the reservoir to soak in the soap solution for 10-15 minutes before scrubbing.
Don’t forget to go over the underside of the lid as well.

, Run fresh, hot water over the reservoir inside and out. Direct the stream over the port and screen for several seconds to make sure they’re sufficiently clear. Completely drain the reservoir of water when you’re done rinsing.Be sure to rinse off any lingering traces of soap, or it could create a film on the plastic surface and affect the flavor of the coffee.

, A microfiber towel or absorbent chamois will provide the best results. You can also set the reservoir upside and leave it to air dry completely for a few hours. Once it’s dry, return the reservoir to its base, replace the lid and enjoy your next cup of coffee!Be sure to leave the lid off of the reservoir while it’s air drying to prevent moisture from becoming trapped inside.
Drying the reservoir with a paper towel or ordinary cloth could leave behind small fibers that can then find their way into your coffee.

Disassemble the brewer.,
Clean the K-Cup holder, funnel, drip plate, and drip tray.,
Clean the exit needle.,
Clean the water reservoir and removable lid.,
Wipe down the outside of the machine.,
Reassemble the brewer.",How to Clean a Keurig1," Open the cover of the brewer by lifting the handle and remove the K-Cup holder inside.


To remove the K-Cup holder, grab the top of the holder with one hand. Using your other hand, push up on the bottom of the K-cup assembly from below. The assembly should eventually release.
Use caution when removing the K-Cup holder. There are two sharp needles inside that could hurt you if you remove the assembly haphazardly.
The remaining pieces should disassemble with relative ease. Gently pull on the funnel until it separates from the K-Cup holder. Remove the drip tray by simply pulling it away from the base of the machine.;
, These elements are all dishwasher-safe.Place them in the top rack of the dishwasher and run the machine on a standard wash setting using mild dish detergent.


To wash the K-Cup holder by hand, simply rinse it under warm to hot running water. Additional scrubbing or detergent is not necessary for general cleaning, but you should exercise caution to prevent yourself from getting stabbed by the sharp needle inside the holder.
If desired, you can also wash the funnel, drip plate, and drip tray by hand. Immerse these pieces in hot soapy water and scrub gently with a non-abrasive cloth. Rinse well to remove all soap residue.
Dry all pieces well. You can either allow them to air dry for several hours, or you can dry the pieces manually with a clean dish towel or paper towels.

, The inside bottom and upper portions of the K-Cup holder both have exit needles with three holes. Remove any debris from these holes by inserting a paper clip into each one and working out anything inside.


Coffee ground and cocoa mix can easily get lodged in the exit needle, making this an important step in the cleaning process.
Insert a straightened paper clip or similar tool into each hole. You should be able to get it about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the tube. Wiggle and move it around to loosen and remove anything lodged inside.
Note that you cannot poke through the needle to the other side. The opening of the needle is located on the side of the K-Cup, not the top.

, These pieces of the machine are not dishwasher safe and must be washed by hand using clean water and a non-abrasive cloth.


Avoid using cleansers or detergents on these elements. Using chemicals near the water reservoir can contaminate your water supply for future uses.
These elements should be wiped out thoroughly with a wet cloth and rinsed under warm to hot running water.
Dry thoroughly by allowing the components to air dry or by drying them manually with a clean dish towel or paper towel.

, Use a damp, non-abrasive cloth to wipe away any water stains or dried coffee grounds on the front of the brewer.


If desired, you could also use a soapy cloth for a more thoroughly cleaning. Just make sure to rinse the soap residue off the machine afterward with a clean damp cloth or under running water.
Never immerse the entire brewer in water.

, Snap the funnel back onto the K-Cup, and insert the K-Cup back into the machine.


Align the arrows on the top and bottom of the K-Cup with those marked on the machine. The two front tabs on the holder should should be on the bottom and the single tap on the front should be at the top. Push on the top rim to snap it back into place.
Reinsert the drip tray by sliding it back into place until it clicks.

Preheat your coffee press.,
Grind your coffee.,
Put the coffee in the press.,
Add the water.,
Wait.,
Finish the coffee.",How to Use a French Press or Cafetiere2," Although you don’t need to add any water at this point, it is good to run your press under warm water. Because the majority of your press is made of glass, pouring boiling water into it might crack the glass, ruining it. Just make sure the glass is slightly warm to the touch before brewing your coffee.








, It is imperative that you always grind your coffee right before you brew it, to get the best flavor and prolong how long it lasts before going stale.









If you want to make one cup of coffee, then you need to grind enough for one heaping tablespoon of grounds.
Continue adding additional tablespoons of grounds for more cups of coffee.
While you are grinding your coffee, begin boiling your water in a separate pot. You can do this in a regular stove-top teakettle or an electric teakettle. The perfect temperature for French press coffee is from 195–200 °F (91–93 °C)., Take off the lid from the French press. This should remove the plunger with the attached filter. Pour the desired amount of coffee grounds into the bottom of the glass.








, Once you have secured the filter over the grounds, pour your boiling water into the press. Add one cup of boiling water for each cup of coffee you desire to end up with. Lift up the plunger and stir the grounds with the water to help extract the coffee into the boiling water.








, Leave the press with the plunger up so that the grounds can continue to interact with the hot water. You can set a timer to make sure you allow it to set for the right amount of time; 3-4 minutes is the perfect amount of steeping time.








, Once the time is up, press down the plunger to separate the grinds from the water. Be sure to press down with a slow and steady pace to avoid mixing up the grounds or sloshing the coffee everywhere. Then, finish by pouring into your favorite coffee mug. Enjoy!

Select your tea.,
Boil your water.,
Add the ingredients.,
Wait.,
Finish your cup of tea.",How to Use a French Press or Cafetiere3," You can choose any loose-leaf tea with large enough leaves that it won’t sneak through the filter. Another option is to cut open a bag of your favorite pre-bagged tea and pour it directly into your French press. For every one cup of tea, add one tablespoon of tea leaves.









Green teas are full of antioxidants and health benefits. For an energy producing cup of tea, choose a green tea or mix that includes green tea.
For a simple, pure cup of tea, try a white tea. These are the least processed of all the tea varieties and offer a light, sweet taste. White teas also have ties to improved complexion and skin health.
Black tea is a dark, rich tea with a full flavor. Traditional black teas include earl gray and English breakfast tea, but there are many other varieties available.
If you want a flower based tea, try an herbal tea. These are often caffeine free and aid in digestion. Popular herbal teas include chamomile and peppermint.
For an energy boost similar to coffee, try a mate tea. These give a cup full of good-for-you vitamins in addition to a great taste and bit of caffeine.
Oolong teas are a strong tea popular in China. These are often likened to black teas, and can be found in a variety of flavors., On a stove or with an electric teakettle, boil one cup of water per one cup of desired tea. Make sure that your French press is warm to the touch before adding the boiling water, to prevent it from cracking with temperature shock.









The temperature of your water will change depending on the type of tea you are brewing. In general, 200 °F (93 °C) is considered a safe temperature for your water to be brought to.

, Place your loose leaf tea in the bottom of the press, and add as much water as you need for your cups of tea. Stir it around a bit to give the tea a better chance to steep.








, Leave the plunger up on the press, and wait about three minutes for the tea to brew. Waiting too long for it to brew will cause the tea to go bitter, ruining the taste.








, Once it has brewed enough time, pour your tea into a classy china teacup or your favorite cozy mug and enjoy! Add lemon, sugar, honey, or cream to customize the flavor of your tea.

Clear out the water reservoir.,
Fill the reservoir with equal parts water and distilled white vinegar.,
Run a few brew cycles with the hot vinegar solution.,
Spot clean other areas as needed.,
Perform repeated brew cycles with only water.",How to Clean a Keurig Water Reservoir2," If you use your Keurig very frequently and it hasn’t been cleaned in a long time, it may be in need of a total descaling. Start by pouring any remaining water out of the reservoir and returning it to the base empty. From here, you’ll be using the reservoir to disperse a special homemade cleaning solution through the machine.”Scale” refers to the natural mineral deposits from water that accumulate on surfaces over time.If you decide to descale your Keurig, be sure to clean the water reservoir separately once you’re finished.

, Ordinary white vinegar can be used to safely descale your Keurig without the need for harsh chemicals. Run a few ounces of cool water in with the vinegar to dilute it. Fill the reservoir about two thirds of the way full.Vinegar is an excellent natural cleaning agent. It’s mild, non-toxic and rinses away easily, leaving your coffee maker clean and sanitized.When the brew cycle is activated, the vinegar mixture will be pulled through the water line and spout of the machine, eliminating buildup from the inside.

, The acidity of the vinegar will help dissolve calcium deposits and hard water stains inside the machine. Use a large mug or another container to catch the hot contents as it emerges from the spout. Continue cycling the vinegar solution until nothing is left in the reservoir.Do not place a K-cup in the brewing chamber. You’re just trying to flush the interior of the machine with the vinegar solution.Run the Keurig on the largest cup setting to keep the maximum amount of water flowing through the machine.Dispose of the used vinegar solution after each cycle.

, Some parts of the Keurig, such as the spout and brewing chamber, may be accessible to clean by hand. If there’s any mineral buildup remaining in these areas, you can scrub them with an unused toothbrush or the corner of a sponge.Detail small holes and crevices, such as the grooves around the K-cup compartment, with a toothpick or paperclip., Empty the reservoir and fill it back up with fresh or distilled water. Run the two or three more cycles to ensure that all the vinegar has been rinsed out. Keep running the Keurig until the water is completely clean and odorless.You may need to drain and refill the reservoir a couple of times before the lingering notes of vinegar are fully dissipated.If your Keurig is especially dirty, it may be a good idea to let the vinegar solution sit in the machine for 20-30 minutes before rinsing it out.

Run a vinegar rinse through the machine.,
Perform a second vinegar rinse.,
Follow with a fresh water rinse.",How to Clean a Keurig2," Fill the water reservoir with undiluted vinegar. Brew the vinegar through the machine.


This process is also known as descaling and should be done every 3 to 6 months. Descaling the brewer removes excess grime sticking to the inside of the brewer. If left alone, this grime came have a serious negative impact on the brewer's ability to heat up and function properly.
Place a ceramic mug on the drip tray to catch the vinegar that brews through the machine.
Do not use a K-Cup while performing the vinegar rinse.
If using a mini model, fill the water reservoir with 10 oz (300 ml) of undiluted white vinegar. Lower the brewer handle after 5 seconds and press the blue ""Brew"" button. It should turn red and begin brewing the vinegar through the machine.
If using a standard-size model, pour 48 oz (1500 ml) into the water reservoir and press the ""Brew"" button. Allow the contents to brew into the mug below.
Discard the warm, dispensed vinegar by dumping it down the sink.

, Repeat the initial vinegar rinse, but allow the vinegar to sit for a period of time in order to descale the machine more thoroughly.


Place the same ceramic mug used in the first vinegar rinse on the drip tray.
Do not use a K-Cup.
If using a mini model, lower the brewer handle 5 seconds after adding 10 oz (300 ml) of white vinegar to the water reservoir. Press the ""Brew"" button, and power the machine down once it starts to dispense the vinegar. Allow the rest of the vinegar to sit in the brewer for 30 minutes before powering it back on and pressing the ""Brew"" button to finish the brewing cycle. Discard the hot, dispensed vinegar by pouring it into the sink.
For standard-size models, add 48 oz (1500 ml) of white vinegar to the water reservoir and press the ""Brew"" button as usual.

If you can get organic foods that have not been exposed to pesticide, that's good, too. This is the healthiest choice for your baby. If this isn't an option, reach for frozen ingredients as an alternative.


Fruits, vegetables, whole grains like wheat, rice, lentils and legumes are healthy plant based starter foods for your baby. These foods are rich in health-promoting nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals and protein. They are generally healthier than animal products, which contain saturated fat and cholesterol which your baby can (and should) do without.
Buy fresh ingredients that are grown locally. Locally grown products may have a short shelf life, but are organic and chemical free. They are, overall, better for your baby’s health.;
, Don't be tempted to buy fresh food in bulk. Buy as many ingredients as you need for 2-3 servings, depending on how long the ingredients will stay fresh.


For small babies, use only one ingredient. Their digestive system is not developed enough and it is necessary to gradually introduce foods to your baby's stomach for her to adapt. When you go to the store, just concentrate on two or three foods to make up your baby's diet.
For bigger babies who have a developed digestive tract, it is safe to use a mixture of ingredients. For example, you can add rice or oats to bulk up any dish. These stay fresh longer, too.

, If your baby is a bit older and you can use a mixture of ingredients in each meal, don't be tempted to add in processed ingredients. It's easy to think fresh fruits and veggies make any dish healthy, but their nutrients can be negated by other ingredients. Here's what to keep in mind:


Use whole wheat flour, instead of refined flour. The more the food is processed, the lesser it's nutrient value.
Use brown sugar instead of refined sugar. It, too, has gone through less processing.
Use rock salt instead of iodized salt. Rock salt dissolves quickly and has more minerals compared to iodized salt.

, Knowing that you only need a few ingredients and sticking to fresh fruits and vegetables will certainly narrow down what you have in mind to feed your baby. As you weigh your options, think about what kinds of food you want to introduce your baby to as well.


Tomato soup or mixed vegetable soup, whole wheat porridge, boiled lentils with rice, etc. are simple dishes to make and good starter foods for your baby.
Follow the recipes that have been passed down the generations of your family. Nothing beats grandma’s experience with babies!

, Here's what you'll need:



A small saucepan. It is not recommended to use raw ingredients for your baby because it is easier to digest cooked food. The saucepan does not have to be big – you will not cook large quantities of food because the baby does not eat much.

Colander. To make a puree, it is necessary to drain the fruit. To do this, you'll need a colander.

Blender. To turn cooked plants into ​​a smooth puree, you need a good blender. The stronger the better – the more blended the food, the easier it will be to digest.

Glass jars. If the baby does not eat all the food, or you cook with the intent to use the dish more than once, you'll need glass jars. Glass jars are easier to maintain than plastic jars and can be easily and sterilized before re-use by washing them in boiling water.

, Wash the ingredients you're using under running water. Remove all dirt, soil, bacteria and remains of pesticides. Peel the ingredients, if the ingredients you chose needs to be peeled. The most dirt is found on the peel and it is harder to digest, too.


When you create a meal for your baby, the best and healthiest option is to use fresh fruits and vegetables. You can use apples, peaches, bananas, carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, apricots, plums, green beans, peas – whatever you think your baby will like.

, It is necessary to cook the ingredients before blending them to make sure they're easy to digest. Boil until they are soft – you can test this with a fork. If it goes in easily and the food readily mashes, it's ready.


Bananas and avocados are the exception. They do not have to cook; it is enough to just mash them with a fork.
Do not add spices. Babies' stomachs aren't great with these add-ins.

, Drain the cooked fruit or vegetables by pouring the contents of your saucepan into a colander to remove any excess water. However, save a little water to make a puree from it because it contains some of the nutrients that got lost with cooking.

, Place the well-cooked and soft fruits or vegetables in the blender along with the water from the saucepan and blend. When it's a smooth, even consistency, your food is ready.


Instead of water, you can use breast milk or formula; if the baby is older than a year you can use soy milk or almond milk.Make sure that the soy milk from soy is grown organically.
If the baby is older and you wish to add additional ingredients like rice or oats to the meal, then cook the rice or oats separately. This way the puree will be smoother.

, Taste a spoonful of food before serving it to the baby. Adjust the salt and sugar if necessary, but stay away from making it too salty or too sweet. The majority of the taste should come from the fruit and veggies, not sugar or salt.

, When the puree has cooled down sufficiently, put the amount that is sufficient for your baby's meal in a bowl and take pride in feeding your baby food that you've created yourself.


In fact, some people believe the baby can smell the food and hear the sound of food being prepared. This is thought to pique her curiosity and enhances her appetite.

, Put the remaining food in jars, make sure they're tightly closed and place them in the fridge. They'll store for up to 3 days.


Store in the freezer up to a month, if you'd like. Put the date on each package that you put in the freezer to use the oldest first.

, If you are not able to make a meal from fresh plant ingredients, use frozen fruits and vegetables. Here's what you should know about frozen foods:If you've purchased frozen vegetables, verify that they are without salt and rise rinse well before using
If you've purchased frozen fruit, make sure it is sugar-free and that is not stored in juices – it's possible the nutrients will soak out into these juices and make the food less healthy for your baby.
If you leave your own fruit and vegetables in the freezer for future use, do not cook them before, but freeze them raw. You will cook them when you're preparing the meal to keep more of the nutrients.

, Thaw only the amount that you can use immediately. You do not want to use food that gets thawed, frozen, and thawed over and over again. This slowly deteriorates the nutrients.


Do not freeze already thawed plant ingredients and do not refreeze food made ​​from frozen ingredients. If you take out too much, prepare it all and store it for later use in the refrigerator.

, In a small saucepan, cover the ingredients with water and bring them to a boil. Once you can easily insert your fork, they're done and ready to be pureed.


You can also use formula or breast milk if you like. If your baby is a bit older, almond or soy milk can work, too.

, Using your colander, drain the ingredients, but save some of the water. The water contains some of the nutrients that have been boiled out of the ingredients.


Blend your ingredients until smooth. Make a puree with a few tablespoons of the drained water and the cooked ingredients. Once it's reached a smooth consistency, it's ready for eating.

, Using your glass jars, put away the remaining food, making sure the jars are tightly closed, and place them in the fridge. They'll store for up to 3 days.


Food that was once frozen should not be refrozen. It's okay to put baby food that was once fresh in the freezer, but baby food made from frozen ingredients should only be kept in the fridge. If it gets refrozen, it'll lose its nutrients.

, Give only a quarter spoonful of the food to your baby at a time. Too much and she'll just spit it right back up. Let the baby relish the food and taste it before giving the next spoonful.


Allow the baby to drink or swallow the food before giving the next spoonful. If she's going slowly, be patient.
Stop when the baby no longer wants to eat it. Always avoid force feeding the remaining food to the baby.

, In general, babies love variety. If she's only eating a few foods, switch them up regularly, or tweak them slightly to give a subtle yet different flavor. Watch how she responds to each dish and make note of which ones she particularly enjoys.


You can switch up how you serve the food, too. Use differently colored bowls to keep the foods exciting – especially ones that aren't her favorite but that she should eat.

, Your baby will let you know her food preferences automatically.


When the baby does not like the food or is full or unwell, she will turn its face away, refuse to open her mouth completely, or simply keep the food in her mouth without swallowing it, etc.
When the baby likes the food, or is hungry, she will open her mouth fully to eat the next spoonful, will open her mouth eagerly for the next spoonful, and will eat the food with a smile, etc.

If you've stumbled on a dish that your baby doesn't like, try to incorporate the food in a different dish, in a different way, slowly.



, Avoid making a new vegetable or a fruit as the main part of any dish you prepare. Start with small portions of a new food to ensure the baby is not allergic to a particular food before increasing the quantity. It also helps to make sure your baby likes the food, too.


When you do start with a new food, monitor if she gets gassy. Certain foods, like lentils, potatoes, and chickpeas may give your baby minor digestive issues. It won't be much of a problem for her, but it may be something you don't wish to deal with.

Give your baby an apple puree.,
Try a banana puree.,

Try out a pear puree.",How to Make Fruit Purees for Babies1," When your baby is four months old, she will begin to show an actual interest in food. Talk to your pediatrician about beginning to feed her purees, while also continuing to feed her breast milk or formula, depending on which one you use. The doctor will most likely suggest that you try feeding your baby purees two times a day.

When your baby is this age, stick to feeding her purees made of only one kind of fruit.;
, Gala and Red apples are both recommended for apple purees for children four to six months old. This is because these kind of apples are soft and easily digestible. They are also fortified with vitamin C and fiber, which can help your baby to move her bowels easily. Try to buy organically grown apples if possible. Avoid fruits that have been left out in the sun, or that do not smell fresh.

To make the puree, wash and clean the apples. To start, wash and clean the apples. Next, peel the apples and remove the core using your paring knife. Then, cut the apples into small cubes and place them in the pot. Add a cup or two of water; just enough so that all cubes are soaked in water. Bring the pot to a boil then lower the heat and simmer for about 4 minutes. After that, you can let it stand for 20 minutes until cool enough and transfer to a blender or food processor.
If the consistency is too thick after blending, add a couple of spoonfuls of water until it has reached the right consistency. You will know it has reached this consistency when you take a spoonful and it slides slowly down the spoon.

, Bananas are rich in potassium and may help to soothe your baby’s tummy. When selecting your bananas, make sure that the peels are completely yellow.

To make banana purees, you will need a big, clean bowl, a paring knife and a potato masher. Start by peeling one ripe fresh banana. One banana usually yields about 6 ounces of pureed fruit. Cut the bananas into small slices and place in the bowl. Then, start mashing using the potato masher or a fork; there’s no need to add liquids. Make sure to mash it well since your baby is not yet ready for solid, chunky food

, The process for making peach or nectarine puree is the same. When in season, buy fresh peaches or nectarines; when not in season you can buy the frozen variety. Both fruits are packed with vitamin C and are sweet enough that babies love them. Each peach or nectarine you choose should give a little when squeeze so that you know it is ripe. Below is the method for making peach puree; use the same method to make nectarine puree.

To make peach puree, begin by washing the peaches; one peach gives about 5 ounces of fruit puree. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, place the peaches inside the pot of boiling water and leave to step for 45 seconds. After that, take out the peaches using a slotted spoon to drain the hot water. Transfer the peaches to a bowl filled with water and ice to stop the cooking process
Once the peaches are cooled down, peel the fruits using a paring knife or just with your fingers. Cut and make an incision along the diameter of the fruit, working your way around the pit inside (peaches have a hard pit in their middle). Twist the peach so it “gives” and then open it up. Using a spoon or a knife, twist the pit around until it pops out of the fruit. Next, cut the peach into small cubes and place in the food processor and blend well.

, Pears can be both sweet and tart at the same time, which can help your baby’s taste buds to experience some variety. Buy pears when they are in season to get the sweetest, ripest pears; in fact, they will be so ripe that you won’t need to cook them before pureeing them. Avoid pears with brown marks.

To make pear puree, clean the pears well. Cut the pears in half and then core them. Cut them into small chunks, place them into the food processor, and blend them. Add water until you get a consistency that slides down your spoon easily, but does not have the consistency of a milk shake.

Move your baby on to some different fruits, as well as some vegetables.,
Give your baby avocado puree.,
Feed your baby a plum or apricot puree.,
Try out an apricot puree.,
Prepare a blueberry puree.",How to Make Fruit Purees for Babies2," At this stage, your baby is ready for other varieties of fruit purees. You can also start feeding her sweet potato, avocado or vegetable purees together with the fruits you gave her when she was younger. Your baby is now ready for slightly solid foods so when pureeing, you don’t have to blend the fruits well. Some of the fruit can be only slightly mashed, but the majority of the fruit should be pureed.

You can also begin to combine different fruits at this stage, such as avocado and banana.
Begin to feed your baby one-fourth to one-half of a cup twice a day.

, Avocados are rich in omega-3 nutrients, which can help your baby’s brain development. Look for avocados that are firm but give slightly when you squeeze them. Under ripe avocados are hard and will not give at all when you squeeze them.

To make avocado puree, slice the avocado in the middle and run the knife or just press the knife gently along the length of the fruit. You will encounter the pit in the middle while doing this. Once you have sliced the avocado, twist the two cheeks and pull apart. You will see the pit in the middle stuck to one avocado cheek. Just stick the blade of a large knife against the pit and once stuck, slowly twist so the pit “gives” and releases.
Once the pit is removed, scoop out the avocado and transfer to a clean bowl. Gently mash the fruit using a potato masher or fork until mashed but leave a few bits and pieces whole so your baby can practice chewing the avocado. Since the avocado is soft, your baby won’t have a hard time mashing the pieces inside her mouth with her gu
A tasty combination is avocado and banana.

, Plums are similar to peaches but are slightly more fibrous, so its better to give a 6 to 8 month old plums because younger children could choke on the fibers. Plums can be used to aid digestion and fight constipation. Ripe plums should give slightly when you squeeze them. Apricots are tangy and can give your baby’s taste buds a variety. They are prepared in the same way as plums.

To make plum (or apricot) puree, was the plums; one plum gives about 5 ounces of fruit puree. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, place the plums inside the pot of boiling water and leave to steep for 45 seconds. After that, take out the plums using a slotted spoon to drain the hot water. Transfer the plums to a bowl filled with water and ice to stop the cooking process.
Once the plums are cooled down, peel the fruits using a paring knife or just with your fingers. Cut and make an incision along the diameter of the fruit, working your way around the pit inside (plums have a hard pit in their middle). Twist the plums so it “gives” and then open them. You will see the pit in the middle stuck to one side of the fruit. Using a spoon or a knife, twist the pit around until it pops out of the fruit.
Next, cut the plums into small cubes and place in the food processor and blend well. Make sure that the fruit is well pureed for your 6-8 month old baby. You’d want to puree plums well even at this stage because these fruits are fibrous and you want to cut up all of the fibers.

, Apricots are tangy and can give your baby’s taste buds variety. You prepare apricot purees i, Blueberries are tart and tangy, which means that they work well as a puree when added to other fruit purees, such as banana, apple or mango purees. Look for a bunch of blueberries that have a uniform color; avoid blueberries with any discolorations.

To make a blueberry puree, wash blueberries (and red berries) thoroughly with clean running water. Let dry a bit by sieving them in a colander. There’s no need to peel blueberries, so just place them inside the blender or food processor and blitz, rather than blend. Mix the pureed blueberries with bananas, or apples and throw in a tablespoon or two of yogurt in the puree. There’s no need to thin out the consistency further with added water; just the pure fruit puree will do.

Spice up your baby’s diet by giving her cheese and eggs.,
Give your baby cherry puree.,
Feed your baby strawberries.",How to Make Fruit Purees for Babies3," At this age, your baby will have grown her first set (or two) of teeth. She will not necessarily chew with her teeth yet, and will most likely still grind food with her gums. On top of the fruits and vegetables you are already giving her, you can also start feeding your baby small amount of (pasteurized) cheese, and little bits of protein, like eggs, tofu, meat, and fish.

Fruits that you can begin serving your child at this time include cherries, and strawberries, plus all the fruits already mentioned.
You can begin to feed your baby one-half to three-fourths of a cup of puree, twice a day.

, Fresh cherries are rich in antioxidants that can help your baby to fight off illness. Off season cherries can be bought frozen. Combine cherries with fruits like bananas, apples, and pears.

To make cherry puree, wash cherries under clean running water. Dry them in a colander. If cherries are a bit under ripe, you can steam them (skin on) for 4 minutes and then transfer to a colander to dry off excess water or just place in the bowl to steep in their own juices.
If the cherries are ripe, you can choose not to steam them. Slice the cherries along their lengths and pry them open. Remove the pit in the middle, as well as the stem. Double check that you got all of the pits. Put the pitless cherries in the food processor and puree or blitz them. You can leave some whole chunks for your baby to practice chewing with.

, Strawberries are rich in vitamins B and C. You can mix strawberries with pretty much every other fruit to create tasty combination. Avoid buying strawberries that are tinged green and white, which means the fruit is not ripe.

To make a strawberry puree, place the berries in a colander and wash with clean running water. With a paring knife, slice off the top with the green leaves. Place the berries in the processor and run it on blitz or puree. Feel free to leave some chunks of fruits in the puree.

Finger foods include pieces of apples or bananas, as well as cookies or crackers. Feel free to feed your baby one cup of fruit spread out over the course of three feedings per day., Mangoes are a tropical fruit that you can slice up and feed your baby. You can also make them into a puree. Ripe mangoes give off a delicious scent and give when you squeeze them.

, Make the mixture 2/3 rice pops and 1/3 cocoa pops. Always stick to this ratio; the healthier cereal being two-thirds and the sugary cereal being one third.

, If your child has a variety of foods to try, then there will be less temptation to eat too much of the sugary treat.

, Children who are denied things often crave them intensely; this little compromise is a half-way meeting that can serve as a good lesson in eating healthily with a small splurge now and then. And it also teaches them a little about moderation in life, although that is a lesson we all have to keep reminding ourselves of lifelong!

, Cereal breakfasts are a convenience but not a necessity. There is no harm in foregoing cereal some mornings and having bowls of fruit, toast with varied toppings, egg dishes, fish and meat or protein plant substitutes, etc. Variety is healthy.

Those you can refill without the use of a machine., How you do this depends on the type of machine you bought. Usually, there will be an opening at the bottom of the machine, below the filling canister.

Soft and mushy fruits are the best choice. They do not require a lot of cooking or chewing by your child. This makes them less likely to get stuck.Try foods like: bananas, ripe mangoes, peaches, pears, honeydew, cantaloupe and papaya.
Make sure to cut all fruit, even mushy fruit, into small 1/2"" pieces. These are big enough for your child to pick up, but not too large for their mouths to process.;
, Like fruits, vegetables are another nutritious food to feed to your child. Again, they're high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants that are important to your baby's health.Feed them softer vegetables as these are the most safe.


Many vegetables, in their raw state, are hard and crunchy. You'll need to cook vegetables very well, so they become soft and mushy. You want to aim for the consistency of a banana or something that could be easily smashed with the back of your fork.
Try vegetables like: steamed carrots, baked sweet potatoes or butternut squash, avocados, small broccoli or cauliflower florets, or small pieces of asparagus.Make sure to cut up vegetables into small 1/2"" pieces. Again, they should be able to pick these up.

, Protein is an essential food group for your baby. These foods provide your baby's body the nutrition they need to grow.Make sure to choose appropriate and safe protein foods like:


Meatballs. Make meatballs or even small bites of meatloaf for your child. These items are just ground meat that are very moist and easy to eat and chew for your child.
Tofu. This vegetarian source of protein is naturally very soft and can be easily mashed or gummed by your child.
Scrambled eggs. Depending on how advanced your child is, they can do either scrambled or hardboiled eggs. Your child may need to be a little older to handle the chewy or spongy texture of hardboiled eggs.
Fish. Items like salmon, tilapia or cod are soft, flaky and can be easily chewed by your child. This is a great protein option that also provides some healthy fats., In addition to fruits, vegetables and protein foods, you can also start to introduce different grain-based foods to your child. These offer a slightly different texture but also provide a great source of B Vitamins and fiber.Choosing whole grains is a great option for your child. They're high in fiber and protein and are just as easy to chew or gum for your baby.
Short cut pasta is a great finger food to start with. Choose pasta shapes like penne, rigatoni or bow ties. These are big enough for your child to grasp but not too big for them to chew thoroughly and swallow.
Cubed french toast or cubed waffles are another great food. Make sure they are not overly toasted and hard. Use softer, inner pieces so your child can chew well enough to swallow.
Cereal is another common food to give children. Little oat circles or puffed rice are small pieces of food that will dissolve in your child's mouth making it a great first food.

, If you want to get a little help from the store, many baby brand foods sell baby finger foods items. You can purchase these in the store and do not have to worry about always having the appropriate type of food on hand at home.


Many companies offer small snacks that are perfectly pre-sized for your baby. They range from cereal to cracker puffs.
Most of these snacks are designed to start to dissolve the second they enter your baby's mouth. This helps your baby chew and gum up these foods well.
Although these foods are convenient, do not rely solely upon then. Your baby needs to taste different flavors and try different textures of foods. Do not limit them to packaged items.

, Although there are a wide variety of foods that will be appropriate for your baby to start with, there are several that are not. Make sure you pay attention to the size of some items as this can be a choking hazard.


Foods that are around the same size as your baby's wind pipe can be dangerous. Your baby doesn't have all of their teeth and cannot thoroughly chew foods well enough to swallow.Specifically watch for foods that would be difficult to chew down or can easily be swallowed whole on accident.
For example, nuts or grape tomatoes are not appropriate for a baby's first finger foods. These should only be introduced once the child has gotten the hang of eating and has all of their back teeth (usually around 3 or 4 years old).

, One particular group of foods that you should avoid, are those with a spongy or squishy texture. Although some of these foods may seem like a good idea, they sponginess may present as a choking hazard.Specific foods you should avoid for now include: hot dogs, meat sticks, shrimp or sausage links.
Although these foods can be cut up into smaller pieces, they are slightly more difficult to chew and are spongy. These could get easily lodged in your child's wind pipe if they do not chew well enough.

, Other inappropriate first foods are raw or hard fruits and vegetables. Your child will not be ready for these types of foods until they are about 3 or 4 years old.


Many fruits and vegetables, especially when they're raw, are very hard and crunchy. Your child doesn't have enough teeth or practice to chew through these types of foods.Foods to avoid include: raw apples (even peeled), grapes, raw carrots, raw celery, grape tomatoes or bits of lettuce.

, Another type of food that can be difficult for little babies are sticky foods. It's hard to process these in your mouth and swallow them. Babies do not have the ability to eat these foods initially. Sticky foods, like peanut butter or dried fruits may sound like a healthy option, but they can make swallowing difficult for a child.
These types of foods can get stuck in their mouth or in their wind pipe as they attempt to swallow them.
Avoid foods like: dried fruit, popcorn, hard candy, peanut butter or cubed peanut butter sandwiches and sticky or gummy candies.

, When you're trying new protein-based foods with your child, make sure to start with moist proteins. Those that are tough or dry can present a problem.


Typically, health professionals don't recommend giving kids meat until they have successfully eaten other finger foods (like cereal puffs or whole grain pasta). Meat takes much more work to chew or gum than other foods.Also, make sure your child has several teeth before giving them more protein-dense foods.
Items to watch out for include: chicken or turkey, beef, pork or lamb. Especially avoid grilled versions of these as they are tough and dry.
When you do introduce these foods try pureeing them or grinding them so they are a finer texture and easier to consume.

, Regardless of what type of food you're feeding your baby, it's essential that you stay near your child at all times. They shouldn't be eating when you're not present.Children need to be supervised — especially when they are trying more solid foods or different foods initially.
If your child has difficulty tolerating some foods or seems to have trouble swallowing, you should be around to remove the food from their mouth.
Make sure that you have the time and patience level to sit and watch your child as they eat. If you're busy or preoccupied, it isn't a good time to try solids with your child.

, It's essential that you feed your child in a highchair only. This will not only help you feed your child, but also keep them safe as they try new solid foods.


Children are usually ready to be sat up in a highchair the same time they're ready to try solid foods for the first time — right around 4-6 months.In addition, make sure your highchair has a sturdy back that is straight up and not in a reclining position. This helps your baby sit up straight and keep their head upright.
Also make sure to strap your child into their highchair. Babies have the tendency to squirm around in their highchairs. They can end up slouching or in a reclining position. Make sure to strap them in to hold them in place.

, Just because you have a free 30 minutes doesn't mean that this is the right time for your baby to try solids. There's a good method of figuring out what time is the best time of day to feed your child.


For starters, your child needs to be alert and awake. Do not try to feed them solids if they're tired, just woke up from a nap or seem sleepy.Also pay attention to their moods. Do they seem cranky or irritable? They might not be overly interested in trying something new at this time.
Also, try to feed them foods when they might be hungry. If they just drank a 6 oz bottle or nursed, they're not going to be hungry or interested in trying solid foods after this.

, You might think that you should focus only on one food or one food group at a time. However, most health professionals feel that you can safely try a large variety of foods when you try solids.Even at this young age, children are learning eating patterns. If you are only giving them one item, they won't learn to enjoy multiple tastes and textures.
Offering a variety of foods will also give your child a chance to actually accept certain foods. It can take over 10 tries for a baby to decide they like a food.
Remember, all these foods, flavors and textures are new and different. It can take your child awhile to enjoy all the variety you're offering.

, Whether you're feeling tired or are feeling run down, it takes a lot of patience to get your child to try new solid finger foods. But be patient and take your time with this new experience.


Before you even start feeding your child solid finger foods, know that it will take time and patience on your part. It's almost a guarantee that your child will spit foods out, not want to eat or not like certain foods.
When you do sit down with your child to start trying solids, make sure there are no distractions and you have plenty of time to concentrate on your child and their eating.
If your child rejects certain food or eating in general, let them take a pass on these items and try again at a different time.

Know which foods babies shouldn't consume.,
Wash and peel the produce.,
Chop the produce into 1-inch pieces.,

Strain the baby food through a fine mesh strainer to eliminate any solids.,
Store the baby food in clean glass jars.,
Reheat frozen baby food thoroughly.",How to Make Baby Food," Produce is at its most nutritious and flavorful when it's perfectly ripe. Since you won't be adding sugar and salt to the food, it's important to choose ripe produce - otherwise, it will taste bland. Look for produce that is brightly colored and ripe without being too soft or bruised.Follow individual guides for each type of fruit and vegetable to determine when specific items are ripe.


Farmer's markets are great places to find fresh produce at its peak, since they tend to stock only fruits and vegetables that are in season.
You can use frozen or canned fruits and vegetables, but it's better to use fresh whenever possible. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables often have additives to help preserve them. Read the label carefully if you decide to buy frozen or canned vegetables.;
, Many fresh fruits and vegetables are treated with pesticides and other chemicals before they are harvested. If possible, shop in the organic section of your supermarket so you can be sure the food you make for your baby is chemical-free.


Some fruits and vegetables are more apt to become contaminated by fruits and vegetables than others. For example, apples are treated with more pesticides than any other produce, so you may want to go out of your way to buy organic apples.Avocados, on the other hand, aren't treated with as many pesticides.







, Some babies are ready to start eating solid food as early as 4 months old, while others aren't quite ready that early. Talk to your pediatrician about starting your child on solid foods. When your baby is ready, the transition should be slow; introduce just a few foods at once.

Babies transitioning from a diet of breast milk or formula-only can have pureed fruits and vegetables, like banana, squash, sweet potatoes, and apples.Babies who have eaten some solid foods and are between the ages of 4 and 8 months can have pureed or strained vegetables and fruits, meats, legumes, and cereals.Talk to your doctor about when to introduce mashed foods and finger foods to your baby's diet. It's important to do so only after the baby has developed certain skills., Babies under one year of age should not be fed certain foods, since they can cause allergies and other illnesses. Never feed a baby these types of foods until after he or she has reached one year of age:Dairy products made from unpasteurized milk
Honey
Outdated canned food
Home-canned food
Food from dented cans

, Use a scrubber to scrub the skin of the vegetables and fruits, especially if it isn't organic. Make sure to wash off any dirt or grit. If the vegetable or fruit has a peel, use a peeler to remove it, since tough skins are difficult for a baby to eat.

, Since you're going to steam the produce, you'll need to chop it into equal-sized pieces so that it will steam efficiently and evenly. Chop squash, sweet potatoes, applies, or whatever type of produce you have using a sharp knife.


Bananas and other very soft foods don't need to be steamed before you puree them.
Be sure to use clean cutting boards and knives. If you're processing more than one kind of food, wash the cutting board and knife with hot, soapy water in between foods.

, Place the food pieces in a steamer basket. Add a few inches of water to a large stockpot. Cover the pot and place it on the stove over medium high heat. Remove the pot from heat once the food pieces are soft, after 5 - 10 minutes.


Use a clean fork to test the food pieces to see if they are soft.
Steam the food to a softer texture than you'd normally do for yourself, since it should be completely smooth once you puree it.
Only use water to steam the produce; don't add butter, salt, sugar, or any other ingredients unless you're sure your baby can digest them.

, Place the soft food pieces in a food processor and process them until completely smooth. If you don't have a food processor, you can use blender, food grinder, or a potato masher.


Be sure no chunks of food remain if your baby is under 6 months old. Older babies may be ready for mashed, rather than pureed, food. Clear this with your doctor before deciding how much to process the food.







, If you're preparing meat, chicken or fish for an older baby, be sure to cook it to the correct internal temperature to kill bacteria. Use a meat thermometer to be sure. Meat should reach an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C), chicken should reach 165 °F (74 °C), and fish should reach 145 °F (63 °C).


Cooked meat may be pureed just like any other food. You can mix it with tomatoes or another savory produce item.

, This final step will ensure the texture of the food is appropriate for your baby's system.

, Portion it into jars with tight-sealing lids to ensure the food stays fresh and doesn't get contaminated. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before using (1 day for meat and fish).If you're storing food in the freezer, be sure to use freezer-safe containers. Baby food may be kept in the freezer for up to 1 month.
Always label the food with the type of food and the date you processed it.

, It should be completely reheated to an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C).

Don't defrost baby food at room temperature. This may allow bacteria to grow. It's safer to actually heat the food before serving."

, Serving up cut vegetables with a side of ranch or peanut butter or cut fruit with yogurt are simple but nutritious options.

, Let them choose snacks at the grocery store. This is a great lesson as it teaches your child how to make healthy choices and how to be independent.

, Such snacks include fruits like bananas, apples, and grapes. You can also prepare snacks in advance like cut up carrots or celery sticks.

, Don't cut them out altogether though. Unlike healthy kid friendly snacks, don't make unhealthy snacks readily available, but rather take control of when and how much is served. Don't deprive your children of junk food as this will make unhealthy snacks more desirable. An unhealthy snack can be included in your selection at least once a week to teach your child about moderation.

, You can create a 3 week cycle so you know in advance what to shop for and serve. Where one day you can offer cheese with grapes, another you can serve crackers with peanut butter. Other suggestions include carrot sticks with hummus, snack mix with raisins, nuts, and cereal, cut banana with low-fat yogurt, and graham crackers with Nutella.

, Cut veggies into fun shapes, cut sandwiches with cookie cutters, serve up cut fruit on kabob skewers, or arrange snacks into a funny face. These tips will make eating healthy more fun.

, Not only is it an excuse to bond with your children, it is an opportunity to practice what you preach. You can show your children that snacking healthy is a way of life.

, Nutritionists often recommend eating 5 times day with a snack between breakfast and lunch and another snack between lunch and dinner. With this in mind, the portions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner should be smaller.

Foods that are too big or too tough to chew won't be something your child will try or enjoy.Regardless of what type of salad you end up preparing for your child, make sure to take extra time to make each type of vegetable, lettuce and topping a small size for your child.
If you have a younger child—around age 4-5—chop vegetables into 1/2 inch pieces. You may also want to consider shredding the lettuce so it's very small and easy to bite and chew.
If you have a child that's a little older, you can make foods a little bigger—around 1 inch pieces and more finely chopped lettuce.;
, Another issue with salads is that they are basically a big plate of vegetables and protein all mixed together. This may be unappealing to your child, so consider keeping things a little more separate.Although tasty to you, a larger variety of vegetables and other foods mixed together might be overwhelming to a child. They usually respond best to just one new food at a time or 3-4 familiar foods. Salads may have more than this.
To help keep your child's salad a little more simple, consider serving it more like a traditional chopped salad. Place a small bed of lettuce on a plate and make small piles of toppings onto of the lettuce.
Keep each of the toppings separate on the salad. For example, make a small pile of diced tomatoes, another small pile of diced cucumbers and another small pile of diced avocado.

, One thing that could get your kids to enjoy salads a little bit more is by keeping the salad dressing on the side. You'd be surprised how this simple trick could help.If you keep the dressing on the side, this allows your child to dip their salad bites or pieces of salad into the dressing instead. The idea of dipping veggies is an easy trick to help get kids to enjoy salads and other vegetables.Children also like to make their own decisions as well. Even something as small as choosing how much dressing they use can help them feel more involved.
You can also make dipping more fun. Consider putting out 3 different dressings in small cups on the table which will allow your child to try multiple different flavors.

, A salad might not be a ""new vegetable"" per se, but if you put a variety of new vegetables on your child's salad, they may be less inclined to try it.To get your child to like a new dish like a salad, keep it simple and stick to vegetables and other toppings they're already familiar with.
Since salads are new item for your child, start by offering a salad with familiar vegetables. Also make sure they are vegetables your child already enjoys.
For example, if your child loves baby carrots, avocados, and tomatoes, slice or dice these on top of their salad.

, Another way to get your child to enjoy salads a little bit more, is by allowing them to get involved. You can let them help you chop vegetables and assemble their own meal.Kids love to get hands-on. Allow them to explore new foods and new meals by assisting you in the kitchen.
If your child is old enjoy and you feel comfortable enough, allow them to help you prepare the salad. Allow them to shred or chop lettuce, dice tomatoes or peel cucumbers.
In addition, allow them to assemble their own salads. If your child is able to have some ability to choose and make decisions on what is on their salad, they're more likely to actually eat it.

, A fun idea to try, if you can, is making a salad garden with your child. You can grow items for salads and teach your child about gardening.If you have a place in your back or front yard you can make a small plot for a garden. If you live in an apartment, you can plant many items in small pots in a sunny place.
Great items you can try to grow on your own include lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green onions, and peppers.
Allow your child to pick out vegetables to grow, help water them, and help pick and prepare them for meals.

, Be mindful of what vegetables you introduce to your child in their salads. Some vegetables are much sweeter in flavor and will be better received by your child.If you think about it, some vegetables are naturally a little sweet and some are more bitter in flavor. Your child will most likely be more apt to like sweeter vegetables over bitter ones.
Ones that may not be well liked include mustard greens, eggplant, radishes, radicchio, asparagus, and cabbage.
Sweeter vegetables that may be better tolerated include sweet peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, peas, corn, and green beans.

, Baby vegetables aren't only cute, but they're kid-friendly too. Consider introducing baby vegetables to your child and serve them on their salads.


Baby vegetables are fun for kids. They're miniature sized versions of the real deal and they're kid-sized.
Baby vegetables are also naturally a little more sweet in flavor. They are picked before they're mature and don't have the change to ripen or mature to a more bitter flavor.
Common vegetables that you can find in a baby form include zucchini, carrots, artichokes, corn, and turnips.

, In addition to helping your child enjoy eating salads, allowing your child to participate in choosing vegetables can help them enjoy them more overall.If you have time, take your child with you to the grocery store. Allow them to tour the produce department with you and see all the different items that are available.
Tell your child that they're in charge of choosing a few vegetables to eat during the week and to include in their salads.
If your child feels like they have some involvement in what's served for dinner, they may be more inclined to try and eat their vegetables.

, If you have kids, you know that it can take more than one try to get them to like something. Be patient and keep introducing both new and old vegetables to help them expand their palate.It can take a child several tries of a vegetable to decide that they'll like something. Even then, there may be days where they are not a fan of a certain item.
As your child learns about foods and their palate is adjusting, it's important to stay consistent and continually present them with vegetables.
If your child doesn't like a new vegetable the first time, make sure to give them another chance to try that vegetable in the near future.
Also, don't only present vegetables you know your child likes. Continue to present new vegetables or ones they haven't liked in the past.

, One very important aspect regarding childhood eating is making sure you're a good role model. Children will imitate you and your eating behaviors.Talk positively about vegetables in front of your child. Talk about how fun it is to try new vegetables, cook together and eat vegetables.
Also make sure that everyone, especially the adults, tries a few bites of vegetables or salad at each meal.
Make it a habit to have salads and other vegetables on a regular basis. The more consistent you are, the more your child will get used to the routine of having vegetables and salads.

, Kids love to eat with their eyes. If you serve a salad with bright and colorful vegetables, they may be more enticed to give it a try.


Start by shredding about 1 cup of romaine lettuce. Toss with 1 tablespoon of your child's favorite dressing. Arrange the dressed lettuce on a plate.
Finely dice the following vegetables into 1/2"" pieces: cherry tomatoes, baby carrots, yellow bell peppers, cucumbers and avocados.
If your child doesn't like these vegetables or loves other vegetables, you can swap out items as needed. Try to stick to brightly colored items.
Arrange each vegetable in rows on top of the dressed romaine lettuce. Arrange them similar to a rainbow. Squirt a little extra dressing on top if your child likes.

, If there's one thing kids do love, it's chicken nuggets or chicken fingers. Take advantage of this enjoyable food and put it over a salad to get kids to try something new.


Start by shredding 1 cup of romaine lettuce. Toss with 1 tablespoon of ranch or blue cheese dressing. You can use an alternative dressing if your child enjoys something else.
Dice 3 baked chicken fingers or 4-5 baked chicken nuggets. You can find these in the refrigerator or freezer aisle of the grocery store. Sprinkle on top of the lettuce.
Also add diced cherry tomatoes or cucumbers. Also sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded cheddar cheese on top. You can add additional vegetables if your child enjoys them.

, Instead of a typical chopped salad over a bunch of salad greens, try this twist on a chunky chopped salad. It might be more enticing to your child.


Quickly steam or blanch 1/2 cup of chopped baby carrots, 1/2 cup small broccoli florets and 1/2 cup of small cauliflower florets. These should be bite-sized for your child.
Toss together the vegetables in a bowl and allow to cool.
Dice 3-4 oz of cheddar cheese. Make cubes slightly smaller than the size of the vegetables.
Toss the cheese into the vegetable mixture. Also add in 1/2 cup of thawed frozen peas. Toss the salad with 2-3 tablespoons of your child's favorite creamy dressing—like ranch dressing—until combined. Serve them about 1 cup of the salad.

If they're eager to learn already, give them the supplies and freedom to do some cooking for you and the rest of the family, and they'll learn by trial and error. If they're not interested, you may have to motivate them a bit more. Try explaining to them that knowing how to cook will make them even more independent, since independence is appealing to most teens.
, When learning to cook, it's often most enjoyable to start with the recipes that you enjoy the most. This is especially important if your teen is leaving for college soon; remind them that they soon won't be able to eat their favorite mac and cheese or meatloaf at home, so if they learn to cook it themselves, they won't have to go without it., Cooking is a tricky skill, especially for someone who isn't naturally drawn to it. Some consider it an art, others a science, but for those who aren't gifted in the kitchen arts, starting with simple recipes is best. Breakfast is a good meal to start with. You can also help your teen start with semi-prepared meals, like boxed mac and cheese or ready-made pizza crusts that they can customize with their chosen ingredients. Some simple recipes are included below to get you started., Every teen is different, so let them learn in a way that suits them:

They might benefit from real-life formal or semi-formal lessons with you, where you give them a play-by-play as you cook. If so, take the time to teach!
They might prefer a trial-and-error method where they get their hands dirty and start trying out their skills. If so, provide a recipe and buy the supplies needed, and let them loose. Be available for help when they need it, but generally let them do their thing.
They might like to read and compare recipes and watch videos online. Some people like to ""study up"" before hitting the kitchen. If this suits them, use the full range of resources: recipe books, websites, and YouTube videos can all help them learn.

, Learning to cook takes practice. Set an expectation that your teen will cook something once a week, perhaps preparing a meal for the whole family. By ensuring they get regular practice, you'll help speed up their learning curve., Watch cooking shows or read cookbooks together to get motivated., Ask them which meals they would like; go to grocery store together and buy the ingredients., Let them do the work. Don't take over the work., This gives teens the responsibility of making food decisions for themselves and their friends., Be a role model.,  A simple French Omelette is easy. One egg per person is enough to start with; if your omelettes are a hit, you get a lot of practice making them individually. , Turn the stove on; when the time is right, set the temperature to be on medium-high.,  Using the dull side of a knife and hitting the egg firmly enough to go almost halfway through the egg works well.  Hitting it too lightly gets you into all sorts of trouble, so be careful.,, Also add just a tiny pinch of salt, and a tiny pinch of white pepper, or any finely-ground pepper., If you added the water as suggested, this should not take even half a minute.,  Pour a tablespoonful of oil on the frying pan, and put it on a small burner of your kitchen range on medium high heat.  If the temperature is too hot, the oil will start to smoke. If it does, turn down the burner, or move the frying pan to an unoccupied burner, and wait until your pan cools to medium high.,,  After a minute or so, the egg should get fried all around the edges.  At this point, use your spatula to push the cooked egg to a side, allowing the runny part to flow into the oil.

 This is usually not a successful maneuver the first time you try it, because you might have waited a little too long, or not waited long enough.  It doesn't matter; you can still eat the egg as long as it isn't burnt, and it isn't under cooked! 
You do not need so much oil that the egg is sloshing in it.  Remember: just a tablespoonful is enough, and a good cook can manage with less than that.

, It is done!  If your family is nervous about uncooked egg, leave it to cook a little more in the pan; if not, slide the egg onto a plate. , Do not add water, as you did for an omelette, except as described below.

You can use a tiny bit of butter for eggs, instead of olive oil, provided you've practiced enough not to burn the butter. 

,, You should know exactly when to do it. ,  Once the egg is in the oil, slip a teeny bit of water into the pan, and quickly cover before the water has a chance to sputter. 

Watch the egg get firm through the glass, and promptly take the pan off the burner just as soon as the egg is truly ready.  You can't really tell with the cover on, so after about a minute, take the cover off, and check on the egg.

,  You can use as much of the salt, pepper, cinnamon or nutmeg as you like, but it is strongly advised to use very little."" A pinch is all you need; that is, less than a quarter teaspoonful.  The exception is cinnamon, which you can use more of. Beat well
,  (Multi-grain or Oatmeal bread, or bread with nuts works really well.)  Meanwhile, heat a large skillet on the stove, and spray it with Pam (or any cooking spray, or even butter)., You don't need to make the bread totally soggy.,  Do not put so much oil that it flows about; just a tablespoonful is all you need. Or use a small pat of butter instead.,  Both sides should be a nice golden brown, but not a dark, burned brown.  It doesn't matter if just the edges of the slice of bread get a tiny bit blackened.  Cook the slice long.

The genius of French Toast is the fragrance.  The cinnamon and nutmeg combination just smells really festive. It might be an acquired taste, and French Toast and pancake syrup/jam is not exactly low in calories. However, it probably beats bacon or sausage for being low in grease, cholesterol, and sundry carcinogens.

, (Cut it into centimeter cubes.),,, When it is hot, put in the beef, and keep moving the cubes about with a wooden skillet, until the beef is thoroughly browned on all sides., The pepper and the vinegar softens the beef.

When you are finished, get the beef off the skillet into a bowl.

,, The onion is almost a must, and one or two of the others. Before cooking, soak them in a light vinegar and salt mix for about five minutes. In the case of snow peas and Bok Choy, also add a little soy sauce to the marinade., It will sizzle, so cover the floor near the stove top with newspaper, and wear an apron. Note that it will be messy., Throw in a dash of Jane's Crazy Mixed-Up Salt, and or Pepper instead of your ordinary salt and pepper.

Serve a stir-fry with rice.

, Mix together a cup of rice, and one-and-three-quarter cups of boiling water. It doesn't need to be boiling, but if you start with boiling water, your rice will come out nice and crisp and firm. If you bring the rice and cold water to a boil, the rice grains might be a little too soft.

Once the rice-water mixture is at a thorough rolling boil reduce heat to just simmering (the mixture continues to just barely boil),

, This steams the rice gently, so that it is cooked, but not overcooked. Only check the rice after at least ten minutes. If you wait for 15 minutes, that's even better.

Consider buying a rice cooker that cook the rice automatically for you. There is also a gadget you can buy, which is a container in which you cook rice in the microwave. It has a special lid that keeps the water in, without allowing it to boil over.

, Get a wooden spoon with a handle that's like a rod, and gently stir the rice, to break if up and fluff it to look like perfectly cooked rice.

If you leave the rice packed tightly in the pot, it will continue to cook, and actually get overcooked.

, Cut some Roma tomatoes into eight, slice up some pitted olives (black, green, or both), chop up a little onion, add a few artichoke hearts, and mixed greens., Mix up some olive oil, garlic powder, a tiny touch of salt, black pepper, some Parmesan cheese, and finely chopped Basil (a leafy herb, sold as a plant in a pot, or as dried flakes), and pour over the salad, and toss well. Tinker with the proportions of the dressing until you like the taste and the fragrance of the dressing., The aftermath of the meal will be depressing to the cooks, so wash up the pots and pans and cooking utensils right after you use them."

Let your toddler cut soft foods.,
Consider letting the toddler crack eggs.,
Ask your toddler to add ingredients.,
Allow them to help prepare produce.,
Give them a brush.,
Let them sprinkle seasonings.",How to Safely Let Your Toddler Help Cook1," One easy way you can let your kids help you cook is by giving them a spoon. Let them stir things as you prepare a meal. Depending on their age, you can give them small bowls to stir or let them stir an entire bowl. You or your partner can help them stir by holding their hand and teaching them how to mix ingredients.For example, you can let them mix together dry ingredients for a cake, or mix the eggs into the cake mix. You may let them try mixing the seasonings into dips or sauces.
You can also try letting your toddler mix things with their fingers. Just make sure they wash their hands first.Place the bowl on a surface where your child can easily get to it. You may want to prepare ingredients at a table where they are sitting in a chair. If they try to mix ingredients at a counter and are too short, they can easily knock the bowl off the edge and cause a mess.
Don't let toddlers stir things in hot pans. There is a serious burn risk when children are around hot stoves.;
, You may want to let your toddler measure ingredients that go into the recipes. This may be easier for your child and less of a risk. Teach your child to carefully measure out each of the ingredients and use the right measuring spoon or measuring cup.For example, your child can measure out half a cup of flour, put almonds into a ¼ cup measuring cup, or place two cups of already chopped spinach into a measuring cup.

, Teach your child how to use a butter knife or plastic knife by showing them how to hold it, which side to slice with, and how to hold the food being sliced. Then, allow your toddler to help you cut and slice soft foods.For example, you can let them cut bananas, strawberries, soft cheese, and soft vegetables.
You can purchase kid-friendly plastic knives that are appropriate for toddlers when supervised by an adult.
Teach your child the dangers of sharp knives and to only use the kid-friendly ones. Tell them they shouldn't touch knives without adults present.

, One fun thing your toddler may be able to do is crack eggs. First, teach your child the proper way to crack eggs. Then, monitor as they crack the eggs for your next recipe.Double check to make sure no egg shells get into the dish.
You may want to place a towel under the bowl or take other precautions to help keep messes at a minimum.

, If you have already measured out ingredients, ask your child to add them to the dish. You can let your child pick up a small bowl and pour it into the mixing bowl, or have them add cut up vegetables and put them in a pot.For example, if you are making a cake, you can let your child pour the sugar you have already measured out into the bowl. You can let them add raisins to a salad, put carrots into your stir fry, or add the cheese on top of your casserole.
You can open canned vegetables and let your child pour the contents into the pot. However, teach your child about the dangers of the sharp edge of a can.

, Your toddler can help you in the kitchen by helping you with your produce. This means they can rinse or wash fruit and vegetables before you get ready to use them. Show them how to rinse off the whole piece of produce while explaining the importance of washing produce before eating it and why produce is important to eat.You can also have them tear greens, broccoli, or cauliflower into small pieces. You can also have them tear apart herbs or remove stems.
They can mash potatoes, cauliflower, or other vegetables.
This is a great way for you to help your toddler learn the names of different foods and expose them to a wider variety of healthy foods., Another way you can let your child help you prepare food is by giving them a brush and letting them help you cover food. Show them how to dip the brush into the oil, butter, or marinade and then how to gently cover the food.You can let them spread olive oil over fish or brush butter over bread.

, If you don’t think your child is old enough to help with the actual food preparation yet, you can let them do small things, like sprinkle seasonings. Show them how to pick up a few herbs and place it in the dish or gently sprinkle salt and pepper.Measure out how much seasoning should go on the dish if you don’t want too much. If it doesn’t matter, like if you’re adding basil or cilantro to a dish, you can let your toddler pick up some with their fingers and put it on the food.

Always monitor your toddler.,
Remind your toddler about kitchen dangers.,
Prevent scalding accidents.,
Make sure you have time for your toddler in the kitchen.,
Plan ahead.,
Get your toddler a step stool.",How to Safely Let Your Toddler Help Cook2," The best way to keep your child safe in the kitchen is to monitor them. The kitchen holds many potential dangers, such as sharp knives, raw meat, and hot surfaces. It takes only a moment for a child to grab a knife or touch a hot pan. Always watch your child closely when you are letting them help in the kitchen.You may consider having another adult in the kitchen with you when your toddler is helping. This gives an extra set of eyes to watch the kid.

, Your toddler is learning about cooking through you. This means they don’t necessarily know that stoves are hot, pots that have been on the stove can burn, that knives are sharp, or that they shouldn’t put their fingers in their mouth after touching raw meat. You need to remind your toddler of these things as you continue to cook together.Before you start cooking together, you should do a basic kitchen safety lesson with your child. Outline what can be dangerous, what they can and can’t do, and what they should do with the help of a grown up.
Make a list of things they can do and things only adults can do. Be sure to explain the reasons so they understand why they can or cannot do certain things.
Make rules, like always washing their hands and not touching the stove.

, Since your toddler is helping you cook, they may be around hot stoves or pans full of hot food. This presents a danger to your child. To help prevent your child from getting hurt, you should take extra precautions with hot items to ensure your child’s safety.For example, don’t place hot bowls or pans near the edges of counters or in places where your child can reach.
Consider using the back burners of the stove so your child won’t accidentally touch them.
Move handles of pots and pans towards the back of the stove so your child can’t grab them.

, Some nights, you may be rushing around trying to get dinner fixed for your family. You may not have the time to watch your child closely, help them with difficult or more dangerous tasks, and talk them through the process of cooking. If you are in a hurry, don’t let your toddler help you cook.If your toddler is really interested in cooking, or you want to include them in the kitchen, choose a few nights a week when you have time to let them help you in the kitchen.
Choose a time when your toddler feels good and is not fussy or grumpy.

, Planning the meals or dishes you want your toddler to help you cook ahead of time can help keep the time stress-free and help keep your child safe. Involve them in easy recipes with few ingredients or difficult tasks so they can help instead of watching you tackle hard cooking techniques or dangerous steps.For example, you may want your child to help you make a salad, homemade pizza, or an easy cake.

, Your toddler is probably too short to reach the counter. To help them be able to reach the counter and help you while you cook, get a sturdy step stool for them to stand on. Make sure it is safe and that your child won’t be able to fall.Watch your child closely while they are on a step stool.

Ask your toddler to gather ingredients.,
Let them choose the menu.,
Get the toddler to set the table.,
Pretend to cook with them.,
Encourage your toddler to help with cleanup.,
Let them open up containers.,
Stay positive.",How to Safely Let Your Toddler Help Cook3," You can get your toddler to help you in the kitchen by getting ingredients for you. Send your toddler to the pantry to grab ingredients. You can also ask them to bring things from the refrigerator, or ask them to pull out a pan from the cabinet.For example, ask them to get you the bag of nuts, a can of vegetables, or a boxed mix from the pantry. Ask them to bring you zucchini, strawberries, or butter from the fridge.

, One good way to foster interest in healthy eating habits and cooking is to get your child involved in the menu planning stage. Choose a variety of different ingredients and place them on the counter. Let your child choose which foods you will make that day. This helps gives them a sense of independence and helps them be interested in the food.For example, you may set out multiple types of bread, three different kinds of fruit, five different vegetables, and different spreads. Let them choose one or two items from each category to make snacks or sandwiches for lunch.

, If your child is too small to work with the food, get them involved by letting them set the table. The child can carry one or two plates at a time to avoid dropping, or you can set all the dishes on the table and allow them to put them out into the correct places.If your toddler is going to be carrying dishes, you may consider using plastic just in case they drop them.

, If your toddler is too young to help you with the actual cooking, you can have them pretend to cook. While you are in the kitchen, give them some clean pots, pans, spoons, spatulas, and other safe cooking equipment. Let your child pretend to cook with you as you cook the real thing.You can even verbally walk your child through the preparation process. For example, you may say, “I’m putting the squash in the pot!” and have your child pretend to do the same thing with their empty pot.
You may also just encourage your child to make music on their pots and pans as your cook.
Your toddler might also find it fun to play with toy cookware along with you as you cook.

, Another way your toddler can help you cook is to help you with the cleanup. You can let your child put silverware, cups, or bowls into the dishwasher. You can also let your child put away ingredients or hand them a damp rag and let them wipe off a surface.You can also get them to help put trash into the garbage can.

, You may consider letting your child open up containers, boxes, or bags of ingredients for you as you cook dinner. This may include plastic containers of leftovers, bags of produce, or boxes of mixes. Avoid giving your child anything that could cut them or that needs scissors to open.


For example, you may let your toddler pull the top off the leftover chicken, pull the green beans from the produce bag, or open the box of cake mix.

, Cooking with your toddler should be a fun experience for both of you. That means you should stay positive and keep things fun and light. Your toddler will make mistakes and they will be messy. Don’t scold them if they do something wrong, drop something on the floor, or spill something. You want to encourage them to enjoy cooking, not be afraid of it.Make sure to thank your toddler and praise their efforts in the kitchen.
If your child drops an egg on the floor, don’t yell at them. Don’t get angry if they accidentally add too much milk or they knock over olive oil.

Proteins found in chicken, fish, and beans make up your muscles and organs, and are essential for growing strong.

Carbohydrates found in whole-grain bread, pasta, and rice provide you with the energy needed to move and be active, and whole grains have much more energy than white bread and processed (factory-made) sugars.

Fruits and Vegetables contain vitamins and minerals that help your eyes, ears, and brain work to the best of their ability, and keep you from getting sick.;
, Depending on their age, different children will need different amounts of food. The following rough guidelines are for young children age 9-13, provided by the Mayo Clinic. Girls are on the lower end while boys are generally on the higher end of the estimates:



Calories: 1,400 - 2,600

Protein: 4-6 ounces

Fruits: 1.5 - 2 cups

Vegetables: 1.5 - 3.5 cups

Grains: 5-9 ounces

Dairy: 2.5 - 3 cupsThese are estimates meant to help you gauge relative amounts of food. While you don't have to measure out each ounce, you do want roughly 50% more grain than protein, for example.

, A good, healthy meal for your child doesn't need to be complicated. Instead, you should aim for balance in a meal -- two or three simple dishes are perfect for a good dinner, for example. A balanced meal needs to include:


A whole-grain carbohydrate, such as bread, pasta, or rice.
A protein source like beans, chicken, or fish.
A fruit or vegetable., Start the day off well with a good breakfast, and give your child healthy snacks every 1-2 hours. Hungry kids are cranky kids, and a cranky kid is more likely to put up a stink when faced with a new or ""gross"" food. Keep them well fed throughout the day and they will be more likely to try something new when it is put in front of them.


Make sure a child always eats breakfast to start their metabolism and get the necessary fuel to do well in school., This is a good place to start planning healthy meals for your child as well as introduce newer, healthier foods into their diet. For example, you might notice that you child loves tomatoes. To convince them to eat healthier, you might start with tomato salads, introducing a few cucumbers or carrots as well to get them slowly eating better food.


Note foods you child can't stand as well and keep them off the table to start -- seeing one food they detest may make a kid turn their nose up at the rest of the meal too.

, The parent is ultimately in charge of what food comes into the house, and if there is no junk food to eat, then your kids won't be able to eat it. Substitute healthier snacks for treats and candy, like fruits, pretzels, and hummus. While you don't have to completely cut out junk food, removing the temptation will make kids less likely to clamor for junk.Make desserts together at home, like a simple cake or chocolate cookies, to get kids more interested in their food and turn junk food into an activity, not an everyday occurrence.
Studies show that making some foods ""off-limits"" makes them more desirable to kids. Don't eliminate junk food, just make it a ""sometimes food."", Telling them the need to eat an apple may turn them off, but giving them the chance to choose between grapes, apples, bananas, or an orange will excite them and make them feel in charge. The more often you give a child choices the more excited they will be to eat something you put in front of them., Preferably, match the new food with 1-2 old favorites. This gives them something to be excited about and makes trying the new food easier. If they don't like it, they can always return to the Mac and Cheese after tasting something new."

Hugs!, Remove crust from two pieces of sliced bread with a knife. Use a large, heart shaped cookie cutter to create a heart shape from both pieces of bread. Then make your sandwich as normal, put both halves together, and send it with your kids with love.

To continue with the Valentine’s theme, you might want to use a red jelly or jam on your heart shaped sandwich, like raspberry jam or strawberry jelly.
A 3½ in (9 cm) heart shaped cookie cutter should work just fine for most kinds of sliced bread., Gather cucumbers, strawberries, and watermelon. Cut these into slices. Use a heart shaped cookie cutter to create little hearts from your cucumber and watermelon. Since strawberries are already heart shaped, simply halve these.

Arrange these on a plate or put them in a plastic baggie for your kids. You might want to include some dip for the cucumbers., Gather together some pre-made dough, tomato sauce, and toppings, like mozzarella cheese and pepperoni. Roll out your dough and then use a knife to cut away pieces to form the shape of a heart. Then:

Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the dough. Add cheese on top of the sauce.
Add toppings on top of the cheese. Pepperoni cut into heart shapes works great.
Bake your pizza according to the dough’s instructions. Generally, a normal sized pizza should bake in about 20 minutes at 400°F (204°C). Enjoy the pizza."

Make the kids a part of meal planning.,
Enroll them in cooking, farming, or food related camps and activities.,
Hide healthy ingredients in old favorites.,
Make the food fun.,
Make your food the only meal option they get.,
Serve food family style.,
Be persistent, but not pushy.",How to Get Kids to Eat Healthy2," This is one of the best ways to get children excited about eating healthy food because they feel like they are choosing the food, not being forced to eat it. Have them choose one part of the meal each night, make your grocery list with you, or prepare simple parts of the meal, like mixing or stirring things.See what foods your child gravitates towards in the store and reward them for their help.
If they seem interested, challenge the kid to balance the meal themselves. Make a chart for each day of the week with space for a protein, carb, and fruit/vegetable and let them choose something for each category.Offer to let teens and older children take charge of one meal a night. Let them know that you'll eat whatever they make, as long as they do too.

, There is a variety of special summer camps and after school programs related to food these days, and this can be a great way to introduce healthy foods without doing all the work yourself. Kids will feel more comfortable trying new things if their friends are doing it, and they can feel proud bringing recipes or nutrition facts back home to you. Check your local parks and rec department for a list of camps, or search online for nearby food experiences for kids., You can sneak vegetables into almost anything if you are stealthy about it. Try puréeing or finely chopping up some vegetables into kid-friendly foods to get them vital vitamins and minerals whenever possible. Some ideas include:


Chopped onions, broccoli, peppers, and spinach in quesadillas or mac & cheese.
Calcium rich yogurt and fruit in blended smoothies.
Thinly sliced eggplant, peppers, squash, or zucchini in lasagna., Smiley faces, even when they are made out of peas, look a lot more appetizing than a pile of green, slimy orbs. Use the occasional drop of food coloring to make ""Green eggs and ham"" or blue spaghetti squash. While you don't need to go overboard, healthy food is a lot easier to get on the table if it is hidden behind something fun.


Let them know fun or exotic names of things, like Papaya, Mango, Zucchini, or Bok Choi.
Cut up vegetables into fun shapes.
Have kids sample the food for a ""texture test"" before you put it on the table.
Let your children explore a bit -- ask them how they might cook something or show them where the food comes from., Don't give in to your child's temper and make a separate meal just for them. You need to stand firm with the healthy meal you've put on the table. If you keep making them specialty food, you tell them that the healthy meal you've put together is not really important and validated their picky habits. Make one meal and stick to it.You can still offer choices within this meal, such as spaghetti with either red sauce or a little olive oil, and only cook one meal.

, Put your meal out on the table and let the kids choose what they want to eat, instead of cooking them a separate meal or putting everything on their plate for them. Kids love to feel like they are in charge of their own decisions, and will likely model their behavior after you. It also lets them put as much of a new food on their plate as they want to sample before coming back for seconds.Ask them to put at least one of everything on their plate, but let them choose the amount.
Serve yourself first so that they can see how much of each food you take.

, It can take between 10 and 15 exposures to a new, healthy food for a child to try something, so take you time and avoid yelling or forcing a child to eat.This will only give them bad memories of the food and make it harder to get them to try something else later. Put the food in front of them and ask them to give it a try, but don't get upset if they won't finish it. Thank them for trying and move on to another food.


Try different ways of cooking foods, such as raw vegetables one night, steamed the next, and roasted the third. Let them know that cooking changes taste and texture.

Get individual yogurt cups just for them.,
Match up fruits and vegetables with healthy dips.",How to Get Kids to Eat Healthy3," The best time to sneak in some fiber is often breakfast, as many cereals now are made with whole-grains that you child won't even notice. Take this time to swap whole grain or high fiber cereals in for their favorites., Oatmeal is a great way to sneak fruits and calcium-rich milk or yogurt into the beginning of the day. You can also let your kids customize it to make it their own. Some options include:


Cocoa powder.
Dried or sliced fruit.
Nuts
Agave nectar, honey, or natural sugars (in moderation).
Cinnamon or spices.

, Chances are good you child won't notice the difference, and the added fiber will be good for their bodies.

, Your child can choose between a variety of yogurt and granola flavors, and many fruits from bananas and apples to mango and berries will mix in as well.

, Go over lunch together so that the feel like they have some agency in the meal. Aim to have one fruit or vegetable, a grain, and a source of protein, and don't feel bad about adding a small desert as well if you trust them to eat everything.

, This simple switch may be hard for a week or two, but you child will quickly get used to it once they have a few sandwiches. Adding fiber to their diet without becoming overpowering, whole-wheat bread is a staple of healthy lunches.

, Naturally sweet, fruit is one of the easiest healthy foods to get into a lunch box. What fruit do they enjoy? What are some fruits that they will never eat? Remember to be creative -- you can scoop out watermelon, for example, and keep it in Tupperware safely on the way to school.


There are a lot of different types of apples, for example. Get you kid excited by having a ""tasting party,"" where you let them sample 3-5 types of apple to find their favorite.

, What dressing is on top? What meat or filling to they love? Once you know how they like the beginnings of their sandwich you can find ways to augment it to be healthier.


Tuna melts -- 1 Can tuna, mixed with light mayo and black pepper, with a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato, and sliced avocado, prepared like a grilled cheese.
Peanut Butter and Jelly with sliced apple in between.
Turkey or Ham sandwiches with thinly sliced cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, and/or tomato.
A spinach or tomato wrap is a great alternative to a plain white roll.

, Can you find a healthy alternative for processed treats, like homemade cookies or a sweet roll with jam? What are the big ""offenders"" in the lunches and how can they be replaced? For example, pretzels, which are baked, are much healthier than a bag of chips, even though kids might not notice that they are a ""healthy"" option.

, If you don't go overboard on the cheese, pizza is actually a decent, well-balanced meal that kids will love. You can slowly add healthy toppings, or make a ""special slice"" with extra cheese that they can eat after trying the rest.


Tru caramelized onions, peppers, or mushroom, finely chopped. These vegetables get sweet after cooking in a skillet with a little oil for 10-12 minutes.
Chopped spinach is almost impossible to detect once it heats up and shrinks a bit.

, Try using a hand blender to puree some squash, carrots, or peppers into red sauce, or saute finely chopped onions and zucchini and add them in with the pasta before serving. No one will notice, but the added vegetables are key for a healthy diet.


Switching to whole-grain pasta is a great way to get more fiber into your daily diet.

, Roast veggies are often the easiest for kids to stomach. Try roasting parsnips, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, squash, and brussel sprouts in a high-heat oven with a little olive oil and salt for a crispy, crunchy side dish.

, This actually applies to a wide variety of food. Frying requires a lot of oil, which adds fat and cholesterol to the meal. If you bake the meal, however, you can still provide some of your child's favorite foods with a healthier twist.


If you can bake a food instead of frying it, it will almost always be healthier.

, Spicing is a great way to get kids involved with making dinner their own. Right before adding spices, call your child over and ask them to smell different scents. Which ones do they like? Which ones do you normally mix together? The child can then feel free to make their own ""special blend,"" customizing the flavor of chicken or fish to their liking.


Remind them, however, that you only need a small pinch of spices to get a lot of flavor.

, Trail mix, customizable and naturally sweet, is a great on-the-go snack for picky children. It is usually a mixture of:


Cereal
Granola
Dried Fruit
Nuts
A touch of chocolate.

, This is a great source of protein, and you can often puree vegetables in as well. All you need are chickpeas, oil, and a food processor.


Add salt, pepper, and herbs & spices to make the dip your own.

, Beans have protein in them that will make the snack more filling and less salty, and kids will love having baked tortilla chips, which feel like junk food.

, Let them pick their favorite flavors and assure them that those are their personal yogurt cups. They'll be excited to have their own food and more likely to reach for it in the fridge.Whenever you can get ""individual"" healthy options, it lets them feel in control and happier to eat healthily.

, Apples and celery go fantastic with peanut butter, for example. Raw Carrots, peppers, and cucumbers match well with hummus. Kids will be more likely to eat healthy food if they can dip them in something delicious at the same time.

Always include a source of protein.,
Include carbohydrates.,
Include lower to moderate amounts of fat.,
Encourage your child to drink an adequate amount of fluid.,
Look for foods high in both calcium and iron.,
Aim to keep foods at the right temperature.,
Do not overload lunch boxes.,
Separate perishable and non-perishable foods.,
Consider packing non-perishable snacks.,
Mix together your own trail mix.,
Whip up an energizing smoothie.,
Wrap up a strawberry and peanut butter wrap.,
Layer up a peach and blueberry yogurt parfait.,
Make your own protein packs.",How to Pack Energizing Snacks for Kid Athletes," An essential part to an energizing snack is protein. This nutrient will help your child build and repair their muscle tissue during the day.Protein is not only essential for muscle, but also to help keep your child more satisfied during the day. Protein takes longer to digest and can help prevent your child from getting overly hungry throughout the day.
There are many sources of lean protein. Pick a variety of items that your child enjoys. You can try: poultry, eggs, dairy products, beef, fish, nuts, beans or tofu.
Measure out the correct portion of protein for your child's snack. Include one serving or about 1-2 ounces per snack.;
, Similar to protein, carbohydrates are another essential nutrient to include in your child's snack. Carbohydrates provide an immediate source of energy to your child's body.Carbohydrates break down into glucose or sugar once digested. This will provide the immediate energy boost for your child during the day.When combined, both protein and carbohydrates will provide immediate and longer-term energy and help your child's body recover after activity.
Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods including: dairy products, fruit, starchy vegetables and grains.
When measuring out appropriate portions, go for: 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1 oz of cheese, 1/2 cup or 1 small piece of fruit, 1 cup of starchy vegetables and 1 oz of grains per serving., Although fat plays an important role in your child's overall diet, it might not be a great addition for an energizing snack. Keep fat content lower in your child's snacks.


Fat takes a longer time to digest. If it's making foods hang around longer in your child's stomach, it can cause some GI distress once they become active.
Typical symptoms include: stomach cramps, general stomach upset, nausea or persistent fullness.When choosing foods for your child's snack, choose lower fat foods like: low-fat dairy, poultry, eggs, beans or tofu.
If including nutritious foods that do have a higher fat content, keep the portion sizes smaller. For example, nuts, nut butters, full fat dairy or avocados have a lot of healthy fats. However, portions should be 1 oz of nuts or avocado and only a 1/2 cup of dairy.

, As activity levels increase, the amount of clear fluids you need increases. This is true for both adults and young athletes.


Children have similar needs to adults. Have your child aim for 7-11 cups of non caffeinated, sugar-free fluids every day. The more active they are or the older they are, the more fluids they need.Encourage your child to drink beverages like: water, flavored water, sparkling water or decaf tea.
If your child participates in a higher intensity activity for more than 60 minutes, they can drink 8-10 oz of an electrolyte or sport's beverage.Also, during these longer bouts of activity, your child should be drinking every 15-20 minutes if possible.

, There are certain nutrients that are essential for kid athletes. Although they do not provide energy, both calcium and iron are especially important for athletes.Calcium is a mineral found in dairy products, dark leafy greens, tofu and some nuts and seeds. It's important for children so they can build strong bones and help prevent fractures or breaks.
In general, most children need about 1,000-1,300 mg of calcium each day.Iron helps build red blood cells which will carry oxygen to organs and muscles. When children do not consume adequate iron, they can become anemic which causes fatigue and shortness of breath.
Kids needs anywhere from 10-15 mg of Iron each day. Try foods like red meat, dark leafy greens, beans, fortified grain products and seafood., If your child participates in sports before or after school, you'll most likely need to pack their snacks. Make sure to keep these packed snacks at the right temperature so they remain safe.


Many foods need to be kept cold or hot to remain safe. When foods enter the ""danger zone"" range (40-140 degrees F), they're more likely to contain bacteria that can cause children or adults to become sick.Use ice packs, insulated lunch boxes, frozen water bottles or juice boxes to help keep foods cold and under that 40 degree mark.
If you're trying to keep foods hot, use a thermos along with an insulated lunchbox to keep foods above 140 degrees F.

, When you are packing lunches, you also need to make sure that you don't pack too much food. This can prevent foods from getting or staying at the right temperature.Try to pack only enough food that will fit reasonably into a lunch box or other insulated package. If you have to squeeze or press foods in, you may be overloading the container.
Also, do not pack more food than your child will eat. If foods get left in the lunch box, by the time your child returns home, these foods will most likely have been kept at a temperature within the ""danger zone"" and will need to be thrown out.

, There are two different groups of foods that you can pack. Keep perishable foods at the correct temperature and out of contact from non-perishable items.When packing lunches and snacks, only keep the perishable foods in your child's lunch box.
Perishable foods include: deli meat, dairy products, slice fruit or vegetables, salads, casseroles or leftovers.
Non-perishable items should be packed separately. Items like nuts, whole fruits, grains, dried fruit or packaged snacks do not need to be kept cold or warm.

, If your child is at school for long hours or doesn't have a place to keep packed snacks, consider packing them non-perishable snacks.


Depending on what's available, your child may find it easier to have non-perishable snacks. This way, they don't have to worry about keeping things warm or cold.
Try: trail mix, protein bars, whole fruit, granola bars, canned tuna and cracker packs or whole fruit with peanut butter packets.
These snacks can be eaten any time, anywhere without having to be refrigerated or heated.

, Trail mix is an easy to make snack that can provide your child with long lasting energy through the day. Plus, you can customize it to fit any child's palate.In a large bowl, mix together the following: 1 cup of dried craisins, 1 cup of sliced dried apricots, 1 cup of roasted almonds, 1 cup of roasted peanuts and 1 cup of roasted pumpkin seeds.
If you'd like, you can also add 1 cup of dark chocolate chips. This does increase the sugar content, but make for a tasty and kid-friendly addition.
Store trail mix in a large tupperware container. Portion out 1/3 cup servings for your child.

, Another great way to bump up your child's energy and nutrition is with a smoothie. These are great before school, after school or during weekend games and practices.In a blender combine the following: 1 cup of frozen mixed berries, 1/2 of a banana, 1/4 cup of tofu and 1/2 cup of milk.
Blend until smoothie is creamy and no chunks remain. Taste and adjust for thickness - adding more milk for a thinner consistency.
This smoothie can be made in advance and stored in a thermos to keep it cold during the day.

, If you're short on time and need a quick, but energizing snack for your child, try this strawberry and peanut butter wrap.Start by laying out an 8"" whole wheat tortilla on the counter. Spread on 2 tablespoons of peanut butter over the entire tortilla. You can also use almond butter or another nut butter.
Slice up 3-4 strawberries and lie each slice flat down the middle of the wrap.
Roll up the wrap and slice into 3-4 rolls. Serve immediately. However, if you want, you can wrap this in plastic wrap before slicing and keep it cold in a lunch box for later.

, Yogurt is a great source of protein. Combined with fruit, this snack will give your child the energy they need to fuel through a game or practice.In a small tupperware or glass, layer the following: 1/4 cup of yogurt, 1/4 cup of sliced peaches and 1/4 cup of blueberries. Layer your parfait so there are two layers of each item.
Top your parfait with one last 1/4 cup of yogurt and a sprinkling of granola or chopped nuts.
If you want to pack this, make sure it's in a sealed container and kept under 40 F until eaten.

, Another fun and energizing snack that you can pack for your child athlete are homemade protein packs. They're convenient and will give your child a great boost of long-lasting energy.


Choose 2 high protein foods along with a fruit or a vegetable.
For example, measure out 1 oz of sliced turkey, 1 oz of cheese and 1 oz of sliced apples. You could also try: 1 oz of almonds, 1 oz of dried cranberries and 1 oz of cubed cheese.
Slice and package your items ahead of time and store them in a tupperware container with dividers or a bento box. Keep refrigerated and then pack in an insulated lunch box the next day.

, If they know how much sugar and fat they are consuming, they will be less likely to want to continue eating it. Teach them to read ingredients' lists and recognize the unhealthy and disgusting components. However, if the children are very young, they may need your help explaining what all of the nutrition facts mean.

Check on the Cheetos every 10 minutes as they bake. Stir them with a spatula so that all sides dry evenly.

, Remove the Cheetos from the oven. Allow them to cool for 15 minutes or so, then enjoy as usual.


This method will bind the spicy seasoning to the chips more effectively than the shortcut method does.

Combine the coating ingredients.,
Transfer the coating mix to a shallow bowl or dish.,
Heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).,
Combine the cornmeal, milk, egg whites, and 1 tsp (5 ml) salt.,
Place the mixture in a cookie gun.,
Squeeze portions of chip dough directly into the oil.,
Fry until golden brown.,
Drain the chips.,
Coat the chips.,
Cool slightly before eating.",How to Make Hot Cheetos3," Place the cheddar cheese powder, buttermilk powder, salt, paprika, black pepper, red cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and cornstarch in a mini food processor or spice grinder. Pulse the ingredients together for 10 to 15 seconds or until evenly distributed., Set this dish aside until later.


If any spices still appear unevenly mixed, quickly stir them into the rest of the mixture with a fork or spoon.

, Pour 2 inches (5 cm) of cooking oil into a medium saucepan and set the saucepan on the stove over high heat. Monitor the temperature closely, altering the temperature controls as needed to maintain an even temperature.


Check the temperature of the cooking oil using a hot oil cooking thermometer, also called a candy thermometer.
If you do not have a cooking thermometer, test the oil by dropping a small drop of chip dough into it. Bubbles should form around the dough immediately, and the piece should float to the surface within seconds.
You may need to raise or lower the heat of the stove eye throughout the entire cooking process.

, Place the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir them together with a whisk or mixing spoon.


The mixture is ready only once all lumps have been removed.

, Spoon the cornmeal dough into a cookie gun or a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) round tip. Pack the dough in well.


It is recommended that you test the consistency of the chip dough before pressing forward. Try squeezing the dough through the die of the cookie gun or the tip of the pastry bag.
If the mixture is too dry to fit through, return it to the mixing bowl and mix in another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of milk.
If the mixture is too wet and refuses to hold any shape or form, return it to the mixing bowl and mix in another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of corn meal.

, Squeeze 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7.6 cm) lengths of dough into the oil. Hold the cookie gun close to the surface of the oil as you work to prevent large amounts of splashing and splatter.


Fry four to six Cheetos at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan since doing so can cause the chips to stick together or cook unevenly.

, Cook the chips in the hot oil for 15 seconds. Flip, using a slotted spoon or tongs, then fry them for another 15 seconds.

, Remove the chips from the hot oil and place them on a platter coated in clean paper towels. Let them drain for 10 to 20 seconds so that most of the excess oil slides off.


Do not allow the chips to drain or cool completely. They still need to be a little warm and a little moist so that the spicy cheese coating will cling to them.

, Transfer the still-hot and slightly moist chips into the bowl of hot cheese powder. Toss well using a fork until all sides are well coated.


For this step, it is recommended that you use a fork or similar utensil instead of your hands. If you use your fingers, the moisture from your hands and from the oil on the chips can cause the coating to stick to your skin, thereby making a sticky mess.

, Remove the chips from the coating mixture and place them in a serving dish. Once they are cool enough to handle with your hands, you can eat them.


While the taste and texture may not be exactly the same as commercial Flamin' Hot Cheetos, you should end up with something pretty similar.
Note that these chips are best eaten after being freshly fried. They may get soggy after a few days.

Enjoy your homemade jelly beans.",How to Make Jelly Beans," Place the water, granulated sugar, and gelatin in a large saucepan. Stir to combine.
, Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Allow the gelatin mixture to reach a boil, stirring frequently.

You'll need to stir the mixture with a wooden or plastic spoon as it heats up. Otherwise, the gelatin granules may gather together and form lumps.
Once the mixture reaches a boil, use a wet pastry brush to wash down the sides of the pan. Doing so removes any sugar clinging to the sides and creates a smoother syrup.

, Insert a candy thermometer into the mixture as soon as it reaches a boil. Continue cooking the syrup until it reaches a temperature of 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius).With the stove heat set to medium, this process should take 20 to 25 minutes.
Do not allow the syrup to reach temperatures much higher than this. If it does, the resulting jelly beans will become hard instead of chewy.

, Fill a large bowl with cold water and add a tray of ice cubes. Place the bottom of the saucepan in this bowl and keep it there for 5 minutes.

If you do not have a large enough bowl, you can fill your sink with ice water, instead.
The ice water should stop the temperature from rising any higher.

, Pour the juice into the syrup and sprinkle it with the salt. Stir well to combine.

You can use any flavor juice for this recipe. If you opt for a mild flavor, consider adding an extra squeeze of lemon juice to enhance it.
Alternatively, you can use liquid flavoring or extracts instead of juice. Since these options are more concentrated, you'll only need to add a few drops instead of the full 1/2 cup (125 ml).
You may also wish to enhance the color of these beans by adding a few drops of food coloring to the syrup, but doing so is not necessary since you'll be adding a colorful shell later on.

, Spray the jelly bean molds with nonstick cooking spray.

The molds should be evenly covered but not drenched. If you notice any puddles of cooking spray sitting in the indentations, use a clean paper towel to dab away the excess.
You can use either plastic or silicone jelly bean molds. You may not need to coat silicone molds, but this step is strongly recommended if you decide to use plastic molds.

, Use a spoon to carefully fill each mold indentation with the flavored syrup.

Try to fill each mold completely. While it might create a mess, over-filling the molds will ultimately be better than under-filling them since the beans will be difficult to remove from under-filled molds.

, Allow the syrup to sit at room temperature for four to six hours, or until the gelatin has firmed up.If you want to speed up the process, you can place the molds into a refrigerator for two to three hours. When taking this option, you should also place the filled molds into a freezer for 20 to 40 minutes after refrigeration to make them even firmer and easier to work with.Test the beans by touching them. They will have a definite solid form, but they should also feel sticky and gummy when pressed.

, Invert the mold and press on each indentation from the bottom side. Doing so should cause the jelly beans to pop out.

Since the beans are so sticky, they may not pop out immediately. If the beans do not pop out, you can use a small spoon to dig them out of their molds. Most should hold their shape even if pressed in this manner.

, Place the jelly beans in a bowl and add the cornstarch. Toss to coat, then allow them to sit for at least four hours.

The corn starch should absorb some of the remaining moisture, making the beans easier to handle.
After drying the beans, you many need to toss them into a sieve to help shake away any excess cornstarch. This won't always be necessary, though, since much of the cornstarch will be absorbed by the beans.

, Pour the corn syrup into a small bowl and stir in several drops of food coloring. Continue stirring until the color is evenly dispersed.If desired, you could also add a few drops of liquid flavoring. Make sure that the flavoring matches or accents the flavor used for the chewy inner portion of the bean.

, Spoon the corn syrup mixture into the bowl of jelly bean middles. Use a spoon to toss the beans until they're evenly coated.

This sticky mixture will become part of the outer shell, so it's important to coat all sides of the all the beans. If you have difficulty doing this while all the beans are piled together, you may wish to transfer the beans into smaller bowls and toss each bowl separately.

, Spoon all the beans into a bowl of superfine sugar. Use a spoon to toss them around, coating all sides evenly.

The superfine sugar will help dry out some of the sticky mixture and prevent the beans from clumping together. It's also a crucial ingredient for the hard outer coating.
Superfine sugar is strongly recommended. If you don't have superfine sugar, standard granulated sugar will also work, but the resulting shell will have a slightly grainy texture.

, Transfer the jelly beans to a large jar. Add some grated cocoa butter to the jar, as well.

The cocoa butter will help prevent the beans from sticking together as they tumble.
Using a large glass jar will be your cheapest option, but if you have a clean rock tumbler, that would work even better.

, Seal the jar and title it at an approximate 45-degree angle. Turn it in your hands for at least 15 minutes while maintaining this angle.

Tumbling the candy polishes it, which should result in a smoother, harder shell.
If you're using a rock tumbler instead of turning the candy by hand, you should let the candy tumble for roughly two hours. Longer tumbling will result in an even smoother coating.

, If the beans still feel tacky when you remove them from the jar or tumbler, spread them out over a sheet of parchment paper and allow the beans to dry overnight.

As they dry, the coating should also become even harder.
Depending on how sticky the beans feel, you may need to flip them over halfway through the drying process to allow both sides adequate drying time.

, Once the beans are dry, they're ready to eat!"

For instance, if you think the plain square-shaped sandwich is boring, use a knife to cut from the bottom left corner towards the center of the sandwich’s top edge. Then cut another identically-sized piece from the bottom-right corner toward the same point. You’ll now have three triangle-shaped sandwiches (tri-wiches). Eat and enjoy your tri-wiches.Circles are also delicious snack shapes. Place your favorite sandwich ingredients into a whole-grain wrap. You could use mayo, cheese, meat, lettuce, tomato, and/or pickles. Roll it up by folding the edge closest to you to the middle of the wrap. Roll the new, curved edge that forms from the fold toward the back edge until it’s wrapped up nicely. Slice the wrap every inch (every two centimeters) along its length. Enjoy your round mini-sandwich wraps.
Try using different shaped cookie cutters to make fun shapes. Try using a star-shaped cookie cutter in the center of your sandwich.
Which sort of shape should your snack be? The sky’s the limit! Think about your favorite shapes, then bring them to life (with an adult’s help).;

Ask an adult to finely dice some red and green pepper into small bits, then sprinkle them across the surface of the holiday tree.
The diced peppers are designed to look like ornaments or tree lights.

, One of the best healthy snacks for Halloween is the banana (or “boo-nana”) ghost. Peel a banana and cut it carefully in half on a plate. Place a lollipop stick halfway into the flat end of each banana half. Press two chocolate chips into the upward-facing side of the banana about half an inch (one centimeter) from the top point of the banana. The chips represent eyes, and so should be quite close to each other, and make a straight side-to-side line relative to the pointy end of the banana (which represents the ghost’s head).Pick the banana ghost up by the lollipop stick and snack away.
Be careful to eat the ghost over a plate, since it might slide off the stick as you eat.

, Ask an adult to slice and core an apple with an apple slicer. (You need 16 even slices, but most apple slicers only slice apples into eight slices.) Discard the core and then ask the adult to slice each apple wedge lengthwise down its middle.If you don’t have an apple slicer, they can cut the apple into eight even slices, then cut the innermost edge of the apple out so that no seeds or core remains on the slices.
Next, get started on the apple dip. Mix 1 cup of plain yogurt, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 tablespoon of peanut butter in a bowl. Spoon some of the mixture into a small dipping cup. Place the dipping cup in the center of a plate.
Arrange your apple slices around the dipping cup in a semicircle beginning from the left side of the cup and arcing up and over to the right side of the dipping cup. The apple slices should be placed on their edges, not on their flat sides. Alternate the edges so that when viewed from above, every other apple slice shows red skin, and the others show the whitish apple flesh. These slices represent the turkey’s feathers.
The dipping cup makes the turkey’s head and body, so stick two chocolate chips in the upper section of the peanut butter dip to represent the turkey’s eyes. The chips should be placed in a symmetrical position along an imaginary horizontal (side-to-side) line.
Place a candy corn just below the chocolate chips with the point facing down. This represents the turkey’s beak.
Begin eating the apple slices and dipping them in the peanut butter dip.

, Apple race cars are healthy snacks that require apple slices, grapes, and toothpicks. Cut an apple into five or six wedges by slicing it vertically. Cut the angle off of the apple wedge by cutting straight down along a vertical axis from a point about one centimeter (half an inch) behind the angle. Place the apple on a plate or cutting board with the skin side up. The apple slice will be able to stand on its own without tipping over.Push two toothpicks through the base of the apple slice. An equal length of toothpick should stick out on both sides of the apple slice.
The toothpicks should be about three centimeters (two inches) apart and about as high off the surface of the plate as the width of your pinkie finger would be if you laid it on the plate next to the apple wedge.
Stick a grape on each length of toothpick that’s sticking out of the apple slice.
Enjoy your apple race car. Eat the grapes first, then remove the toothpicks and eat the apple slice.
Be careful not to prick your hand when touching the toothpick.

The ingredients should be made up of things like ""tomato juice,"" ""celery juice,"" ""beet juice,"" or ""onion juice from concentrate.""

, You may think that freshly squeezed juice is better than juices that are made from concentrate. However, nutritionally, you won't see much difference between the two, as long as you're picking 100 percent juice.In other words, if you see ""orange juice from concentrate"" on the label, that is nutritionally pretty much the same as ""orange juice.""

, While fortified juices can provide vitamins for your kids, these juices are often not 100 percent juice. Always be sure to check that the drink is pure juice rather than a juice blend with added sugars. If you're not sure, read the ingredient list. If it has ingredients like ""sugar"" or ""high-fructose corn syrup,"" then it's not pure juice.Even if you see claims like ""100% DV of vitamin D,"" make sure to still look for the label ""100% juice.""

, Every juice offers some nutrients, but juices don't all offer the same nutrients. Therefore, it's a good idea to switch up the juices your kids are drinking, so they get a variety of vitamins. Try apple, red grape juice, pomegranate juice, orange juice, pineapple juice, grapefruit juice, and tomato juice just to name a few. Berry juices are also good choices., Some people believe that organic juices are healthier. To be labelled organic, foods must be free of synthetic flavors and dyes. It also must be grown with organic farming methods, including not using synthetic pesticides. For that reason, organic juices contain fewer unnatural ingredients.A juice has to be certified by the government to earn the label ""organic."" Look for the word on the front of the label.

, When giving your children juice, make sure to keep it no more than 4 to 6 ounces (1/2 to 3/4 of a cup) of juice per day for children ages 1 to 6 and no more than 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1½ cups) for children 7 to 18 years old.One way to help with portion sizes is to choose options that are pre-portioned, such as juice boxes., Babies under 6 months should stick solely to formula or breast milk for drinking and you should not offer juice until after 12 months. After 6 months, babies can start to drink small amounts of water, but make sure to discuss this with your pediatrician. Juice can take away from the nutrition they need to get from those other sources, and babies don't need the added sugar.Some sources suggest waiting until kids are 2-years-old before giving them juice. Children who don't have juice won't crave juice, which will keep their sugar intake lower., When starting your child on juice, it is a good idea to dilute it 50/50 with water. This will cut down on the sugar and calories while still giving your child the taste of juice. If your older kids like the taste of juice but you'd like to cut back on their sugar, try adding a dash of juice to water and sparkling water. It may take your kids some time to adjust, but they'll soon like this refreshing beverage., If you let your child sip juice frequently throughout the day, you increase their chances of developing tooth decay because sugar and acid are constantly on their teeth. Children should only drink juice at mealtimes, so that they don't have that sugar on their teeth all day long., When your child wants some juice, just say, “No, you can't have juice right now, but here is an apple.” Don’t ask your child if they would like a piece of fruit instead of juice because the answer will probably be no. The whole fruit has fiber, whereas the juice does not, helping them to feel full. Juice contributes to your child's overall calories, but it doesn't help them feel as full.For instance, if your child asks for orange juice, ask if they want an orange instead. Similarly, you could offer an apple instead of apple juice, along with a cup of water.

, Water is the best option for kids (and adults!), so serve water as much as possible. Tap water and sparkling water are both good options for kids, iced or lukewarm, depending on their preference.Make drinking water more fun! Let kids have a special cup or water bottle that's just for them. Silly straws can also make it more fun.
Try sparkling waters with added flavors that don't have sweeteners.
Another way to make water more fun for kids is to add pieces of fruit for a light flavor. You can add lemon, lime, grapefruit, or orange wedges, or slices of strawberries or cucumber, for instance. Mint leaves are also a nice addition.
If your kids complain about the water tasting bad, try using a filtered water pitcher that you keep cold in the fridge.

, Another healthy option is low-fat milk. Milk is a great option for kids because it provides them with the calcium they need to strengthen their bones. While milk does have some sugar (from lactose), it's not as sugary as juice, and it contains protein, as well., Tea can also be a good option for older children (10 years and older), as long as it is caffeine-free. It should also be unsweetened or very lightly sweetened to cut down on sugar. Try choosing teas in fun flavors kids might like, such as raspberry tea or mint tea."

Enjoy your experience.",How to Begin Cooking in the Kitchen (for Kids)," It is always important to ask for permission first before you start using the kitchen for cooking. You never know what plans the adults might have, or if mom thinks you're not yet old enough to be cooking without her supervision!;
, This means reading it all the way through and possibly more than once. Make sure that you understand it. If there is anything in the recipe that doesn't make sense, ask an older person for help.

, Wash your hands before you begin, as you are cooking and handling food, and at the end. It is also important to wash your hands every time you touch the garbage bin, compost container or when you pick up anything off the floor.

, It is important to have all of your ingredients and equipment assembled before you start cooking. Get all the things like baking trays, flour sifter, double boiler etc. out and all of the food ingredients. This will help you follow the recipe more easily and prevent any messing around looking for ingredients and equipment that you didn't realize you needed—or maybe don't even have!

, When you are a beginner cook, you should follow the recipe exactly. As you cook more, you will become more at ease with making changes to a recipe and still create successful dishes.

, Always be aware of hot surfaces. Keep saucepan handles turned inwards so that you don't accidentally knock them. Use oven mitts or pot holders to remove things from the oven after cooking. And turn off the stovetop plates when not in use. Warn others in the kitchen that there are hot areas cooling down. Also be careful of steam - it can also burn, so do not put your hand or any other part of your body over steam as the food or water is cooking.

, It is easier if you can clean as you go but don't worry if this doesn't come naturally at first. After a while, you'll work out that this is easier than cooking in a mess! Just make sure that you clean up after yourself when you have finished cooking, and don't forget any spills on the floor or cupboard doors.

, Cooking is fun and a creative activity. When you feel a little more confident, start experimenting with different ingredients and come up with your own creations.

Know that it’s OK if your child doesn't want to bake cookies.",How to Bake Cookies with Your Child," The last thing you want is knowing that you don’t have all the ingredients when you want to start. That can cause a disaster. Look in your cabinets and pantry to assure you have all the ingredients. If you don’t, do a quick shopping spree with your child. Have them find all the ingredients and cross them out on the shopping list.;
, Have your child do a quick scavenger hunt of all the tools and ingredients you’ll need for your recipe.

, It helps your child if the recipe is printed out, even if you know it by heart. Your child will be able to read the recipe and comprehend what it means. If needed, describe what you child needs to do if they are having trouble understanding the recipe. You could also rewrite the recipe yourself and make it into an easier understanding for your child.

, Those packets avoid all the fun for your child because they are quick and easy to make. This also bores and upsets the child as they were hoping for at least an hour of baking. Try using easy scratch recipes. They don’t that long to make, after all!

, Pull over an apron and put on old clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty. Girls with long hair may need their hair tied, may need to wear a net, or may need to wear a chef’s hat to avoid hair in the cookies. Prevent your child from wearing expensive new clothes or clothes with long sleeves.


Letting your child wear an apron or/and a chef’s hat makes them feel proud and feel like a ‘baker’. Consider this while you choose an outfit before baking.

, Let’s admit, no one really likes messes. We parents, babysitters, older siblings, grandparents, or family members hate cleaning up after a child’s mess. But if you have a quick clean up mode, it’s not so bad. Cover your cooking space with an old tablecloth, have a roll of paper towels on hand to wipe up those spills, and wash each dish as you go on to bake up goodies!

, Younger children might not be able to reach their cooking space (or might have to stand on their tippy toes to reach). If that’s the case you might need to stable a stool for good reach.


Note that this will not be needed for taller kids.

, Teach your child how to preheat the oven and what it’s for. You may need to help them if they are having trouble. Supervision is defiantly needed.

, Have your child determine what size cooking pan they need. Grease or cover the cookie tin with parchment paper. Place it aside for later use.

, Mix that sugar, crack those eggs, pour the cocoa chips, and have a really good time. Children will have fun measuring and adding the ingredients in. Have them roll the dough and try to crack the eggs. Offer advice on how to bake cookies correctly. You never know, they might just bake some cookies for you on your birthday!

, Tell stories, crack a joke or two, tell about the cooking past, and pipe up the radio to dance while your favorite song pulls up. Before you know it those cookies will be in the oven!

, The kitchen is that second school for children. They’ll be able to measure the ingredients, read the recipe, learn what’s hot and what’s not, and so much more. Bring up that ‘school’ stuff whenever you can, but never overdue it.

, Remind your child that the cookies will bake, refrigerate, or do any other process. While you two are waiting, clean up. Wash those extra dishes, sweep up the floor, wipe the counter, and even clean yourself up!

, This is one of the greatest parts of the baking process of cookies. Kids have that excellent imagination and those wonderful plucky fingers. Decorate your cookies with icing, sprinkles, dried fruit, frosting, or spices. Have your child decorate them, not you! Have them do whatever they want to their cookie/s.

, Of course once the cookies are done you and your child get to eat them. But you are not the only ones to enjoy your fabulous cookies. Share them with the family, give them as a birthday gift, make dozens to bring at a hospital, or make a sale of the cookies and use the money for a cause. Not only will it teach your child about teamwork, it’ll teach them to know about others around them and how they feel.

, Mistakes were born to happen. There will be flour spills, or egg shells in the dough, or cookies that will bake as hard as rocks. Both of you will learn together of your mistakes and learn how to prevent them in the future. You may make valued changes to your recipe, or change things around in the kitchen. Discuss together how to avoid similar problems during baking and after baking.

, Not every child has that passion to bake a treat or two. Some may go insane for baking, others won’t. Some will much prefer to be bored than bake in a boring kitchen. Understand your child’s opinion and move on. Try doing something else together that they enjoy best.

Widen your child's food horizons.",How to Choose Healthy Kid's Meal Options," To make choosing a nutritious kids meal a little easier, try to pick a restaurant that is kid or family oriented. They may have more options or allow more substitutions and changes.Many fancier or expensive restaurants may not have a kids menu or serve foods that many children would actually want to eat.
In addition, the chef may not be as willing to make substitutions and changes to the meals or items served.
Look for a restaurant that has a children's menu available already. You may want to do some research online or call the restaurant to see what types of menus and foods are available.
Also, consider asking if the chef is willing to make changes, substitutions or serve smaller portions of items on the regular or adult menu.;
, Everyone needs to consume adequate amounts of protein. Children also need adequate protein. It's essential for the growth and development of their bodies.Start by telling your child to pick out a protein or meat. Give them a list of options or choices that you've already pre-selected. This will limit their options and keep them on track.
Although many kids menu's offer a fried or high fat source of protein (like chicken tenders or a hot dog), consider giving them the option of ordering something of the appetizer list or main entree list.
Grilled, steamed, baked or poached protein options are generally lower in fat and calories. These will be the best and most nutritious choice for your child.If you can only order a fried or high fat source of protein, that's OK. Focus on having your child select a more nutritious side.

, Both fruits and vegetables are full of fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.These are essential food groups and should be eaten at each one of your child's meals.


Once your child has selected a main dish or source of protein, move on to the side dish. Again, giving them a pre-selected menu or list will help keep them focused. If you're not offering french fries, buttered pasta or macaroni and cheese they won't know its available to order.
Since both fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories and very nutritious, you can give your child multiple choices. Emphasize the need for a healthy side if they've selected a higher fat or less healthy main dish.

, Another important point to focus on when ordering your child's meal is selecting a nutritious grain. Going for 100% whole grains is the most nutritious choice and will offer your child a good dose of extra fiber.100% whole grains are much higher in fiber, minerals and even protein compared to refined grains like white rice or plain pasta.
Review the menu and check for whole grain options. If you can't find them, ask the wait staff if they offer whole grains over the refined grains.
Many restaurants now offer whole grain bread, whole grain noodles or pasta and brown rice as sides. If your child is interested in having one of these options, go for the whole grain versions.

, Kids meals are notoriously famous for some fried foods. Try to limit the items you order that are higher in fat. They're usually higher in calories and low in beneficial nutrients.Whether it's chicken nuggets, french fries, a grilled cheese or a hotdog, you might not find the best bets on these kid menus. Try to avoid ordering these types of foods for your child's meal.
Ask instead if there are any grilled or lower fat options. For example, do they serve grilled chicken tenders? Would they offer a baked potato? These are better and more nutritious options for your child.

, Foods aren't the only unhealthy item that may be featured on kids menus. Be wary of high calorie, sugar-laden beverages that are often featured on kids menus as well.


Kids know that restaurants offer a variety of beverages. They may start asking for chocolate milk, lemonade or even soda knowing these options are available. Skip these sugary drinks in favor of something unsweetened.Again, give your child a menu of choices they can pick from. Leave out options like: chocolate milk, lemonade, sweetened tea, sodas, juices and mixed drinks like a Shirley Temple.
Instead, offer items like water or skim milk. Both of these options are the only drinks children should be drinking. However, an unsweetened tea or the occasional 100% fruit juice isn't bad.

, When you go to a restaurant with your children, it's important to help them review the entire menu. They (or even you) may go straight to the kids menu without looking over what else the restaurant offers.To find the healthiest or most nutritious option at restaurants, make sure you're aware of everything that they offer. If you only look at the kids menu, you'll limit your overall options.
Start with the kids menu. Review it and see if there's an option there that you think would be appropriate for your child. Some kids menu's offer items like grilled chicken, salmon and steamed vegetables.
Also review the other parts of the menu. This is an especially good idea if your child isn't picky about their food choices. You may find something on the appetizer list or sides that is more nutritious than what's offered on the kids menu.

, When you're out to eat with your child, you're most likely going to be the one scanning the entire menu for a nutritious option. Get your child involved in the meal making decision by giving them a select list of options to choose from.Scan the menu and come up with 2 or 3 choices that would be appropriate for your child to have. Present these to your child and allow them to choose one of these options.
If you let your child choose their meals without your influence, they may end up choosing those standard higher fat or fried kids meal options. If you tailor their choices down, they'll be limited in what they can order.
Also, if you see a vegetable, fruit or lean protein you know your child already loves, offer this up as an option. This can help entice them to make a healthier choice.
Consider letting your child choose one nutritious item and one favorite item. If your child is asking for the chicken nuggets, don't fight them on it. Ask that they skip the fries and choose a more nutritious side.

, Kids might not understand the concept of portion control. This is a great teaching point for you to emphasize when you're out to eat with your family.


Kids might get excited about having a lot of options when you go out to eat. They're probably not given many options at home. They may want to order a few things that they don't get to eat on a regular basis.
If your child is asking for a few items, talk to them about how their eyes can sometimes be bigger than their stomach. It's important to only choose a protein and a side when you're out to eat.
If your child does want to try more than one item, ask them if splitting those items with a sibling or a parent would be beneficial.

, You might not want to let your child choose one of those standard fast food meals with a toy. However, consider allowing your child to choose these meals and talk to them about why these can be a good idea.


Many fast food restaurants are now offering a fruit as a side with their kids meals. You might get a small fruit salad, a clementine or sliced apples with the meal.
Kids meals also feature smaller than ""small"" options. You get a kid-sized chicken nuggets or fries which are automatically portion controlled.
Teach them that these may be good options because they can enjoy some of their favorite foods but still consume a well-balanced meal.

, Regardless of what habit you're trying to get your child to pick up, you'll be most successful if you lead by example. If you're not choosing a healthy meal at a restaurant, your child most likely won't either.When you're out to eat, make sure that you choose a healthy option. This will show your child how to order, but also ensure you're having a nutritious meal as well.
If you're craving something higher in calorie (like a cheeseburger) skip a higher calorie side and order something a little more nutritious. This can teach your child about compromising when you order a favorite item.
The more consistent you are with making healthy choices and offering them healthy choices, the more they'll come to fall into this routine.

, You may choose to go out to dinner so you can indulge in some of your favorite foods - especially if you don't cook them at home. Instead of talking about unhealthy foods, talk positively about healthy and nutritious foods in front of your children.


Like being a role model, your children hear the comments you make about foods. Avoid talking negatively about healthy items. For example, don't talk about how you don't like vegetables or don't think they taste good. Your children will pick up on this and mimic this behavior.
Focus on saying encouraging words about healthy eating. Talk about how vegetables taste delicious or you enjoy eating fresh fruit for dessert. This will help your child understand the importance of healthy eating.

, If you want your child to make healthy choices at restaurants or to ask for more nutritious foods, make sure you're setting that example at home. If children are used to eating items like macaroni and cheese or chicken nuggets on a regular basis, they'll continue to ask for those foods when you go out to eat.


Set the basis for healthy eating with home cooked meals. If you're normally serving lean protein, vegetables, fruits and whole grains, this will become your child's normal way of eating. They're more likely to ask for similar items at restaurants.Also, don't treat restaurant meals differently than home cooked meals. Many people treat eating out as a special occasion or a time to treat themselves to higher calorie or unhealthier foods. Your child will catch onto this so treat home cooked and restaurant meals similarly.

, Another great way to get your child to eat healthier options at restaurants is by introducing them to new foods. You can try going to ethnic restaurants to help expose your child to new foods.


Your child may not always like the traditional healthy and nutritious foods that are offered at restaurants. Plain steamed broccoli or grilled chicken may not be very tempting.
Try taking your child to a new restaurant or an ethnic restaurant where they'd be exposed to some of these same nutritious foods that are prepared in a very different manner.
For example, they may not like steamed broccoli, but enjoy vegetable tempura. They may also enjoy a curry dish or even pasta primavera with vegetables. Ask your child if they'd be interested in trying some of these new dishes.

Read the nutrition label.,
Consider looking for fortified cereals.,
Consider organic versus conventional cereals.,
Consider making your own baby cereal at home.",How to Choose Healthy Cereals for Your Baby1," When you're looking for a healthy and nutritious baby cereal, the first place you'll need to look is the food label. This is where you'll get a lot of information on the product and be able to compare to other items in the store.


Start by looking at the ingredient list. You'll want to know exactly what you're feeding your child (especially if you're worried about allergies or sensitivities). This is usually found on the back or side of the cereal container.
Regardless of what grain you're choosing, go for 100% whole grains. If the label says white rice or hulled wheat, these are not 100% whole grains.You will also see the nutrition fact panel on baby cereals. If your child needs to meet a certain calorie level to improve growth, this is where you'll find out how many calories this cereal contains per serving.;
, Many health professions like pediatricians suggest starting babies on fortified cereals. These products have certain nutrients added to them to help them be a more nutrient dense food for your child.Look for cereals that are fortified with iron. You might find this as a ""call-out"" on the front of the package. Double check there is iron on the ingredient list and on the nutrition fact panel. Babies need about 10 – 11 mg of iron per day.You may also see cereals that are fortified with DHA or EPA. These are optional fortifications; however, both of these healthy fats help support the development of your baby's brain and immune system.DHA is needed for brain, eye, and nervous system development. DHA accumulates in the brain during the first two years of life. The brain grows quickly at this time of life.Some infant cereals even advertise that they contain probiotics. Although this is only an optional fortification, some studies show that probiotics may help infants with colic, diarrhea or eczema., Another option that you'll see on store shelves is organic baby cereal. Decide whether or not you want to feed your child organic or conventional baby cereal.


Organic baby cereals are produced the same way that other organic foods are. They are not raised or farmed with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Feeding your baby an organic cereal may limit their exposure to these pesticides.
There are different organic labels you'll see in the store. ""100% organic"" can be used to label a product that contains 100% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water which are considered natural). ""Organic"" can be used to label any product that contains a minimum of 95% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water). Up to 5% of the ingredients may be inorganic, and are not commercially available as organic. ""Made with organic ingredients"" means they contain at least 70% organically produced ingredients.
When it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between organic and conventional baby cereal. The nutrients are identical.
Health professionals generally recommend you choose organic if you feel that is most important; however, it's better to focus on finding a cereal that contains adequate fortification and is something you and your baby will enjoy.

, If you don't find a baby cereal in-store that you think is appropriate for your child, consider making your own baby cereal. This is not very difficult, but does take some advanced planning.


To make your own homemade baby cereal, start by choosing what grain you'd like to use. Brown rice is the most common grain, but you can also use oats or multigrain cereals.Blend 1/4 cup of your chosen grain in a food processor until it becomes a powder or the consistency of flour.
Mix this with about 1 cup of water, breast milk or formula. Bring to a low simmer and whisk for a few constantly for about 10 minutes. Taste the cereal to make sure there are not uncooked pieces.
Allow your homemade cereal to cool completely or to be only room temperature. Serve to your child within 24 hours.

Pour your crushed graham crackers into a medium sized bowl.,
Add 1/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk.,
Roll your graham balls.,
Press your graham ball into a flat disk.,
Add your favorite filling.,
Fold your graham ball back into a ball shape.,
Smooth the edges.,
Enjoy!",How to Make Graham Balls1," You can buy crushed graham crackers or crush them yourself. You can make as many graham balls as you have ingredients for, but 2 cups of crushed graham crackers is a good place to start and will make about 6 graham balls.


Crushing graham crackers takes a little bit of time and energy. If you prefer to crush the crackers yourself, try using a mortar and pestle.;
, Pour the condensed milk over the crushed graham crackers and mix it all together with a plastic spatula until combined. Aim for a slightly clumpy sandy mixture. It shouldn't be too wet or too dry and should stick together slightly.

, Scoop out a heaping tablespoon into the palm of your hand and roll it between your palms until it becomes rounded.


Make sure you have washed your hands first!

, Holding the ball in the palm of your hand, gently press down on it with your other hand. Apply pressure gently to create an even and flat surface.


Don't press too hard or your dough might crumble.
Don't worry about the edges cracking slightly, you will be rolling it back up into a ball again later anyway.

, Press a few mini marshmallows or even chocolate chips into the center of the flat graham ball. Read on for some creative filling suggestions in the next section.


Make sure not to overfill your ball! Keep your marshmallow in the center and in a small pile. If you try to put too much filling inside your graham ball, it won't be able to close properly.

, Once you have a few marshmallows in the center of your disk, carefully fold the edges up and together as you gently press down on the center. Bring the edges together on the top of your ball.


The goal is to fold the dough over completely, covering the filling inside.

, After folding the sides over, hold your graham ball between your palms and gently roll it back into a ball, applying a slight pressure. Repeat the steps to create more graham balls.

, You can munch on your graham balls right away or chill them in the refrigerator for about 5-10 minutes beforehand.Dust them with powdered sugar or coconut flakes and enjoy them with a glass of milk. You can even wrap your graham balls up and give them out as gifts or party favors.


You can store your graham balls for 2 weeks in an airtight container in the refrigerator, otherwise, plan to eat them within a couple of days.

Most pediatricians will recommend that your child (as long as they are developing normally) begins solid foods anywhere from four to six months.
Talk to your pediatrician about what type of grain they think is the most appropriate for your child. Although rice cereal is the most common, your physician may suggest something different.
Also ask your pediatrician how often to start feeding your child cereals. It's typically recommended to try two times a day when your baby isn't overly cranky or sleepy.

, Rice cereals are the most common and easily found infant cereals. You will see white rice cereal and brown rice cereal options available.


Rice cereal is typically the most commonly recommended infant cereal to start with because it is exceedingly rare for an infant to be allergic to rice.If you do choose to start with rice cereal, choose a product that is fortified with iron.
Also, choose a cereal that is made from brown rice. White rice is heavily processed and many of the nutrients have been stripped from the grain.
You may be surprised and concerned that there is arsenic in rice. But arsenic is found in the Earth’s crust, and present in water and soil. Crops absorb arsenic as they grow, that’s how it gets into our foods.The FDA has issued a limit of 100 parts per billion for arsenic in infant rice cereal. Rice cereal is a good source of nutrients for your baby, but it should not be the only one. Be sure to provide a variety of infant cereals, like oat, barley and multigrain., Another type of infant cereal that's widely available is multigrain cereal. This will introduce more than one type of grain to your infant and may provide other sources of nutrients.


Whole grain cereals may include rice, oats, wheat, barley and even flax. If it's 100% whole grain, these foods are unrefined and still contain most of their nutrient dense components.Health professionals do recommend, that like all other cereals, your multigrain infant cereal should be fortified with iron. Check the labels to see that iron has been added to the cereal.
If you are worried that some of these grains could lead to an allergy later on, note that studies do not support this. In fact, introducing some of these grains earlier on actually reduce the risk for future food allergies., 100% whole grain cereal is another option that is available to parents. This is a single grain cereal that contains all the nutrient dense components of the wheat grain.


Again, the risk of allergies to wheat do not increase by giving your child wheat cereal in an early age.
In addition, both whole wheat, multi grain and oat cereal do not contain arsenic which may be found in rice cereals (like brown rice cereal).
Look for a wheat cereal that features 100% whole wheat grains and is fortified with iron.

, If you want to give your child something other than rice or whole wheat cereal, you can try using oat cereal. It will have little to no arsenic and is still a nutritious whole grain.


Like rice cereals, oat cereal is a great option because it's a single grain cereal. In addition, the likelihood of your child being allergic to oats is very, very low.Again, check the labeling to make sure it's 100% whole grain oats (you'll find this information on the food label).
Also, this cereal should be fortified with iron as oats do not have a high level of iron naturally.

Read the package instructions.,
Choose the appropriate liquid to mix with cereals.,
Toss out unused cereals.,
Be patient with your child.",How to Choose Healthy Cereals for Your Baby3," Regardless of what type of cereal you purchase for your baby, it's important to make sure that you follow the mixing instructions correctly. This will help ensure your baby is getting the right amount of cereal.


Each infant cereal will have specific instructions listed on the actual product. Before you purchase a product, make sure you read over the instructions.
If you need to cook or heat the cereal, make sure to follow the directions to ensure the cereal is prepared correctly. Always allow a cereal to come down to room temperature before feeding it to your child.
The cereal should be mixed until it's a thin and quite liquid consistency. You may need to add more milk or formula to get it to the right consistency., When preparing an infant or baby cereal, you'll need to mix the dry cereal with a liquid. Take advantage of this opportunity to add more nutrition to your baby's cereal.


Most cereals will tell you to mix with breast milk or formula. This helps increase the nutrient content (especially in terms of protein and fat) of the cereal. It's essential that you do this step.
You can mix your infant cereal with water if you do not have any breast milk or formula available to you.However, try to limit how often you do this.

, Like most baby foods, you do not want to keep prepared cereals long. Feeding your child leftovers can put them in danger of getting sick.You need to be extra careful with how long you store uneaten baby cereals. Babies and infants are the most susceptible to foodborne illness since their immune systems are still immature.
If you make extra baby cereal, only put a few tablespoons into a bowl. Do not feed your child from the larger serving. Saliva can contaminate the cereal if you were to store it the refrigerator.
Throw out any extra cereal your child didn't consume from their pre-portioned serving. In addition, only keep baby cereal for 24 hrs.

, All children tolerate foods at different stages and at different times. As you and your child get the hang of eating solids, you'll notice your child becomes much better at eating.


Children are great at knowing when they are hungry, when they're not and when they want more food. Make sure to follow your child's hunger and satisfaction cues.
A baby may turn away his head or not open his lips if he doesn't want any solids or doesn't want anymore of the cereal.Do not try to force feed a child who doesn't want cereal. Even if your child only eats a bite or two, that's OK. There will be other opportunities to try solid foods.

Try peanut butter and crackers for a protein-carb combo.,
Serve Greek yogurt for a healthy sweet snack.,
Give your child unsalted nuts before bed.,
Try offering a glass of warm milk.,
Try to fill gaps in what your child ate that day.,
Offer snacks that your child can learn to prepare.",How to Give Your Kids a Healthy Bedtime Snack1," A combination of protein and complex carbs at bedtime, like whole grain crackers with nut butter, will help prevent blood sugar spikes. Sweet snacks cause blood sugar levels to rise and fall, which could cause your child to wake up hungry a couple hours after bedtime.Other protein-carb combo snacks include hummus and crackers, peanut butter toast, and cheese and fruit slices.;
, Greek yogurt could be a great option if your child has a sweet tooth. Instead of serving a sweet snack like ice cream or cookies, you can satisfy their craving with Greek yogurt.Greek yogurt with fruit or veggie slices also fits into the protein-carb category.

, Peanuts, cashews, pistachios, and other nuts contain protein and fiber, which both help promote a full night's sleep. Go for unsalted nuts to avoid adding too much sodium to your child's diet.Cashews contain lots of magnesium, which makes them an even more appealing bedtime snack. Magnesium deficiency is linked to sleep disorders like restless leg syndrome and muscle cramps., Warm milk before bed isn’t just an old fashioned myth. Milk contains melatonin, which is a neurochemical that helps regulate the sleep cycle. Your child might also find warm milk soothing, so it could help them relax before at bedtime.Make sure they brush their teeth before going to sleep, even if they’ve just had a glass of milk. Going to sleep after drinking anything except water can result in tooth decay.

, Think about what your child ate or didn’t eat that day. Use the bedtime snack to fill any nutritional gaps.For example, if they skipped their serving of fruit at lunch, offer them a banana or apple slices at bedtime.

, Teaching your child early how to snack in a healthy way can set the foundation for life-long eating habits. As they enter into their school-age and preteen years, they’ll learn how to make quick and easy healthy snacks for themselves.Greek yogurt with sliced cucumber, cheese with crackers, sliced fruit or veggies, and toast with fruit and peanut butter are all great snacks to teach your growing child how to make."
"
Give your child a bedtime snack to promote a full night’s sleep.,
Offer a snack an hour before bedtime.,
Try to keep a consistent bedtime routine.",How to Give Your Kids a Healthy Bedtime Snack2," Toddlers and young children have high nutritional needs, but their stomachs are still growing. Along with three meals, two to three snacks during the day will make sure they get the nutrients they need. Going to bed hungry can make it more difficult for anyone to fall asleep, especially a growing child.An overnight dip in blood sugar can interfere with a full night’s sleep, causing your young one to wake up in the middle of the night., Offering a snack an hour before bedtime will allow for quiet time before bed. During that time, you can make sure your child completes their hygiene and bath routines.When you offer a snack, ask your child if they’re they’re hungry first, so they don’t just eat for the sake of it.After snacking, make sure your child brushes their teeth and goes to the bathroom. Then, they can do relaxing activities until it’s time to go to sleep, like listening to soothing music and reading a book (or you can read them a story)., Do your best to put your child to bed and complete their bedtime routine at the same time every day. A consistent sleep schedule, even on the weekends, is best for both children and adults.Making sure your child snacks at scheduled times, including before bed, will help prevent overgrazing in the future."
"
Keep the snack size small.,
Keep the sugar content low.,
Don’t let caffeine sneak up on you.,
Be aware of the feigning hunger phase.",How to Give Your Kids a Healthy Bedtime Snack3," Remember that the bedtime snack is not a full meal. Limit portion size to a small piece of fruit, a few crackers with peanut butter or cheese, or a small bowl of low-sugar, whole grain cereal with milk.Avoid feeding your child a full meal within two hours of bedtime.

, Sugar can cause spikes in blood sugar that interfere with sleep. Further, a sugary snack before bed can encourage your child to eat less at dinner.If they’re expecting a sweet snack in a couple hours, they might turn down their portion of steamed veggies at dinner.

, Avoid giving your child obvious sources of caffeine, such as coffee and colas. You should also steer clear of less obvious sources, such as hot or iced tea and chocolate.Caffeine has a long half-life, so if your child does consume any tea or chocolate, make sure it’s at least six hours before bedtime.

, Some kids go through a feigning hunger phase, which is when they say they’re hungry as a way to stay up later. If they constantly ask for one thing after another or seem to be stalling, they probably just want to stay up as late as possible.Plan on offering a snack an hour before bedtime to help make sure they stick to their bedtime routine."

Bring a sweater.,
Wear a bra that has no metal in it.,
Wear comfortable bottoms.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Layer it up.,
Leave the belt off.,

A key point to remember when dressing for the airport is convenience is important.,
Avoid lots of jewelry.,
Go simple on the beauty routine.,
Bring a big purse.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Wear socks.,

Wear socks to protect your feet.,
Wear compression socks or leg wear.",How to Dress for the Airport (for Women)," It can get chilly in airports, and it can also get cool on a plane. The temperature may shift and vary. So bring something warm.Even if you’re going to a warm climate, bringing along a zip-up sweatshirt or a simple cardigan sweater is a good idea. Some knits can look pretty stylish. Dark clothing is better because it will hide spills that could happen on the plane.If you’re traveling in winter, you might want to bring a puffy down jacket if you have one because it won’t wrinkle if you need to place it into the overhead bin.
To make your life easier, start removing layered items, such as a sweatshirt before you get to the metal detector. A lightweight jacket could also work.;
, It depends on the bra, of course, but some underwire bras can set off airport metal detectors. That costs you time.


It’s also likely to cause you to have to succumb to a pat-down inspection. Not only are those sometimes embarrassing, but it will delay you.
Instead, try metal-free bras. A simple padded brassiere could work, and sports bras are perfect for airport travel.
If you like your underwire bra, just pack it in your suitcase instead of wearing it to the airport. Underwire bras could also be uncomfortable during a long flight.

, You’ll want to be comfortable at the airport (no stiletto heels!), but that doesn’t mean you can’t still look good. Victoria Beckham has said the airport is her runway.Lots of people end up in the airport in sweatpants or a track suit because they're so comfortable. If that's not for you, try a nice pair of leggings instead. Match them with long sweaters, hoodies, or long tops.
You can dress up a dressed down look by carrying a nice, statement handbag. Celebrities tend to wear sunglasses inside airports a lot and hats too. Go for comfort but with style.
Wearing jeans can be a good choice in an airport. However, wear worn jeans that don’t have too tight of a waistband and are worn in.
Celebrities walk through airports all the time, and they manage to look both comfortable and stylish. Try relaxed trousers with a blazer like actress Cate Blanchett. Try jeans with flats and a simple black blouse like the model Miranda Kerr., Loose sweaters are extremely comfortable, especially if you pair them with jeans or leggings. Loose fitting dresses or pants are also a good choice for flying.


A loose sweater will keep you warm and will feel comfortable, including if you end up sitting in the airport or on the plane for hours.If you want to wear a skirt, go with a long maxi skirt and don't choose anything too tight and short.Wear an oversize pashmina scarf with the sweater (or just with a shirt) and it can almost double as a blanket on the plane. The other benefit of loose clothing is that it can help prevent blood clots. Although synthetic clothing can be flammable, it's also less likely to wrinkle, which can make it a good choice for planes.
A graphic T-shirt is another option if you’re in a warm climate. It’s casual but still trendy, so you will look stylish without sacrificing comfort. Avoid T-shirts with offensive sayings, though. It could cause you trouble in an airport.

, Often when you’re traveling, you will be shifting between different climates or temperatures. Maybe you’re going somewhere warmer or colder. Or maybe the temperature on the plane will shift. Come prepared.


If you layer clothes on your body, you won’t have to pack as much. You can remove one layer (say a sweater) and enjoy the tank top underneath once you land somewhere warmer (or vice versa). You should dress for the colder climate if you’re flying between locales with different temperatures.
Wearing a Pashmina, shawl, scarves, or wrap can be turned into makeshift pillows, allowing you to sleep more easily on the plane, if necessary.Get prepared for the plane to be cold at times even if the climate outside is not. You will also want to wear fabrics that breathe and allow air to pass, such as silk or cotton. You will feel cleaner and fresher for longer.

, If you wear a belt to the airport, it’s going to be a big hassle. Save yourself some time, and leave it in your suitcase or at home.


At security, you will probably be asked to remove your belt if you wear one. That means it will take you longer to get through the metal detector. It also means you might annoy people behind you. Although if your TSA PRE CHECK you maybe able to keep your belt on but it depends on the airport you go to.

, Consider how to make the experience easier.
Make sure to choose pants that will stay up without a belt if you forgot one, though!

, If you’re wearing a ton of jewelry to the airport – or hard to remove pieces, like small earrings with small clasps – it could be a hassle.


At the metal detector, you may have to remove most of it. Body piercings could set it off and significantly delay you.
The other problem with wearing a lot of jewelry is that it could make you a mark for thieves or pick pockets. It’s usually not a good idea to flash your wealth in an airport.
You could keep the jewelry in a pocket within your carry on, and then put it on once you land and leave the destination airport.

, Lots of makeup and elaborate hair probably looks great when you board the plane and not so great after a multiple hour flight. Simpler is better!


Your skin is likely to feel dehydrated after a flight, so do bring a small bottle of moisturizer and tube of chapstick. Pull your hair in a ponytail!
Leave behind big bottles of beauty products. Maybe you like using your own shampoo. Or maybe it’s saline solution, sunscreen, or expensive face lotion you’re bringing along.
You know the rules. You can only get bottles the size of 3 full ounces through security. Follow the rules, and it will go faster.

, It can be really handy in an airport to carry a big purse. For one, you’ll have somewhere to put items you buy, like reading material or gum.


For another, a nice, statement purse can dress up an otherwise low-key outfit, allowing you to look chic in an airport while staying comfortable.
A big purse can almost double as another carry-on bag. Some women like to bring a hair brush and makeup on the plane with them, so they can freshen up right before they land.
A too-small purse can be easier to lose. A larger purse is almost always a better bet when going to an airport. Clothing with pockets can also be useful.

, You’re going to regret it if you try to walk around an airport in heels. It will be even worse if you have to run because you’re late.


Save the heels for the suitcase. Sure, they look good, but you may have to walk for long destinations, and if your plane is late for a connecting flight, you might have to step it up.
A better choice in airport shoes: comfortable flats that easily slip off your feet. That makes them easy to remove at security. Wearing your heaviest shoes, though, can reduce the weight of your luggage and free up more room for backing.
You will also want to avoid boots or sandals with excessive lacing, buckles, zippers or the like, again because they will take forever to take off and put back on at security. Avoid tight shoes because your feet will likely expand over a long flight. If your a girl who is under 13 you can wear boots or sandals as long as they don't have metal because if your under 13 you keeps your shoes on at security. Or if your pre check you can wear boots or sandals because you keep your shoes on.

, You might think those flip flops are comfortable, but they don’t provide much support. Worse, they can be a germ haven.


Think about how many people have walked through the metal detector before you. Do you really want to go through with bare feet? You’ll likely be asked to remove your shoes. Although your under 13 or pre check or maybe if your 75 its most likely your not asked to remove your shoes.

, They will also stay warmer there if the air conditioning makes the airport a bit cold or the plane is chilly inside.
Socks will also help cushion your feet as you walk through the airport. Some airports are quite a trek from one side to the other or even require taking a tram.

, Getting blood cots is a danger of flying when you will be in cramped conditions. There are special garments designed to help prevent this.


Support your pregnancy. If you’re pregnant, check with your doctor before flying. However, some doctors will recommend that you wear special clothing when flying. Some pregnant women wear compression leg wear or socks while flying. These will help stop your legs from swelling because they spur blood circulation.
You can usually get these garments at drug stores or pharmacies or online through travel-supply stores. Wearing loose-fitting clothing can also reduce the possibility of getting blood clots. Avoid super tight clothing, socks, nylons, or even skinny jeans.
Some people with other preexisting medical conditions may want to wear the garments too. The same is true of travelers who fly a lot. They help avoid a condition called deep vein thrombosis

Review possible traveling companions.,
Think of where you are going.,
Does the person you are considering traveling with speak more than one language, do you?,
Has he or she traveled to where you are going?,
Have they traveled much and had good experiences?,
Do they have habits you find annoying?,
If traveling with limited budget, consider a talk about sharing expenses.This can be the biggest of all the considerations!,
Travel is one of the best ways to broaden your horizons.",How to Decide Whether to Go Somewhere Alone," Think of a few factors, such as your relationship with them, if they are of legal age, do they have a chronic illness? Do they know how to handle being in dangerous areas? Obviously traveling can be stressful,exciting,and fun. So deciding whether or not to travel with someone takes some consideration. Even someone who is a friend can become a different person while travelling.;
, Is it dangerous? Foreign? Local? Luxury or economy? Do you share the same tastes? Does he or she need 4 star accommodations while a hostel is what you were thinking. Do you like the same foods? If sampling the local cuisine is your idea of travel will they be looking for the nearest McDonald's?

, Of course this isn't the basis of choosing your companion but if you have a choice of people to travel with it may be a consideration.

, Obviously if they have it can really be helpful if they know what to expect and can guide you along.Do they enjoy the same types of things you do? Even though you are traveling together it is OK to do things separately, for example if they want to go to a museum and you want to go to the beach go ahead you can always meet up again later! Be flexible.

, Some people's travel stories are always negative, is this them? If so you might want to reconsider. Travel doesn't need to be work! Try to match your style with theirs, if they want to start at 6:00AM and go till 9:00pm cramming in as many sights and activities in as they can while you are thinking of leisurely breakfasts and wandering around randomly might cause problems.

, If so, it will only be worse on the road. While traveling little things can be magnified, especially if you plan on sharing accommodations. Do they need the radio or TV on to sleep? Do they smoke and you don't? Do they need AC and you want the heat on? Think of all the aspects of day to day life then apply them to a situation in an unfamiliar place.

, Make sure you both agree on who is paying for what. As stated before if you are planning on staying in a hostel and buying food from the market to cook yourself and they think they are going to a resort it could be a deal breaker. Make sure you know how to access your money; will your ATM card work in your destination? Are you going to carry travelers checks? How do they plan to pay for things? It may be an uncomfortable discussion but it is vital to know these things.

, Some people prefer to do it alone others wouldn't think of it. If you are planning a trip for any length of time with someone you have never traveled with before stop and consider. Maybe a short local trip as a trial would be in order. Spend some time with this person before you go. The most important thing is to be flexible, calmly talk about anything that's bothering you, don't accuse discuss.

, Travel to the location of your choosing may be expensive. Determine the costs of taking a plane, train, coach bus, rental car, or cruise ship to your selected location. Air travel is the quickest option but may be costlier than train, bus, or car rental if the distance isn’t too great. A cruise ship affords the greatest luxury and will often include a number of stops but is also the costliest option.You can compare plane ticket costs with Google Flights, SkyScanner.com, Expedia, FareCompare.com, or Kayak. Always research price comparisons before making your purchase.

If your destination hosts many tourists, there will likely be a wide variety of hotels, motels, resorts, and bed-and-breakfasts.Pick a hotel that is located near the attractions you’re seeking. This will prove convenient and save you in local travel costs.
Consider amenities like televisions in the rooms, internet access, and access to a swimming pool. You should also consider the quality and size of available beds and bathrooms, the availability of air conditioning, and whether or not they serve a complimentary breakfast. If you have any questions that aren’t answered by their website, call the front desk.
Check customer reviews on Google and Yelp. Keep in mind that nearly every hotel has some excellent reviews and some that are terrible. Read as many as possible to get a comprehensive idea of the quality.

Travel insurance can often be purchased from vending machines at airports or online.Allianz, World Nomads, Travel Guard, and InsureMyTrip.com are some websites that offer standalone travel insurance.

Find someone who is flexible.",How to Choose a Travel Partner1," Traveling should be fun. When you are on a trip, you will want to do lots of activities that you are enjoy. Preferably, your companion will want to do the same things as you.Think about your travel priorities. Make a list of all of your ""must dos"".
For example, maybe you are planning a trip to France. If visiting The Louvre is a priority, make sure your travel partner wants to go, too.
Remember that you don't have to do all of the activities together. But when you travel with someone, it is fun to do at least some things with each other.;
, When you travel, there are many types of experiences that you could have. You could be very active or you might be looking for a more sedate trip. Find a travel partner who has an agenda and energy level similar to yours.Think about what type of trip you want to have. Are you looking forward to walking a lot? Do you plan to be doing a lot of physical activities, such as scuba diving?
If you anticipate being active, try to look for a friend who enjoys being active. Maybe your pal from the gym would be a good choice.
Likewise, if you plan to chill, take that into account. If you want to spend your days relaxing on the beach, you don't want a travel partner who will be constantly nagging you to get moving.

, Before you travel, you should plan a budget. Figure out what items are most important to you. For example, do you want to splurge on luxury lodging and save by not doing many excursions? Get a good idea of what things will cost.Before traveling with a friend, make sure that you are on the same page concerning money. You don't want to be planning an expensive getaway at the same time your friend is looking for budget travel.
Try asking specific questions. You can say, ""How much do you think we should spend on a hotel each night?""
You can also plan a budget together. Say, ""Let's sit down and work out how much we want to spend per day.""

, If you are thinking about traveling with a companion, take some time to have an open discussion. You should discuss your goals for the trip. You could also talk about your travel style.Schedule a time to sit down and talk. Try saying, ""I know we've talked hypothetically about traveling through Europe together. Let's have coffee this week and actually talk that through.""
Be upfront. If there is something about you that your friend needs to know, go a head and share that.
For example, you might need to say, ""I'm a nervous flyer. Is there anything I should know about traveling with you?""

, No matter how carefully you plan your trip, it is likely that something will go awry. Maybe it will rain on the day you planned to visit the Grand Canyon. Or you might not be able to get reservations at that French restaurant you've been dying to try.Choose a travel partner who can adjust. You don't want to be stuck with someone who declares the whole trip ruined if you have to adjust plans.
Travel with a friend who is pretty easygoing. Do you have a buddy who is willing to go out for sushi, even if you'd planned on having pizza? That person might be easy to get along with.
Make sure that you're flexible, too. Remember that you're on vacation to relax and have fun. Try to just go with the flow if you have to change your agenda.

Join a travel group.",How to Choose a Travel Partner2," Maybe you're planning a big trip and looking for someone to go with you. It can be frustrating if none of your close friends or family can go with you. Try expanding your network.


Ask your friends if they know anyone who wants to travel with you. For example, maybe your friend has a cousin who has always wanted to take an Alaskan cruise, just like the one you are planning.
Use social media to make connections. Make a post looking for a travel partner, tagging multiple friends. That way, their friends will see your post, too.
Make sure to try to meet your new travel partner in person before your trip. If that's not possible, correspond by e-mail or phone and get to know one another.

, Sometimes you just can't find someone you know to travel with you. That's okay. Traveling alone can be really fun. And there are lots of ways to meet new travel companions along the way.A hostel is a great place to meet new friends. These inexpensive lodgings are very common in Europe.
Staying at a hostel is often a communal experience. Make some reservations to stay at various hostels, and get ready to meet your fellow travelers.
Connect with a new group of people. If you meet some people that you get along with, ask if you can go along with them to the next city.

, If you are young, consider taking a gap year. A gap year is a year between high school and college. People often spend their gap year traveling.Gap year travel is very common among Europeans. It is becoming increasingly popular in the United States.
Search the internet for a study abroad program. Based on your interests, you will be placed with a group of like-minded travelers.
Try using a reputable website such as Go Overseas. They have options for short and long trips, with a variety of locations and objectives.

, Don't worry if you can't find someone you know to travel with you. There are businesses that are professionals at setting you up with the travel experience of your dreams.

Consider your interests.,
Factor in your current needs.,
Take fellow travellers into account.,
Research travel destinations.",How to Choose a Travel Destination1," Write a list of activities that you enjoy. Brainstorm others that you would like to try for the first time. Narrow down your destination options by knowing exactly what you expect to be there waiting for you.Such activities could include:


Physical pastimes, like hiking, swimming, or skiing.
Cultural activities, such as museums, dining, and theater.
Rest and relaxation, such as spa treatments or simply reading a book poolside.;
, Now that you have created a list of things you enjoy in general, take a step back. Examine your life and situation as it stands today. Ask yourself what you would want most out of a trip if you were to go on one this minute. Then go back through your list and cross out those activities that don’t suit your needs at the moment.For example, if you’ve been working 60 hours per week, fixing your house up during your off-hours, and training for a marathon, you might appreciate more laidback activities that will allow you to unwind.
Conversely, if you’re bored stiff by your routine, you may want to climb out of your rut by challenging yourself with more adventurous pursuits.

, If anyone will be travelling with you (such as family or a significant other), have them write their own list(s) of preferred pastimes. Share your lists as a group. Discover which activities everyone hopes to experience so you focus on destinations that will make everybody happy.If there’s an odd duck in the group whose interests don’t match everyone else’s, ask them to prioritize items on their list so at least some of their expectations are met. For example, if their #1 priority is hiking, while everyone else is more interested in museums, shopping, and theater, consider going to a city that also offers a lot of walking tours.
If only you and your significant other are going on this trip, and your lists don’t match, consider letting one person decide on a destination this time around, and then let the other decide your next trip.

, Consult online and print publications to find locations offering the experiences that you are seeking. Use tourism websites, travel blogs, and travel guides to gain an idea of what is out there. Search by location (say, ""Italy"") or interests (like ""Top 10 Destinations for Rock Climbing"").Ask friends, family, or other associates for recommendations and warnings based on their own travels. However, maintain a healthy skepticism when researching. Be on the lookout for:


Sources that are attempting to sell you something.
Out-of-date information

Before you travel, take some time to do your research. Start by reading reviews.
Read traveler reviews of every place you plan to stay. You want to know if other people experienced big problems like the heat not working or the doors not locking.
Use a site like Trip Advisor. They post multiple reviews for every aspect of traveling., You want your vacation to be amazing. That's natural. But make sure to keep your expectations realistic.Try not to get upset if something goes wrong. For example, don't consider the whole trip ruined if one of your adventures gets rained out.
Plan to have a good time. But be ready to laugh it off if something unexpectedly goes awry.
Maybe you're traveling in New York, and the restaurant lost your reservation. That's disappointing, but it's also a great excuse to try a slice of famous NYC pizza.

, Take a true time out when you are on vacation. Try not to be tethered to your phone or laptop. Avoid the urge to check your e-mail multiple times a day.Don't check social media multiple times a day. Try to enjoy your own experiences.
Focus on being in the moment. Look around at your surroundings, and find somewhere new to explore.

Determine your budget.,
Research costs of living.,
Decide how much time you have to travel.,
Consider travel deals.",How to Choose a Travel Destination2," Figure out exactly how much you can afford to spend on travel. At the same time, determine what luxuries you can and can’t do without. With this info, whittle your list of preferred destinations down even further according to cost.Ask yourself if you are willing to stay at a campground or hostel in order to see the sights you want to see, or if you need comfier accommodations.
Make the same call regarding food: is dining out an integral part of your dream vacation, or are you willing to live on peanut butter sandwiches to reduce costs?

, First, come up with a list of items that you expect to purchase while travelling. Then, for each destination you have in mind, research the costs of those items to make sure they don’t exceed your budget. Remember that an American dollar, for example, doesn’t go as far in NYC as it might in Smalltown, USA.Factor in basic items (like, say, grilled cheese sandwiches if that’s what you’ll be living on) as well as items specific to your trip (such as theater tickets).
If you are considering other countries, also factor in the exchange rate between their currency and yours.
Also consider whether each destination has a tourist season, when costs may rise above their off-season norm., Now that you have a firm budget, figure out how long it has to last you. Determine how many days (including travel time) you will spend away from home. Use this number to better decide which activities you want to focus on and how much money you are willing to spend on them.A brief trip (like a week or two) may enable you to spend more on luxuries like fine dining and accommodations. Or, it may make a steady diet of PB&J seem more doable so you can spend your money on things like scuba gear rentals, Broadway tickets, or high-end shopping.A longer trip of a few weeks will allow you to visit multiple places, such as all of Holland instead of just Amsterdam. You may have to sacrifice some luxuries in order to stretch your budget, but with so much time at your disposal, you can also utilize more cost-cutting options, such as indirect flights.

, Look for all-inclusive or partially-inclusive travel deals that charge a flat fee for things like travel fare, accommodations, and food. Sign up for alerts from companies offering discounted travel or lodging. If you plan on traveling regularly, find companies that offer loyalty programs."
"
Think about convenience.,
Consider the season.,
Take special events into account.,
Make sure the destination is safe.",How to Choose a Travel Destination3," Research the realities of day-to-day life in your dream destinations, as well as any hurdles that you will have to overcome in order to get there. Then ask yourself how much hassle you are willing to endure in order to travel. Weigh this against the benefits of travelling there to make sure that your trip will still be a positive experience in the end. Consider things like:Whether you will need to get a passport, visa, and/or vaccinations beforehand (which will also have to be factored into your budget).
How developed their infrastructure is in terms of medical services, public transportation, roads, internet and cellphone service, and availability of ATMs and/or currency exchanges.
How comfortable you’ll feel when visiting a country or region where you don’t speak the local language.
What special needs you or fellow travelers may require based on age, disabilities, or medical conditions.

, In addition to deciding how long you will be travelling, decide when you’ll be going. For each destination, research what weather you should expect during this timeframe. Decide whether these conditions are tolerable to you. Then judge their impact on the activities you hope to pursue while there.For example, if you don’t mind the extra heat, humidity, and afternoon thunderstorms, there is little difference between visiting Puerto Rico in the summer and any other time of the year.
On the other hand, if you’re an outdoorsy type who hates the bitter cold, but who can only currently travel during the winter, you may want to postpone that trip to Maine for another time.
Also consider the weather's impact on your health or those who will be joining you, based on age, medical history, and current health.

, Of course, a special event (like spending New Year’s Eve in Times Square) may be part of a destination’s draw for you.But if not, research each destination’s cultural calendar to see if they will be hosting any big activities during your stay there. If so, gauge whether this will add or detract from your own experience.


Research how large of a crowd will attend based on past numbers. Then find out how this number affects availability for things like accommodations, tickets, restaurant seating, and transportation.
Consider the nature of the event versus the people you will be travelling with. Planning a family vacation to, say, Daytona Beach during spring break may not be the best idea.

, Stay up-to-date about the current environment for each destination. Although it is impossible to foresee every eventuality, be on the lookout for any trends that indicate consistent danger. If traveling abroad, refer to government websites (such as https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html) for alerts and warnings about specific areas. Always consider:Health risks, such as outbreaks of diseases.
Civil unrest, like protests, riots, rebellions, and war.
Spikes and trends in crime.
Environmental concerns, like seasons of high-risk (such as hurricane or wildfire seasons).

Review your final choices.,
Follow your gut.,
Compromise with fellow travelers.",How to Choose a Travel Destination4," If you’ve narrowed your list to a couple of choices instead of one stand-out, compare the two. Apply the same criteria that you used to eliminate other choices. Find out if one seems more sensible, doable, and enjoyable than the other.

, If your final choices still seem equally appealing after a second comparison, forget the checklist. Take a step back, clear your head, and give yourself some time. Wait to see which destination you find yourself dreaming about more. Listen to your heart and go with that.

, If your group is equally torn between two destinations, work toward an agreement. Ask for everyone’s reasons for their preferred choice. Based on these, try to find a solution by considering things like:


The likelihood of being able to travel as a group again in the future so you can visit both.
Whether individuals in the group will have a chance to go to their top pick on their own in the future.
Timely considerations, like the season, special events, and once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.
Whether a previous option that has already been nixed for this or that reason should be reconsidered if everyone can agree to it.

Take further action.",How to Complain After a Bad Vacation," This means that you must make your complaint to the company that is providing the bad service.


Package holiday: make your complaint to the tour operator because your contract is made directly with the operator. The tour operator is responsible for your flights, accommodation and any other extras outlined in the agreement. If an airline goes out of business or is not up to standard, it is the tour operator who is responsible for providing you with an alternative.
Independent traveller: take your complaint to the relevant individual supplier of the service, for example, the hotel or the transport company. You won't have the same benefits or guarantee of arrangements that you would have using a tour operator, so you will need to rely on the insurance policy that covers you to work out what you are covered for when things go wrong.;
, If there is a representative of a resort or other location that is part of your package holiday, make the complaint directly to this person. This may result in the matter being resolved easily and quickly. If you are travelling independently, make the complaint directly to the hotel reception or the flight counter etc. and again, when it is fresh in everyone's mind and immediate in its consequences, you may have the matter resolved quickly.

, If the problem has not been rectified take photos and statements from other holiday makers to back up your complaint. When you return home, check the details of your holiday in the brochure and paperwork; this too can be used as evidence that may demonstrate that you have been misled.

, Address your complaint to the tour operator. Be clear about what was wrong, how you want to be compensated and set a deadline for a response. Back up your complaint in writing by enclosing copies of the evidence. Keep the originals, you may need them at a later date.

, If your complaint is being ignored, or you are being offered less than you believe you deserve, don't give up. Keep up the complaint until you are happy with the settlement. Keep copies of all correspondence in a separate file for reference.

, In many instances, paying for your holiday, or a holiday service, by credit card gives you the extra insurance of being able to claim against your card issuer as well as the service provider if things go wrong. This only applies to organisations operating within the same country as your credit card issuer. For example, if you are from the UK, and have paid your Mediterranean hotel manager directly, you would not be covered. Read the fine print!

, If your complaint has not been dealt with to your satisfaction, contact a consumer organisation for more advice. They would advise on your particular complaint and put you in contact with the relevant travel dispute associations.

Ask the right questions.,
Be certain about what you expect from the hotel.,
Choose the hotel according to its location.,
Be alert to the other things that you must take into consideration.,
Look at the prices with care.,
Look for value for money.,
Get a sense of the hotel through its website and write-ups.,
Check what events might be occurring in the area at the time of your visit.,
Consider whether events held at the hotel itself will disturb your stay.,
Make your booking.",How to Choose a Luxury Hotel," Find the answers to these questions. If you do not like the answers that you get, try a different hotel.


1. Which is the best room in the hotel?
2. What is the finest luxury item in the hotel?
3. Which dish must you not miss when eating at the hotel? Are there reviews of the dish and/or the food?;
, Are you wanting to combine business and pleasure? Are you simply after a great vacation? Or are you only staying there during a business trip? Whatever your need, the hotel needs to be able to meet that specific requirement or you will be better off with a different hotel.


Before you book a hotel, check whether both your “pleasure” and ‘’needs” are met. If you are traveling with your wife and children, or family and friends, reflect upon these two things seriously.
The things that you must look for include: Indoor pools, children’s menu, professional babysitting, in-room refrigerator and other such services.
There are many people who also look for spa, gym and various laundry services too. Are these important to you?
On the other hand, if you are traveling alone or for business purposes, then look out for various features such as: Internet access, convenient shuttles, conference rooms or halls for business meetings and e-booking and fax facilities.

, If you decide to buy a house, then it is important to select and supervise the location. In a similar manner, a hotel’s location is crucial. For instance, if you book hotels in a seaside town, then you will definitely look for seaside hotels, not necessarily one in the center of town. Doing this will let you enjoy a great seaside view, although if you need to get to town, you'll also need to know how to travel there.

, Some of these include:


How far are the tourist sites from the hotel?
How far is the airport or the nearest railway station?
Where the shopping malls are located?

, Avoid being swayed by the belief that highly priced hotels are the more luxurious ones. This isn't always the case. Moreover, budget prices can sometimes come with nasty additional costs attached that you weren't expecting. To get the price right, consider the following:


Check at least three hotels located in the same area. Find ones with little price variation. Simply call the hotels and get quotes. You may find many hotels claiming sky-high prices for their services, while there might be few other hotels that are offering standardized services at a reasonable price.
Take transport into consideration. The hotel might be a bargain but the transport into the city or to the tourist sites might be prohibitive.

,


Does the booking include local taxes, breakfast?
What is the check out time?
What are the facilities? If you have children, a pool or garden would be beneficial.
Are there restaurants or shops such as supermarkets nearby, if you are doing self-catering? Is self-catering supported?
Look carefully at what is included; sometimes you will save a few dollars, other times you will pay extra for many other services, so check the pros and cons.

, By looking at the feedback, you can get a good idea of what other guests thought about their stay at the place. Are there things that concern you most, such as noise, local nightclub patrons spilling onto the hotel street, cramped rooms, bugs, etc.? Feedback will often bring to light such things and allow you to make an informed decision.


The best way to find authentic feedback is the reliable travel websites. These websites have records of almost all the hotels in the corner of the world and can bring forth to you valuable opinion from customers who have stayed in a particular hotel.
Learn to differentiate between the right and the wrong feedback. There are many user reviews which are blatantly positive or overtly negative. For instance, a particular user might have only said positive things about the hotel in question. You might sometimes find it best to disregard really glowing and really negative feedback, in case it was put there by the hotel or its competitors; look for the comments in the middle ground. If you're really unsure, ask the local people or your friends, family and acquaintances about the hotels at the location.

, Perhaps there are discounts, or perhaps the prices skyrocket as a result. If your timing coincides and high prices are unavoidable, it might be worth checking what deals are on offer, to try to save money and enjoy the event as well.

, Are there any concerts, karaoke competitions or poolside parties being held during your stay? If large groups of noisy people will be there, it could impact your stay in a negative way. On the other hand, if you're attending too, it might be perfect to stay at the same place.

, After you have followed the above parts, the next step is to find out more about the best room, the luxury items and the best dish in that particular hotel. If you have completed your research on all this and have taken into account the rates and offerings, you can book with assurance. Then pack your bag and leave on a jet plane for your dream destination. Wishing you a wonderful trip and a luxurious stay in the hotel of your choice!

Use some websites that have distance calculation without a route, as a last-case scenario.",How to Calculate the Distance Between Two Cities," It sometimes tells you the distance between two cities, including distances between two cities in chart-form.


You may have to travel to a bookstore first to buy a road atlas and/or map of your intended destination first.
Look at the paper-map's scale. Normally, a paper-map's scale, should be your very first option, when the two cities are in the same state. They are very useful, when it comes to judging distances. It takes a while to get to understand how to read one, though. Use a piece of scrap paper and a pen to calculate this distance.
Some paper maps even give a chart that tells the difference between most of the bigger cities on the same map.;
, Several websites and programs give approximate mileage between your cities, and even an intended course of travel.


If the originating destination is not within the same country as the resultant destination, you'll probably want to consult other places.
Some of these places include (but are not limited to): Google Earth, Google Maps, MapQuest, Bing Maps, and Yahoo Travel.

, Type into Bing's search box ""distance between (location 1) and (location 2)"", but make sure to include your state's abbreviation if traveling between two states.


Sometimes this works. Sometimes it doesn't. It used to display within their site's applications this distance. However, now this has been replaced and you have to briefly skim through the listings, to see if anything close matches what you've searched.

, GPS systems use satellites to mark the exact place on the map.


Some cellphones have GPS chips in them, and, although that helps for these people, it many times, wears down the batteries even more than when making what a cellphone is supposed to be used for (making calls), thereby passing off other calls.

, Use your car (or have someone drive you) to the other town. Reset the trip odometer in the initial location and read the final mileage of the trip odometer at the destination.

, They can SOMETIMES tell you other routes to take in finding this information. Some may even find the distance and tell you what it is, within your call.

, As like contacting your travel agent, your flight company may even be able to tell you how far it is between your two points.

, The bill may even list the distance.


It may even appear, before the purchase is actually made, but after the research has been completed in almost it's entirety.

, Some other websites have information that calculate the distance, without an intended route. Although they are harder to find, some are relatively easy to find when looking in the right spot.

Do a final sweep of the room before walking out the door.",How to Check Out of a Hotel," Debit cards left with the front desk during check in are a high risk for fraud. In many cases, money illegally withdrawn from your debit account cannot be returned. Fraudulent transactions made on credit cards, however, can generally be contested for a full refund.If you don’t have a credit card when checking in, see if you can substitute a driver’s license or a similar item for a credit or debit card. Some hotels may only accept credit or debit cards.
If the hotel you’re staying it is insistent about holding a card, ask to see a manager. Ask the manager if you could pay a cash deposit as a substitute for the card. Be sure to get a receipt for the deposit.
Some hotels may allow you to pay for your room with a Paypal account. In this case, you won’t need a credit or debit card. Some hotels may charge additional fees for Paypal payments.;
, Some hotels may charge a fee for checking out early or late.Most hotels provide general check out information to lodgers on pamphlets or signs in your room or at the front desk. Alternatively, look up check out information online.


The check out policy will vary between hotels. For example, you may be able to leave your room key in your room when checking out.
If you can’t find check out info in your room or online, call the front desk. Ask about the check out time and whether there are any penalties for early or late checkout.

, Different hotels will have different policies about penalties, gratuities, and fees. Look online for a complete list of these for the hotel you’re staying at. Ask the front desk about these for additional information or explanation.


To check for gratuity on the sly, ask for an itemized receipt at some point. Any gratuities should be clearly indicated on the receipt. Prevent double tipping by not tipping when gratuity is included.
Some common hotel fees include things like: a minibar restocking fee (on top of the cost of minibar items), a gym fee, holding fees for baggage, and fees for wireless Internet use., If you’re a heavy sleeper, you may want to set a few alarms. Position your alarm away from your bed so you don’t turn it off and go back to sleep. Allow yourself enough time before checking out to pack your belongings and make your way to the front desk.Many hotels offer a free wake-up call service.Call the front desk the night before you check out and ask to be called with a reminder.

, Some hotels may refer to the front desk simply as “Reception” or the “Reception Desk.” This is normally located near the main entrance of the hotel where you checked in for your stay. With your baggage in tow, go to the front desk worker, give them your keys, and settle payment for your stay.


When you arrive at the front desk, say something like, “Hi, I’ve been staying in room 222 and I’d like to check out.”Ask for an itemized receipt for your total bill. Fraud is relatively common at hotels. If your hotel refuses to give you a receipt, this may be a red flag.An itemized receipt is generally required to get reimbursement for expenses on a business trip. Be sure to ask for one when traveling on business.

, More and more, hotels are using online tools to make your stay more convenient. Some hotels may offer an online checkout. To find out if the hotel you’re staying at has an online checkout, look for this information online at the hotel’s website or ask the front desk.


Many online check out services will send a bill to your email address, though you may be able to request that a physical bill be sent to your home., If you’ve decided to pay cash for any of the services you’ve received at the hotel or to resolve penalties, ask for an itemized receipt. Compare this to your total receipt to make sure you weren’t charged twice for the same thing.


If a “clerical error” occurs and the hotel doesn’t have a record of your payment, you may have to pay this fee again if you don't have a receipt., Items that you’ve hung in closets or tucked away in drawers can easily be forgotten. Out of habit, you may have put something in one of these places without thinking. Check all closets and drawers before leaving and pack your personal items in your bag(s)., Toiletries and bathroom accessories, like towels and beauty tools, are often overlooked and left behind. Move towels on the floor to ensure nothing has been knocked on the ground and hidden from view., High up storage areas can hide outside of your normal view. Some items may have been kicked under or behind your bed. Outlets, especially ones hidden behind beds and dressers, may still have chargers plugged in.Guests often absently deposit items on shelves, making them easy to lose amidst hotel knickknacks decorating shelves.

, In many cases, you’ll have to bring your room key(s) to the front desk to check out.Gather your packed possessions near your room’s entrance. Note your room number, if necessary. The front desk worker will usually ask for your room number and keys when checking out.Some hotels may require guests to leave their keys (usually magnetic card keys) behind in the room when checking out.

, When all your things are packed and positioned at the room entrance, anything left behind will be more obvious. Before leaving to check out at the front desk, give the room one more look over.

Draw your pattern onto the foam using a permanent marker.,
Place your marked foam block along the edge of a table, with the first marked line you want to cut overlapping the table's edge by about an inch.,
Lubricate both sides of your electric carving knife's blade with a non-stick cooking spray.,
Continue cutting without pause, for the remainder of the line's length.",How to Use an Electric Knife to Cut Foam," If you plan to wrap the foam with batting for a pillow or other upholstery project, subtract an inch from all sides for each layer of batting you'll use.

Draw the pattern again on the underside of the foam section you'll cut.;
,

Lay a 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) thick plywood strip, which is as long as your tabletop and about 2-feet (.6096-meters) wide, over the foam block. Line it up the plywood's long section with the table's edge that's beneath the foam.
Attach C-clamps to the plywood and the underside of the table on either side of the foam block.
Tighten the clamps to hold the foam in place while you cut it.

, A lubricated blade cuts more easily and overheats less often than a dry blade, which helps you avoid injuries or cutting mistakes from forcing the knife.

Turn on the knife and insert the tip of its blade into one of your pattern lines at a perpendicular angle until the knife has reached the underside of the foam block; do not cut further yet. Switch off the knife.
Check beneath the knife to make sure it emerged on the underside pattern lines you marked.
Turn the knife back on and start cutting; continue to hold your electric knife at a perpendicular angle for the duration of the cut to keep your cuts' edges straight. Allow the knife to glide gently along the foam's insides instead of applying too much pressure. Apply a gentle up-and-down sawing motion when necessary.

, Stopping mid-cut usually creates a jagged or rippled cut in the area where you ended and re-started the cut. Approach square corners slowly, and place a framing square against the corner to help guide your cuts."

Tape the paracord to the handle.,
Wind the cord around the handle.,
Work your way down the entire length of the handle.,
Tie the cord to the empty end.,
Knot the ends together.",How to Wrap Paracord Around a Knife Handle1," Place the paracord along one side of the handle. Tape it to the handle at a point just beneath the blade of the knife.


There should be enough cord to extend down the length of the handle, plus a little extra. For most knives, the total length should be about 1 foot (30.5 cm). Allow this excess cord to hang off past the bottom of the handle.
Do not cut the paracord yet.
Wrap the tape around the handle two or three times. Make sure that it firmly holds the cord in place.;
, Wrap the paracord around the width of the handle in one full rotation.









Work with the cord still attached to the bundle. Do not wrap using the excess cord hanging down from the bottom of handle.
The cord should form a tight loop over the handle, fitting over the handle's width. This loop should end when it crosses over the taped starting point.

, Continue wrapping the paracord around the width of the handle until you reach the opposite end.









Each consecutive loop should be directly next to the loop before it on the handle. Keep the wrapping very tight as you go along.
Wrap the attached side of the paracord over the loose, cut end, covering that cut end and securing it to the handle.

, Slip both ends of the paracord through the lanyard hole at the bottom of the handle. Tie them into a firm knot to secure the wrapping.









If the hole is not large enough, you could wrap both ends of the paracord around the back notch of the knife. Tie the knot behind this notch.
The knot must be very tight so that the paracord wrapping cannot unravel.

, Cut the attached side of the paracord so that the tail is roughly the same length as the excess loose end still hanging off the bottom of the handle. Tie both of these ends together into a firm knot.









The resulting loop should serve as a wrist loop, so you'll need to make sure that you cut off enough to paracord to form a loop capable of fitting over your wrist.
The process is complete once you finish this step.

Thread the ends through the eyelet.,
Tie a final knot.",How to Wrap Paracord Around a Knife Handle2," Cut a long piece of paracord and lay it on your working surface. Place the top of the handle over the center of the cut paracord.


You need a piece of paracord that is at least at least four to five times longer than the length of the handle. Any excess cord can be trimmed at the end of the process, so it's better to start with too much than too little.

, Grab the left end of the paracord and cross it over the top of the handle. Slip it under the right end of the cord, drawing it through from the bottom and out from the top.









The two ends should form a loop over the width of the handle. The intersection of this loop should be at the right side of the handle.

, Take the other end (the one you haven't worked with yet) and slide it into the loop from the back. Draw it back through to the left side of the handle.









From the back side of the loop (lying beneath the handle), you will need to slip this end into the bottom of the loop and out through the top. This step will tie the loop in place.
Pull the paracord tight with both ends to tighten the loop in place around the handle.
At the end of this step, the right and left ends of the paracord will have changed places. The end that was previously the left end is now the right end and vice versa.

, Grab the right end of the paracord and cross it over the top of the handle, beneath your previously formed loop. Slip the right end under the left, drawing it through from the bottom and out from the top.









As before, this should create a loose loop. The point of intersection should lie at the left side of the handle this time.

, Take the left end of the cord and pass it underneath the handle of the knife.









Since both ends are on the left at the start of this step, the ""left end"" refers to the end previously positioned on the left side before you created this current loop.

, Take the end you worked with in the previous step and pass it through the loop around the handle from the right side.









You'll need to insert the end through the loop from bottom to top.
Pull the cord tight to secure the loop in place.
At the end of this step, the two ends will have reversed sides again.

, Repeat the steps used to create the last loop, working with the cord on the left instead of the cord on the right.









Cross the left end over the front of the sheath. Pass it under the right end to create a loop.
Pass the right end behind the handle to the left side, then insert it through the loop at the left side, working from back to front.
Pull both ends to secure the new loop in place.

, Continue making crisscross loops over the knife, keeping them as snug and close together as possible, until you reach the bottom of the handle.









Use the same steps followed to create the previous two loops. Alternate back and forth between the right and left ends.

, Slip both ends through the eyelet at the bottom of the knife.









You thread the ends through the eyelet from the same side, or you can thread them into the eyelet from opposite sides. If you do the latter, knot the ends around the side of the eyelet to help secure the cord.

, Tie the ends of both sides into a tight knot. The resulting loop can be used as a wrist loop.









The completion of this step completes the project.

Examine the plunge router.,
Notice the plunge router motors come in a variety of sizes ranging from 1� horsepower to 31/2 horsepower.,
Research and buy what you can afford.,

Set the plunge router base onto the surface.,
Make the cut with the router moving from left to right.

,
Release the downward pressure on handles and the bit will retract.

",How to Use a Plunge Router," You will note that it contains an electric motor mounted between two posts. The motor rests on top of springs and is attached to a flat base that guides the motor down at a 90 degree angle.


The motor rises back into position when downward pressure is released, raising the router bit above the base.
Attached to a collet, the motor connects much like a hand drill chuck. It comes in 2 sizes, � inch and 1/2 inch (as well as 8 mm and 12 mm in metric sizes). This is where the router bit does the cutting.;
, The bigger the motor, and consequently the collet, the bigger the router bit. As a result, the cut is deeper.

, Remember, a higher price does not necessarily mean a better tool.

, These are often shop made or bought as add-on accessories.


The most common jig will be used for cutting dadoes. Dadoes are used in joining two pieces of wood at 90 degrees, such as adding a kitchen cabinet shelf to a side piece. This type of joint uses a straight cut router bit for dadoes.
Clamp the guide into place so that, when the router bit is plunged downward, the bit will line up with the dado joint you want to cut.

,, Pull the trigger and push downward while holding the router with both hands. This act will engage the bit with the wood.

,, The router will retract into the base.

,


Install the desired router bit in the collet. Most profile-edge bits, like a round over or Roman Ogee bit, will have a sleeve bearing that will guide the bit along the edge of the work piece.
Set the depth gauge for the amount of bit you want to use.

, Firmly press downward, holding the handles while pulling the trigger.

Drill the screws into place.,
Conceal the pocket holes with wood plugs or adhesive.",How to Use a Kreg Jig," Before you begin drilling, it’s important to measure the width of the boards you’ll be working with. The thickness is what you’re looking to gauge here. Knowing the exact thickness of the board will enable you to drill the pocket holes at just the right angle.Always measure your wood, regardless of the specifications given on the label. It’s possible for wood to shrink or for a board’s width to be based on averages rather than precise measurements.
The difference of a fraction of an inch could potentially throw off your whole project.;
, Line the pocket hole drill bit up with the specifications indicated on the base of the jig. The step (the place on the bit where it narrows to a point) should be even with the notch that corresponds to the thickness of your board. Slide the depth collar to the appropriate height and tighten it using an Allen wrench.The depth collar is slightly wider than the guide holes of the jig, and will keep you from drilling too far into the wood.
A special pocket hole drill bit should be included with your new Kreg Jig.

, Using the same measurements, adjust the height of the jig to the appropriate position. To do this, loosen the thumbscrew on the back so that you can raise or lower guide hole piece freely. Once the jig is where you want it, tighten the thumbscrew to secure it.Raising and lowering the jig will change the angle of the guide holes slightly to make them suitable for boards of varying widths.
Remember to reset the guide hole piece every time you drill a board of a different size.

, Clamp the jig down so that it will remain firmly in place. This will prevent the wood from coming loose while you’re drilling. Make sure the guide holes of the jig are facing toward you on the workbench.You’ll be drilling into the back side of the board, which won’t be visible once the piece is completed., Place one end of the wooden board vertically against the clamp backing on the opposite side of the jig, then pull the lever to press the clamp tight against it. Test the board to make sure that it doesn’t slide around.The clamp lever should lock into position once the clamp is fully extended.

, The guide holes should be just large enough to comfortably accommodate the drill bit. Most standard Kreg Jig models will have at least three guide holes so that you can drill as many holes as needed to support the joint.For greater precision and security, keep your pocket holes spaced at even distances.
Should you need more pocket holes than your jig allows, you can make room for more by shifting the wood down in the clamp after drilling your first set.

, Begin drilling into the guide holes using steady pressure until you’re stopped by the depth collar. Pull back on the drill as you work to free the guide holes of loose wood chips. Drill as many holes as you need to create a strong joint that will suit the purposes of your project, then turn the board around and repeat the process on the other end.Try drilling on a scrap piece of wood first to confirm that the settings on the jig are correct.
You’ll need to drill at least two pocket holes—otherwise, the boards will pivot around the single screw.The jig will allow you to drill at a shallow angle into the wood, which results in a more structurally sound joint than if you were to drill straight through.

, Now that you’ve drilled the boards, arrange them the way they’ll go in the finished project. Make sure the edges are evenly aligned. If you prefer, you can clamp the boards in place to make them easier to manage.Line up the boards carefully to avoid making a costly mistake.
If you’re using a smaller clamp, clamp both pieces of wood to the table at the seam., Spread a thin layer of wood glue onto the edges of the boards where they connect. This will reinforce the joint even further and prevent the boards from coming apart as you fasten them.Give the glue a few minutes to set up to make the joint more sturdy while drilling.
If you're using wood glue in addition to a conventional clamp, apply the glue before you align the edges of the boards.

, Fit the screws into the pocket holes so that they’re aimed at the body of the adjoining board. Drive the screws deep until they disappear inside the pocket hole. The pocket hole bit conveniently bores its own thread as it drills, so you should have no problem getting the screws to hold.For softer woods, use screws with a coarse thread. Finer threads should be reserved for hard, dense varieties of wood like maple and oak.
Select the right type of screw for the exact specifications and type of wood you’re using., Once you’re done, you may notice shallow depressions left behind at the openings of the pocket holes. These can easily be filled with a glob of putty or wood glue. You could also invest in a set of Kreg wood plugs, which are specially tapered to slide right in for a smooth, seamless finish.Plugging the pocket holes is merely a cosmetic choice, and won’t affect the strength of the joint in any way.
Since you’ll be drilling into the back or underside of the boards, the pocket holes on the finished piece shouldn’t be visible even if you haven’t taken steps to conceal them."

Note that you should tape the loop to the flat side of the handle, not the narrow edge. The dimensions of the loop should also correspond to the flat side.
The intersection of the loop should be at the top of the handle, just below the bottom of the blade. The curve of the loop should be at the bottom of the handle.
The length of paracord should be roughly four to five times longer than the length of the handle. The loop should be centered in the middle of the cord.

, Wrap the left end of the paracord around the width of the handle. Slide it underneath the opposite side of the original loop to secure it.









The left end of the cord should wrap all the way around the handle. When it reaches the point of intersection of your original loop, slide the end beneath the intersection and underneath the the cord below it. This will be the cord on your left, but it is also the section of the loop closest to the right end.
When finished, the left end of the cord will still be on the lefthand side of the handle.
Wrap the cord tightly as you work.

, Wrap the right end of the cord around the width of the handle. Insert it into the space between all three sections of cord at the front of the handle.









The three sections of cord at the center front are the two portions just beneath the intersection of the original loop and the left end you wrapped around the handle in the previous step.
Slip the right end over the left intersection portion, under the left cord, and under the right intersection portion.
Tug on the cord tightly to secure the the wrap in place.
When you finish this step, the right end will still be on the right side of the handle.

, The rest of the handle should be wrapped by following the same two wrapping steps; these two steps consist of a set. After completing each set, rotate the knife 180 degrees.









Essentially, every other set will be performed upside-down.
Each set should be performed by wrapping the left end first, followed by the right end.
Continue until you reach the bottom of the handle.

, Once you reach the very bottom of the knife, you should weave the two final ends back into several layers of wrapped paracord at the bottom of the handle.









As long as you wrapped the cord tightly around the handle as you worked, weaving the ends in should provide enough security to hold the wrapping in place.

, For added security, bring the two ends around to the back of the knife handle and tie them into a tight knot. Trim any excess as desired.









If you want to make a handle loop, simply knot the ends together near their tips instead of tying them near the handle.
The completion of this step completes the process.

Obtain a mallet/hammer and a set of chisels.,
Select a suitable chisel for the kind of project you intend to take on.There are many types of chisels available for different applications.,
Sharpen and inspect the beveled edges before and after each use.,
Clamp down or secure the wood piece to the vice on the workbench.,
Hold the chisel with both hands.,
Carve with the chisel at a 16-20 degree angle with the bevel side facing up and the flat side against the wood surface.,
Hold the hammer with your dominant hand and direct the chisel with other hand.

,
Put the chisel onto the wood.,
Adjust the angle of the chisel according to how much material you want to remove.

,
Hit the end of the chisel with the hammer.,
Lever the chisel up to remove the chipped wood.,
Inspect your chisels, sharpen and apply some oil to coat and avoid rust.

",How to Use a Woodworking Chisel," Hardware stores should have whole sets of chisels and various hammers in stock.


Even a cheap set of chisels can last you a lifetime if used properly.
The hammer/mallet must be made of a soft material such as wood, rubber, or plastic to dampen and prevent damage to the chisel.;
, They come in a variety of sizes, shapes and tips., Spending a few minutes to hone and repair chirped the edges of your chisel will save you hours wasted if a damaged chisel scratches and makes surface marks that are only visible after you've sanded and applied a finishing coat., It is best to work on a firm surface that can handle enough weight and sturdy enough when you use force.

Avoid damaging or making dent marks when clamping the wood.
Do not tighten the vice too hard.
Use plastic or another piece of wood between the clamps and the work-piece to spread the pressure area to avoid leaving marks on the wood.







, You use one hand to press the edge down and direct it with control, The other hand follows with the pushing force.

A properly sharpened chisel needs little force to carve and shave even on hardwood.

,


Carve one small and thin shaving at a time. Forcing and cutting into the wood can damage the chisel or split the wood you're working on.
Hammering the chisel as a last resort, or when removing knots, making tenons and mortise holes.

,, The bevel should be pointing up.

,, Start off gently, hit harder when necessary.

,


There will be a lot of excess material cut out unless you break the wood's fibers where you want the hole/mortise to be. This is done by using a saw or by making vertical cuts with the chisel along a line.

Make sure the nozzle is free of old glue residue.,
Load a glue stick into the back of the gun.,
Plug the glue gun’s cord into an electrical outlet.,
Wait for the glue to heat up.,
Lightly squeeze the trigger to release the melted glue.,
Only use as much glue as you need.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Keep a glue gun handy for basic repairs.,
Try a glue gun for creative crafts.,
Make alterations to clothing.,
Use a glue gun on delicate surfaces.",How to Use a Glue Gun," Go over the owner's manual for information about safely operating your glue gun. Take note of the different components of the glue gun and how they're supposed to function. The instruction manual should be able to tell you whether your glue gun will begin heating up automatically or needs to be turned on and off, how long it typically takes to warm up, and what materials it's recommended for.


Be sure to read through the safety warnings carefully to reduce the risk of accident or injury while using the glue gun.
Your manual should also specify exactly what size or type of glue stick you'll need.;
, Before plugging in or using the glue gun, look over the body to check for cracking, splitting, chipping or any other indications of damage. Make sure you also take a look at the electrical cord to see if there’s any frayed or broken wires. It can be very dangerous to operate a glue under under these conditions.Because of their electrical and heating elements, a malfunctioning glue gun can be extremely hazardous to use.

, There should be a clear path for the melted glue to emerge from the tip of the glue gun. If necessary, remove the nozzle and wipe it down with a piece of aluminum foil to take off dried glue, or use a toothpick to clean out the hole. Your glue gun should always be free of excess residue from past projects before each use.








Always make sure the glue gun is unplugged before handling or removing the nozzle.
Never use water to clean a glue gun. In the worst case scenario, you may simply have to wait until the glue gun warms up enough for the old stuck-on glue to drip off.

, Take a fresh glue stick and place one end into the circular opening in the back of the gun. Slide it in until it stops. If there is already a partially used glue stick in the gun, finish that stick before inserting a new one. Your glue gun does not need to be loaded with a new stick for each project.








Most glue sticks are uniformly sized and made to fit any glue gun model. Check the instructions or specifications of your glue gun when buying replacement glue sticks just to be on the safe side.

, Locate an electric outlet in the wall nearest to where you’ll be working on your project. Stick the glue gun’s electric cord into the socket. The glue gun’s heating element will automatically begin to warm the glue stick inside, so don’t touch the nozzle or leave the glue gun unattended once it has been plugged in. Ensure you’re your glue gun is upright in its stand to avoid accidents.Again, check the electrical cord for any signs of damage or deterioration before plugging it in. An cord in bad condition can present a possible fire risk.
Some glue gun models are cordless, giving you more freedom to choose where and how you work. If you can't find one of these, try using an extension cord to increase your range within your work area.

, Give the glue gun a couple minutes to soften the glue. Once it’s been sufficiently melted, the glue will ooze out when you pull the trigger. For most glue guns, the heating process will take around two minutes. Larger and industrial-grade glue guns may require up to five minutes to heat the glue enough to make it easily dispensable.Some glue guns will have on/off switches, while others won’t. If your model does, it will need to be placed in the “on” position before it will begin heating up the glue. Otherwise, it will start warming as soon as it is plugged in.
Rest the glue gun on the wire support stand at its base when it’s not in use. Never lay an active glue gun on its side., Aim the nozzle of the glue gun downwards and place it close the item you’ll be gluing. Gently squeeze the trigger of the gun until melted glue begins to emerge from the nozzle. Glue directly onto the item’s surface, leaving the nozzle in contact. Apply the glue smoothly in dots, swirls or straight lines.








Place a piece of scrap cardboard or foil beneath the object you’re gluing to catch stray strands of glue.Try gluing a few pieces of throwaway material to get a feel for your glue gun before using it for projects that require precision.
If possible, wear a pair of gloves while working with hot glue to protect your hands from the heat and mess.

, Start with a modest amount of glue and then determine whether you need more. A little glue goes a long way. The melted glue will flow fairly quickly once the trigger is pulled, and it can be easy to use too much if you’re not careful. Avoid saturating the item you’re gluing or applying the glue in messy globs. Glue can set up rather quickly, so only use as much as you need as you go.








Attaching Styrofoam letters to diorama will only take a small dot, for instance, while you might want to add more glue in a zig-zag or spiral pattern to securely hold objects with large surface areas or heavy parts.
Hot glue is meant to be applied somewhat thickly, but using an excessive amount can cause softer surfaces to grow stiff and may be unsightly.

, Remove the nozzle from the item you just finished gluing. If the glue gun model you’re using has an on/off switch, flip it to the “off” position and set it aside. Allow the glue to dry for several minutes. The bond between the glued surfaces will solidify as the glue sets up. It can be helpful to hold your items with your hands or a clamp as the glue sets for a tight bond., Make a home in your toolbox for a glue gun when performing minor indoor repair jobs. Hot glue works especially well on wood and plastic objects in cool, dry conditions. Whether it’s securing a bit of loose panelling or sticking your child’s toys back together, glue guns create a fairly strong, flexible bond that will serve just about any general adhesive task.You should not try to hold moving parts or heavy, precarious objects together using a glue gun. Big jobs should always be carried out by contractors using the proper tools.

, The next time you’re helping your kids with a school project or putting together homemade holiday decorations, reach for the hot glue gun instead of the Elmer’s. It’s better for larger variety of surfaces, goes on cleaner and won’t cause paper to wrinkle and colors to bleed the way some craft glues do. A small dab of hot glue will help your DIY creations hold up longer.It is difficult to remove hot glue once it has set up. Make sure that the measurements, angles and dimensions of your craft project are perfect before gluing it down.

, Hem an ill-fitting pair of pants with a ring of hot glue, or use it to reattach a button that’s popped off. Unlike many types of bonding materials, hot glue is actually quite successful on fabrics. It will work best, however, on parts of clothing like buttons, zippers and other functional features. Though it might not provide the permanency of stitching or tailoring, gluing will do the trick for small alterations if you have no other alternative.Repeated washings will eventually deteriorate glue that is used on clothing, especially in warm water.
Use hot glue to secure patches, rhinestones and other accessories to clothing.

, Because of its thick, gel-like consistency, hot glue works better for sticking thin, easily damaged surfaces together than more liquid adhesives like paste and even superglue. Watery glues can be difficult to apply, require longer to take effect and have a higher chance of damaging sensitive materials than hot glue. Hot glue is also versatile, and will often hold together temperamental objects that don’t take well to other types of adhesives. Just make sure any delicate parts are aligned before application.Apply a small amount of glue when working with delicate materials to keep from ruining it.
Hot glue works on lace, wicker, paper, cotton and even confectionary items like those used to make candy arrangements and gingerbread houses."

, As home wine making is a popular hobby, there are many companies that provide these seals. Look for bottling and home wine making materials providers on the Internet. The seals usually will come with a tear-away band to remove seals already in place., Slide the seal over the neck of the corked wine bottle with the tear-away band on the end of the seal closest to the bottle opening. Slide the seal down far enough that it wraps around the flared edge of the bottle opening, but will not close over the cork., Use the heat gun on a low setting. Move the stream of air over the seal without lingering in any single area. Rotating the bottle as heat is applied will help insure this. Do not let the tip of the heat gun make contact with the seal. Continue until the seal appears snug. Avoid over-shrinking the seal, which could cause the seal to crack."

,
Reset the torque wrench to zero when you are done.",How to Use a Torque Wrench," Purchase one directly from an auto parts store or a supplier. If you purchase a used torque wrench, take it to be recalibrated at an auto parts store.


There are four types of torque wrenches: beam, click adjustable, dial gauge and digital electronic. The main differences between these types are how they are read and how easily they can be adjusted.
If low cost and ease of use is important to you, use a beam style torque wrench.
If accuracy and repeat use is more important, use a click adjustable torque wrench.;
, This will normally be noted in the number of foot-pounds that is recommended. For example, it may indicate if 30 or 100 foot-pounds is recommended for the specific bolt or nut.


If you can’t find this specification in the instructions, look the information up online.
Note the pattern in which the instructions suggest you tighten the fasteners. For example, a star pattern or starting in the middle and alternating between the two sides.

, The torque will not work correctly on damaged threads. It may also cause problems removing the fasteners in the future.


Don’t oil the threads ahead of time. This reduces friction and increases the load on the bolt.

, Then, you can follow up with the torque wrench.








, Hold the handle so that it is centered on the pivot. For accuracy, neither end of the handle should be touching the bar.








, Don’t view it at an angle.








, Tighten the other fasteners in the recommended direction with the same technique.

It is a good idea to vacuum in the workspace to avoid adhesion problems and blowing dust.;
, Use a solvent to remove oil and dirt if the item can’t be washed with mild detergent and water. Dry the surfaces completely.

, Read the package to determine more specific temperature requirements for the adhesive you are using.

, Hand held spray applicators are ideal for small jobs. High volume, low-pressure applicators are ideal for medium to large jobs jobs.


Automatic spray applicators are ideal for the largest jobs. They will require larger air compressors.
Pressurized cylinders and compressors require care during storage and use.

, Adhesives can contain strong chemicals.

, Turn on the adhesive and apply it one coat at a time, until you are comfortable and ready to work on your main project., Both surfaces need to be facing up to apply the adhesive.

, Spray a uniform layer and then let it dry for 30 minutes. These surfaces require two coats of adhesive to adhere completely.

, Allow it to dry for 10 to 30 minutes, or the amount indicated on package directions. It must dry slightly to evaporate some of the liquid before it is ready to adhere.


Some adhesives require you to wait four to 24 hours before bonding. Bonding is the act of connecting the two adhesive surfaces together and smoothing the air bubbles out., Use several parallel spacers. Place your other surface on top of these spacers and position it exactly.

, Set the top surface carefully on the bottom surface.

, Start in the center and work out toward the edges.

, Try a pinch or nip roll for best results., If you’ve done a thorough job of applying pressure, you can trim the edges almost immediately with power tools or machinery.

Grasp the tension rod.,
Pull downward.,
Compress both ends toward the center, if necessary.,
Pull downward again.,
Remove the rod and any remaining curtain.",How to Use a Tension Rod," A tension rod needs to be placed in between two hard, flat surfaces that face opposite one another. In most cases, the two opposing surfaces will be two walls.Examples of two opposing wall spaces include the interior frame of a window, opposing walls of a shower, opposing walls beneath a sink, and opposing walls of a closet.
Measure this space between these two surfaces before selecting and adjusting a tension rod. Use a measuring stick or measuring tape to do so.
Check the label on the tension rod package. The product should list a length range somewhere on the package, and the distance you just measured must fall within that size range if that tension rod will work with your space.;
, Examine the tension rod and look for the point at which the two separate sections fit together.


These two sections are two separate shafts. They lock together, and a strong spring hidden inside of the interlocking area is what allows the tension rod to be adjusted to different lengths.
To adjust the length of the tension rod, you will need to manipulate these two separate shafts.

, Place one hand to the left of the point of intersection and the other hand to the right of that same point.


Your hands must be positioned near the point of intersection. Adjusting the tension rod will become more difficult if you move your hands too far down either shaft.

, Twist the smaller shaft counterclockwise to lengthen the tension rod.If you need to shorten the tension rod, twist the smaller shaft in a clockwise rotation.
Use your other hand to keep the larger shaft stable while you rotate the smaller one. Alternatively, you can speed the lengthening or shortening process along by simultaneously twisting the larger shaft in the opposite direction of the smaller shaft.
Adjust the tension rod until it matches the same approximate length as the measured space you plan to put it in. It may even help to measure the length of the tension rod with a measuring stick or measuring tape as you adjust it.
You can make additional adjustments when the tension rod is actually in its proper position, but it will be easier to work with if the rod has been adjusted to the approximate point it needs to be at before you try placing it.

, If you plan to hang a curtain with an upper hem, the easiest way to do so is by sliding the adjusted tension rod through the upper hem before placing the rod in its final position.


You will need access to at least one end of the tension rod to fit this style of curtain on it, and you won't have access to either end once the rod is in place.
The entire curtain needs be on the tension rod, but it should not cover the entire rod yet. Keep it to one side or shaft of the rod, but do not allow it to hang off either end of the tension rod.
Do not hang the curtain on the tension rod if you plan to hang the curtain with curtain hooks, though. Placing the curtain on unnecessarily early could make it more difficult to manipulate the tension rod as you're installing it.

, Line the tension rod up so that it is perpendicular to the two opposing walls you plan to fit it between. Use your hands to push the tension rod in between these two surfaces.


One end of the tension rod should press flat against one wall and the other end of the rod should press flat against the opposite wall.
You should be able to squeeze the tension rod in place between the two surfaces using only your hands.
Try pressing both ends in at the same time. If that does not work, try pushing one end partially in place first, then wiggling and maneuvering the second end in.
If you cannot fit both ends of the tension rod into the space it needs to occupy, shorten it a little by rotating the smaller shaft in a clockwise motion as before. After shortening the tension rod, try to put it in place again.

, If the rod seems to slip out of place, it is not currently maintaining the right amount of tension. You will need to create more tension by lengthening the rod.


Hold the rod in its final position as you lengthen it.
Twist the smaller shaft counterclockwise to lengthen the rod. Continue lengthening it until the entire rod fits snugly between the two opposing surfaces.
When finished, the rod should be snug and should span straight across the distance between the surfaces. If the tension rod extends between the two surfaces at a diagonal, you will need to take it down and readjust it.
Also note that a tension rod actually loses pressure as you lengthen it because the interior spring becomes less compressed. As such, a tension rod that is unable to maintain enough tension when lengthened to its maximum span and the correct length for the space is actually too short for that space. You will need to use another tension rod that is slightly larger.

, If you wish to hang a curtain with conventional curtain hooks, attach the curtain hooks to the curtain, then slip the hooks over the side of the tension rod.


No matter which type of curtain you're using, take this time to straighten it out so that the curtain spans the entire length of the tension rod.
If the tension rod starts to slip or fall with the curtain on it, the rod might not have enough tension to support the weight of the material. This means that you will need to use a longer tension rod.
Once you complete this step, the installation process is complete.

, If you currently have a curtain or similar drapery hanging on the tension rod you wish to remove, you will need to move the curtain to provide better access to the curtain rod.


If the curtain has been hung with standard curtain hooks or rings, snap the rings apart to open them and remove the curtain from each one. Set the curtain aside, then slip the rings off the side of the rod. Set the rings aside, too.
If the tension rod has been slipped through the upper hem of the curtain and no rings have been used, you won't be able to completely remove the curtain until after the tension rod has been removed. For now, simply slide the curtain as far to one side as possible to get it out of the way as you manipulate the tension rod.

, Grab the tension rod near one of its end caps.


Ideally, you should grab the tension rod with your dominant hand. Use your non-dominant hand for support.

If you're standing on a stepladder, rest your non-dominant hand on the wall to prevent yourself from losing your balance and falling as you tug on the tension rod.
If you're not standing on a stepladder, lightly place your non-dominant hand on the center of the tension rod to steady it as you tug. Do not apply pressure to the center of the tension rod, though.



, Use your dominant hand to tug straight down on the end of the tension rod.If the tension rod is loose enough, this alone might be enough to free the tension rod from its place and cause it to slide off the wall. In this case, you should be able to lift it straight out and away from the space without taking any additional steps.
If the tension rod is not loose enough to come free, you will need to continue with the remaining steps.

, When the tension rod is too tight to pull off with an initial tug, you will need to compress both ends toward the center of the rod and try again.


If the tension rod is fairly small and light, you might be able to do this yourself. Place your hands on either side of the center of the tension rod, placing each hand roughly halfway between the center and one end. Squeeze the tension rod and move both ends in toward the center to compress it.
If the tension rod is too large, too heavy, or too tight, you might need the assistance of another person. Instruct the other person to compress the rod as described and to keep it compressed while you move onto the next step.

, Pull straight down on one end of the tension rod while keeping the entire tension rod compressed toward its center.


This should be enough to pop the tension rod out of its place in between the two opposing surfaces.

, Once the tension rod has been popped out of place, simply pull it straight out, toward you.


If the rod had been inserted through the upper hem of a curtain, slide the curtain off the tension rod at this time.
Once you complete this step, the tension rod has been removed from the space it occupied.

Remove as much of the caulk as you can before it dries.,
Rub your hands with a plastic bag.,
Rinse with water.,
Dry your hands and repeat if needed.,
Act fast!,
Try using a home remedy if dry caulk remains.",How to Remove Silicone Caulk from Hands1," Silicone caulk can be seriously sticky stuff, so the more you can get off of your hands initially, the easier it will be to get your hands completely clean in the long run. As soon as you notice caulk on your hands, take a tissue or paper towel and immediately wipe it away. Discard the tissue or paper towel immediately afterward to avoid accidentally spreading the caulk.


Don't use a fabric towel (especially one that you care about). Once silicone dries, it's very difficult to get out. In addition, it's basically waterproof, so even if it doesn't ruin your towel's appearance, it may make it less useful as a towel.;
, Once you wipe the excess caulk off of your hands, grab a cheap plastic bag (like the kind you get at the grocery store). Rub your hands with the bag, using it the same way you'd use a washcloth. If the silicone hasn't already dried, it should cling to the bag more readily than it clings to your hands, removing much of the remaining caulk. Though this trick is a little unconventional, it's cited by certain home improvement resources as being effective.If you don't have a grocery bag handy, most cheap plastic bags (like, for instance, trash can liners) should work well.

, If the caulk on your hands hasn't had a chance to dry, you should be able to remove much of it with a paper towel or plastic bag. To get the last of it, rinse with water. As you rinse, periodically scrub your hands with a sponge, paper towel, or mild abrasive. As noted above, you'll probably want to avoid using ""nice"" towels to remove caulk.


You may use soap if you wish. However, it's unclear whether doing this has any significant effect.

, Next, dry your hands off with a rag or paper towel. Examine them carefully, checking for any remaining caulk. Be thorough — even a small amount can be annoying once it dries. If you see any silicone remaining, you will probably want to repeat the steps above as needed until it's been removed or it's become obvious that it won't leave your hands.

, When used for its intended purpose, silicone caulk can take some time to dry completely — roughly 24 hours for a standard ""bead"". However, when it's spread thin or in tiny drops on your hands, it can dry much faster. Because of this, time is of the essence when you're trying to get silicone caulk off of your hands. The quicker you start removing wet caulk from your hands, the less effort you'll have to spend trying to remove dry caulk, which is much harder to clean off.


Because a big part of keeping your hands clean when caulking is to be able to clean them right away, it can be very helpful to keep cleaning supplies with you as you do your caulking. Keeping a clean plastic bag and a few paper towels near you while you work can make the difference between completely clean hands at the end of your project and the lingering inconvenience of hands caked with dry silicone.

, If you've tried the tips above and haven't been able to get the caulk off of your hands, there's a good chance that it's had time to dry. Unfortunately, because dry caulk is a strong adhesive and is basically waterproof, paper towels, plastic bags, and water won't be much help removing it. In this case, you may want to try one of the many home remedies recommended for removing dried caulk from your hands in the section below. Though these methods aren't definitively proven, many online sources recommend them.

Mix one or two sheets of toilet paper with Elmer's Glue, e.g.",How to Repair a Loose Wood Screw Hole for a Hinge11," using a small cup and a screwdriver. The paper disintegrates easily, and the mixture can resemble modeling clay with the right amount of glue. Stuff the mixture into the hole, e.g. with a nail head, before it sets and make a pilot hole with the nail. Before the unused mixture has hardened completely, drive the screw partially into the pilot hole, then remove the screw and allow the material to harden further for an hour or two. The dried material is firmly bonded and holds screws as well as the original wood. This procedure also works well for filling holes in wallboard.

Just use a 2 inch long, self-drilling screw with a power drill.",How to Repair a Loose Wood Screw Hole for a Hinge12," Drill the screw at an angle, I.E. slightly up or slightly down. I have been fixing doors this way for twenty-five years and have never broken a jam or had the door come off again. Do not put the screw in at an angle more than 20 degrees or the head of the screw will stick out and prevent the hinge from closing (but you can file the screw down so it will not hit with an attachment that goes on the drill). I usually put the screws in at about a 10 or 15 degree angle so they will not prevent the hinge from closing.









Many times you can use longer a 3 inch, self drilling screw right in the old hole without having to go in at an angle. I have used 2, 3, 4, 5 and even 6 inch screws in old jams. Since I learned this, I have never replaced a jam. I buy the screws in one pound boxes but I use so many 2 inch, self drilling screws to fix doors that I buy them in five pound boxes.
Be sure and replace all three screws where the problem is so that it will really hold well (permanently).
With the self drilling screws and an electric drill, you can fix the door really fast (in minutes).

Try acetone.,
Try (cautiously) using a hair dryer.,
Try an abrasive.,
Try mineral spirits.,
When all else fails, simply wait.,
Don't use harsh solvents.,
Don't scrape or gouge the caulk.",How to Remove Silicone Caulk from Hands2," One of the most common pieces of advice you may find online when trying to remove dried silicone from your hands is to use acetone. Acetone, an organic chemical frequently used in nail polish removers, is able to dissolve some plastics (like, for instance, acrylic nail polish) with ease. Its ability to dissolve or weaken silicone caulk is less definite. However, many online sources attest to its usefulness.To use this method, soak the corner of a paper towel with pure acetone or a nail polish remover containing acetone and gently wet the spots on your hands covered with acetone. Don't pour the acetone all over your hands — this is wasteful and can produce noxious unpleasant fumes. If using nail polish remover, check the ingredient label to be sure it contains acetone before using.

, Silicone, like many other synthetic compounds, will eventually weaken if heated up gradually. Because of this property, some sources recommend using a hair dryer to loosen the caulk's hold on your hands. Turn the dryer on and wave it over the affected areas, allowing the silicone to gradually warm. Once you feel that the silicone has heated up, try scrubbing with a sponge or another mild abrasive to get it off.


If you want to try this method, be sure to start with the lowest possible setting on the hair dryer. Gradually increase the heat as needed and stop immediately if the heat becomes intense or painful. Silicone isn't worth burning yourself over — it will eventually fall off on its own.

, Another way to get silicone off of your hands is simply to rub (and rub, and rub...) until there's none left. However, this method requires a warning. Silicone is quite tough — in fact, for most purposes, it's tougher than your skin. Because of this, you'll want to be very careful as you use your abrasive to remove the silicone to avoid rubbing your skin raw. Use only mild abrasives, not harsh ones like steel wool. Stop rubbing well before you think you might be sore. Remember, the silicone will eventually fall off on its own, so there's no reason to hurt yourself trying to get it off. Just a few appropriate abrasives you might consider using are:


Kitchen sponges
Fine-grit sandpaper (if you're careful)
Pumice stones

, Like acetone, mineral spirits (a turpentine substitute sometimes called ""white spirits"" in the UK) are sometimes prescribed for the task of weakening stubborn silicone caulk. As with acetone, the actual usefulness of mineral spirits is the subject of some doubt, though some home improvement sites recommend them.If you have some mineral spirits handy, try applying some to dried-on silicone lightly with a soaked paper towel. Follow with abrasion once the spirits have had a chance to weaken the silicone. If you don't have mineral spirits, you can usually find some at major hardware stores for fairly cheap (usually not much more than $10 per gallon).


While mineral spirits are usually not dangerous to touch, be sure to thoroughly wash yourself after coming into contact with them. Being in direct contact with mineral spirits for several hours or longer can lead to seriously nasty chemical burns.

, Sometimes, particularly stubborn spots of silicone caulk can stick to your hands despite your repeated efforts to get it off. In these cases, your best option may be simply to wait for it to fall off on its own, rather than wear your hands red trying to get it off. Your body naturally sheds dead skin cells nearly constantly. Once the skin under the dried-on silicone dies, it will eventually fall off, taking the caulk with it.


The human body usually takes about 27 days to completely shed and replenish an entire layer of skin.The silicon gel dried to your hands will probably take less time to fall off (on the order of a week or so).

, When it comes to getting silicone caulk off of your hands, stick to the safe methods described in this article — don't risk trying anything that may hurt you. For instance, while acetone and mineral spirits are generally safe for brief use on your hands, other, harsher chemicals can present serious problems. Many noxious or caustic solvents can be harmful if touched, inhaled, or ingested, so you'll want to stay far away from them. Below are just a few of the sorts of chemicals you definitely won't want to use to get caulk off of your hands:


Bleach
Drain cleaner
Paint thinner
Lye
Strong acids or bases.

, Never use a sharp tool or a harsh abrasive to physically remove silicone caulk from your hands. Though it may be tempting to use a knife or a handful of steel wool to scrape or cut annoying dried-on caulk away from your hands, these methods run a high risk of injuring your hands. On top of this, there's very little guarantee that they work well against the gummy, clingy texture of silicone. Though this advice probably goes without saying for most, in the interests of safety, it bears mentioning.

Grab one that's cheap and you don't care about -- if it breaks, no harm, no foul. A bendy, laminated card works best









Force it between the lock and the frame, flush against the frame. Bend it back, forcing the lock back into the door, opening it.
If there's no room between the lock and the frame, you can force it between the door and the frame above the lock, then swipe quickly downward while angling the card toward the frame. This is where a thicker, sturdier card may come in handy.;
, This method works on doors with ""privacy handles,"" locked by pushing a button in the door handle. If you're locked on the other side, look for a tiny hole on the doorknob. Push an eyeglasses screwdriver, a paper clip hammered flat, or a very small butter knife into this hole. Push it straight through as far as you can, and turn or twist it until it catches a groove and the lock clicks open.







, This can be complicated, so you may wish to read the full instructions. To get started, insert the short end of an Allen wrench into the lower edge of the keyhole. Apply a tiny bit of pressure to turn the lock slightly in the direction the key would turn. Keep this pressure as steady as possible, and use an unbent paperclip with a small crook at the end to pick the lock:








Scrubbing method: push the paperclip in gently at the lower end of the keyhole, then lift it back and upward. Repeat in a circular motion while increase the pressure on the Allen wrench slightly each time, until you feel the lock shift. When this happens, keep the pressure steady as you repeat the motion, until the door unlocks.
Pin by pin method: If you can't succeed with the scrubbing method, keep the pressure on the Allen wrench slight and steady while you gradually push the paperclip in. When the paperclip makes contact with a pin, try to catch it on the bend and lift it upward until it clicks into place. Repeat with additional pins until the lock turns.

, Using a standard-sized flat head screwdriver, wedge it between the bottom knuckle and the pin. Tap the handle of the screwdriver in a downward direction with a hammer. Remove the head and pin when they're loose enough.









Repeat this with all hinges. If the pin won't come out easily, you may have more success forcing it out with a Phillips head screwdriver.

, There's a reason this is the last step -- it should be your last resort. In most cases, you'd probably rather call a locksmith or a non-emergency number for the local fire station. If you need to leave urgently, bash downward repeatedly until the doorknob or lock breaks away from the door.

Determine the size (or ""gauge"") of your saw's chain.,
Clean the chain thoroughly.,
Inspect the chain for damaged or overly worn links and teeth.,
Set your saw on a solid surface or clamp the bar in a vise.,
Locate the leading cutter as your starting point.,
Set your file in the notch on the front of the cutter.,
Hold the file at the same angle that the cutter was ground or filed to begin with.,
Slide the file across the face of the cutter, using a moderate twisting motion to discharge metal chips (filings) that are removed.,
Work every second tooth identically from your beginning point around the loop.,
Reverse sides of the saw and proceed around the unfiled teeth angled in the other direction.,
Check the clearance of the rakers (depth gauge), the curved hook shaped links between the cutters.,
File any raker/depth gauge that interferes with the cutter (in other words, that sits too high) using a flat mill bastard file (not likely to be needed except when dealing with a defective chain).








,
Oil your chain (saturate/soak with oil), check the tension, and you should be ready to cut once again.

",How to Sharpen a Chainsaw," You will need to buy either a rotary grindstone or chainsaw file that matches your chain tooth. Since there are several sizes of chainsaw teeth, the grindstone or file you choose must be the correct diameter for your saw. Typical sizes are 3/16, 5/32 and 7/32 of an inch in diameter.;
, You may use mineral spirits or a commercial degreasing detergent to remove oil, dirt, and debris from your chain. Do not flood or get excessive cleaner on the engine or other components, since some of these products can damage the plastic housing or other parts.

, Individual teeth may become chipped, broken, or bent, making them dangerous to use. As a rule of thumb, the top plate (flat surface at the top of cutting teeth) should be at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in length. If it is worn shorter than this, there is a risk it will break while in motion. Any damaged, weakened, or overly worn chains should be discarded.








, The saw must be stable, and the blade must be firmly supported to permit safe and accurate filing. Clamping the bar in a vise, with the jaws holding the bar and allowing the chain to rotate freely, is your best option.

, This will be the shortest cutter on the chain. If all of the cutters seem to be the same length, you may start anywhere. The main concern is that you file each cutter so that the flat edge on top of each cutter is very nearly the same length. That way each will slice away the same amount of wood as they pass through the kerf of your cut. It also may help to mark the first tooth you file with a dab of paint or a permanent marker so you'll be sure of where you started.








, This is the angled ""tooth"" on the front of the flat surface of the chain link. The curve of the file should exactly fit the curve of the face of the cutting tip, and the top 20% of the file diameter should be above the top of the tooth.

, The angle might be 25 or 30 degrees (check saw specifications). Special ""ripping"" chains may have a flatter angle. In any case, it is essential to match the angle the chain was originally machined to. Some saw teeth have ""witness markers"" as a visual aid.








, There is some difference of opinion as to the best direction for pushing the file, but usually you will push it from the short side of the angle toward the long point. This should leave a smoother cutting surface (an important consideration).








, As you progress through the chain, keep advancing it by hand so that the tooth you are filing is on top of the bar.








, Keep an eye on the length of each flat top of the cutter. Some manufacturers suggest measuring with calipers to ensure an equal ""bite"" as the saw is cutting, but if you have a good eye, you should be close enough to get fairly good results.








, They should clear each cutting edge about one tenth of an inch lower than the cutter. This governs the amount of wood that the cutter removes on each pass. A special tool that is laid on top of the blade is available from chainsaw dealers or hardware stores. If the gauge is too high and must be filed, this tool protects the adjacent tooth as you file the gauge down.

If you are using a friend's key, call and ask him about it. He is likely to know the door's idiosyncrasies.

, There's no universal standard for which way a key turns to unlock a door. Even if you know which way is ""unlock,"" turning the key further toward the ""locked"" direction sometimes causes the lock to unjam. If you can get the key to turn a short distance past the full locked position, rotate it back the other way in a quick, smooth motion and you may overcome the jam.








, Unless you plan on replacing the lock, choose a grease-free lubricant such as graphite powder, since oil will jam the lock even more once it dries out. A single, short spray or squeeze directly into the keyhole should be enough; too much lubricant can be counterproductive.









If you're trapped in a room, use any oil you have available, or rub the key with a graphite pencil tip.

, The problem could be a bent key, or a key with severely damaged teeth. Bending the key back into a flat position will sometimes serve as a temporary fix, if you have a clamp handy. Replace the keys at a hardware store as soon as you can.








, If you hear a click when the key turns, the door is probably unlocked but jammed, and a few thumps might open it. If the lock is jammed, hitting the lock several times might help after lubrication to help shift the sticky tumblers.








, You may have to set aside the key and use the lockpicking methods described in the section below. If that doesn't work, you may need to call and hire a locksmith.

Remove some of the rust with a stiff wire brush.,
Apply penetrating oil to lubricate the hex bolt.,
Attempt to work the rusted bolt out with a hex key.,
Heat the surrounding material with a propane torch.,
Break the hex bolt to remove it.",How to Remove Rusted Allen Bolts," Before attempting to loosen the bolt, remove as much rust as possible. The less rust there is on the bolt, the less likely you are to snap off or strip the head when loosening it. Use a brush with stiff wire bristles to scrub rust from the threads and head of the bolt, the nut, and the surrounding metal.;
, Penetrating oil is one of the best tools available for loosening rusty bolts, though its proper application requires patience. Apply the oil to as much of the bolt as you can access, and then let it sit for a long time. If you have several days to spare, apply the oil a few times daily for a few days. At the very least, try to give the oil a few hours to penetrate the rust. If you don't have penetrating oil, apply another type of lubricant.

, After brushing and lubricating the bolt, use a hex key to try to loosen it. It may help to turn the bolt in both directions to begin with. Using a ratchet-style hex key with a larger handle will also improve your chances of loosening the bolt. If the head of the bolt is large enough, you can try loosening it by twisting the entire head with a wrench.

, If the hex bolt cannot be loosened using the above techniques, you can try applying heat. Heating the nut and the surrounding material can cause it to expand slightly, giving the bolt a little more room to turn. Apply heat using a hand held propane torch, being careful to heat the bolt itself as little as possible. If you are working near plastic or other materials that will melt or burn, be careful to watch for smoke.

, If none of the above methods work for removing the bolt, you can break the bolt off. This is best done with an impact gun, but can be done by hitting the bolt with a hammer or sledgehammer. After breaking the bolt off, you may have to drill the remaining piece out.

Understand what causes kickback.,
Choose where to cut appropriately.,Clamp down the timber if it wants to slide about on the stools.,
Make a bench if you are cutting many pieces up.",How to Handle Kickback in a Circular Saw," Once you know what causes kickback, you are halfway to preventing it. When all is going well, the action of the teeth cutting into the timber (""A"" in the image) helps to keep the saw bed and the timber in close contact. If the timber starts pinching the blade (at ""B""), the opposite happens: The saw wants to climb out of the timber, sometimes with a vicious jerk. The easy answer is to not let the timber bind on the back of the blade.
, In the following sketch you see a length of 150 x 50 on a couple of saw stools. Where would you cut with the circular saw? Point A, B, or C?

You can saw straight through it at point B, holding the main length of timber with your left hand, and letting the off-cut fall to the ground. But, there will probably be a big rough split on the end because you needed another hand to support the off-cut (if you are right handed).



 


If you cut through at point A, holding one piece with your left hand and letting the other drop to the ground, but it'll splinter again. It is fairly safe, but you have another thing to consider. Look at the sketch below.
The two ends on the stools want to stay put, but when you are pushing in the middle, and as soon as the bit of timber remaining to cut becomes small enough, the whole lot wants to bend, and sure enough, bind on the back of the blade.






A better way to do it would be to cut at point C, where, as you are getting almost through the cut, you can support the off-cut with your left hand in such a way that you help the cut to open up.

,, There are several ways to do this.
Use some of the smaller pieces to make a bench. Then with a few lumps of off-cuts under the piece being cut you can cut safely.
Make a bench out of a couple of planks.

Cut on the ground, using packers and one foot on the timber being cut.

Consider whether the flip over saw is what you need.,
Consider the robustness of the saw.,
Understand what flip over saws are like to use everyday.,
Flip the saw into table mode.,
Know how to run long lengths of timber through the blade.,
Be aware of the pros of a flip over saw:


Versatile and adaptable, making it suitable for most jobs
Reliable, tough and capable of working in harsh conditions
Long expected life on site and virtually forever in the home workshop!,
Be aware of the cons of a flip over saw.,
Consider if you're someone who should buy a flip over saw.",How to Decide if a Flip over Type Saw Is the Right Choice for You," Ultimately, you need a rough idea of your type of work to decide if a flip over saw is the right saw for you. For example; if you do mostly sheet panel work you might want a dedicated table saw with a larger bed or if you regularly cut unusually large, complicated cornices then maybe a dedicated larger blade, sliding chop saw is a better proposition. As a general, all purpose saw, flip over saws are going to be very hard to beat and it can be used for almost everything.;
, Professional flip over saws are robust and will cope with daily site work for many many years; cutting tough materials and handling the rough handling, dirt and wet that site work sometimes entails. This means that for workshop, home or hobby use professional flip over saws are just going to be cruising and might easily last for decades! Professional flip over saws are built for tough guys on site and won't fail. Flip over saws don't tend to break down.

, Ergonomically, they work well as their table height and sturdy legs make placing timber on them simple. As with all these saws, you will need side supports to hold longer timber lengths safely while you cut. You will get away with two but three is better (two to the left of you and one to the right to catch the off cut). You could buy dedicated supports but a great tip is to screw or cable tie timber 'packing' onto your existing 'saw horses'. Use the metal folding type with a four by two screwed to them if you want exactly the right height; this one makes handling long lengths a cinch, especially if working alone.


Switchgears are normally robust and reliable with safe no volt type switches, no false starts and a soft start-ups on most. Blade guards automatically move up out of the way on cutting and some have a slotted design so that you can see 'through' the guard down to your line if required. Moving the saw down and through the material should have a steady weight, feel sure and there should be no hint of 'play' anywhere.

, This is usually simple and only takes a few seconds. Pull the saw down and locate the locking mechanism then simply flip the bed over and it locks into place. The riving knife or separator blade can be dropped into place either before flipping or afterwards and is usually just a simple hand tight fastener. The riving knife also has a blade guard which automatically lifts over the wood when ripping making it totally safe.

, This needs care not to bog down the blade, ripping down a long length of 2""× 6"" into 2""× 2""s for example (Sorry, 47mm × 150mm or 47mm × 47mm to be all European!) needs a steady push and accurate feeding. Wood is not the only material either; this saw cuts various plastic sheets, sections and even pipes.

,
Has enough capacity to easily cut all common timber sizes found on the average job, 2""× 4"", 1""× 6"" etc (Sorry, 47mm × 100mm or 25mm × 150mm to be all European!)
Converts in a flash from combination crosscut saw to table saw
Portable and stores well in the truck, esp. in table saw configuration with legs off
Good switch gear, both table and handle mounted
Sturdy and heavy construction with its own legs makes bigger timbers no problem

,


Doesn't have a plunge depth stop, although arguably rarely needed either
Lacks the larger cutting capacity of a dedicated table saw or big combination saw
Can be heavy to lift alone (I guess that the writer is getting old!)
Need to remember to turn a blade stop key when cutting unique angles you will only forget once though!
Dust extraction system is arguably complex and expensive, although efficient
Everyone on site will want to 'borrow' it!

, It would be difficult to list everyone who would find a flip over saw a useful addition to their tool kit but definitely if you are building; renovating; remodeling; restoring; extending; repairing; upgrading; fitting kitchens or bathrooms, framing works, building decks or sheds, woodworking hobbies or simply want some saw bling in the garage, most flip over saws will accurately and reliably cope with your cutting needs and more.

Position the tile saw onto a level, sturdy surface.,
Fill the tile saw's reservoir with water.,
Position the tile onto the cutting table.,
Turn the tile saw on.,
Feed the tile into the blade.,
Remove the tile and turn off the saw.",How to Use a Tile Saw," Just as with any power tool, you want the tile saw to be securely positioned and level. A tile saw is best positioned on a heavy, bulky table or directly on the floor. Attempting to operate a tile saw on a wobbly table can result in inaccurate cuts and even injury.






;
, All tile saws will have a trough of water mounted beneath the cutting surface. In some cases this trough is removable, while in others you may have to fill it manually with a pitcher. Ensure that the water pump is completely submerged.








, Adjust the fence so that when the tile is pushed against it, the blade lines up with the pencil mark indicating the desired cut. It is best to leave the widest part of the tile between the fence and the blade; this will help you keep your hand as far from the blade as possible.









For cutting tiles along the diagonal, position a miter guide or speed square between the tile and the fence. This will keep the tile positioned at a 45 degree angle to the blade.
For making partial cuts, for instance when making an L-shaped cutout to accommodate an electrical outlet, set the tile up in the same way as a complete cut. You will simply feed the tile only far enough into the blade to achieve the desired cut depth.

, When the tile is positioned and you are ready to make your cut, engage the power switch. Ensure that water is being sprayed onto the blade before cutting the tile.








, Using a steady grip, feed the tile slowly straight into the blade. Do not force the tile into the blade any faster than it naturally wants to move; let the blade do the work of cutting the tile. Take care to feed the tile especially slowly at the edges of the tile, as this is where most breakages occur.








, When the cut is complete, carefully pull the cut pieces of tile away from the blade. Turn off the tile saw, and prepare your next tile for cutting before engaging the blade again.

Read the instruction manual.,
Wear eye and ear protection when using the table saw.,
Use a push shoe, push stick, or splitter when cutting thin boards.,
Use clearance inserts.,
Install the blade guard properly.,
Don't cut warped boards.,
Locate your emergency turn off button.,
Avoid wearing loose hanging jewelry or clothing.",How to Use a Table Saw1," Make sure to read the instructions that came with your saw for proper use and installation of the saw. Although most table saws are similar, there are differences among brands. Reading the manual will let you know where each part of the saw is, what it does, and the proper safety precautions that you should take when using your specific model., Wear safety goggles or a hardhat with a visor when cutting boards on your table saw. This will prevent sawdust and wood debris from flying into your face or eyes. Also, proper ear protection should be used because saw blades can be incredibly loud and hurt your eardrums. You can either purchase cheap, disposable earplugs or more sturdy earmuffs to protect your hearing., When cutting narrow, short boards, there may not be much clearance for your hands between the blade and the side fence. For this reason, you should use a push stick or a notched sled to help guide your wood as it gets cut. You can purchase these table saw pushing devices at hardware stores, online, or you can create them yourself.Some push devices will have adjustable parts for different sizes of wood.

, If you are ripping really thin boards, you'll want to use an insert to protect your fingers from being close to the blade. An insert is a piece of wood that fits between the side fence and your saw blade and allows a buffer zone when cutting especially thin pieces of wood.In addition to using a clearance insert, you should also use a pushing device when cutting very thin boards.

, Blade guards prevent debris from kicking back and keep your fingers away from the blade. If blade guard is no longer installed, purchase one from your table saw manufacturer, or re-install the one that came with the table saw originally. Many modern blade guards can be reattached to your blade by simply fitting it on top of the blade and tightening screws or plastic clamps., Warped or bent boards will make rough cuts and will cause wood to kick back. Do not use any boards that have been water damaged or warped., Most table saws will come with a large button or paddle for an emergency turn off. If there is an accident or a board is kicking back you may need to turn off your machine quickly. Many times this button can be hit with your leg if your hands are occupied., Avoid wearing things that can get caught in the saw like loose sleeves or a tie. Other baggy or loose fitting clothing could get trapped in the saw and pull you towards it. If you have long hair, tie it up before using your table saw."
"
See what is available for you to buy.,
Consider how the saw is made.,
Think about the amperage of the saw motor.,
Buy for safety's sake - another consideration for your choice in buying a circular saw.,
Research saws.",How to Buy a Circular Saw," You will find there are three types of circular saws. The differences are based on how they operate or how the saw blade is turned as well as how they are powered.


The direct drive, or sidewinder, is the saw you are probably the most familiar with. This saw, with the blade attached directly to the motor, is powered by 110 house current and normally is the least expensive of the three types.
The worm drive circular saw, on the other hand, is the most expensive of the three types. Here, the saw blade is driven through the use of reduction gears that put less strain on the motor and have a history of longevity. This is most often the choice of professional carpenters.
The third type of saw is the cordless, or battery operated, circular saw. This saw is a direct drive (sidewinder) type but uses an attached battery, like the cordless drill, to power it. The cordless circular saw also will have a smaller diameter blade.;
, This is, perhaps, more so than just how it is driven.


A cast-metal plate attached to the bottom of the saw on the more expensive version determines the depth and angle of cut. It also gives a reference mark for you to follow while making the cut.
The cheaper version has a plate made from aluminum, which will be easier to bend or knock out of alignment due to abuse.
The heavier cast metal plate will hold up better on a job site.

, Higher amperage indicates the saw's longevity and power in cutting certain types of wood. They will normally come in the cheaper 12 amp and the more expensive 15 amp saws.


Higher amperage saws have a reputation of holding up better over time. It is not uncommon for a 15 amp worm drive saw to be used for several decades and even be handed down to another generation.
A basic aluminum plate 12 amp sidewinder model will cost in the $30 range while a 15 amp cast metal base worm drive model runs $200 or more.
Cordless saws depend on the size of the battery - 12 to 24 volt - and who the manufacturer is to determine the cost.

, Never buy one without checking the holding balance and seeing how easy it is for you to safely use.


How easy is it to operate the double-safety switch that turns it on? Are the saw's adjustments assemble and easy to use? Does the blade guard operate correctly at different depths and angles of cut you might use the saw in?
These are all considerations that only your hands on the saw can reveal.

, Do your homework before you go to the tool store to buy, look at, and handle the circular saw. Look up the different saws that have been reviewed including the owner satisfaction and complaint comments. This will save you aggravation and wasted money on the circular saw you buy.

",How to Use a Scroll Saw," Depending upon the type of wood you're using, you may want to use a blade with few teeth for this part or a different saw.;
, For hard wood, use a slower speed. Soft woods, such as maple or popular, can take faster speeds.

,,, Hold down the piece, and push it forward along the cut line.


As you push the piece forward, lift 1 finger at a time out of the way. Do not lift 1 hand or both fingers, or the piece may jump and create a jagged cut.







, Watch the blade, and listen to the saw to determine if you need to slow down.

,, Guide the blade onto the line of cut, and meet with the first cut. Gently back the blade out of the cut, and turn the piece again for the next line.

Adjust the blade so it's higher than the thickness of the wood.,
Adjust the width of the fence that you need to cut.,
Hold the wood against the fence.,
Lower the blade guard and turn on the table saw.,
Push your board through the blade.,
Switch off the saw.",How to Use a Table Saw2," To avoid potential kickback, you want to make sure that the blades of the saw are as high as the thickness of the piece of wood you are cutting. Use the blade adjusting handle on the bottom of your table saw to either raise or lower the blade. The blade should be about a .25 inches (0.635 cm) higher than the thickness of the wood you intend to cut., Use a tape measure to measure the distance from the saw blade to the fence. There will be a handle that will tighten and loosen the side rail, so that you can move it left to right. Move the side fence to the distance that you want to cut your board.


For instance, if you need to cut a 2-foot (61 cm) wide board, you'd measure 2 feet (61 cm) between the side fence and the saw blade., Place your thumb and hand carefully behind the piece of wood between the fence and saw blade. Set the wood firmly against the table saw and the side fence to prevent kickback.

, Lower the plastic guard blade over the blade to protect you from debris. Turn on the blade and get ready to cut.

, At a slow and steady rate, push your board through the blade. Concentrate on keeping the board flush with your fence as you push it through. Never put your hand close to the blade, and always use a push device or insert if there is not at least 6 inches (15.24 cm) between your hand and your blade.A sharp blade and a flat board will prevent your wood from splintering or chipping.

, Flip the switch on your table saw to turn it off. Your board should now be properly cut to your intended dimensions.

Set your miter gauge into its slot.,
Square the miter gauge to your blade.,

Push the board through the blade.,
Pull back the board and turn off the saw.",How to Use a Table Saw3," Adjust the saw blade to about .25 inches (0.635 cm) above the thickness of your board. Setting the blade too high could splinter your wood and setting it too low will cause it to not cut all the way through., If you don't have a built-in miter gauge, you'll have to set one into the miter gauge slot, which should be on the left of your saw blade. If your saw didn't come with a miter gauge, you can purchase one at a hardware store or online., To make perfect crosscuts, the miter gauge must be squared with the sawblade. Loosen the handle on the miter gauge and place a 45-degree drafting triangle along the length of your saw blade. Adjust the gauge until both sides of your drafting triangle runs at a 90-degree angle against the blade and the miter gauge. Once it's perfect, retighten the handle on the gauge to hold it in place., Use your right hand to pull the miter gauge handle and set the gauge to the back of the saw. Using your left hand, firmly hold your board against the edge of the miter gauge. Keep your fingers at least 6 inches away from the saw blade cover.The board should be sitting at a 90-degree angle to your blade on the miter gauge fence.

, Push slowly but deliberately with your right hand onto the miter gauge handle and keep a firm grip on the board with your left hand. Push the miter gauge fence forward and cut your board., Once you've cut through your piece of wood, pull back the board to the starting position. Turn off your table saw, and you've just made a crosscut.

Keep the blades clean.,
Mark your cuts first.,
Beware of wasting the blade.,
Use some tricks for different materials.",How to Use a Steel Chop Saw," A 14 inch (35.6 cm) saw will successfully cut through material about 5 inches (12.7 cm) thick with the correct blade and support. Check the switch, cord, clamp base, and guards to be sure they are in good condition.;
, These saws typically require 15 amps minimum at 120 volts, so you will not want to operate one with a long, small gauge extension cord. You might also choose a ground fault interrupted circuit if available when cutting outdoors or where an electrical short is possible.

, Thinner abrasive blades cut quickest, but a slightly thicker blade handles abuse better. Buy a quality blade from a reputable reseller for best results.

, These saws create dust, sparks, and debris, so eye protection, including a face shield, are recommended. You may also want to wear thick gloves and hearing protection, as well as sturdy long pants and sleeved shirts and work boots for additional protection.

, When you are cutting flat bar, set the work in the clamp vertically, so the is cut is through a thin layer the whole way. It is hard for the blade to clear the kerf (cuttings) when it has to cut across flat work.


For angle steel, set it on the two edges, so there is no flat to cut through.
If you set the chop saw up directly on concrete, put a bit of cement sheet, iron, even wet plywood (as long as you keep your eye on it) underneath it. That will keep those sparks from leaving a permanent stain on the concrete.
A lot of times with a chop saw, you will have to work with the saw on the ground. That's because of the length and weight of the material you may want to cut. Put something flat and solid under the saw and then use packers to support the steel.
Protect walls or windows or any features you are near. Remember, sparks and debris are discharged at high speeds to the rear of the saw.

, Use a square to test that the face of the disk is square off the steel just in case the ground is sloping or your packers are wrong.


Don't worry if the packers to the right are a bit low. This will allow the cut to open slightly as you cut.
Never set your packers high or even level and don't set up on a bench for that matter. As you cut, the steel will sag in the middle, and cause the chop saw to bind and then jam.

, After a saw has been used for a while, metal and disk residue builds up on the inside of the steel guard. You will see it when you are changing the disk. Give the outside of the guard a whack with a hammer to dislodge the build up. (When it is switched off, of course). Don't take the chance of it flying off at speed when cutting.

, To get a really accurate cut, mark the material with a fine pencil, or a sharp piece of French chalk (if working on black steel). Set it in position with the clamp nipped up lightly. If your mark is not fine enough or hard to see, you can put your tape measure on the end of the material and bring it under the disk. Lower the disk almost to the tape and sight down the face of the disk to the tape. Sight down the surface of the disk that is going to do the cut.


If you move your eye you will see that the size of 1520mm is dead in line with the cutting face.
If the piece that you want is on the right of the disk, you should sight along that side of the blade.

, If you are pushing it a bit much and you see dust coming off the blade, back off, you are wasting the blade. What you should see is plenty of bright sparks coming out the back, and hear the revs not a lot less than free idle speed.

,


For heavy material that is hard to move, nip the clamp lightly, adjust by tapping the end of the material with a hammer until it is spot on.
If the steel is long and heavy, try tapping the saw with the hammer to get it up to the mark. Tighten up the clamp and do the cut using steady pressure.
Use your tape under a cutting blade when needed. The sighting down the blade is common on all saws.

Push the saw into the material with enough force to keep the blade cutting, but avoid pushing so hard the motor speed seems to decrease, or binding occurs on the blade.,
Be sure the lower blade guard returns to its position when you exit the cut.",How to Use a Circular Saw," Here a few examples:









5 inch (12.7 cm) trim saws, usually with a fine-toothed blade and often with the blade located on the left side of the motor, for easy viewing of the blade path. These are available in 120V, AC models, and rechargeable battery models in various DC voltages.

6 1⁄2 inch (16.5 cm) saws, as shown in the illustration above, used for cutting to length nominal lumber for construction, as well as ripping lumber, and cutting plywood or composite material.

7 1⁄4 inch (18.4 cm) saws, often call skilsaws, from the name of a major circular saw manufacturer, Skil. These are the backbone of the construction industry, used for cutting lumber up to 2 1⁄4 inch (5.7 cm) thick. They are used for cutting framing lumber to length, and ripping lumber. They also have a number of optional blades which can be used for cutting composite materials, concrete, ferrous and nonferrous metal sheeting, pipe, tubing, and even cold-rolled steel bar stock.
8 and 10 inch saws, used for cutting to length larger lumber or timbers, up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) thick. These are heavier, more cumbersome tools used mostly in industrial work.
Worm-drive saws have a gearbox with a worm-geardrive, and are found in 7 1⁄4 inch (18.4 cm) models which are most commonly used for ripping lumber or cutting plywood decking or sheathing. They typically have the blade on the left side of the machine, to make watching the blade path easier when cutting parallel to the edge of a wide sheet of plywood.;
, The following are basic functions of some of these features.









The base plate can be tilted to make angled cuts. Most saws adjust from 90 degrees to slightly less than 45 degrees, making it possible to cut bevelled ends on boards for corning attachments, hip-roof rafter cuts, and even miters. Most saws are equipped with a thumbscrew or lever to loosen the bolt which keeps the saw blade on the correct angle for the cut you are making, located on the front of the saw. Some are also equipped with a scale which indicates the blade angle, from '0' (90 degrees, or square to the board surface) to 45 degrees.
The blade can be set to the depth required for individual cuts, from less than 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) to the full depth the blade is capable of penetrating. The lever or thumbscrew which locks the base plate at the desired height is usually located at the rear of the motor on the left side.
Many circular saws are equipped with a ripping fence, to guide the blade as you make a rip cut along the edge of a board, giving you a straighter, parallel cut.
Dust ejector. A few newer saws are equipped with a dust ejector to blow the sawdust away from the operator's face and from the mark where the cut is being made.
Laser tracking light. Some newer saws are equipped with a laser that projects a bright, red line down the path of the blade travel. These can also be purchased to retrofit on older units that are not factory equipped with them.
Blade guard. This should be considered an essential safety feature on any saw, and has two parts, the fixed guard over the top of the blade, and the floating guard, which rolls out of the way as the saw is pushed into the work piece. Some have a handle so the blade guard can manually be lifted for plunge cutting or easier viewing of the cutting mark.

, They range in blade composition, number of teeth (cutting bits or surfaces), the amount of set (the width of the kerf removed by the blade), and the blade quality.









One of these circular saws will probably have a plain HSS (high speed steel) saw blade in it when it is bought new.
TCT (tungsten carbide tipped) blades are much more durable, especially in tough hardwoods. Also plywood and composite boards are hard on blades so TCT blades are needed on them.

Blades with fewer teeth (say 28) and with less rake to the face of the teeth, are designed for ripping along the length of timber, with the grain. They typically give a quick rough cut. They are cheap to buy and cheap to sharpen, since they have fewer teeth.
Blades with more teeth (say 40) are designed for crosscut type work. They give a lot neater cut in most circumstances.


Abrasive blades are made from carborundum or other abrasive materials bonded together in a resin or other synthetic binding material, and are used for cutting concrete or metal. They tend to wear away rather quickly, but for small projects, they are inexpensive and make fast cuts.
Diamond rim blades. These blades are made of special alloy metals with industrial diamonds embedded in the rim (around the outside diameter of the blade), and are for cutting hard concrete, cement composite materials, and masonry products like block or brick.
Special tempered alloy blades. These blades have tempered carbon steel teeth, which are very fine (small, and closely spaced) for cutting sheet metal like galvanized roofing metal, or aluminum, copper, or brass tubing.
Dado blades. These are blades which can actually be adjusted to cut different width kerfs (the width of the material removed in the blade path). These blades make it much faster and easier for cutting dadoes and rabbets, used for joining lumber.
Trim and panelling blades. These blades have fine teeth for making smooth, accurate cuts on finished materials like mouldings and panelling.

, For example, do not lay a board on a floor or concrete slab for cutting. Sawhorses or a saw table are normally used for this purpose.








,, Don't have much more of the blade showing than you really need for the job you are doing. So to cut 40mm thick timber, set your blade to about 45mm or 50mm. This helps to minimize kickback.








, It should spring back in place as soon as you lift the saw off the work. It should slide up smoothly as you push onto the work. Make sure it's in the DOWN position before you put the saw down on the bench.








,, The right hand one is a guide for cutting with the blade set in the normal position, and the other one is for when the base angled at 45 deg. Line the notch up to the pencil line.








, (photo 1) Keep your eye on the guide (photo 2) all the time. This puts you in a natural position looking forward along the pencil line, and out of the way of any sawdust.








, Make sure that you are keeping the base of the circular saw flat on the timber being cut.








, A sharp blade should pass through any but the hardest materials with minimal effort.








, Even a blade guard in good condition will occasionally bind if a piece of debris from the cut becomes lodged in its mechanism.

Select the proper anchor screw.",How to Put Anchor Screws in a Wall1," What is it made out of? Different types of walls will require different types of anchors and may require a different installation process.


Plaster walls begin as wooden frames that have been constructed from narrow strips of wood cut from a lathe. These frames are then coated with several layers of plaster until the desired density is achieved. Plaster wall was the standard during the early 1900s.Drywall is made from a plaster sheet that has been sandwiched between paper. Drywall became popular in the United States and Canada during the late 1950s as a lighter-weight replacement to plaster wall.Brick and mortar, and concrete walls are also common.;
, This is the second most important factor to consider when selecting the proper type of wall anchor.


Cabinets, because of the way that they hang, put more stress on an anchor. It is therefore not recommended to hang a cabinet with an anchor. Depending on the size of the cabinet, you may find a smaller piece that will work with an anchor.

, The angle that you will be installing the anchor and the weight of the object being hung will affect which type of anchor you should use. The amount of stress on an anchor affects how much it can support.

, This can only be done if you know ahead of time what type of material the anchor will be screwed into, the approximate weight of the object being hung, and angle of the anchor (as in the case of a ceiling).Plaster wall: anything under 20-pounds can be hung with a plastic expansion anchor. Use a molly bolt for anything weighing more than 20-pounds.Drywall: use a threaded anchor screw for anything weighing less than 20-pounds. Anything weighing more should be anchored with a molly bolt. Hanging anything more than a few pounds--such as a smoke detector--is not recommended on drywall ceilings.Concrete or brick and mortar walls require expansion anchors. Be sure never to install any anchors in-between seams of concrete or brick. Anchors should only be installed in the brick or stone itself, ever in the grout. The amount of weight that the anchor can hold will be determined by the strength and condition of the wall itself (e.g., old brick and mortar walls that are in poor condition tend to be brittle and can crumble; this directly impacts how much weight an anchor can support).

",How to Use Wall Plugs and Screws," Purchase or rent a stud finder and mark the locations on your walls. If those areas don’t match up with the project, then move on to finding wall plugs and screws that will work.


Installation in the center of a stud is always preferred, because it is a load-bearing support. Walls, especially dry wall, are not designed to hold large, heavy objects by themselves.;
, (6.8kg). If it does, the universal version is likely to work well. If possible, purchase wall plug and screw combos to ensure they will fit.


If the wall plugs and screws are sold separately, test the screws by inserting them inside the plug. If it fits through the center and comes out the other end with a few mm to spare, the screw will likely work with that plug.





These universal wall plugs and screws often come with hanging objects in the original packaging.

, The plug opens up perpendicular to the wall once it’s installed into panel or plasterboard. There is also a special plasterboard plug you can buy that expands like an umbrella once behind the wall., Buy a package that includes a steel screw. This is best for attaching items to wooden beams, window frames or wall cladding.

Once screwed in the wall, you will need to hammer the screw the rest of the way in to complete the process.

, (200 kg). Unlike the screw head, there is a nut at the end. After the plug is installed, you tighten the nut and the anchor keeps a strong hold on the surrounding material.

, Unlike other anchors, there are two metal wings. Keep them closed and push them through the ceiling, and then the wings will sit against the inside of the ceiling material while you tighten the screw., Generally both are measured in mm. For example, a size three wall plug is usually a three mm drill bit. You will be able to compare them side-by-side to ensure the size is right.


If you don’t have a power drill, find a nail that is the size of the plug and pound that in to create your pilot hole.

, Unlike nail holes, wall plugs can look unsightly and require patching if you want to change positions.

, Make sure it is a little longer than the length of the screw.

, You will push the expanding section through the hole until the collared section touches the wall.

, Align your flat or Philips head drill bit with the top of the screw and drill into the wall.

, This is a special combination screw. When the threaded part is in the wall, tap the rest of it into the wall with a hammer.

Determine exactly where you want your picture frame or mirror to hang.,
Make a small pencil mark where the center of the screw will go.,
Drill a hole in the spot(s) you marked.,
Slide the expansion anchor into the hole.,
Screw the support screw into the anchor.,
Back the screw out slightly by turning it counter-clockwise.",How to Put Anchor Screws in a Wall2," If your picture frame or mirror has a wire-hanger in the back, be sure to take into account the amount of slack when figuring-out where you want the picture or mirror to hang.

, If the picture frame or mirror has multiple hooks on the back, be sure to measure the distance between them. Use a level to measure the spot for your second anchor. Make another small pencil mark where the second anchor will be installed.


You can also apply a bit of grease or lipstick on the hooks of the item you will hang. Place the item where you want it on the wall and gently press it against the wall. The grease or lipstick will leave a mark to show you where to install your anchors.

, Be sure that you hold the drill perpendicular to the wall so that the anchor will sit parallel to the ground: an anchor that is not installed straight will not be able to support as much weight. You should drill a hole that is approximately the same size as the anchor itself (the screw will force it to expand outward).Make sure the hole you drill is deeper than the anchor is long.

, If the hole is too small, the anchor will collapse onto itself and may not install properly. Push it in until the anchor sits flush against the wall. Do not bang on the screw because it could bend or break.


If needed, tap the anchor with a rubber mallet lightly to get it to sit flush against the surface of the wall.

, Line up the screw and the anchor and, using either a philips or flat head screwdriver, turn the screw clockwise just until the base of the screw comes to rest against the base of the anchor.









If the object you are hanging has a mounting bracket, you may need to slide the screw through the bracket before screwing it into the anchor.

, Be sure to leave just-enough of the screw exposed to ""catch"" the hanger on the back of picture frame or mirror. A good rule of thumb is to leave about a 1/4"" of screw exposed for hanging.

Threaded anchor screws are mostly used in drywall.

, If the picture frame or mirror has multiple hooks on the back, be sure to measure the distance between them. Make another small pencil mark where the second-anchor will be installed (in-line with the previous mark, spaced the same distance as the hooks on the picture farm or mirror).

, Because these anchors are self-threaded you do not need to pre-drill any holes.








Although this is not absolutely necessary, you can use a nail to make a tiny indention on your mark. This indentations will hold the tip of the anchor as you begin screwing it into the wall.

, You will have to use a drill to install the anchor. Be sure to hold the screwdriver or drill perpendicular to the wall to ensure that the anchor is installed perfectly straight.


Clockwise is ""in.""
Make sure you are applying enough pressure to allow the threads to catch. Otherwise, the tip of the anchor will keep spinning in place.Screw the anchor in until it rests flush against the wall.

, The hole should be slightly larger than the molly bolt. You can measure it by folding the wings and measuring its width. As the molly bolt is screwed in its wings will compress and create tension, filling any gap.Be sure that you hold the drill perpendicular to the wall so that the anchor is installed perfectly straight. All wall anchors should be installed parallel to the ground.


Make sure you hole you drill is deeper than the anchor is long.

, Unlike the other two types of anchors, which require the anchor and the support screw to be installed separately, the molly bolt and screw are installed at the same time. Prepare the molly bolt by screwing the support screw into the winged-bolt.








, Be sure to hold the screwdriver perpendicular to the wall as you are turning it clockwise. This will help ensure that the anchor is installed perfectly straight.









Since the hole you drilled earlier is larger than the molly bolt, you should not have to use a drill.Don't over tighten, the molly bolt will flare as you screw it into the wall.Just make sure that it is snug.

Choose a suitable site to work from: flat, level and free from loose materials, debris or rubble.
,Check that the flip over saw is firm and does not move.,
Route the power cable to the flip over saw away from the work area and not suspended off the ground in any way to cause a trip hazard.,
Gather together your personal protection equipment (PPE), which should at least comprise of suitable safety glasses and a good push stick if using the flip over saw in table cutting mode.,
Wear stout, steel toe capped boots, sensible clothes and tuck away anything loose that could be pulled into the blade.,
Keep your material stock sited to hand and safely stacked.,
Site the saw so that you don’t have to walk around it to take the freshly cut workpiece back to the work place and then stack the materials to the left hand side for convenience.,
Use some kind of side supports, if cutting lengths longer than say 1 meter (3.3 ft).,
Plan your work so that you minimize the amount of times that you need to ‘flip’ the saw over into table mode and back, if you can.",How to Use a Flip Over Saw1,",,
Your power supply should be from a safe point with enough capacity for the start up surge of a powerful motor, often around 2000w. This supply should have some kind of circuit protection preferably a sensitive breaker that will trip in the even of an accident. If using a 110v transformer, site this next to the power point and use a suitable 110v extension lead to the flip over saw. DO NOT run a 240v extension lead to the 110v transformer at the saw!, Ear defenders are a good idea if in an enclosed space or if using the saw for extended periods and absolutely essential if cutting aluminum (special blade required) (as the noise from these blades can be horrendous!) If not using a dust extraction system then dust nuisance face masks should also be considered especially if ripping down long lengths of material or working in an enclosed space., Wearing rings and other jewellery is not to be recommended either. Hard hats are needed if there is a danger from above or if passing long lengths of timber overhead., Removing a single length should not cause the stack to collapse!, This leaves a clear route between the flip over saw and the workplace. Being efficient means getting more work done for less effort!, Either commercial saw supports or custom altered ‘saw horses’. Try using metal folding type saw horses with a timber packing piece screwed to the tops. Three is ideal, two to the left and one to the right to catch the off cut. Two to the left is needed as the material may get smaller and smaller if cutting several sections out of one length. This is essential for safe working and to prevent the blade snatching the workpiece as it cuts through., For example: do all of the table saw cuts first and then switch to your miter saw cuts. This is not always feasible or practical though and fortunately most flip over saws are quick to change over."
"
Unscrew the threaded screw.,
Grab the collar with a set of needle-nosed pliers.,
Press the tip of a screwdriver into the hole where the wall anchor is lodged.,
Push the anchor through the wall with a screwdriver.",How to Remove Wall Anchors1," Some anchors have threaded screws that need to be removed before you can reach the collar. In these cases, use a screwdriver to turn the screw counterclockwise until it is loose, and then remove it., Use needle-nosed pliers to get underneath the anchor and grip it. Grab the edge of the collar, then pull out and snap it off.The collar is a small circular piece of metal that holds the anchor in place, so that it cannot be pushed backward, out the other end of the wall.
Be gentle when you attach the pliers. You don’t want to gouge the drywall. Try to avoid touching the drywall with the pliers.

, Once the anchor has been removed, you can use a screwdriver to push the anchor out through the other end of the wall. The screwdriver shouldn’t be larger than the diameter of the wall anchor because you will want to be able to push it through the wall without making the hole bigger. , The wall anchor should fall into the frame, behind the drywall. You will be left with a small hole to patch.

Consider the weight of the object.,
Match the wall plug to the screw.,
Examine the wall.,
Insert the correct bit into the drill.,
Drill a pilot hole straight into the wall.,
Remove a plug.,
Insert the plug into the pilot hole.,
Gently twist in the screw.,
Switch to the proper tool.,
Tighten the screw firmly.",How to Use a Rawl Plug," The weight of the object you wish to hang will determine the screw gauge you'll need, and the screw gauge will determine the correct wall plug.


The gauge of a screw is the diameter of the non-threaded portion. Larger numbers indicate a larger diameter.As a general rule, the heavier the object is, the larger screw gauge you'll need.
If the object comes packaged with manufacturer's instructions, review those instructions for advice on the proper screw gauge.
If no instructions are available, use the following notes as a general guide:Standard kitchen cupboards may need size 10 (5.0 mm) screws.
Internal doors may need size 8 (4.0 mm) screws.
A shelf measuring 1 yd (1 m) in length may require size 8 (4.0 mm) screws.
A 12-inch (30.5-cm) by 8-inch (20-cm) picture frame may need size 6 (3.5 mm) screws.


When in doubt, use screw that might be too large instead of using one that might be too small.;
, The correct wall plug size will primarily depend upon the screw gauge being used.


More precisely, the wall plug size will change based on the drill bit used to create the hole.
As a general rule:Yellow plugs fit into 5.0 mm holes and work best with screw sizes 3 and 4, but can be used for screw sizes 3 through 8.
Red plugs fit into 6.0 mm holes and work best with screw sizes 6 and 8, but can be used for screw sizes 6 through 10.
Brown plugs fit into 7.0 mm holes and work best with screw sizes 8 through 12, but can be used for screw sizes 8 through 14.
Blue plugs fit into 10.0 mm holes and work best with screw size 14, but can be used for screw sizes 14 through 18.


Note that not every brand follows the same color guidelines. Check the package or the wall plug itself for information concerning hole size before you begin working with any set of plugs.

, Determine whether the wall is solid or hollow before purchasing wall plugs for it.Solid walls will need the standard bullet-shaped wall plug.
Hollow walls will need wall plugs with wings, also known as plasterboard plugs.

, Insert the required drill bit into a power drill, firmly locking it into place.


Choose a drill bit that corresponds to the necessary pilot hole size for the wall plug you intend to use. In other words, use a 5.0 mm drill bit for a yellow plug, a 6.0 mm drill bit for a red plug, a 7.0 mm drill bit for a brown plug, or a 10.0 mm drill bit for a blue plug.
If in doubt, compare the drill bit with the large drill bit hole on the left side of the wall plug strip. The bit should tightly fit into this guide hole.

, Hold the drill bit to the wall and slowly drill your pilot hole.


The drill itself should be positioned at a right angle against the wall.
Work slowly and only drill a hole that is just long enough to accommodate the screw you intend to use.

, Remove one wall plug from the strip by twist and snapping it off.


The thin plastic connecting the plug to the strip must break, but the body of the plug must remain intact and undented.

, Using your fingers, push the wall plug into the pilot hole.After pushing it into the wall as far as possible with your fingers, use a hammer to carefully push it in further. Stop once the head of the wall plug is flush against the wall.
Note that it must fit snugly into the hole. If it feels loose, the plug will be unable to grasp the screw properly and will only spin around as you attempt to install the screw. If the plug is loose, increase the plug size and adjust the screw size as needed to match.

, Insert the tip of the screw into the installed wall plug, then gently twist the head of the screw in between your fingers until the tip enters the first few millimeters of the plug.


Note that the screw must be equal to or larger than the minimum screw size hole indicated on the wall plug strip. It must also be equal to or smaller than the maximum screw size hole on the same strip.
If you are unable to get the screw to grip properly when using your fingers, you could screw the first few millimeters in using a manual screwdriver. You could also gently tap the first few millimeters in using a hammer.
Inserting the tip into the plug in this manner can reduce the amount of pressure put on the wall when you tighten the screw, thereby reducing the risk of cracking or otherwise damaging the wall material.

, You can finish tightening the screw using a Phillips screwdriver or an electric drill, but you'll need to make sure that you have the right size tool before you begin.


Check the width of the screwdriver or drill bit against the slot of the screw. The two must be a close match.

, Slowly tighten the screw into the wall plug as needed using the drill or screwdriver.


If you decide to use a power drill, run the drill on its slowest speed to reduce the risk of overtightening the screw.
Do not overtighten the screw. If it feels too tight and working it into the wall takes too much effort, you should reverse the tool and pull the screw out. Switch to a smaller screw or start over with a larger pilot hole before trying again.
Once the screw is securely tightened into the wall plug, the installation process is complete.

, Do not use chainsaw for purpose not intended. Do not use for cutting non-wood items.

, Use only electrical voltage noted on model plate of chainsaw. Use only extension cords marked for outdoor use.

, Do not operate the pole saw or chainsaw while under the influence of alcohol, medication, or drugs, in rain or wet or damp areas, or where highly flammable liquids or gases are present. Don't operate the saw while in a hurry, while on a tree or on a ladder, or while on aerial booms, buckets or platforms

, If the pole or saw is damaged, adjusted wrong, or not fully and securely assembled, don't use it. If trigger does not turn pole saw on and off, don't use it. The chain must stop moving when you release the trigger. If it doesn't, have the switch replaced by an authorized service center.

, Wear snug fitting clothes when operating pole saw or chainsaw. Wear heavy-duty gloves (rubber gloves when operating outdoors), steel toe safety footwear with non-skid soles, eye protection such as safety glasses, goggles, or face screen, a safety hard hat, ear muffs or earplugs, a hair covering to contain long hair, and a face or dust mask (if working in dusty areas).


Do not wear loose fitting clothing or jewelry. They can get caught in moving chain.

, Make sure you have a clear work area, a planned retreat path for falling limbs, and secure footing to operate from. Inspect tree before trimming. Make allowance for branches to fall freely to the ground.


Do not use your pole saw to fall saplings. Use the chainsaw without pole attachment.

, To reduce the risk of electrical shock, this saw has a polarized plug (one blade is wider than the other). This plug will fit in a polarized plug only one way. If the plug doe not fit full in the outlet of your extension cord, reverse the plug. If it still does not fit, a polarized extension cord is necessary. Do not change the plug in any way.   

, Use common sense while operating the unit. Keep all body parts away from chain when saw is running.

, Be aware of extension cord while operating chain saw. Be careful not to trip over cord. Keep cord away from chain and operator at all times. Do not use near power lines. Keep at least 10 feet (3.0 m) away from electrical lines.

, Keep children, animals, and bystanders away from pole saw and extension cord. Only the pole saw user should be in work area.

, Do not use pole saw to cut down trees. Use the chainsaw without the pole attachment and only if you're trained or have expert help. Do not cut brush or small saplings with pole saw. Use chain saw only, with extreme care. Slender matter may catch in the chain and be whipped toward you. This could also pull you off balance.

, Keep one hand on the pole and the other on the handle.

, Before starting pole saw, make sure chain is not touching anything.

, Avoid body contact with grounded objects such as pipes, fences, and metal posts.

, Do not force the chain. It will do the job better and safest at the rate at which it was intended.

, Be alert for wood springing back. When wood tension is released, limb could spring back and strike operator causing serious injury or death.

, Unplug it, return the telescoping pole to the shortest position, and hold the unit at its balance point (close to the saw end). Hold it with the guide bar and chain to the rear.

"Miter saw cuts,

Long lengths should be marked from the left and short lengths of say under a meter should be marked from the right.,

Fold down the saw ‘head’ and secure as directed in the manufacturers instructions (they vary a little), ‘flip’ the saw over and listen for the locator catch to click.,
Off cut management.,
Limitations

Assuming that you have the right size saw for the job in hand and it can physically cut the material.",How to Use a Flip Over Saw2,", This is to ensure that the longer side of the material to be cut is to the left as this is the side which you will be firmly holding as the saw does its work.
Place the material under the blade and grasp the handle with blade guard release DO NOT PRESS THE POWER SWITCH AT THIS POINT.
Gently pull down the saw until the blade almost touches the material and adjust the material side to side, until the blade is positioned to the waste/off cut side of your mark.
Release the saw back to its resting point and keeping a firm grip on the workpiece, start the motor.
While waiting for the blade to reach full speed, listen to it. Become familiar with how the motor sounds and be vigilant to anything unusual. Sometimes small pieces of material get trapped in the guard mechanism and can rub against the blade until they fly out without warning! Stop, unplug the power and investigate any unusual sounds immediately!
With the blade at full speed and sounding good, gently pull the saw down into and through the workpiece. Become familiar with how the blade feels and cuts, learn to judge how much pressure to apply and do not slow the blade down excessively, about 10% or so is about right. Once all the way through the material, gently return the saw to its upright position, switch off the motor and wait for the blade to completely stop.
All done, you should now have the correct size workpiece. Ready for transferring to the workplace for fixing.
Never leave a flip over saw running in-between cuts. On a busy site a running motor can be dangerously and deceptively quiet.

, Always ‘double check’ visually that the saw bed is secured in position.
Always use the riving knife and blade guard when ripping down timber, again, as per manufacturers description. This stops the timber binding the blade after the cut and prevents the blade ‘throwing’ the timber back towards you at some speed!
Set up the fence or guide if making a parallel cut using the graduated marks on the saw table bed or by measuring between the fence and blade with a tape measure.
If you have set up the saw as per the earlier instructions you should have a clear area in front of the flip over saw (it is so tempting to stack material behind you, but as you can see, this is a mistake).
Once you are ready, start the flip over saw and step back from the machine with your material in hand. Again, listen to the motor as the blade spins up to full speed and place your material on the front edge of the table and line it up with the fence.
By now the blade will be running at full speed, gently but firmly feed the material into the blade, keeping a firm sideways and downwards pressure on the material into the guiding fence and table bed. Once you are about halfway you have the option to stop, withdraw the material, turn it over end to end and run the other half through until you meet the first cut. Shorter lengths may be fed straight through in one go, keeping hands well away from the blade or use one or two push sticks.

, Always know where your off cut is going to go. Small ones can fly out if not properly managed and long off cuts can tip and trap the blade also causing trouble. Good support is the answer, BEFORE, DURING and AFTER the cut., The only limitation that you will find with a flip over saw is that of having to continually flip the machine between the two modes if the work demands it or you don’t properly plan your cuts. Flip over saws do mean that you need to look a little further ahead and think about what you are doing.
As with many combination machines there is some compromise to achieve the flexibility. With flip over saws this may mean that the table saw bed is a little small or that the capacity of the miter saw is a little less because it doesn’t have a sliding arm.
Ultimately though, using a flip over saw is simple coupled with good capabilities and versatility means that a flip over saw can handle most jobs, either on site or in the workshop at home.

Use your item to pick the lock.,
Remove the doorknob.",How to Pick a Lock With Household Items1," Most privacy door knobs, also known as ""bed and bath"" door knobs, either have a pushbutton or twisting lock mechanism on the inside Doorknob. The outside Doorknob will have a small round hole in the center that is intended to allow for emergency access. If possible, ascertain which kind of lock mechanism (push button or twisting) you are dealing with.
If the outside Doorknob has a keyhole instead of a hole, you will need to proceed to the method for picking a locked entry door.;
, You need to find a long, thin object that is small enough to fit into the hole, but sturdy enough to put pressure on the locking mechanism. Ideal choices include a small screwdriver or hex wrench, a hair pin, or a heavy-duty paperclip. You can even use a bamboo skewer from the kitchen, or a cotton swab with the fluff removed from one end.


If using a hair pin or paper clip, first bend it open so you have a long, straight bit of metal.
If you are having trouble finding a suitable object, get creative. Open up a ball-point pen and use the ink cartridge, or check the bottom of your purse for a toothpick. You can almost always find something that will work!

, If the lock has a push button mechanism, just insert the tool straight into the hole until you feel some resistance, and push. You should immediately hear a click indicating the lock has been released. If the lock has a twisting mechanism, you will need to insert the tool, and sweep it around in a twisting motion until it catches on something, and then apply a bit of pressure. You will then hear a click that means the door is unlocked.









When opening a twist-lock, you may need to try sweeping the tool both counter-clockwise and clockwise until the lock releases.

, If you cannot get the knob to unlock using the above method, most privacy door knobs are held together with two, visible screws. Find a screwdriver that fits, and simply undo these screws. Within a few minutes, both doorknobs will come off. Simply pull any remaining locking mechanism out of the hole and open the door.








It is best to alternate back and forth between the two screws as you go.
You may have to apply some tension to the Doorknob by pulling on it as the screws loosen.
In some cases, the screws will be hidden under a decorative collar. If so, this collar must first be removed by either inserting a paperclip into a small hole on the collar that releases it (if there is one) or gently prying up the collar with a flathead screwdriver."

",How to Use a Cross Cut Saw," Finer teeth make for a smoother cut, essential to make learning how to use a saw easier. Larger toothed saws are used for cuts where accuracy can be sacrificed for cutting speed.;
, A dull saw makes sawing highly unpleasant.

, Hold the wood down or clamp it into place so it that will not move. Mark the location where you will make the cut.

, Make sure the cut location is off the sawhorse or not in between the sawhorses.

, Keep fingers clear of the area to be cut.

, Use a straight piece of wood to keep the saw in line with the line you wish to cut. Slowly draw the blade of the saw on the mark on the wood at a 45 degree angle.

,, Do not let the blade come off the wood.

, Let the saw do the work. Using too much force will make the saw bite into the wood, getting it stuck, possibly leading to you bending the saw.

, It is not a knife, so do not try to use it as one.

, As long as you see sawdust coming from the wood, it is being cut.

, Support the piece that is being cut off with your hand if possible.

Visualize the inside of the lock to understand how picking works.",How to Pick a Lock with a Bobby Pin1," Bend back the pin so that you have a long piece of metal wire. This will be your pick, and is inserted into the lock and used to move the pins out of the way.

Strip off the rubber knobs on the ends, as they will only get in the way. You can do this with your teeth, or a pair of wire cutters if you have them.;
, Stick the pin into your lock roughly one centimeter. The flat side should be facing up. Push the rest of the pin to the left, bending the end of the pin slightly. It only needs to curl up a few millimeters.









You'll end up pushing the pin roughly 2 or 3 inches to the left to get the right bend.

, Take one end of your pick and bend half of it back on itself, creating a little loop. This is simply so that the pick is easier to hold and put pressure on.








, This is easiest with a pair of pliers, but you can do it with your fingers with a little persistence. The lever acts like the key-- turning the actual lock once you've moved the pins (which keep the lock secure) out of the way with your pick. You simply want the bent half off the pin (away from the rubber ends) to be at a right angle from the rest bottom of the pin.








, A typical lock is made up of two parts: the barrel and the pins. The barrel is the chamber you put the key into. The pins are small metal cylinders that sink into the barrel, holding it in place until a key (or your pick) pushes them up and out of the way. The pins are cut in half, and when the halfway mark lines up with the barrel you can turn the lock. Your job, as a lock picker, is to manually push up each of the pins into the correct position, slowly turning the barrel so that they can't call back into place. Once you've got all the pins out of the way, the barrel will turn freely and the door will be open.









A key is basically a complex pick. The groves are tuned so that, once inserted, all the pins are perfectly aligned and you can turn the doorknob."

The teeth of the key won’t be the right size or dimension to move the pins, so the key won’t turn, but it’s important that it be able to slide inside. Locks and keys come in all different makes, but many keys will fit into a standard cylindrical home lock.If you’re fashioning your own bump key, pick a key that you don’t use regularly. Try it out in a few cylinder locks to see if it fits before filing it to the right specifications.
Lock bumping is such a potential problem because it can be performed with almost any key.;
, Look at the key and observe the spacing of the teeth. At the bottom of each tooth is a flat area known as the “valley” that separates the teeth. In order to be able to disengage the pins of the lock, these valleys will need to be filed down all the way to the main shaft of the key.


When it comes time to modify the key, be careful not to file the valleys too shallow or deep. If the spaces between the teeth are not at the right depth, the key will be useless.

, Use a manual file (a wedge or triangular shape will work best) to shave down the valleys between each tooth on the key. The key should have a jagged, zig-zag appearance when you’re finished. Once the valleys are as deep as they can be, the teeth will be long enough to push up the pins in the lock when the key is struck a certain way.Locksmiths refer to keys that have been ground down to a serrated pattern with sharp, even peaks and valleys as “999 keys.”Pre-cut bump keys can also be bought from unscrupulous vendors, but be warned: possession of a bump key is generally regarded as a cause for criminal suspicion by law enforcement.

, File each valley down to the same point along the shaft of the key. If the valleys at the front of the key are deeper than those in the back, the key won’t be able to slide into the lock. If the valleys in the back are deeper, you may have difficulty pulling the key out of the lock after bumping it. There should be a very small triangular depression in the shaft of the key at the bottom of each valley.Locksmiths and services that grind key duplicates are capable of precisely cutting 999 keys, but you might get some strange looks if you ask for this to be done.

, Fit the key into the lock. Push it in until it stops, then pull back slightly until you hear or feel the last pin click. This puts the pins in the right position to be manipulated by the teeth of the modified key.









Keys of roughly the same size will often fit any lock with the same mechanism (like a cylindrical lock).Insert the key slowly and carefully to make sure it doesn’t get stuck. The deeper valleys might make it prone to getting caught on the pins.

, Try turning the key in the unlock direction (usually counterclockwise). Keep constant pressure on the key as you work. It won’t move very far initially, but if you’re able to jostle the pins just right with a well-placed strike, the key will effortlessly turn the rest of the way. Grip the key near the teeth to allow yourself room to hit the back end of it.








Don’t turn the key too hard. It will be weaker since you removed metal from the body, and twisting it forcefully while striking it might cause it to break off in the lock.

, Using a mallet, the handle of a screwdriver or another broad, blunt object, strike the rear edge of the key as you continue trying to turn it in the lock. This is what is known as the “bump.” You’ll need to hit the key quite hard, as the technique requires that that force be transferred through the lock. If you’re successful, the pins inside the lock will jump momentarily, creating enough space for the key to turn the rest of the way.








Hit the key directly on the end, not at an angle.
The bump won’t work if the key is inserted all the way into the lock. Pull back on the key until you hear the first click before attempting the strike.

, If you’re unsuccessful on your first attempt, try wiggling the key and hitting it again. Repeat this process, turning the key in the unlock direction the entire time, until the pins catch. If after multiple attempts the key still won’t budge, remove it from the lock and try inserting it again, pulling back just a little to put it in the right position to dislodge the pins.








If you’ve tried over and over and still can’t get the key to turn, either the grooves you filed in the valleys are not the right length or the deadbolt needs to be turned in the opposite direction.

, Most modern locks are designed to protect against lock-picking techniques like bumping. Take a look at the face of your deadbolt to see if a small marking is displayed above or to the side of the key slot. If so, it means your lock is resistant to forced entry measures.The markings themselves will vary, but may take the form of a vertical line, a plus sign or an Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL) seal of security.
Ask a hardware specialist for tamper-proof designs when buying new locks.

, Take your locks to be worked on by a professional. Locksmiths can install special heavy duty pins and incorporate additional security features to make your home harder to break into. If the doors to your home are guarded by basic cylinder locks and you’re worried about a break-in, it may be worth the expense to upgrade to more forbidding locks.


If you have reason to be especially concerned about lockpicking, consider going with a different type of locking mechanism than the usual cylinder lock.

, In most hardware and home improvement stores you can purchase light commercial grade locks. These locks, which are typically used by businesses to prevent theft, are made of resilient materials and make use of complex locking mechanisms. A commercial grade lock could make a surprisingly effective deterrent against a would-be burglar.Commercial grade locks will be more expensive on average but provide more trustworthy home defense.

, One of the best methods of preventing a break-in is to simply be home, or make it look like someone is. If you have a dog, keep it chained or fenced within sight of the outside of your home. Put up “No Trespassing” or security system signs to ward off intruders, or simply make sure you’re seen coming and going frequently. While this approach isn’t foolproof, it has been shown to make most criminals think better of trying to gain entry to your residence.Leave a TV or lamp on in the front of your home at night or when you have to go out of town to make it appear that someone is home and awake.
The majority of break-ins occur through the front door. Make sure you have locks secure enough to stop a brazen attempt to enter your home."

Make sure you have permission to pick the lock.,
Find a suitable card.,
Use the card to pick the lock.",How to Pick a Lock With Household Items2," If the lock in question is not attached to your own home, secure the property-owner's permission before proceeding. Breaking and entering is a serious crime in most places that can result in mandatory jail time.

, The ideal card will be a plastic card that is both stiff and somewhat flexible. Avoid using your actual credit or debit card, as it may get damaged in the process. A grocery store loyalty card makes an ideal choice, as does a laminated library card. Even a stiff business card will work on some locks. , Take the card, and slide it into the gap between the door and the doorjamb. Begin just above the door handle, and slide the card downwards and in. You may have to wiggle it a bit, but if you are lucky, the card will press against the latch assembly and allow you to open the door.








This technique only works on regular key-locks. It will not work to open a deadbolt.
Some doors open almost instantly using this technique, whereas others require more effort. Experiment with different cards, and different angles.
Remember that this technique only circumvents the lock, it doesn't actually unlock the door. If you let the door close, you could end up locked out all over again!

Make sure you have permission to pick the lock.,
Fashion a lock-pick using household items.,
Make a tension wrench.,
Pick the lock using your tools.",How to Pick a Lock With Household Items3," If the lock in question is not attached to your own home, secure permission from the property owner before proceeding. Breaking and entering is a crime!

, Bobby pins or hair pins work best, but you can also use heavy-duty paperclips, or other stiff bits of wire. First create your pick by opening out one of the bobby pins or paperclips until it is straight. Then bend the last 1/8"" of the pick up at a 20 degree angle. If you are using a hair pin with plastic-dipped ends, you will need to scrape the plastic from the end of the pick first using a pair of pliers, the ground, or even your teeth, in a pinch.

, Take another bobby pin, or open up a paper clip and then fold it in half, and bend this into an L-shape. The tension wrench needs to be fairly sturdy, so make sure and use a heavy-duty paper clip or hair pin. You can also use a small flat-head screwdriver, or similar item that fits into the bottom of the keyhole as a tension wrench. 







, First insert the tension wrench into the bottom part of the lock, and rotate it in the direction you would turn the key to unlock it to place tension on the lock. Maintain this tension throughout the process. Then slowly wiggle the pick into the top part of the lock using a gentle up-and-down motion. You should hear a series of clicks as the various pins in the lock are raised. When you have successfully raised all of the pins, the tension wrench will suddenly rotate freely and unlock the door.









It is possible to pick most locks in a matter of seconds, but it takes a little practice. If you get frustrated, just take a deep breath and start again.
This technique also works on many deadbolts and padlocks, as well.
Picking a lock in this fashion looks extremely suspicious, and is likely to result in your neighbors calling the police. If you are a kid, call your parents and let them know what's going on before you start, and be prepared to show the police proof that you are breaking into your own home, garage, etc.

For many Master Locks, you can use the following to help figure out the first number...,
Speed tip: You don't have to clear the lock to try each combination.","How to Crack a ""Master Lock"" Combination Lock2"," Turn the lock's dial clockwise to zero.;
, Turn the dial clockwise (CW) slowly as you press the shackle. If you can't turn the dial at all from the zero point, release the shackle and turn the dial CW just a number or 2 and then try it again.

,


As you turn the dial CW with tension on the shackle, you will come to the first clockwise stopping point where you can't turn the dial anymore. Make note of where it stops. Sometimes, the dial will stick right on the numbers, but sometimes the sticking point will be between the numbers. If so, record the number to the half (example: 22.5).
While continuing to apply tension to the shackle, turn the dial as far left (counter-clockwise) as you can. Make note of the first counter-clockwise (CCW) stopping point. The CCW stopping point and CW stopping point form your sticking ""range"", for example, 22.5 to 10. (Note: Some 800XXX and 908xxx locks have a two number sticking range .)
Determine the first sticking point by finding the number that's in the midpoint of the sticking range. A range of 4 and 5 would have a first sticking point of 4.5. A range of 22.5 and 23.5 would have a first sticking point of 23.
Each set of numbers that you find will have the same range. For example, one group may be 0.25 to 0.75 and another may be 0.5 to 0.25 on either side of the sticking points.

, Turn the dial clockwise about one number higher from the first sticking point in order to allow you to ""escape"" that sticking point.

, You should find 11 more sticking points, for a total of 12 sticking points in one complete turn of the dial. Write all 12 sticking points down.

,


Look at your list of sticking points and eliminate all those which are not whole numbers (that is, cross off any number that ends in 0.5). You should eliminate 7 of the 12 numbers with this step.
Of the remaining sticking points, choose the number with the unique digit in the ""1s"" position. Four of the remaining 5 numbers will share the same number in the ""1s"" place, so for example, if the numbers left on the list are 4, 14, 24, 27, and 34, the number 27 is the only number which does not have a 4 in the ""ones"" place. This is the third number of the combination.
If you only have four numbers remaining and they all share the same digit in the ""1s"" position, check the ""note"" above in step 3 about a 2-number range... the third number of your combination will be the number that has a 2-number range (for example, if you have 0, 30, 20, 10 left, but 20 has a range of 19 to 21, that would mean that your third combination number is 20).

, Divide the third number of the combination (27 in this case) by four, and write down the remainder.


In this case 27/4 = 6 remainder 3. Remember that you are only concerned with the remainder, which will always be 0, 1, 2, or 3. If the third number of the combination is less than four, that is your magic number.
The remainder is the magic number. Write it down.

,


Add 4 to the magic number (3). Write down the result (7).
Now add 4 to that and continue adding 4 to each resulting sum until you have gone completely around the dial once. Write down each of these numbers.
For the example above, the numbers would be 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, and 39. One of these numbers is the first number of the combination. (Note: For some 800XXX locks, this will be the second number of the combination. The next set of numbers will be used as the first)

, If your magic number is 0 or 1, then add 2 to it. Otherwise, subtract 2 from the magic number.


Since the example magic number is 3, subtract 2 and get 1.
Write down the answer and add 4 to it. Now add 4 to each resulting sum until you have gone completely around the dial once.
In the example, the numbers would be 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, and 37. One of these numbers is the second number in the combination.

, In this example, since 27 is the third number, you can cross 25 and 29 off your list of possible second numbers.

, You now know all the possible first numbers (3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39), all the possible second numbers (1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 33, 37), and the third number (27). You've just narrowed down 64,000 combinations to only 80. Try every possible combination until you find the right one.

, Apply pressure on the shackle, Turn the dial counter-clockwise (CCW) slowly as you pull the shackle. Once per rotation it should stick. Look at the number when it sticks and add 5 to that value. Find the number you wrote down for the first digit (in step 9) that is nearest the sum. For example if the lock sticks at 17 when rotating CCW, you would write down 17+5=22, then look in the list above and determine that 23 is likely the first number of the combination. , You only have to clear the lock when the first or third number exceeds the second for the first time. So we would try 27-1-27, then rotate CW to 5 and CCW to 27, then CW to 9 and CCW to 27, then CW to 13 and CCW to 27, then CW to 17 and CCW to 27, then CW to 21 and CCW to 27, *now that the next number we would try is 33 which is greater than our first digit we would try 27-33-27, then CW to 37 and CCW to 27. The reason this works is the disk for the second digit isn't impacted when we rotate CCW, so we are effectively just setting the 2nd number to a bigger value. When the value gets too big then we effectively passed the first number *twice* and then picked our second digit -- which is why we have to reset when the 2nd number becomes bigger than the first.

Insert your lever into the bottom half of the lock.,

Insert your pick, bent side up, and feel for the pins.,
Find your first ""seized,"" or difficult to move, pin and push it up until it clicks.,
Find and repeat on the rest of the seized pins.,
Adjust the tension on your lever if you're having difficulty.",How to Pick a Lock with a Bobby Pin2," Stick the bent end into the bottom of the lock, keeping it as low as possible while still getting the lever as deep into the barrel as possible.








, Use your lever as if it was a key, turning the lock as if you were about to open the door. It won't move very far, but this pressure is important. You need to hold the lock throughout the entire process. It should not, however, be heavy pressure. You just want enough to slightly move it, but you shouldn't be straining against the lock at all. Remember, you still need the pins trapped in the barrel to be loose enough that they can move up and down.









If you're not sure which way the lock turns, try both directions. The wrong direction will make clicking sounds, and you'll feel it slightly grinding.

, Get a feel for the pins by moving them up and down with your pick. They will be on the top half of the keyhole. Push a few of them up, feeling them move and drop back down as you work. You'll have to jiggle your pick up and down to get around to them all, and some of them might not want to move, yet, but that's fine. For now, get a mental count of the pins and note which ones move freely and which seem stuck.









The bent end should be pointing upwards. You'll be pushing up specific pins with the end.
If the pins aren't moving at all, you likely have too much tension on your lever. Lighten up and try again., As you test all the pins, find the one that doesn't want to move. Keeping consistent pressure on the lever, gently push up the pin until it makes an audible ""CLICK."" This means you've matched up the split in the center of the pin with the barrel, and the pin will now be out of the way of the lock.









You may notice that the lever turns a little bit more once you've gotten the pin in place. This is because it has one less pin of resistance.

, Once you've gotten one of the pins out of the way, previously free pins may seize up. This is actually a good thing, as it just instructs you which pins to get next. Repeat this process until the lever can turn the lock completely and the door is opened:









Find the seized pin, the one that doesn't want to move as much.
Keep constant pressure on the lever, turning the lock as if you were opening it.
Gently push it up until it clicks in the lock.
Move on to the next pin., This is the most common stumbling block for new lock-pickers, as it is as much about feel as anything else. If you put too much tension on the lock, the pins will be too seized to move and you won't be able to get them out of the way. Too little pressure, or letting up pressure accidentally as you work, and the pins will slide back down into place and you'll have to start over. The best tip is to start with a little too much pressure, loosening it slowly as you work until the pins can move. This prevents you from losing pins and allows you to find the right tension gradually.

Rusted locks may be frozen shut no matter how skillful your lock picking technique. Investigate the overall condition of a lock before attempting to pick it.Rusty locks may be restored to pickable condition with the application of a suitable lubricant, like WD40.;
, A professional lock picking kit will contain tools like tension wrenches, picks, and raking tools.You'll also need a suitable lock lubricant, like lubricating graphite, which should be available at your local hardware store.You can use household items as substitutes for picking tools, like a bobby pin or a paperclip.
You may need to go to a specialty store, like a spy store or a locksmith, or an online seller to buy a lock picking set.
Although owning a lock picking set is legal in most regions, if caught by police with these tools on you, there may be laws that require you to prove you weren't intending on committing a crime., Knowing the uses and names of basic lock picking tools will make it easier to talk about them. This is especially important because pop culture has misrepresented some tools.The three main tools include:


A tension wrench. Also called a torque wrench, this tool is a thin piece of metal with flared ends. It is L-shaped or Z-shaped, where the diagonal line of the Z is straight. It is inserted into the plug (the part of the lock that turns) to apply tension to it.
A lock pick. These generally have a handle that narrows to a thin, pointed piece of metal that curves slightly at its end. The pick manipulates the inner parts (pins) of the lock mechanism.A rake. These are picks with many ridges. Some rakes may have a triangular point on the end or be rounded. These are scraped across the inside of the lock mechanism (pins) to disengage it., When a key is inserted into the keyway of the plug (the turning part of the lock), the wards (ridges/teeth) of the key push up spring-loaded pins.Each individual lock pin is actually made up of a set: a key pin and driver pin. When the break between each set of key and driver pins aligns with the lock turning mechanism, also called the shearline, the lock turns and opens.You won't be able to see inside the lock when picking it, so having a firm mental image of the mechanism is vital.
The number of pins varies from lock to lock. Padlocks often have 3 or 4, while door locks generally have 5 to 8.
Some locks, especially those in Europe, are situated with the pins at the bottom of the keyway instead of the top.

, Pins in the lock may be frozen from lack of use. Dirtiness can make the lock mechanism difficult to manipulate. Resolve these problems and give yourself the best chance of picking the lock by applying lock lubricant to it.









Many kinds of lock lubricant have simple spray applicators that allow you to direct lubricant into the keyway., While applying light pressure with your tension wrench to the keyway, you're going to push up pins inside the keyway with your pick, one by one. When a pin is lifted enough, the tension from the wrench will prevent it from falling and the next pin can be set. When all pins are set, the lock will open.







, Insert your tension wrench into the top or bottom of the keyway. Gently turn the wrench to apply torque (tension) to the plug. The plug will turn one way a little more than the other. This is the direction the key turns.









It's easy to apply too much force to tension wrenches. While getting the feel for picking locks, you may want to only use a single finger to apply tension to the wrench., Insert your pick into the keyway. Gently feel the outline of the pins using your pick. Single out one that is accessible. Apply light but slowly increasing pressure to the pick until you feel the springs of the pin give way. Remove the pick.








Try to hold the image of the pins in your mind. Doing so can help you keep track of solved pin positions should you have to reset the lock and begin picking afresh.
By applying increasing pressure to a single pin, you can test the resistance of the pin springs. Some may be stiffer than others and require more pressure.Generally, the inner workings of locks are relatively delicate. Always err on the side of too little force to prevent accidental lock or pick breaking.

, Insert your tension wrench into the bottom or top of the keyway. Turn the wrench with gentle pressure. Feel how the plug shifts. Release pressure on the wrench. Repeat this process a few times.








Your goal, at this point, is to get a sense of the tightness of the plug and to feel for the position where the pins bind in the lock mechanism, freezing it and stopping the plug from turning.

, Apply gentle pressure to the plug again with your tension wrench. Insert a pick into the keyway. Lightly touch the pins with your pick as you apply tension. Release tension on your wrench. Continue this process until you identify one pin that binds (resists) more than others when light tension is applied. This is the first binding pin.








When you identify the binding pin, maintain steady pressure on your tension wrench. Too much pressure will cause the lock to freeze, too little and the pins will reset., While maintaining consistent pressure with your tension wrench, lift the first binding pin with your pick little by little. Eventually, your tension wrench should turn the plug very slightly. The first pin should now be set in place. Use your pick to find the next pin that binds more than the remaining ones and similarly lift and set it. Repeat this until all pins are set.








In many common locks, pins will set either front-to-back or back-to-front. However, keep in mind that this is not always the case.
Lifting a pin slowly will allow it to set more easily. With practice this motion can become significantly more rapid, especially when paired with the later described raking technique.
Applying too much torque to your tension wrench at any point could cause the lock to freeze. In this case, you'll likely have to relieve pressure on the wrench to reset the pins and start again., When the last pin sets, the lock should fully disengage and open. You may have to apply more pressure with your tension wrench to turn the lock open. A little extra force can be applied with the pick if it's still inserted in the keyway, though you should take care not to jostle any pins or damage the pick.







, Much as you would normally, get a feel for the plug with your tension wrench. Insert your pick into the keyway and lightly feel the position of pins. Press a single pin to test pin spring stiffness.








Though the raking technique is generally faster for knowledgeable lock pickers, it operates on the principles of picking a single pin at a time, and will be easiest for those with some experience picking pins one by one.

, A normal pick or a rake can be used to perform this maneuver. Apply light, steady pressure to the plug with your tension wrench. Insert your rake-tool into the keyway slowly and smoothly. Draw the tool upwards and out of the keyway in a snap.









When drawing your rake-tool out of the keyway, the pressure applied by the tool should be on its tip only.
Your pick should be long enough so that it comes in contact with every pin in the lock while raking., Raking usually takes multiple attempts before it is successful. After raking, listen carefully to the lock when relieving pressure on your tension wrench. The sound of pins falling indicates you're using the correct pressure with your tension wrench.







, Rake the pins as described previously. While keeping pressure consistent with your tension wrench, use the tip of the tool to ""scrub"" unset pins. If the pins refuse to set, release pressure with your wrench and start again. Continue until the lock disengages and opens.








When most of the pins are set, you may need to increase the pressure on your tension wrench and lightly intensify scrubbing."

Position the rubber band over the stripped screw.,
Push the screwdriver into the screw head, over the rubber band.,
Turn the screwdriver counter-clockwise to remove the screw.",How to Use a Rubber Band to Unscrew Stripped Screws," You will want to make sure the rubber band is laying flat, over the screw top and is being held securely in place.


Make sure the rubber band you use has a wide enough band width so that the rubber completely engulfs the screw head.





;
, The rubber band will form into the previous screw indents, creating leverage for the screwdriver.


Make sure the screwdriver is pushed far enough but not too far that it breaks through the rubber band skin.







, Work slowly as even though your rubber band will provide you with a mold, the screw is still vulnerable and most likely difficult to turn.


Re-position the rubber band over the screw head as you work if necessary. The screwdriver may penetrate through the rubber band at some point, especially if you are working with an electric screwdriver. Move the rubber band over to expose material that is in tact to continue to remove the screw.

First, try using a shorter screw driver with a larger head. Apply downward pressure and slowly attempt to remove the screw.
If this doesn’t work, try using a screwdriver with a different type of head. If the screw is a philips head, try a flathead screwdriver. When using a flathead screwdriver, it must be narrow enough to fit inside the entire hole. Apply downward pressure and try to extract the screw.;
, Place your screwdriver into the head. Grab a hammer and tap the base of the screwdriver. This will lodge your screwdriver into the head, providing you with more grip. Set down the hammer and attempt to remove the screw.This method works best with soft-metal screws.

, If there is a slight gap between the surface and the head of the screw, try rotating the screw out with a pair of pliers, or vice grips. Secure the screw within the mouth of the locking pliers. Rotate the pliers and try to turn the stuck screw out.







, Select the correct drill bit and power up your electric screwdriver. Carefully drill a small, shallow hole into the head. This will allow your screwdriver to sit deeper in the head of the screw. Retrieve your screwdriver and insert it into the head. Apply downward force as you attempt to remove the screw.







, Attach a metal cutting disc to the Dremel, or small electronic rotator. Power up the tool and cut a new notch in the screw head. Grab a flathead screwdriver and put it in the newly cut slot. Rotate the screwdriver and try to remove the striped screw."

Note the recommended depth for you specific screw extractor. Don’t make the hole deeper than recommended.

, Insert the extractor into the hole you created. Lightly tap it into the screw with a hammer—make sure the extractor’s threads grip the sides of the screw before proceeding. Locate a T handle—it likely came in your extractor kit—and attach it to the top of the extractor., Keep the extractor straight while turning it counter-clockwise. Avoid applying any lateral pressure to the extractor as this can cause it to bend. Continue turning the screw until it loosens. Pull up on the extractor to bring the screw to the surface. Pull the screw from the surface with a pair of pliers.

Place the rubber band flat against the head and insert your screwdriver. Slowly turn the screw driver and attempt to remove the screw., When you can’t find a rubber band, you can substitute steel wool. Place the steel wool on top of the head. Insert your screwdriver firmly into the hole. Rotate the screwdriver slowly and try to remove the screw., Spray the screw head with a rust penetrant. Allow the rust penetrant to sit for 15 minutes. Reapply the rust penetrant. Tap the stripped head 5 to 6 times with a hammer. Retrieve your screwdriver and attempt to remove the screw. If you are unable to remove the stuck screw, apply a valve grinding compound. This product contains grit that will allow your screwdriver to grip the head. Insert your screwdriver into the head and try removing the screw.

Maximize the grip strength.,
Add material for extra grip.,
Tap the screwdriver into place with a hammer.,
Push down hard as you rotate.,
Heat the area.,
Cut a flat-head notch with a dremel or hacksaw.",How to Remove a Stripped Screw1," If you can still grip the screw head with a screwdriver, try one last time to remove it by hand. Follow these instructions first to maximize your chances:


If the screw is fastened to metal, spray on penetrating oil and let sit at least fifteen minutes.Use the largest manual screwdriver that fits your screw.
If possible, grip the screwdriver handle with a wrench to get more leverage.;
, If the screwdriver keeps slipping out of the stripped hole, cover it with a small piece of material that gives extra grip. Press this into the hold with the screwdriver and try again. Here are some options:



Wide rubber band, cut to form one band
A piece of steel wool
A piece of green abrasive from a kitchen sponge
Duct tape, with the adhesive side against the screw head

, Tap the screwdriver in gently to avoid breaking the screw head. Skip this step if you are working with a fragile object.

, Place your palm against the end of the screwdriver, with your arm directly behind it. Press directly down into the screw with your full forearm as you rotate the screwdriver.


If the tool you are using is slipping, stop using it immediately. Further slippage will only continue to wear down the screw head and make it harder to remove. Definitely be sure you are going in the correct direction for removal, which is usually--but not always--counterclockwise (""lefty loosey, righty tighty""). Pressing down hard as you are unscrewing will help prevent slippage.

, If you can heat the screw without damaging the object the screw is attached to, this will often loosen the threads. Apply a heat gun or propane torch to the screw, moving it constantly to avoid overheating. Once it is hot enough to sizzle a drop of water, let the screw cool, then try again.This works especially well if the screw has been set in place with a bonding agent.

, If your screwdriver still can't get a good grip, cut a notch into the screw head. Insert a flat-head screwdriver and attempt to turn the screw.You can combine this with any of the approaches above.

Prepare the surface by removing debris and sanding.,
Mix the wood filler if you’re using a two-part filler.,
Use a putty knife to apply the filler to the hole.,
Sand the surface after the filler has set.",How to Hide a Screw1," Remove hanging pieces of wood, flaky paint, and other debris around the screw hole. Use medium grit sandpaper (less than 100 grit) to sand away rough patches. Clear away any remaining residue using a shop vac or moistened cloth.If you use a moistened cloth, make sure the area is dry before applying wood filler.
Your screws should be slightly counterbored, or screwed just below the surface of the wood.;
, Scoop a golf ball-sized amount of filler and a tiny dab (no larger than a pea) of hardener onto a hand palette, small piece of scrap wood, or other small work surface. Use a putty knife to mix them together thoroughly.Two part fillers include a small separate container with hardener, which you mix in with the fuller. They’re preferable because they set faster and have a nice, workable texture.Use a smaller amount of filler if you’re only hiding a couple screws. Don’t increase the amount much larger than a golf ball-sized scoop, or you’ll have to work faster to use the full amount before it sets. Make smaller batches instead if necessary., Choose a blade no longer than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in width to maximize your control. Spread a small amount of filler over the screw and hole. Take care not to apply too much filler, but to spread only enough so the hole becomes flush with the surface.Spreading as little filler as possible will make the sanding process easier.

, When you’ve finished filling over the screws, let the filler set according to its instructions, which is typically about 15 to 20 minutes after mixing the filler. Use a medium grit sandpaper (around 100 grit or higher) to smooth over your work surface. Wipe or vacuum away any residue, and you’re ready to stain or paint."

Assemble your tools:


A screw extractor about 2/3 the diameter of the screw you are extracting.,
Centre punch the screw before drilling, to avoid having the bit wander.

,
Drill a 1/8"" pilot hole in the centre of the broken screw.,
Insert the extractor: Put the tip of the extractor into the hole you drilled and tap it in with a hammer.,
Continue turning the screw extractor counter-clockwise until the broken screw is free.",How to Use a Screw Extractor," You can buy screw extractors individually at a hardware store as needed, or you can buy a set of screw extractors at a hardware store or home improvement centre.
Drill bits suitable for drilling into hard metal (e.g., high speed steel, titanium coated, or tungsten carbide), to drill into the embedded screw. You will need a 1/8"" bit to drill a pilot hole, and additional bits in 1/16"" or 1/8"" increments up to the size hole recommended in the instructions that come with the screw extractor—typically 1/8"" smaller than the screw you are extracting.
A sharp, pointed centre punch made for punching into metal.
A hammer.
A T-shaped tap handle from a tap and die set.
A padded work glove (optional).
Cutting oil (optional).
Locking (preferably) or slip joint pliers (optional).;
,, Using larger drill bits, in 1/16"" or 1/8"" increments, enlarge the hole until you reach the diameter recommended to accommodate the extractor. Be careful to keep your drill centred in the screw, drilling straight down the center line toward the screw's point (see Warnings below). Drill to the depth recommended in the screw extractor's instructions, typically about 3 times the diameter of the largest bit used to make the finished hole. When using the extractor, you do not want the extractor's point to bottom out before the lands (threads) engage the sides of the hole securely.

, Then, using a tap handle (the T-shaped handle that comes with a tap and die set), twist the extractor counter-clockwise into the pilot hole. As the screw extractor tightens itself into the broken screw, the screw will slowly start to turn. Using a padded work glove will enable you to get a firmer grip on the tap handle. If you use a tool to turn the extractor, take care to turn the extractor exactly around its axis; avoid any lateral pressure on the tool, as this may unseat the extractor.

, Or, once enough of screw emerges from the surface, you may switch to locking (preferably) or slip joint pliers to continue turning the screw to complete the removal; the pliers may give you more leverage.

Get an impact driver.,
Set the impact driver to loosen screws.,
Hold the driver in place.,
Strike the end with a mallet.,
Check the driver direction.,
Repeat until the screw is loose.",How to Remove a Stripped Screw2," An impact driver is a manual tool that drives a screwdriver bit further into the screw using a weight and spring. This works well on sturdy construction, but may damage electronics or other sensitive equipment. If you're concerned about damage, avoid cheap models with a stiff spring, since these require forceful hammer blows to work.A powered impact wrench is not recommended, since the excessive force could damage the surrounding material.

, Some models have a switch. On others, you set the direction of the turn by twisting the handle.

, Fit a drill bit of the correct size to the end of your driver. Place it in the screw and hold the driver in place at a 90º angle. Grip the driver at its midpoint, keeping your hand clear of the end.


The bits that came with your impact driver are often extra-hard, which makes the process easier., Tap the end of the driver sharply with a heavy mallet. A rubber mallet helps you avoid scratching the driver.

, Some impact drivers jar out of position after each strike.Set it back to ""loosen"" if you need to.

, Once the screw comes loose, use a regular screwdriver to remove it from the hole.

Get a screw extractor.,
Punch a hole in the center of the screw head.,
Drill a hole into the screw head.,
Tap in the extractor with a brass hammer.,
Turn the extractor carefully.,
Heat the screw if it won't come out.",How to Remove a Stripped Screw3," If the screw head is worn but intact, purchase a screw extractor. A typical extractor is essentially a screwdriver bit made of extra-hard metal, reverse threaded right at the tip. This is one of the most consistent ways to remove a stripped screw, but it does require caution. If the extractor breaks off in the screw, it may require a professional to finish the job. To reduce the chance of this happening, choose an extractor no more than 75% of the diameter of the screw shank (not the head).For Torx or socket cap screws with an exposed cylindrical body, use a multi-spline extractor. This fits over the head of the screw, and engages it with splines (teeth) on the inner surface. Instead of following the instructions below, tap this type of extractor gently into place, then turn with a socket wrench.

, Place a center punch on the exact center of the screw head. Strike the end with a hammer to create a dent for your drill.


Wear eye protection to protect yourself from flying shards of metal. Keep them on throughout this process.

, Use a drill bit designed for hard metal. The screw extractor should have the drill bit size stamped somewhere on the tool. Drill slowly and stabilize it with a drill press if possible. Start with a hole ⅛ to ¼ inch (3–6 mm) deep; going too far may break the screw.It helps to start the hole with a small drill bit to give the larger one a place to grip.

, The extra-hard metal of the extractor is brittle, so an iron or steel hammer could break it. Tap it in until the extractor has a firm grip on the walls of the hole you drilled.

, If the torque is too forceful or uneven, the extractor may break, leaving you worse off than before. A tap handle that fits snugly over the head of your extractor is by far the safest way to remove the extractor and attached screw. The drilling should have loosened the screw, so you can often remove it without much force.Some extractor kits come with a nut that fits over the extractor head. Grip the nut with two wrenches about 180º from each other, for a more equal torque.

, If the screw doesn't budge or you're concerned the extractor might break, remove the extractor. Heat the screw with a torch, then drip paraffin wax or water on it to lubricate the threads. Try the extractor again once the screw has cooled.Take care not to damage the surrounding material. Even when working with metal, it's best to stick to heat guns or propane torches. Move the torch around the screw constantly to avoid heating any one spot for more than a second at a time."
"
Attach a nut to the screw with epoxy.,
Drill out the screw head.,
Hire a professional.",How to Remove a Stripped Screw4," Find a nut that fits snugly around the screw head. Bond them together using a two-part metal-to-metal epoxy, often sold as ""weld bond."" Wait for the epoxy to cure as directed on the label, then grip the nut with a socket wrench and rotate.


If you don't have a nut the right size, you can adhere a smaller nut to the top of the screw head. This will not provide as much leverage.

, Breaking the screw usually relieves pressure on the screw shaft, making it easier to pull out — but if it doesn't work, you've eliminated most other options. Choose a drill bit slightly larger than the shaft of the screw, so the head detaches completely when you drill through. Start with a center punch to make a hole in the exact center of the screw, and take care to drill directly through the center.Once the screw head breaks off, grip the screw shaft with locking pliers and rotate counter-clockwise to remove.


If the screw head isn't flat, file it down or grind it with a dremel and a pointed grinding stone attachment. Center punch and drill once you have a flat surface to work with.

, If all else fails, hire a machine shop to remove the screw using electrical discharge machining (EDM).This may be your best option if you used a screw extractor that broke off inside the screw.

Acquire your plugs.,
Make custom wood plugs.,
Test your counter bore and plug in a piece of scrap wood.,
Drill a shallow counterbore to house the plug.,
Drill a pilot hole for the screw in the center of the counterbore.,
Drive the screws to the bottom of the counterbore.,
Insert the plug into the counterbore.,
Sand the surface to hide your work.",How to Hide a Screw2," Purchase plugs that are the same material as your project’s surface. They’ll be available at a hardware or home improvement store in a variety of bit sizes.For example, use oak wood plugs if you’re attaching oak treads to a staircase and want to hide your screws.

, For custom projects, you can also make your own plugs, provided you have a drill press. Just purchase a plug cutter for your drill press that matches the counter-bore size of your screw holes.Clamp a piece of wood that matches your project to your press table, set your press to medium speed, and use steady pressure to slowly feed the plug cutter into the wood until it bottoms out the wood.To remove the cut plugs from the wood strip, first tape the cut surface so the plugs won’t roll away when you remove them. Use a bandsaw to cut through the piece of wood near its bottom, which is the side opposite the one you made your plug cuts. Once you slice through the wood, you can remove the plugs by pulling off the tape and pushing out any that don’t stick with a screwdriver.

, You’ll need to counterbore your screw holes in order to secure your plugs. It’s best to choose a piece of scrap wood and test out your counterbore bit and plugs. That way, you’ll be sure that your plugs fit well into your counterbores without ruining your project., After testing on scrap wood, drill a counterbore into the surface where you’ll be hiding the screw hole using a brad-point bit. If necessary, mark off where you’ll be driving your screw beforehand. The counterbore’s depth will depend on your needs, but should be no deeper than half the depth of your project’s topmost piece of wood.For example, if you’re attaching wood treads to a staircase that are 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thick, your counterbore should be no deeper than 1/4 inch (0.64 cm).
To help guide you, measure your bit for the proper counterbore depth and tape off the area above it.  

, Select a twist with the same diameter of your screw’s shank, and attach it to your drill. The brad-point bit that you used to counterbore will leave a small, tapered mark in the center of the bore. Place the twist in this centered mark and drill your screw’s pilot hole.Repeat this process to make bores and pilot holes for each screw you need to drive.

, After you’ve made your bores and pilot holes, drive your screws. Use a screwdriver or a drill bit with the appropriate head (most likely Phillips head) for your screws. Be sure to drive them tightly to the bottom of each counterbore., Dab a small amount of carpenter’s glue into the sides of a bore. Take a plug, whether store-bought or custom-made, and line up its face grains with the surrounding wood surface of your project. Insert the plug into the bore, and use a mallet to gently tap it into place.Use a damp rag to wipe away any glue that leaks out when you tap the plug into place.
Repeat this sequence to hide each of your screws.

, Give your glue enough time to dry according to its instructions. When it’s dry, use medium to fine grit sandpaper (at least 180 grit) to smother over your work surface and make the wood plug flush. Dry wipe or vacuum any residue to finish hiding your handiwork."

Ream the hole with a tapered diamond bur if the hole isn't large enough for you purpose when you have finished drilling through the arrowhead.
",How to Drill a Hole in an Arrowhead," Those crafted from flinty material, or lightly grained minerals are better than arrowheads of very hard materials like obsidian. The arrowhead shouldn't have cracks or very irregular surfaces where you plan to drill, as these can cause problems while drilling.
, Normal high speed drills or carbide bits will fail in this project. An industrial diamond bur is the best choice to make drilling easier with a minimal chance of breaking your arrowhead., It needs to be deep enough to hold sufficient water to completely cover your arrowhead, and flexible enough to offer give, which will help support the arrowhead when you press down with the drill.,,

Mark your arrowhead where you plan to drill it. You can use a fine point marker, since pencil or ink pen marks might disappear in the water., Guide it carefully as it begins to cut so it doesn't run, or move off the mark., Too much pressure may destroy the bur or crack the arrowhead, too little only means inefficient cutting., If your cutting bur binds, you may have to invert the arrowhead and begin a new hole from the reverse side, but it can be difficult to align your hole with the original one on the opposite side.,"

Drill a pilot hole for your screw under the curled strip of wood. Then drive your screw so it’s flush with the wood surface under the curled strip., Apply carpenter’s glue to both pieces, and use a bit more if your curled edge incurred any splits or cracks when you chiseled it.Clamp the curled edge to the surface and let it dry for about 60 minutes.Place a piece of scrap wood between your project’s surface and the clamp. Tape over the surface of the scrap piece that comes into contact with your project to avoid sticking.  

, Use medium to fine grit sandpaper to finish your project. Letting the area dry for 60 minutes should leave you with dry but slightly tacky glue. That way, when you sand it, the dust and glue will combine to fill any cracks and further hide your work."

Read the numbers.,

Interpret the first number.,

Interpret the second number.,

Read the length, which is generally given after the x.,
Understand some other nomenclature that sometimes goes with screw threads.",How to Read a Screw Thread Callout," They will look something like one of these:

#4-40 x .5
1/4-20 x 5/8
M3-0.50 x 10;
, The first number gives the major, or largest, diameter.

In Unified threads (measured in inches) there are numbered diameters #0 through #10, with 0 the smallest and 10 the largest. (Diameters #12 and #14 may also be found, but are usually on older equipment and needed for repairs or restorations. #14 is close to, but not exactly the same as, 1/4-inch.) The major diameter in Unified threads = 0.060"" + (numbered diameter) * 0.013"" . So, #2 has a major diameter of 0.086"". Equation: D = (2)*0.013 + 0.060 = 0.086. The odd numbers exist, but the even numbers are in far more common use. For screws larger than a #10, the diameters are listed in fractional inches. For instance, a 1/4-20 screw has a 1/4-inch major diameter.
For metric threads, e.g. M3.5, the number following the M is the major diameter of the external thread in millimeters.

, It relates to the distance between adjacent threads. It may be given as the number of threads per unit length, or it may be given as the distance between threads (also called the thread pitch).

For Unified threads, the number given is threads per inch. For instance, a 1/4-20 screw has 20 threads per inch.
For metric threads, the thread pitch is given in millimeters per thread. Thus, an M2 x 0.4 screw has threads every 0.4mm. Although most metric fasteners have two or more standard pitches (fine & coarse threads), the pitch is often omitted from a thread callout; it is always helpful to carry a sample with you to the hardware store.

Two major metric ""industrial standards"" are DIN Deutsches Institute für Normung (German) and the JIS Japanese Industrial Standards. Although these standards are closely related and often identical, there will be cases where say a JIS M8 bolt may not have the same pitch as a DIN M8 bolt. The American National Standard (ANSI) Metric thread is more commonly used in the USA.



, The length of most screws is measured from the bottom of the head, as shown. Note, however, that a flathead screw, designed to sit flush in a countersunk material, is measured to the top of the head.

For unified threads, the length is given in inches. A 1/4-20 x 3/4 screw is .75 inches (1.9 cm) long. The length may be given in fractional inches or the decimal equivalent.
For metric threads, the length is given in millimeters.

,


Thread classes refer to fitting how loosely or tightly the screw fits in the nut. The most common thread classes are 2A or 2B. ""A"" indicates an external thread, such as on a screw or bolt. B indicates an internal thread, such as on a nut. The 2 (or, far less commonly, 1 or 3) describes the tightness of the fit.
You may see the abbreviations UNC and UNF. These stand for unified coarse and unified fine, respectively, and they refer to standard series of thread pitch. Each series assigns a pitch to diameter. For instance, a #10 UNC screw has 24 threads per inch, whereas a #10 UNF screw has 32 threads per inch. If a thread is specified by its series, look for the pitch in a table.
Minor diameter is the smallest diameter of the thread, or the innermost diameter. Major diameter is the largest diameter of the thread, or the outermost diameter. The diameter given is typically the nominal major diameter of an external, or male, thread.

Use this method when trying to remove a Phillips head screw without the proper screwdriver.,
Try a coin.,
Use your thumbnail.,
Find a kitchen butter knife.,
Use an old CD.,
Try pliers or vice grips.,
Use a hacksaw to create a long groove in the screw, similar to a flat head screw.,
Use a flat head screwdriver.,
Try a plastic toothbrush.",How to Unscrew a Screw Without a Screwdriver1," Phillips head screws are those that have two grooves forming a cross. In some cases one of the grooves will be longer than the other; if one groove is longer, this is the groove you should use when trying to unscrew your screw because it is easier to use with a variety of improvised tools.


Phillips head screws are particularly prone to being stripped, when the corners formed by the grooves are worn. This makes it very difficult to unscrew your screw because there are no longer solid grooves in which to insert your tool. Be very careful when using these methods so as not to strip your screw.;
, Try inserting a small coin into the longer groove and seeing if it will turn the screw. Dimes and pennies are particularly useful for this method. This will usually only work for larger sized screws rather than very small ones.


Insert the coin into the larger groove and turn counterclockwise.

, Your thumbnail will only work if the screw is quite loose in the surface. Insert your nail into the longer groove and turn counterclockwise. If the screw is relatively loose then the screw should come out easily but if it is tight then this method likely will not work.

, Kitchen butter knives can be used in a very similar way to coins. Insert the end of the butter knife into the longer groove and turn counterclockwise to unscrew the screw.


If your butter knife is of low quality and strength or the screw is very tight, then you may bend your butter knife rather than unscrewing the screw. Be aware of this potential damage., Insert the edge of an old CD into the longer groove and turn counterclockwise. This can damage and/or break the CD so make sure to use an old one that you don’t mind damaging.


If the screw is very tight then this method might not work very well.

, This will only work if the head of the screw is somewhat raised above the surrounding surface. Use the pliers or vice grips to grab the sides of the screw head and turn the screw counterclockwise to twist it out.


Needle nose pliers may work better than regular pliers.

, If your screw head is raised above the surface, you can use a hacksaw to create a groove similar to that of a flat head screw. Hold the hacksaw vertically and slowly cut the end of the screw to create a groove.


Make sure you do not cut the surface of the wood or whatever the screw is fastened to.
Remove the screw as you would a flat head screw, such as with a flat head screwdriver or another flat object such as a credit card., If you can't find your Phillips head screwdriver but can find a flat head screwdriver, try using a flat head that is about the same length as the longer groove in the Phillips head screw. Insert the flat head into the longer groove and turn counterclockwise to unscrew.


This will not work with smaller screws, but it should be fine for normal size and larger screws.
Be careful not to damage your screw because there will now be less surface area in contact with the screw head., Take a plastic toothbrush and lightly melt the end using a lighter or other source of heat. Once the plastic is soft you can insert it in the head of the screw and allow the plastic to harden once more. Once it is hard try to turn the screw counterclockwise to unscrew it.


This will usually only work with screws that are not too tight and relatively easy to turn.
Be very careful when using the lighter to avoid accidents and make sure to melt the toothbrush slowly so you can monitor the melting and prevent a mess from the melting plastic.

Choose a strong bar magnet.,
Wipe the screwdriver clean.,
Slide the magnet from the handle to the tip.,
Repeat this motion in the same direction.,
Rotate and repeat.,
Test the screwdriver.",How to Magnetize a Screwdriver1," The stronger the magnet, the easier it will be to magnetize the screwdriver. Ideally, find a neodymium magnet or other rare-earth magnet with a pull force of at least ¼ pound.These are available at hardware stores or online.


If you don't mind destroying an old hard drive, you can disassemble it to get two strong magnets.;
, Remove any grime from the screwdriver. If you need to use a damp cloth, dry the tool thoroughly afterward., Touch one end of the magnet to the metal surface of the screwdriver, next to the handle. Drag it down to the tip. This causes small magnetic regions (domains) in the steel to align in the direction of the magnet's field.On a large screwdriver, magnetize the half closest to the tip instead of the whole tool.

, Take the magnet off the screwdriver, then drag it from the handle to the tip again. Repeat this several times, using the same end of the magnet each time.


Do not drag the magnet back from the tip to the handle. This will undo your work.

, Rotate the screwdriver by a quarter turn. Drag the magnet from handle to tip again several times. Repeat with the third and fourth sides of the screwdriver.

, If the screwdriver can't pick up a screw magnetically, repeat the process. If it still doesn't work after ten passes on each side, try again with a stronger magnet.


A hard steel screwdriver can stay magnetized for months. If you'd like to demagnetize it, run the magnet back the other way (tip to handle), or whack the screwdriver against the wall a few times to scramble its magnetic domains again."

Use this method to remove a flat head screw without a screwdriver.,
Use a card.,
Try the tab from a can of soda.,
Try a coin.,
Use your thumbnail.,
Find a kitchen butter knife.,
Try pliers or vice grips.",How to Unscrew a Screw Without a Screwdriver2," A flat head screw has one groove across the head of the screw only. If you do not have a flat head screwdriver then you can usually use any kind of flat surface to unscrew the screw.

, Try using a card such as a plastic credit card to turn the screw. Insert the edge of the card into the long groove and turn counterclockwise to unscrew the screw. Make sure the card is strong and old as it could be damaged in the process.

, Remove the tab from a can of soda and insert into the groove on the head of the flat head screw. Turn the head counterclockwise to unscrew the screw.

, Try inserting a small coin into the groove and turning counterclockwise to unscrew. Dimes and pennies are particularly useful for this method but larger coins will be easier to turn if they fit in the groove.

, Your thumbnail will only work if the screw is quite loose in the surface. Insert your nail into the groove and turn counterclockwise. If the screw is relatively loose then the screw should come out easily but if it is tight then this method likely will not work.

, Kitchen butter knives can be used in a very similar way to coins. Insert the end of the butter knife into the groove and turn counterclockwise to unscrew the screw.


If your butter knife is of low quality and strength or the screw is very tight, then you may bend your butter knife rather than unscrewing the screw. Be aware of this potential damage.

, This will only work if the head of the screw is raised above the surrounding surface somewhat. Use the pliers or vice grips to grab the sides of the screw head and turn the screw counterclockwise to twist it out.


Needle nose pliers may work better than regular pliers.

Use this method if you have a torx screw.,
Use a small flat head screwdriver.,
Break out the pin on security torx screws.,
Drill a small hole in the tip of your torx driver.,
Try a plastic toothbrush.",How to Unscrew a Screw Without a Screwdriver3," Torx screws have a star-shaped pattern on the head and are very popular screws for all purposes. Security torx screws will have a nub in the middle of the screw head that needs to be accounted for.


Torx screws can be easy to damage so be very careful when using an alternative tool to unscrew these screws.

, Insert the flat head screwdriver between two opposite edges of the screw head. Turn counterclockwise to remove the screw. Make sure you turn slowly so as not to damage the head.


For security torx screws you will need to insert the flat head in against one of the outer grooves and the center nub of the head. This works much the same as non-security torx screws.
Security torx screws will usually turn the opposite direction, so you should turn clockwise to remove them.

, If you have a normal torx screwdriver but not a security version then you can simply remove the center pin out of the screw head. Take a hammer and a punch or other chisel-like tool and line up the chisel at the bottom of the pin. Gently tap on the top of the chisel to remove the center pin., If you have a security torx screw and wish to remove using a non-security torx driver or drill bit then you can drill a small hole in the drill bit. This way it has a small hole to accommodate the center pin on your security torx screw.

, Take a plastic toothbrush and lightly melt the end using a lighter or other source of heat. Once the plastic is soft you can insert it in the head of the screw and allow the plastic to harden once more. Once it is hard try to turn the screw counterclockwise to unscrew it.

Use this method for removing very tiny screws without a screwdriver.,
Try the tip of a knife.,
Use a metal nail file.,
Use the tip of pointy little scissors.,
Try the tip of tweezers.",How to Unscrew a Screw Without a Screwdriver4," Very tiny screws are particularly difficult to remove without the proper tools. They are often found on electronics devices. If you can, use an eyeglass repair kit to remove your screws, which will have the necessary tiny screwdrivers.


If you cannot find or use an eyeglass repair kit then you can try one of these methods.
Eyeglass repair kits are very cheap and easy to find.

, Use the pointed tip of a knife to turn tiny screws counterclockwise. Insert the knife tip into the groove; if you can, try inserting the knife tip at a slight angle to provide more contact surface area between the knife and the screw.

, Use the tip of a metal nail file to insert into the groove on the top of the screw head. Turn the screw counterclockwise, being careful not to damage the head.

, Insert the tip of very pointy scissors into one of the grooves on the screw head. Turn the screw counterclockwise.


Blunt scissors will not work well for opening very small screws.

, Insert the pointy tip of tweezers into the groove on the screw head and turn counterclockwise. The tip of tweezers must be pointy to be inserted into the groove properly.

Check the fuel cap.,
Activate the chain brake.,
Remove the bar cover.,
Press the decompression valve, if applicable.,
Pump the primer valve, if your saw has one.,
Set the master control to the cold start setting.",How to Start a Stihl Chainsaw1," If you have a gas-powered chainsaw, it will need to be fueled up before using it. Before starting it, you should make sure that the fuel cap is securely fastened, and that there are no drips or pools of fuel on the outside of the chainsaw.If you see any fuel on the outer parts of the chainsaw, carefully wipe it away.
Always start your chainsaw well away from fuel sources.;
, On a gas-powered Stihl chainsaw, the chain brake is located just in front of the handlebar. All you have to do to activate it is push it forward. This will keep the chain locked as a safety precaution while you are starting the chainsaw, and until you are ready to use the tool., Your chainsaw may be equipped with a sheath or cover that goes over the chain and bar. If so, remove it before starting the chainsaw. That way, your tool will be ready to use once you start it., Typically, only professional-grade Stihl chainsaws have a decompression valve, so if you have a home or consumer-grade model, you will skip this step. If you have a professional saw, simply press the valve down (it will be located on the top of the chainsaw, near the starter rope)., Many Stihl models have a primer valve located on the side of the tool, near the handlebar. If yours has one, simply push it down several times. Don’t worry about the number of times you press the valve.-Several pushes won’t flood the engine, only circulate the fuel., Press and hold the throttle trigger lockout (located on the side of the chainsaw, above the trigger) with your thumb, then move the master control (on the left of the rear of the chainsaw) down as far as it will go. This is the position you should start the chainsaw in the first time you use it each session.If you have recently used the chainsaw, turned it off for a few minutes, and are ready to use it again, set the master control to the warm start setting before beginning. This is located one notch up from the lowest setting.

Strip the insulation from both ends of a piece of wire.,
Coil the wire around the screwdriver.,
Attach the wires to a household battery.,
Disconnect the battery.",How to Magnetize a Screwdriver2," Cut off a piece of wire at least 3 ft. (0.9m) long, then strip about an inch (2.5 cm) of insulation off each end.


Thin wire can overheat, while thick wire will be less effective. Try 16–22 AWG (1.3–0.6mm diameter) wire.Thinner insulation enables stronger magnetization. Enamel-coated wire gives the best results.To strip the enamel off the ends, rub the wire with 220-grit sandpaper., Wrap the wire tight around the screwdriver shaft ten to twenty times. You can double back for a second layer if the screwdriver is too short, but don't reverse the direction of the loop. (For example, you can move left—right—left along the screwdriver, but make sure to wind every loop clockwise.) Tape the wire in place if necessary.

, Attach the wire ends to the terminals of a 6V or 9V battery. The current flowing through the coils will create a magnetic field, which in turn magnetizes the screwdriver.


Using higher voltage batteries is not recommended unless you have experience handling them safely. Anything more powerful than a 9 volt battery only needs to be connected for a split second to magnetize the screwdriver.Wear insulated gloves to protect from shocks and sparks.

, The screwdriver will always be magnetic while connected to the battery, but the wire and battery terminals will heat up quickly.Disconnect the battery after 30 to 60 seconds, then try to pick up a screw with the screwdriver. In most cases, it will still be magnetic.


If the screwdriver loses its magnetism after the battery is disconnected, wrap a few more loops of wire and try again.

Decide whether an electric, battery operated, gasoline, or hydraulic chainsaw is the right one for your needs.,
Decide on the size and chain configuration you will need.,
Every brand has unique features and characteristics.,
Find out what your local dealers can sell and service.,
Ask friends and neighbors who use a chainsaw what they think of the available brands.,
Choose specific features that are important to you.,
Consider the weight of the chainsaw.,
Decide on new or used.,
Look in the phone book, or visit stores with a hardware section to see what they offer.

,
Compare prices.,
Check online sales sites for used chainsaws.,
Remember, buying a saw is only the first step.,
Consider buying an extra chain, since a chain can become dull or break during use, causing you to lose time.

",How to Buy a Chainsaw," To help you work this out, here are some of the key features of each type of saw:



Electric chainsaws: These are lighter, don't require fuel, do not require cranking, and are cleaner than gasoline saws. They do, however, have limits as to how large a log they can cut, and require access to electric power to operate.

Battery operated chainsaws: These do not require close access to electrical outlets, but have limited run time and significantly less power than other types. They are best for light trimming or cutting small branches.

Gasoline chainsaws: These have the most power. They range from 27cc's to over 150, suitable for cutting anything from small branches to large trees. They can be temperamental and will require you to mix fuel.

Hydraulic chainsaws: These are used for clearing limbs from power lines and even cutting underwater, but generally, they are niche tools, and since they require a remote motor to provide hydraulic power, they are not suitable for most users.;
, Small jobs can be done with 12 inch (30cm) bars, and either the battery, electric, or gasoline saw, so the choice is yours which to buy.

, Homelite and Poulan saws, for example, are inexpensive, and work well for most small projects. They may not hold up as well for serious cutting jobs though, in which case, spending more money on a Husqvarna, Stihl, Echo, or Jonsered saw is a better investment.

, No matter what brand you choose, you will eventually need parts and service, so buying a chainsaw that offers locally provided servicing and parts is a good choice.

, Nothing beats experienced advice when making a choice.

, Here are some examples:


What kind of blade does the chainsaw have? There are straight blades, bow blades, different cutter size chains, and special chains for ripping, carving, and other jobs.
Select the safety features you think are important. Most chainsaws have chain brakes; however, if you buy a used chainsaw, this feature may not be available on your model. Anti- kickback bars are another feature you may want. Spark arrest mufflers and tip guards are also common on modern chainsaws.

, A diminutive person wouldn't really want to handle a 165cc Stihl chainsaw with a 36"" blade. These weigh in at over 45 pounds.

, New chainsaws have the advantage of a manufacturer's warranty, but used chainsaws can be less than half the cost. Check what you can of the seller's background if buying the chainsaw used, such as looking at auction site feedback.

,, Look for sales, promotions, and other things that effect the price of the chainsaw.

, eBay and Craigslist often have listings for used (and sometimes new) saws. Be aware you won't be able to test run a chainsaw bought and shipped to your location. You might ask ahead if returns are appropriate should the chainsaw prove unworkable for your needs.

, You will need fuel (or extension cords), chain lubricant, tools to sharpen and adjust the chain, and safety gear to wear while operating the tool.

Set your chainsaw on the ground in a clear, flat area.,
Hold the chainsaw down with your foot and hand.,
Pull the starter rope.,
Set the chainsaw to open the “choke”.,
Pull the starter rope again.,
Move the master control to the idle setting.,
Lift the chainsaw up.",How to Start a Stihl Chainsaw2," Stihl recommends starting your chainsaw from a sitting position. Set the tool on level ground, and make sure there is nothing touching or immediately below or in front of the bar and chain.Never “drop” start or “throw” start your chainsaw. These are dangerous positions that do not allow you to control your tool.

, Slip the toe of your right foot into the rear handle opening. At the same time, press down on front handle with your left hand, wrapping your thumb and fingers around it and locking your elbow. This will secure the chainsaw as you start it., Grip the handle of the starter rope with your right hand. Slowly pull vertically until you feel some resistance. Then, pull the starter rope quickly several times until the chainsaw fires.Only grasp the starter rope handle. Never wrap the rope around your hand or grasp the rope itself.

, The chainsaw will fire, but then immediately die again. When this happens, move the master control up one position to the half throttle (warm start) setting. If you recently used your chainsaw, the master control should already be at the warm start setting.

, Using the same technique as before, grasp the starter rope handle again and pull vertically. You will hear the engine of your chainsaw fire again., Once the chainsaw has started and stays running, move the master control up one notch. Just a slight touch of your finger should do it. This will keep the chainsaw running., Check your surroundings one more time to make sure there are no people or objects in your way. Slowly get up, holding the chainsaw by the handlebar. Then release the chain brake by pulling it back toward you. Your chainsaw is now ready to use."
"
Make sure you have secure footing.,
Position the rear handle of the chainsaw against your leg.,
Hold the chainsaw securely.",How to Start a Stihl Chainsaw3," If you must start your chainsaw on uneven ground, Stihl recommends an alternate technique for safety reasons. First of all, use your foot to clear any debris away from your site, and make a small impression in the ground you can use to support your foot., Brace the handle against your body, just above the knee. This will give you greater control over the chainsaw., Keep your left hand on the chainsaw’s handlebar, and lock your elbow. Use your right hand to start the chainsaw, then follow the same directions for pulling the starter rope and starting your tool as you would when beginning from a sitting position."
"
Connect to a power supply.,
Find secure, balanced footing.,
Pull the hand guard toward handle.,
Press the trigger switch lockout.,
Squeeze the trigger.This will be located on the underside of the handle.",How to Start a Stihl Chainsaw4," The power supply you connect your chainsaw to must be of the same voltage. Check your chainsaw’s manual for information if you are not sure about your model’s specifications.Use an extension cord if necessary.

, You can start an electric chainsaw from a seated or standing position as necessary. As you would for a gas-powered chainsaw, check and make sure that the surrounding area is free from people and obstructions. Your body should feel balanced before you begin., The hand guard will be located just in front of the handlebar. Pull it toward you (and the back of the chainsaw) until it clicks. This is a safety feature designed to protect you as you operate the chainsaw, which will not start until the guard is engaged., This is located just above the trigger, on the side of the handle. Use your thumb to depress the switch, and make sure to keep holding it down fully., Use just your index finger to pull the trigger up, but grasp it firmly. Keep holding the lockout. Your chainsaw is now ready to use."

Rent or buy the portable bandsaw best suited for your needs.,

Familiarize yourself with the tool.,

Use the two handles, one located on each end of the saw to hold the tool while it is operated.,

Read the operator's manual and become familiar with unique characteristics of your choice of saws, and especially the safety recommendations from the manufacturer.,

Dress appropriately for using this tool.,
Support loose material when cutting.,
Mark the stock you are cutting at the correct angle for your needs.,

Place the sawblade against the stock to be cut, making sure the blade is parallel to the cut line you have marked, and perpendicular to the stock (if the cut is to be square, or 90 degrees).,
Start the saw by squeezing the trigger and allow the saw to cut its way through the stock you are cutting.,
Watch the blade to make sure it is aligned with your cut mark, and slow the cut when you are nearly through the stock so you can anticipate the blade binding if the material flexes or bends suddenly.,
Release the trigger and allow the blade to quit moving before setting the saw down after the cut is complete.",How to Use a Portable Bandsaw," Commercial or Industrial Grade tools are expensive and often somewhat heavier than handyman or homeowner's grades, and most portable bandsaws fall in the former category. Here are some options you may find on portable bandsaws:

Capacity. Since the stock or material you are cutting must fit in the throat of the machine, choosing one with sufficient capacity is essential. Large capacity portable bandsaws can cut pipe or angle stock up to about 6 inches (15.2 cm), whereas standard machines are limited to about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of diameter or width.
Power source. If you are working in the field where electrical cords are not practical, you may choose to purchase a battery powered saw. These, however, are more expensive than the typical A.C. voltage saws, and have limited cutting times between battery recharging.
Brand choice. Most name-brands offer similar features and torque, and use a common blade length. Common brands include Porter Cable, Milwaukee, Ridgid, and DeWalt, and are available at builder's supply centers and tool retailers. Discount retailers offer off-brand tools which serve the same purpose, but may be of lower quality than the previous brands, at much lower prices. Be aware that with power tools, as with many consumer products, you will probably get what you pay for.;
, Portable bandsaws use a trigger switch similar to drills and circular saws, but usually are equipped with a separate speed selector so the sawblade moves at a speed suitable for the material you are cutting., This will allow you to guide the tool, while maintaining complete control of it. Other notable components your should be familiar with are these:





 The tracking adjustment screw on this model saw.

Tracking adjustment. This feature allows you to adjust the path the bandsaw's blade travels as it revolves around the rear drive pulley and the forward idler pulley. Because the front pulley floats on a spring tension hub assembly, it must be adjusted so the alignment cause the blade to travel positioned correctly on these two pulleys.




 The tension control lever, which is turned to release tension when installing a new blade.

Tension release handle. This handle, located on the forward end of the saw, is released to allow the operator to quickly and easily change the bandsaw blade if it becomes dull or is not suitable for the task at hand.
Guide rollers. These roller bearing assemblies support the blade as it is engaged in cutting your material so it doesn't deflect or bind. Because the bandsaw blade is made of a thin, flexible metal, these rollers must rotate freely and be positioned correctly to prevent the blade from binding or warping during the cut.
Cutting shoe. This is a flat, notched metal guide which will support the saw to offset the drag of the blades teeth as they cut the stock. This helps to insure the metal being sawn will not be dragged into the rear drive pulley while you are cutting.

, Bandsaws operate with an exposed blade capable of cutting through almost any common metal from soft copper to cast iron and steel, and will cut fingers with no discretion. This is one reason why the operator should keep both hands on the provided handles (located on the back of the saw, away from the blade)., Safety glasses and gloves are very important, but also keep in mind that loose jewelry or clothing can easily get caught in the moving blade., Using a vice or having a helper to hold a round pipe or bar will prevent it from spinning in response to the blade biting into it during a cut. Metal which bends during the cut can bind the blade causing the operator to lose control of his saw, and heavy items can drop on the operator's feet when they fall free., Mark pipe around the diameter so the finished cut will be true., Keep the shoe of the saw firmly against the stock., Do not force the saw or apply excessive pressure, as the saw's teeth are able to remove only a certain amount of material with each pass. Rocking the saw when cutting very thick, solid pieces of stock may allow the metal chips to clear the saw's kerf, but usually, holding the saw steady in relation to the cut is the best method., Check the free end of the stock to make sure there is nothing in the way of it when it drops off., Set the saw on a clean, level surface when the cut is finished, to insure it does not fall and become damaged, or get dirt or debris in the pulley assemblies."

For a novice, a bar type blade is more practical than a bow blade, so this article will discuss the bar blade. The bar needs to be at least one third longer than the diameter of the tree or log you are cutting.
Usually, the horsepower or displacement of the engine is relative to the length of your bar, and is matched at the factory. A well-tuned engine and sharp blade will allow you to cut quickly, easily and accurately, resulting in safer conditions.
A small person doing a light trimming job may find an electric chainsaw is better suited for their task, but for purposes of brevity, this article will focus on gasoline saws.

, It is critical to have room to do your job safely. This means watching for overhead power lines and obstructions, nearby cars and buildings, and escape room from falling trees or limbs for the saw operator.

, Each of these type cuts have considerations and cautions which need to be addressed. Falling a tree on a power line will always be disastrous. Falling on a friend or neighbor's car or house will at least lead to hard feelings. Again, for brevity, it is not practical to describe all these situations in detail.


Felling: This is the act of cutting down a tree.
Limbing: This is removing limbs from the tree before or after it is felled.
Trimming: (when using a chain saw) This refers to cutting limbs back or taking off branches on a limb. (if you are not using a chain saw, this could be as simple as shaping a bush-for brevity, not discussed here)
Bucking: This is cutting the ""log"" or trunk of the tree in usable pieces, for instance, fireplace lengths.

, If you are preparing to start the saw, you have already selected a saw that is suitable for your project and build.

, Because chainsaws are two cycle engines, they do not have a lubricating oil supply, and they will burn up quickly if the correct fuel is not used.

, Ensure that the chain is on properly, has the tension adjusted appropriately, and cannot rotate when the chain brake is engaged. Check that the air filter is properly installed and that the faceplate and bar nuts are on firmly.

, The caps may be labeled, and often the larger cap will be for fuel, and the smaller for bar lubricant. Fill the bar lube tank, check both caps to ensure that they are tightly installed, and place the saw on a flat surface. This is especially important for cranking very large saws, since the blade will commence turning as soon as the saw starts and revs up.

, If your saw is equipped with a choke lever, place it in the choke position. This causes the carburetor to suck fuel into the combustion chamber more quickly. Engage the chain brake. Switch the saw to ""on"", this will either be a toggle, rocker, or plunger type switch, depending on model. Pull the starter rope sharply, until the engine ""fires"". If the engine fires but does not start, push the choke in half way and try again. Usually in a well tuned saw, it will take no more than 4 or 5 pulls to get the saw running.

, Hopefully, you have selected a practice piece of wood or chosen a limb or log in an easy place to cut. Bring the blade in line with the cut you are going to make, disengage the chain brake, squeeze the throttle fully open, and lay the blade against the wood. Do not force the blade, it will draw into the cut with just the weight of the blade, or moderate pressure. Keep the saw running full throttle throughout the cut, easing the throttle off only as you are about to exit the cut on the other side of the log.

, Have a sledge hammer and wedge, a spitting maul, or at least an axe and wood wedge in case the limb you are cutting wedges your bar and you cannot free it.

, Often it is a good idea to drain out the fuel and oil before storing since these may leak out and are flammable materials. The engine can be run one last time to empty the carburetor after you drain the fuel tank, this will keep the remaining fuel from gumming up the fuel system over long term storage.

, A case is the best bet, but if you don't have one, buy a ""bar cover"" to protect both you and your saw.

Decide the type and size of the machine you need.,

Set your saw up.,

Select the correct blade for your cutting project.,
Make sure your saw is unplugged when performing the following steps.,

Adjust the bandsaw's blade tension according to the manufacturer's instructions.,

Check the tracking of your blade.,

Set up the blade guides.,

Adjust the saw's table.,

Set miter guides if you are using them to make a straight cut.,

Mark out your cut on the wood stock you are using.,

Check all the necessary clearances for your cut.,
Make your cut.",How to Use a Bench Top Bandsaw," Bench-top bandsaws are usually a bit smaller than their larger stand mounted cousins. Here are some things to consider:
Capacity. There are two measurements for your bandsaw's capacity, one describes the width of cut it is capable of making, the other is the thickness of the material which can be cut with it. A typical bench-top bandsaw will make a cut about 9 or 10 inches (22.9 or 25.4 cm) in width, and will cut through material about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) thick.
Cutting speed. Variable speed bandsaws have a little more flexibility than single speed machines, but cost more. For practical purposes, a single speed saw will work for most wood-cutting projects.
Blade length. Although the length of the blade doesn't effect the cut itself, you will want to select a saw that uses a common size blade available with different teeth types and blade widths.
Table features. This refers to the table of the saw itself. Tables made from heavy, durable materials like cast aluminum or cast iron with milled guides for miter attachments and a tilting capability provide more versatility than fixed, plain tables.
Ease of use. Make sure that no special tools or complicated procedures are required for setting up your saw, changing the blades, or servicing it.
Safety. Choose a machine which is double-insulated or has a grounding plug, and provides good visibility around the cutting area. A lock out switch will make it difficult for children to turn the saw on if they have unsupervised access to it.
Power requirements. Most tools of this sort operate on the standard household electrical voltage of the country they are purchased in. Larger, commercial/industrial machines may require 3 phase power not available to a typical homeowner.;
, Read all the manufacturer's instructions and safety information prior to assembling a new bandsaw. Set the machine up at a comfortable working height, often just above waist-high for the operator. Make sure a sufficient source of light is available. Bench-top bandsaws should be fastened to the bench to prevent the machine from overturning, and new machines should come with fasteners for this purpose., There are two criteria for this selection, blade width and teeth per inch (TPI). Here are examples of each:
Blade width. This is the physical width of the blade itself. Narrower blades will allow a shorter turning radius for intricate scrollwork. Wider blades tend to be more durable, since they allow for less flex and dissipate heat more efficiently.

1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) blades are the narrowest standard blade configuration, for cutting the smallest arc possible.

1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) blades. These are a narrow blade for cutting a small circle or arc.

5⁄16 inch (0.8 cm) blades are a mid-width or general purpose blade. They can make a radius cut of about 3 inches (7.6 cm), depending on the hardness and thickness of the lumber, and are a bit more durable than the narrower, 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) blade.

3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) blades are not suitable for sharp curves. They will give very good results on straight and mitered cuts, and will usually stay sharp longer than the narrower blades.


TPI. The number of teeth per inch will determine the effect of the cut on the material you are cutting. A high TPI count will create a smoother cut, but cut at a slower rate, a lower TPI count will cut more quickly, but make a rougher cut.
16 TPI blades have very small teeth, and usually very little set, or angled offset in each tooth. They are usually used for cutting very thin material, less than one half inch thick, at slower feed rates.
12 TPI blades are for fine, smooth cuts in wood up to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick were a smooth finished cut is needed.
8 TPI blades are about the same as a general purpose handsaw blade, and will provide a smooth cut at a faster feed rate in wood up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) or more thick.
Skiptooth, variable tooth, and hook tooth blades are also available for specialized cutting purposes.


One other blade specification to consider is the blade's thickness. The smaller the bandsaw's wheels (the pulley-like rollers that hold and drive the blade), the thinner the blade will need to be, since it is continuously bending as it rolls around these components.

, Simply turning the saw off is not a safe alternative, since it is possible the switch could be bumped while you work on the machine., Most bandsaws have a tension adjustment screw or knob on the upper, rear portion of the machine. Your blade should be tight enough it doesn't slip or deflect when cutting, but running a blade too tight can damage your saw. A normal test of blade tightness is to raise the blade guide to maximum height, and press against the blade sideways. It should move about 1/8 of an inch with a few pounds of force applied in this manner. Again, refer to the manufacturer's instructions for your machine's specific information., For this step, you will need to open the cover on the upper wheel assembly, usually held shut with clamps or knob screws. Turn the upper wheel by hand and observe the blade's position on the wheel. It should run in the center of the wheel without wobble or deviation for 10-20 complete revolutions. Turn the tracking adjustment knob to correct the blade position on the wheel if it does not. Close all access panels when this step is complete., Most, if not all, benchtop bandsaws have a movable blade guide extending down from the upper wheel housing. There is usually a thumb knob or lever which locks/unlocks this device to allow it to be changed quickly and easily. You will want the blade guide to be fairly close to the surface of the wood stock you are cutting, but not so close it could bind or jam your wood. Allow at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of clearance from the thickest part of the stock, and lock the guide in position., For a square cut, one that is perpendicular to the work table, use a block square or a square piece of stock to visually check the blade alignment. If your saw has been preset to zero on a scaled angle indicator, use the zero or 90 degree mark to facilitate this step., Miter guides will hold your work stock in alignment between ninety and forty five degrees while cutting straight lines, if your saw is equipped with them., Make clear, easily distinguished lines, using either a soft lead pencil or a marker suitable for this purpose. Do not use an ink marker on wood that is to be naturally finished or stained with a transparent or translucent stain!, You do not want to be halfway through the cut only to find out the workpiece will not turn or feed though completely. It is now time to plug your saw in., Turn on the saw, allow it to come up to speed, and note that the blade is traveling in a straight, true line. If there is any observable wobble or deflection in the blade, stop and recheck the assembly for proper adjustment! Keep your fingers as far as possible from the bandsaw's blade, and feed the stock so that the blade follows the cutting mark you have made."

Slide the lock pick (your first hairpin) into the lock just above the lever.,
Feel around for a stuck or “seized” pin.,
Work the seized pin until you hear a click.,
Work the other pins the same way.,
Turn the lever to open the lock.",How to Pick Locks on Doorknobs1," Be careful not to bend the pin too far and risk cracking the metal. You don’t want to end up with two separate pieces. Your hair pin should be in the shape of an “L” at this point. 





;
, You can usually bite these off with your teeth. You can also remove them by gripping them with a pair of pliers and pulling them off, or by scraping them away with a butter knife., This can be done by inserting the end into the lock itself and then bending the pin to one side. This should give you a tiny bend at the end about an inch long. Avoid over bending it. This is not a ninety-degree bend like the last one., At this point you should have your pin in an “L” shape with the tip of the flat end bent downwards slightly. Take the other end and fold it in half over itself so that you have a small “V” shape (about twenty degree angle) that can act like a handle.

, You’ll need one more hairpin that will be inserted into the lock to help you turn it., Don’t unfold the hairpin like you did the last one. Instead, use a pair of pliers to bend the closed end of the hairpin about seventy-degrees. You can also try the same method you used for the first hairpin. Stick the end into the lock and then pull down until the hairpin is bent.

, The lever is going to act as a guide for your lock pick as well as allow you to turn the lock once the pins are all pushed into place. The open end will act as a handle, allowing you to turn the lever and apply pressure to the pins inside the lock. 







, Turn the lever softly but firmly in the same direction you would turn your key to unlock the door. The lock will catch on the pins and you’ll feel some resistance. Keep this pressure on the barrel while you begin picking the lock.







, The end that is arced should be pointed upward so that the tip of the pick can work at pushing the lock pins up.








, Keeping pressure on the lock with your lever, start to push your lock pick forward, using an up and down motion to feel past the pins. Some of the pins may move up and down fairly easily. Push by them until you find a “seized” pin. This one will be much harder to move.







, Work your lock pick up and down on the seized pin until you hear it click into place with the barrel. This is the sound of the barrel moving slightly to the side which separates the break in the pin and keeps it from securing the lock.







, Once you’ve taken care of one pin another will become stuck or seized. Find that one and start to work it in the same way.








Remember to keep pressure on the lever.
Work the pick in an up and down motion.Trust how the pins feel on the pick and allow it to direct your movements.

, Once you feel like you’ve dealt with all of the pins, put more pressure on your lever and the lock should open.








If the lock does not open you may have pushed one of the pins up too high. You can try to remedy this by easing up on some of the pressure on your lever. This may allow that pin to fall back down, but it could also allow other pins to fall and cause you to have to start over."

Kits are available for most lock brands and come equipped to do multiple locks, but frequently work for only locks of the same brand.
Some kits include only lock pins, while others include special tools (cylinder follower, ring remover, plug follower) to remove the lock cylinder so you can replace the lock pins.
You can order extra pins if you have more locks to rekey than the kit has pins for.;
, Door knobs are held in place with a clip accessed by inserting a wire into a tiny hole. Your rekeying kit may include a wire tool for this purpose, or you can unbend a paper clip and insert it.

, Using a cylinder follower (a small brass tube), push the cylinder through the assembly to remove the sleeve covering it and then remove the cylinder.

, Use a wrench-like ring remover to remove the retaining ring from the lock cylinder. Put the retainer ring somewhere you'll find it later when reassembling the lock.

, Insert the key for the current lock into the cylinder and turn it to separate the upper and lower lock pins. Push the plug follower through the cylinder, using constant pressure to remove the plug.


Keeping constant pressure will keep the upper lock pins and their retaining springs in place when you remove the cylinder plug. If you should let the springs fall out, you can still pick them up and reinsert them.

, The lower lock pins are roughly bullet-shaped, with the pointed ends touching the key, and of varying lengths.

, This will push the springs out of the way and serve as a partial guide for the new lock pins.

, The new pins should be color-coded or coded numerically to match a chart showing which pin goes where in the lock. You'll need either a tweezers or small needle-nosed pliers to grip the pins and insert them. The new pins should align with the key when it is inserted in the lock.


If the pins are not coded, you'll have to use trial and error, inserting and withdrawing the key to make sure it fits the lock with the new pins installed.

, Replace the cylinder plug and retaining ring, then replace the cylinder in the doorknob or lock face and reattach it to the door. Test the re-keyed lock to make sure it locks and unlocks with the new key.

, Slide the handle portion of the key into the lock until it reaches the broken segment. You will want to see where the large groove on the side of the key is located. This is the best spot to insert your extractor tool.

, Key extractor tools are generally sold in a set with a variety of different key hooks and spiral extractors. You can buy them online or at any hardware store. The key hooks look like miniature harpoons, with long, thin rods and can have a variety of hook shapes on the end. Spiral extractors are thin, bendable metal rods with tiny hooks all along the length. While any of the tools might work for a number of different keys, it may take some trial and error to find the tool that best fits your lock and grips your key fragment.


Start with the small hook tool. The small hooks on extractor tools can usually grab the majority of key types and shapes.

, The hook should be facing upward to easily hook the teeth of the key. Direct the tool so that it slides in along the groove on the side of the key.

, Once the extractor tool is in the lock, turn the tool toward the key slightly. Then pull the tool back while pressing the handle end away from the lock. This will press the hook against the key and help slide it out of the lock. Keep trying until the hook on the tool catches one of the teeth and you are able to pull the partial key free.If using spiral style extractor tools the same rule methods apply. However, instead of twisting a small amount, you will want to spin the handle several times before pulling the tool straight back to remove the key fragment.
You can try using an additional extractor tool on the other side of the key at the same time. Slide the key in the same way and pull the tools back and with slight pressure in the opposite direction to help grip the key between the tools.
If the key comes part of the way out, use a pair of needle-nose pliers to grip the exposed portion and finish removing it.You want to be sure you don't accidentally knock it back into the lock.

Locate the pins inside the lock.,
Depress the pins.,
Jiggle pick until each pin unlocks.",How to Pick a Lock Using a Paperclip," Most of what you need to pick a lock with a paperclip is easily accessible. You really only need three different things. The paperclips, one to act as lock pick, one to act as tension wrench, and a pair of pliers to shape the paperclips.


Two big paperclips, one to act as tension wrench, one to act as the pick. There is no upper size limit, but you want to make sure that the width is not slim enough that it will fit into the lock and that the height is tall enough so that you can insert it into the lock while still holding onto enough length to turn them.
Grab a pair of pliers to shape the two paperclips. It's easier to use pliers than your hands.;
, In order to do this, unfold the large edge of your paperclip twice until a straight portion juts out. You will be inserting the straight part into the lock to use as a pick.








Some locksmiths also put a tiny upward bend into the tip of the pick. This is to depress the pins inside the lock, but is not strictly necessary.

, Take out both bends in the jumbo paperclip until the paperclip is two straight wires with a curve at the end. Press the curved end down with a wrench. Make a 90° bend in the curved end that's about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) long.









Alternately, you could unfold an edge of your paperclip until a straight portion sticks out at a 90° angle. This is a basic tension wrench that is workable but not ideal.

, The bottom of the keyhole is called the shear line. You want to apply pressure with the tension wrench here, in a rotational manner (which way the lock turns).








It can take some practice to get the right amount of pressure. Too hard and you'll twist your paperclip out of shape. Too lightly and you won't put enough pressure on it to pick the lock.

, This can be a bit hard to do if you're not sure which way it turns, but it's important to turn the wrench in the right way. There are a couple ways to test the lock and see which way the key would turn.








If you know which way the lock turns in order to open, turn the tension wrench in that direction. If you don't know what direction the lock opens, guess to one side; on the first shot, you'll have a 50/50 chance of opening the lock.
If you have a sensitive touch, you can also feel which way the lock opens by turning with the tension wrench. Turn clockwise first, then counter-clockwise. You'll feel slightly less pressure when the wrench turns the right direction.

, Do this a couple times to potentially set a few pins.









Keep pressure on tension wrench as you're doing this. If you don't the lock picking won't work properly.
Quickly doesn't mean yanking it out, but you want to move quickly enough that the motion is smooth. Again this is something that you have to get a feel for which is why few people are able to pick a lock on their first try.

, Keeping pressure on the tension wrench, try to locate the pins inside the keyhole using your pick. Most American locks will have at least five pins that you'll need to set in order to open the lock.









You'll feel the pins against your lock pick when you insert it. This will tell you where you need to depress them.

, Be sure to apply rotational pressure to your tension wrench as you depress the pins. You should feel a slight give when you set the pins to their unlocked position, or even a slight clicking sound.









Experienced lock pickers can do this in what looks like one swift motion, but inexperienced pickers will need to use more deliberate motions to set each pin.

, Applying more and more pressure with the tension wrench, jiggle the pick until each pin unlocks. When you hear a snap or click, be sure to rotate the tension wrench to unlock the lock.

Check the angle of the teeth. Break off the end of the blade which the blade teeth are angled away.
If you don't have a coping saw blade handy you can try other items around your house. Give anything that is a long, thin, rigid, and cylindrical a shot. For example, you can try a barbeque skewer or a bicycle spoke if you have access to them. Usually, such methods have a very low probability of success, especially if the key is wedged deep in the lock.

, Wrap several inches on the unbroken end with several layers of duct tape. If the blade teeth still poke through the duct tape, simply add another layer or two.

, Use the spray nozzle and straw attachment and flood the cylinder with a coating of a lubricating silicone spray. Wipe up any excess spray that comes back out of the lock cylinder.

, Place the broken end of the coping saw blade into the lock cylinder with the teeth pointed upwards. Wiggle the handle end until the blade squeezes in next to the key.


If you are trying to remove a car key that has teeth on both sides of the key, you can slide the saw blade in with the teeth up or down.If you're not having luck gripping one side of the key, turn the blade around and try the other.

, Twist the blade about a quarter turn toward the key, then pull the blade out and slightly toward the side away from the lock. Repeat this action several times until the blade successfully grips the key.


If the key comes partially out, just grip the end with needle-nose pliers and finish removing the key the rest of the way.

Remove the spark plug lead to ensure the blade cannot start.,
Wear thick safety gloves at all times when touching the blade.,
Tighten your chainsaw blade when the chain no longer sits flush on the bar.,
Remove or loosen the covering where the blade meets the motor.,
Clean out the engine and drive-train with compressed air and a rag.,
Add a touch of grease to the rolling tip at the end of the blade.",How to Adjust Chainsaw Tension1," This is the small cap, often on the button you use to prime the chainsaw. Disconnect it so that the motor cannot get the electricity required to start., This is not only for your safety but also for the health of the blade. Granted, touching it once or twice won't kill it, but it is better for both you and the chainsaw if you keep gloves on at all times.

, The bar is the long ""knife"" of the chainsaw -- the part you use to guide the blade and actually cut. The chain should wrap snugly around the whole bar, not be hanging off the bottom side. If it is hanging, you'll need to adjust the tension.The Snap Test: Wearing gloves and goggles, hold onto the top of the saw. With the other hand, lift the chain off the bar several inches and let go. If it doesn't snap back into place cleanly, you'll need to adjust the tension.
For precise work, you want about a 1.25mm space between the blade and the bottom of the bar when the motor is cool. A hot motor and chain will slightly expand the chain, loosening it slightly., For older models, this plate likely comes right out. For newer ones, there may be two screws holding it down. At the very least, loosen these two screws a full turn so that the blade and chain have room to shift as you adjust the tension.

, If the cover comes all the way off, use this chance to wipe down the entire assembly, assuring the blade runs cleanly without unnecessary friction. Otherwise, get a can of compressed air and shot it into the loosened covering to remove dirt and dust.A toothbrush is a good way to help remove tricky, hard to reach bits.

, This sprocket is vital to keep the blade moving efficiently. Add a touch of grease so that it can spin freely, and then wipe up any excess with a dirty rag.If you're adding a new chain and want to adjust it, click here.

Make sure you've got the right tools.,
Lodge a book underneath the door for support.,
Force the pin up from the door hinge.,
Nudge the pin loose and remove it.,
Remove the door.",How to Remove a Door Hinge Pin1," Before you take to removing the hinge pins, it's good form to make sure you have all the things you'll need with you. Most important are a hammer and a wedge, nail punch, or nail set to knock the pin out, and a screwdriver to further pry it once it's partway out.


Avoid using a regular nail to knock out the hinge pins. It is likely to bend.;
, You're going to be destabilizing your door, so it's really important there's some kind of support to keep it from toppling over while you're in the midst of unpinning it. Sliding books underneath the crack in the door will give the door a surface to sit on while you remove the pins.


If you have another set of hand ready, the second person can serve this purpose by holding the door steady while you tend to the following step.

, Taking a hammer and your nail punch, gently ram the pin upwards. Put the flat end of the nail against the pin, and tap it up with the hammer. Continue to tap it up, gradually increasing the force until the pin is finally lodged upwards. This is better to do with a number of smaller moves than one big force; being too quick and brash may result in the pin getting scratched or damaged. Give it a spray with a lubricant like WD-40 if there's persistent difficulty in getting it to nudge up.

, Once you've got the pin to come unstuck a few centimetres at the top, you can use an old screwdriver to pry it up further. Tapping the hinge with a hammer can loosen it up. If this isn't working, try ramming the pin up with a few more taps from the hammer. For the sake of stability, take off the bottom hinge first, followed by the top. If the door is triple-hinged, take out the middle one first.
Some may recommend using a chisel, but it's best to use a cheap flathead screwdriver for this. There is a risk it will be damaged, so it's best to use one you don't care much about anymore. , Once all of the pieces are removed, it's time to take the door down. Be very careful, as doors can be very heavy. It's highly recommended you get two people to carry it down. If you have to do it on your own, take extra care to keep it from toppling over.

Know that Bumping a Lock is the best method.,
Procure or make a bump key.,
Follow the directions on the wikiHow how article on bumping a lock.








,
Note there are bump proof locks out there.",How to Open Master Locks1,"






;
, Procuring a bump key involves asking for a locksmith to make a 999 key (where all the valleys are cut to the maximum depth.)









Ask for a 999 key may cast you under suspicion, so be careful.
Get your triangular file to go with it.

Familiarize yourself with the lock.,
Practice pressure.,
Find the first number.,
Set the first number of the combination as your starting point.,
Turn the dial counterclockwise to find the second number.,
Try combinations.,
Test for the third number.",How to Open Combination Locks Without a Code1," A lock has three main components. The shackle is the U-shaped piece which attaches it to an object. The dial is the portion with numbers that turns. The body is the rest of the lock. If you hold the lock with the shackle on top and the dial facing you, typically the locking mechanism is on the left side of the shackle.;
, To find a lock combination you will need to pull up gently on the shackle. Too much pressure will make it impossible to turn the dial. Too little and the dial will spin freely. You should exert gentle pressure. This may take some practice.

, Pull up gently on the shackle and hold it in place. Turn the dial clockwise listening carefully until you hear the lock click.


Start with a good deal of pressure and gently let up as you spin it around, until you meet resistance in only one place.
If the dial catches every few numbers, you are pulling too hard. If it never catches at all, you are not pulling enough. It should catch in only one place, making a click.
If the click happens when the dial is between two numbers, round up to the higher number.
Add 5 to that number and write it down. This is the first number in the combination., It may be helpful to spin the dial a few times before doing this to reset the lock.

, Maintaining gentle pressure on the shackle, turn the dial slowly. You should go all the way around the mechanism once before reaching the second number.


The lock will bump and catch as you turn.
Eventually the lock hit a point where it will be very difficult to turn. This stopping point is the second number. Note it on the same piece of paper., One method of finding the third number is to simply test every possible combination. Set your first two numbers as if you were ready to unlock. Then turn the dial clockwise very slowly, testing each possible combination.


At this point there should be only forty possible combinations.
You do not have to reset the first two numbers for each combination. Simply turn one number then tug. Repeat the process until the lock opens.

, A different method for finding the third number is to test the catch. Spin the dial clockwise a few times to reset the lock and set it at 0. Apply upwards pressure on the shackle and turn the dial clockwise.


The lock will catch several times, allowing for slight movement back and forth between two numbers.
Write down the number in the middle. For instance, if the lock catches between 33 and 35, write down 34 on a separate piece of paper. This is not necessarily the final number.
The lock will also catch partway between numbers. For example, the range might be between 27.5 and 29.5. If the middle number is not a whole number, such as 28.5, do not write it down. Lock combinations are always whole numbers.
Proceed all the way around the dial, writing down all the whole numbers where it catches. You should have four or five numbers written down.
Most of the numbers will fit a pattern, for instance all ending in 5. The one number that does not fit the pattern is the final number in your combination."

Buy a combination lock.,
Find the combination on the sticker on the back of the lock.",How to Open a Combination Lock1," Combination locks can be found at most hardware, home improvement, and sports stores across the US. Some stores that sell combination locks are The Home Depot, Lowes, Sears, Modell's, Staples, and Walmart.


;
, Most of the time, your new combination lock will come with a sticker on the back of the lock, telling you your lock's combination. Remove the sticker carefully. Write down the combination and throw out the sticker -- you don't want to leave the sticker around in case someone else finds it and knows it's the combination to a lock.





Start memorizing your new locker combination. This will make it easier for you to consistently open the lock.

Use a flat file, check if the bar has uneven ""high spots"" that you can file down.,
Figure out which way the chain needs to face so the blades pull forward.,
Lock the chain into the grooves on the bar.,
Remove the cover over the blade area and attach the bar.,
Reattach the covering so that the bar is snugly and firmly in place.,
Hold the nose of the bar up slightly as you work.,
Find your adjusting screw and tighten it until the blade is snug on the bar.,
With hands still gloved, manually pull the chain around the bar to check for tight spots.",How to Adjust Chainsaw Tension2," There is no top or bottom to most chainsaw bars, but one side will often start to wear out and chip. If this is the case, put the bar in a vice and careful file down any jagged, high edges so that the side is even again.

, The chain pulls forward, meaning the chain on top of the bar moves away from your body. The saw blades will point obviously in one direction, with the teeth all pointing the same way. They should point forwards., Put the blade on the bar so that the saw teeth on top of the blade push away from you. Make sure that they fit snugly.

, Pull the chain around and lock it into the sprocket that powers the chainsaw (a large, round, spin-able part with grooves to lock into the chain). Then attach the bar snugly to the motor of the chainsaw according to your specific manufacturer's instructions.

, You want the bar on and chainsaw re-assembled before making your tension adjustments.

, Throughout the next few steps, use your free hand to slightly lift the nose of the bar up. The rest of the chainsaw should rest on a clean, flat surface.

, This screw is often found perpendicular to the direction of the chain. It will move a small pin that catches the chain, making it slightly shorter or longer to add or subtract tension. Check your owner's manual if unable to locate the screw, though it should be easy.


Sometimes the adjustment screw is located between the mounting studs. It could also be on the outside of the chainsaw, on the covering., If the blade doesn't move smoothly all the way around, lightly loosen the adjustment screw so that it can slide with ease. You want the blade on snugly, covering the whole bar, but not so snug that it can't move and cut easily.


A ""perfect"" middle ground to shoot for is 1.25mm of space between the chain and the bar, on the bottom half."

Keep your hinge pins close at hand.,
Place books along the bottom of the door arch.,
Situate the door in the hinges.,
Replace the pins.,
Spray the hinges with an oiled lubricant.",How to Remove a Door Hinge Pin2," While the most difficult part of taking off a door happens at the end, when it comes to reattaching it, it gets way easier at the start. Due to the fact that keeping an unhinged door stable is tricky work, it's a good idea to keep your hinge pins very close so that as little time will be spent grabbing for them. Putting them in your back pocket will give you an easy time getting them when you need them.


The easiest thing is to have someone holding the pins nearby. They can hand them to you as needed.

, If you remember how many books you needed to fill the door crack before taking the book off, it's recommended you use the same combination again. Otherwise, you may need to do a bit of trial and error before you find an elevation that accommodates the natural crack. Place them at the bottom of the arch for proper support. , Next, you will want to lift up the door and hook it in place with the hinges. This is much more easily done with two people, with one on each side of the door. Locking in the doors will be much easier if you have the books or platform to compensate for the crack underneath it. , Once the door is in relative alignment with the hinges, it's time to get the pins in. Take them out and lightly tap them in until the pin is at least slightly intersecting with the hinge and door. To help alleviate the gravity concerns, you should start with the top pin, then the bottom. If the door you're working with has a middle hinge, leave that one for last.


Once the pins are in part way, give them some tapping with the hammer, gradually increasing the level of force until it's completely in. The pin should be fully seated in the hinge.

, Now that your door is nicely replaced, it's time to give it a finishing touch. A good thing to do is to give it a casual spray with a lubricant like white grease. WD-40 will dry out quickly. This will ensure the hinges are quiet and slick.

, Sometimes, a good jolt will knock the lock free. This won't work on all locks, but you may have some fun.









If the lock is on a wooden door, the odds are you will break the door before the lock.

, A drill should go right through the center of the lock where the mechanism is. This won't work on most master locks, and will likely disable the lock so it cannot even be opened with the proper key.








, The right power saw cuts through the lock itself.









The New York city fire department uses saws with an aluminum oxide blade. It is effective when you can access the lock with it.
Wear eye protection and cut through the body of the lock (not the shackle.)

, You can use this tool on the shackle or on an attached cable.









If the lock is attached to a cable, you may have better luck cutting the cable than the lock.
If you want to try to cut open the lock itself, cut the shackle. This will not work on most master locks, as they are made of case hardened steel.

, This only works if there is enough space to fit the pliers in. Similarly, for huge padlocks, a car jack may work to separate the lock.









Naturally these methods only work if there is enough space.

, You can actually open the lock with a high powered rifle, but you may be sprayed with metal fragments or ricocheting pieces.









This was proven by the Mythbusters.The Mythbusters tried a 9mm, a 357 magnum, a shotgun, and a M1 Garand rifle. The handguns did not work at all. The shotgun loosened it up

Fold the sides to make a handle.,
Gently fold the shim around the shackle of the lock.,
Press the shackle up as far as it will go and hold it in position with your finger.,
Pop the lock.",How to Open Combination Locks Without a Code2," Recently made locks are designed to be shim-proof by the manufacturers, although in some cases it is still possible to pick them. This method will work better on older locks.

, In order to use a shim properly you need to be working with the place where the shackle locks, as working on the hinge will not accomplish anything.


Usually the locking mechanism is on the left side if you are looking at the lock with the shackle on top and the dial facing you.

, You can create a shim for yourself by cutting up a soda can.Use scissors to cut off the top of the can, down the length and then to cut off the bottom.


You should be left with a single piece of aluminum that was once the body of the can and is now a wide strip of metal.

, Turn the aluminum horizontally, so you are cutting the shorter side of the material. This piece will be used to make the shim.


Cut a strip a little over one inch wide.
If any of the edges are ragged, trim them., Hold the small strip of aluminum horizontally and cut two curves from the bottom, somewhat resembling the letter U.


Center the U in the middle of your strip.
Do not cut all the way to the top.

, Cutting from the bottom of the metal around a quarter of an inch from the base of the U, cut diagonally upwards to intersect with the top of the U and remove the triangles of material.


The result should be a strip of metal that looks something like the letter M, with the middle of the M curved instead of pointed. This will be the shim.ddd

, Turn the top of the metal downward an eighth of an inch or so. Then fold the sides upward around the top of the strip of metal.


Folding the sides allows you to have a handle on the shim that will not cut your hand with a sharp edge.

, The U of the shim should face downward.


You will want to wrap the shim carefully around the outside first so it molds to the shape of the shaft.
When you have got the shape you want, turn the shim so the U is on the inner part of the shackle and your handle is on the outside of it.
Remember to do this on the side of the shackle that has the locking mechanism.

, Using your other hand, slowly work the shim into the crack between the shackle and the lock itself.


It will take a few minutes and you should not rush or force it.
When you have worked it in as far as it will go, stop.

, Pinch the shim with one hand. With the other hand, press the shackle down then pull it up. The lock should open."

Open multiple-dial locks by turning each dial individually.",How to Open a Lock1," Combination locks require that you input in a series of numbers in the correct order to open the lock. They usually feature dials with numbers from 0-60 or 100, and you need to spin the dial to get the lock to open.;
, Usually, the combination is on a sticker or engraved in the back of the lock. If you cannot find the combination, you will not be able to open the lock unless you can figure out the numbers or break the lock.


As an example, this tutorial will solve for the combination 5 - 45 - 20

, This ""resets"" the dial, allowing you to input your combination.

, Line up the first number in your combination with the small arrow on the top of the lock. In this case, stop on 5.

, Turn the dial one full rotation, returning to your first number. Make sure your turn -counter-clockwise.


You will pass your second number while spinning, but this is intentional.
For this example, you would return back to 5.

, After making the first full rotation, keep turning the same direction until you reach your second number. Here you would turn all the way to 45.

, After landing on your second number, simply turn the dial to your last number, here 20. This completes your combination.

, Once you've successfully input your combination the lock should easily come off. To review:


Spin the dial 3 times clockwise, landing on your first number.
Spin the dial counterclockwise 1 full rotation before landing on your second number.
Spin the dial clockwise to your final number.
Open the lock., Some combination locks feature multiple dials with the numbers 0-9. To open one, simply turn each dial to create the correct combination. For example, if the combination is 1492, turn the first dial to 1, the second to 4, the third to 9, and the last to 2.

Pull on the body of the lock to open it.",How to Open a Padlock1," Most padlocks will have the combination listed either on the back of the lock or somewhere within the packaging. Look for a three digit code when you buy your lock., Turning the dial three full rotations clockwise will reset the numbers and allow you to input the first number in your combination. In most padlocks, if you don't reset it, your code won't work.

, On your third rotation, line up the indicator on the top of the lock with the first digit in your combination. The indicator will usually look like an arrow or upside down triangle., Turn the dial to the left, passing the first number in the combination. Line the indicator with the second digit in your combination after you pass the first number. Stop rotating the dial once you land on the second digit.Remember to pass the first number in the combination when turning the dial or your lock will not open.

, Complete the opening of your lock by rotating the dial clockwise until the indicator matches up with the last digit in your combination. Do not pass the third digit in your combination this time.


When you last on the last digit in the combination you should hear the click the shackle disengaging with the body of your lock.

, Gently pull down on the body of your lock to disengage it. You can then rotate the lock and remove it to open your storage.

Take out the key.",How to Remove a Woodruff Key1," Put this directly onto the pulley and shaft area to loosen any corrosion that will make the pulley hard to move.Those that come in spray bottles are handy and will still be effective for getting into and breaking up rust on metal.;
, This holds the pulley in place and can be undone with a tool such as a crank remover or wrench. If the threads are damaged, more tools and methods will have to be utilized, such as pliers., If there is any rust or dirt on the shaft, lightly sand or brush it. The hub of the pulley usually is fit well to the shaft, so the debris can prevent a loosened pulley from sliding off.

, Do whatever you can to stop the pulley from turning, then use a tool such as a socket or ring spanner on the nut until the pulley can be removed., Place a pry bar or a large screwdriver behind the pulley, if there is a surface behind it to use as leverage. If not, you can try striking the back of the pulley with a hammer while applying pressure with the pry bar or screwdriver.Use a soft-faced hammer to avoid damaging the components. If you use a normal hammer, hold a wood block against the fastener and shaft.
Tap the pulley shaft with the hammer. Don’t use too much pressure. For steel hammers, insulate the shaft, nut, and bolt before striking.

, On the now freed pulley, look for a semicircular piece inset into the shaft. This is the Woodruff key. Grip the sides of the key with pliers and remove it. If pliers don’t work, try to wedge it out with a small screwdriver. These keys are delicate, so force can easily damage them, but keys are easily and cheaply ordered in hardware and auto part stores or online and replaced. Remove any shredded key bits in the machine so they don’t cause damage later.You can try tapping a nail on one end of the key, drilling into the center of the key and removing it with a nail, or even heating the key up with a blowtorch and letting it cool repeatedly to loosen it.
Remember that damaging the key is a far better alternative than damaging the shaft or other part around the key.

Try out all 8 potential combinations.",How to Open a Lock2," A classic MasterLock has 64,000 possible combinations, but with a few simple tricks and a web-based algorithm you can crack the code in fewer than 8 guesses.

, Start with the triangle pointing down to 0 on the dial. It does not matter which way you turn to get there.

, Pull on the U-lock as if you had put in the right combination and wanted to open the lock.

, As you turn the dial, you'll reach a point where the dial gets stuck. It will only move between two close points, either between two numbers (like 10 and 11) or between two half numbers (like 2.5 and 3.5). Write down the number in between the grooves as your first sticking point. For example, if you are stuck between 2.5 and 3.5, right down 3 as your first sticking point.


If this number is a half number, like 1.5 (sticking point is between 1 and 2), ignore it. Release the lock to turn the dial and repeat this step until you find the next sticking point.
This number will be under 11.

, Repeat the previous step, holding the lock as if you were opening it and turning the dial until it sticks. Record the number in between the sticking points -- if you are stuck between 4.5 and 5.5, your second sticking point is 5.


Like before, ignore half-sticking points (2.5, 9.5) and continue until you have a whole number.
This number will also be below 11.

, Put about half as much pressure as before on the top of the lock as before. You are completely trying to pry it open, but you are putting some pressure on it as if you were opening the U on top of the lock.

, You will be able to turn past this number, but you'll feel the dial slow down as it passes this point. Record this number as the resistance point.


You can turn the dial past this resistance point multiple times, all counter-clockwise, to make sure you feel resistance in the same place each time., While you can do some basic math to figure out the exact location by hand, online hackers have posted a free algorithm to determine the 8 potential combinations for your lock online. This calculator will give you two potential sticking points to test out.

, The online algorithm will provide the first digit for you and offer two potential third digits at the bottom. Turn to the first one to test it out. If one of the third digits is ""15,"" go to 15 on the dial.

, With the dial on the potential digit, pull hard on the lock. Note how much resistance the lock gives.

, Do the same thing with the second potential digit. Compare this with the resistance from the first number -- one of them should be much easier to pull on then the other.

, You can check them multiple times, but one number will provide noticeably less resistance when you pull on the lock. Click on this digit in the algorithm online.


You should see the box labeled ""second digit"" fill up with 8 possible numbers.

, Now that you have your 8 possible combinations, the only thing to do is try them all out. The first and last number will all be the same, but try out every one of the possible middle digits to get the lock open."

Once you've gotten every pin up, turn the torque wrench.,
Call a locksmith if you still can't get into your door.",How to Open a Lock3," Most locks turn clockwise to open, but try turning counter-clockwise if this doesn't work. As long as you have the correct key you will hear a faint ""click"" and the door will open.


If the door does not open, you likely have the wrong key.

, Lock picking works on any traditional pin lock. f you can use a key to open the lock, you can pick it.

, You will need two tools -- a torque wrench and a pick. In a pinch, resourceful locksmiths have used bobby pins, paper clips, and butter knives as well. However, the easiest way to pick a lock is with a professional kit, which can be found cheaply online.


Try using a flathead screwdriver, butter knife, or small Allen key if you do not have a torque wrench. Anything small enough to fit in the keyhole but sturdy enough not to break.
Try using a bobby pin or paperclip if you cannot get a pick. Simply straighten them and use pliers to angle the last half a centimeter up 90 degrees.

, You should see several ""pins,"" which are small metal cylinders that keep the lock in place. The grooves on a key are made to push all of these pins up into the right place, allowing you to turn the key. When you pick a lock, however, you use your pick to manually push each pin out of the way.

, You want to wedge it lightly into the bottom of the lock so it is only a few centimeters deep.

, Act as if you were using a key, using light pressure to turn the lock. It will not go very far, but keep this pressure on the lock as you work.

, Using your pin, feel each of the pins in the lock. You should be able to move them up individually,

, You easily push the pins up with your pick. To make them stay, however, you need to use your torque wrench to keep turning the lock so it doesn't slide back into place.

, When you push each pin up, the subtle turning of the torque wrench prevents them from sliding back into place. If the pins don't stay up when you push them, add more pressure the torque wrench. If they are too difficult to push up, apply less pressure.


This is the ""art"" of lock picking, and takes some practice. Each lock is a little different, and you'll need to feel out how much pressure is correct as you work.

, Keep up your pressure with torque wrench as you push up each pin.

, The pins are what keep the lock from moving, but with every pin out of the way you'll be able to turn the lock freely.

, Locksmiths are professionals who can open almost any door. Make sure, however, that you can prove that the lock they are breaking belongs to you, or they may not provide service.

Remember to remove the combination sticker from the lock before you use it.
If you have trouble memorizing things, remember to write the code down on a piece of paper somewhere.

, The first number in the code represents the number that your leftmost dial must be on to open the lock. Rotate the dials until the indicator on the side of the lock lines up with the first digit of the code.


Sometimes the indicator for the numbers will be a red line or arrow., Continue to rotate the rest of the dials from left to right until all of the dials are aligned with the indicator on the side and correspond with the correct code., Once correctly input all the numbers, you can pull on the body of the lock to disengage the shackle. When you put the lock back on, make sure to rotate each dial a couple of times to reset the lock.

Pull on the body of the lock to pull it free.",How to Open a Padlock3," Tilt the bottom of the padlock towards you so that you can see the keyhole. If it's dark where you are, you may need to use a flashlight or cell phone to illuminate the hole for you.

, Take the key with your index finger and thumb and firmly push it into the keyhole. If it does not fit into the keyhole, turn the key over and try again.If the key won't fit regardless of what you try, there's a good chance that it's the wrong key.
Every key has a different profile which will push pins up inside of the lock and disengage the shackle when you have the right key.

, Most key locks will unlock when you turn the key counterclockwise, although this may not always be the case. Turn your key back and forth if turning it clockwise doesn't open it. You'll feel the shackle disengaging in the lock when you've unlocked it successfully., Once the shackle has disengaged, pull on the body of the lock to free it. You can then rotate the lock to remove it from whatever you're trying to open. When you close the lock back up, make sure that you feel and hear a clicking sound which means that the lock has locked again.


Some padlocks will require you to put the key in and turn it clockwise to lock it.

Contact the lock company.,
Hire a locksmith.,
Hit the side of the lock with a small hammer.,
Use a bolt cutter to cut the body of the lock.",How to Open a Padlock4," Sometimes lock companies will be able to tell you your padlock combination if your lock has a serial number, which can usually be found as an engraving on the back of the lock. Call the manufacturer of your padlock, or submit a lost combination form by mail, fax, or email., If you're unable to obtain the combination for your lock, you can hire a professional locksmith to pick the lock or to cut the shackle on the lock. Make sure to read reviews of your locksmith and call beforehand to get a quote. Typically a locksmith visit will cost between $50 to $350., Sometimes you can dislodge the shackle from the lock by simply tapping on the side of the lock. This won't help you get the combination or a new key, but could help you open something if it has a padlock and you've forgotten the combination. Apply tension on the shackle by pulling on the body of the lock, then hit your hammer on the side of the lock's body to open the shackle., While a common belief is that you should cut a padlock at the shackle, this is wrong, as the shackle is often made of the toughest metal throughout the lock. Instead, use 18 or 36 inch (45.72 cm or 91.44 cm) bolt cutters and position them over the lock's body. Apply pressure on the handles and try to cut all the way through the body of the lock to remove it."

Tighten the forcing screw.,
Remove the Woodruff key.",How to Remove a Woodruff Key2," These claw-like devices come in different sizes. You can use measuring tape to find out the diameter of the pulley so that you can buy or rent one that expands to fit over the pulley.


You’ll need an appropriate socket wrench to adjust the forcing screw on the gear puller.

, Once the gear puller is set, the center bolt should engage the pulley shaft in proper alignment to prevent slippage. Adjust the arms so that the puller’s jaws are set at about right angles against the pulley or gear., Use the socket wrench to tighten the screw at the end of the gear puller until the screw touches the pulley shaft. Continue turning until the pulley can slide free.


You can strike the exposed end of the gear puller with a hammer to try to loosen the pulley., On the freed pulley, locate the semicircular shape in the shaft. This is the key and it can be removed by gripping the sides with pliers or wedging one end with a screwdriver. The key may be stuck. If that is the case, alternative and possibly damaging measures need to be taken. Remember to remove any shredded key bits.


Try tapping down on one end of the key with a hammer and nail. Another option is to drill into the center of the key and remove it with a nail.
Rapidly heating the key with a blowtorch and letting it cool can help loosen it.
Remember that these keys are cheap and readily available online or at hardware and auto part stores, so causing damage to it may be necessary. Damaging the parts around it is a more costly idea.

Center punch the broken bolt as close to the center as possible.,
Drill a pilot hole into the center of the broken bolt with the left-handed drill bit.,
Place the appropriate-size extracting bit into the hole you created with the drill.,
Remove the broken bolt.,
Remove metal filings.",How to Remove a Broken Bolt1," Using a hammer, mark the center of the broken bolt with a center punch. This will help you drill into the center of the bolt as closely as possible, putting you at less risk of damaging the threads of the broken bolt.





;
, A left-handed drill bit is threaded in the opposite direction, so the reverse setting on your drill is what will actually drive in the bit. You want to use a left-handed bit because it will torque in the opposite direction as the broken bolt, which will stop the bolt from being driven in tighter.








If you’re lucky, the left-handed bit will grab and unscrew the bolt enough by itself for you to grab the bolt with a pair of vice grips or channel locks and finish removing it from there.
Make sure you use the appropriate size drill bit. The bits in the extracting kit should have a table letting you know what size to use based on the size of the bolt you need to remove. Using too big a bit will risk damaging the threads on the bolt, and using too small a bit will require a smaller, weaker extractor with a higher risk of breaking off during the process.

, Based on the type of extracting kit you purchased, the extracting bit will have a tapered, left-handed bit at one end and either a hex head or a T-handle head at the other. Since the extractor is also a left-handed bit, it will also work into the broken bolt with a counterclockwise movement.








Since the extractor is tapered, you should initially tap it into place with your hammer before switching to a socket or T-handle.

, As you continue to tighten in the extractor, the tapered end will catch and the torque will work to loosen the bolt once the extracting bit is snug.









Continue turning the extracting tool counterclockwise until the broken bolt has been completely removed from the surface in which it was embedded.
Be sure to take your time during this process to prevent excessive damage to either the bolt or the item from which you are removing it. You also want to work the extractor as gently as possible because they are made of hardened steel, and a broken off extractor will be even more difficult to drill out.

, During the bolt-removal process, it is likely that small amounts of metal fillings will have come off of the bolt. If you plan to replace the broken bolt with a new one, it is important to first remove all of these fillings and shaving. You can most easily accomplish this with either a magnet or compressed air.

Locate the magazine release.,
Hold down the release button and slide the magazine out.,
Load the staples and reload the magazine.,
Power on and test.",How to Load a Staple Gun1," The magazine release is a button that releases the magazine clip that holds the stapler.The button is generally found at the rear of the magazine itself and may require pushing or pulling to depress.If you don’t know where your magazine is located, look at where the staples come out of the gun. Make sure the stapler gun is unplugged or off before pressing the magazine release. The release button should be on the opposite side of where the staples are fired.;
, After depressing the release button, you will be able to slide the magazine out of the gun.From here, you will need to turn the stapler upside down to insert the staples., While the gun is upside down, insert the staples leg first. They will go in towards the nose of the stapler, followed by the butt.Slide the magazine back in until you hear the “click” notifying you that the magazine has clipped into place., Plug your electric stapler back into the wall and give it a try. Ensure the staples are coming out one at a time. Be cautious of any kickback if this is your first time using this type stapler.


Test the stapler gun by stapling into a scrap piece of wood. Try to use a piece that is as close to the thickness of the actual items that you are stapling together or are made from the same material. For example, if you are stapling into particle board, use scrap pieces of particle board to test the stapler.

Place your hinges in the correct location.,
Trace around the hinge.,
Cut the mortise.,
Mark the location of the screws.,
Drill the pilot holes.,
Install the individual hinges.,
Connect the door to the jamb.",How to Install or Replace Door Hinges1," Assuming you’re installing a new door, you’ll need to find the precise location on the door frame for your hinges. Most doors require a minimum of two hinges: one hinge is located 7-inches from the top of the door frame, and the other hinge is located 11-inches from the bottom of the door frame. Measure this distance and mark the location on the frame, and then do the same on the door that you’re hanging.









If you have a third hinge (typically used for heavy doors), it will be placed directly in the middle of the other two hinges (this will put it slightly off-center).;
, Put your hinge in place on the door and the jamb, and use a carpenters pencil to carefully trace around the hinge. The depth of the hinge on the jam should always be as thick as the hinge is. Double check to make sure that your outlines match the same location on the door and jamb, before moving to the next step. Then, use a utility knife to score the outline; this will make it easier to cut the mortise.








, The term ‘cut the mortise’ is the professional term for cutting out the wood in the jamb in the shape of the hinge, so that the hinge will be inset in the jamb and provide more strength and aesthetic appeal. To cut the mortise, you’ll need a very sharp chisel and a hammer. While carefully angling the chisel, tap gently into the jamb from the side to remove thin strips of wood. Make sure not to cut the mortise too deep, as this will cause the hinge to become loose over time. Cut out only the outlined area and the marked depth.








Using a dull chisel will make it more difficult to cut the mortise, and cause you to use more pressure with the hammer (which could cause a slip).
If you cut the mortise too deep, you can use wood filler or place a thin piece of wood in it before installing the hinge.

, Replace the hinge back in the jamb where you cut the mortise. Use your pencil to mark the location of the screws in the jamb. Do the same with the location of the hinge on the door. Remove the hinges when you’re done marking.








, Use a drill or screwdriver to drill very narrow pilot holes in the location of the screws you marked on the jamb. Tap them lightly in first, to make sure the screws don’t accidentally move out of place. Use a screw guide to keep the screws straight as they go into the wood.








, Put the hinges back in their places, and use a drill or screwdriver to secure them individually into the jamb and the door.








, Hold the door in place, using blocks under the bottom to support it if necessary. Line up the two hinge plates so that the ones on the door match the ones in the jamb. Slide the hinge pins into place, and remove the blocks from the door. Test the door to make sure it works, and you’re finished!

Purchase suitable lubricant.,
Find the hinge pin.,
Remove the hinge pin.,
Clean, and Apply lubricant.,
Reassemble the hinge.,
Verify.,
Use a rag or paper towel to clean up.",How to Lubricate Door Hinges1," Lubricant used on door hinges should be capable of penetrating the grime and coating the interior of the hinge to keep it working effectively. It's important to get a can or container that has a thin nozzle to access the hinge area. Ask your local hardware dealer for a good and affordable spray lubricant. Good varieties and brands to use on hinges include:


Silicone spray lubricants like Blaster or Tri-Flow are usually the most widely-available and easiest lubricants to use for greasing door hinges.
Lithium grease is effective and dust-resistant, available in large quantities at most auto parts stores. Primarily used for lubricating car parts, this will do the trick and be useful in other situations as well.
Food-grade oils like olive, canola, or coconut oil can also be used in a pinch to lubricate sticky hinges. If the door works relatively well but still squeaks, these are effective ways of fixing a quick squeak. Food oils tend to attract dust and grime, however, making them less desirable than silicone, or other varieties of lubricant.;
, Each door hinge consists of the hinge itself and the pin used to hold the two components of the hinge together, the door to the wall. Look for the round hinge pin that sits between the flat plates on the hinge. This hinge pin holds the hinge plates together and will need to be removed to lubricate the hinge effectively.

, Open the door and pull out the pin some of the way from the hinge. On some hinges, you may be able to use your fingers, but it's likely you'll need to use long pliers to move the pin counterclockwise to remove it. Be careful to avoid scraping your knuckles.


Some hinge pins can be rusted or otherwise difficult to remove. If you're struggling to get it loose, you might use a screwdriver or some PB blaster to help to loosen the pin. Read the following section for more specific information on dealing with stuck pins.

, After removing the hinge pin, clean off the old grease and grime from the pin and the hinge plates using a disposable rag or paper towel. Then, apply a thin coat of lubricant directly onto the hinge pin, as well as into the hinge itself.

, Push the hinge pin back into place and ensure that it is secured., Open and close the door several times to work the lubricant around the innards of the hinges. If the door continues to squeak when you open and close it, repeat this process for each hinge until the squeak disappears.

, Wipe away any excess grime, oil drips, and dust from the hinge area to leave it clean. The build up of grime is why the hinge becomes squeaky in the first place, making it important that you clean it up while you've got the chance.

Know that you can manually open some car doors.,
Pry open the door with a screwdriver and push the unlock button.,
Use a clothes-hanger to open your door manually.,
Unlock your car with your shoelace.,
Call AAA if you cannot get into your car.",How to Open a Lock4," The following techniques only work on older cars that don't use electronic locking. If your car doors have small knobs or rods that move up and down when you lock the car you should be able to get the door open without a key.

, Known as the ""screw and rod"" technique, this can damage your car if you are not careful. Since the locking mechanism is usually on the middle of the door, you can pry open the top part of the door with a screwdriver and use a long rod to push the unlock button.


Pry open the top of the door with a flathead screwdriver.
Take a metal rod or yardstick and stick it into the space you between the car and the door.
Use the rod to press the ""unlock"" button on your door.
This technique often works for newer cars as well.

, Pull apart the clothes hanger so that you have a long wire with the hook at the end. You can use this hook to manually pull up the lock on your car door. Stick the hook end of the hanger between weather-stripping and the bottom of the window, lining the end of the hook up with the knob of the lock. Stick the hook down and feel around for the lock -- it will feel like a vertical rod sticking up from the keyhole to the lock inside the car. Get your hook under this rod and pull up to release the lock.


This may take some time, especially if you are inexperienced, but it will work in a pinch.
""Slim-Jims"" are professional hooks made for this purpose. They are the long, slender tools seen in carjackers on movies and TV., This strategy only works on cars that have a visible knob that unlocks the door. Still, it is quick, easy, and efficient. To open your car with a shoelace:


Create a slipknot in the middle of your lace.
Get the lace inside the car by threading it between the door and the car frame. Think of ""flossing"" the space between your door and the car.
Hook the loop in the middle of your lace around the locking mechanism.
Tighten the lace around the lock by pulling on both ends.
Pull the lock upwards to unlock your car., If you have an AAA membership you may be entitled to a free or discounted visit from a locksmith. Be sure to call and ask about the price and how soon someone can come help you.

Decide the length.,
Cut the length.,
Take the safety wire, thread one end of the safety wire through one of the holes and pull it back, and thread the other end through another hole in the same bolt and bring them together.

,
Put the two ends of the wire equal in length and form a loop through the bolt head.

,
Grab the wire a short distance before the loose ends with using the safety wire pliers tool.,
Using safety wire pliers grab the 2 wires where they reach the halfway of the second bolt and twist them 2-9 times depending on the diameter of the wire used, the thicker the wire is the less turns needed.

,
Release the wire from the tool, with the two loose ends remaining adjacent to each other.

,
Insert one of those ends through one of the holes on the bolt, and pulled through the other hole, then insert the other end through the hole and bring the two ends together.

,
Put the two ends of the wire equal in length and form a loop through the bolt head.

,
Repeat the twisting process on the two loose ends and fold them towards the bolt in a way so the wire won't lose itself.

,
When done, cut and twist the loose end with a pair of diagonal cutters or the safety wire cutters to prevent cutting fingers.

",How to Lock Wire Drilled Head Bolts," The length of the piece of wire to be used is determined by the distance between the bolts that need to be lock wired.;
, The wire should be cut to a length that is a little bit longer than twice that distance between the bolts.

,,, Pull together until the two ends are firm and tied around the first drilled-head bolt.

,,, The fizzy drink should have dissolved the rust build-up causing the bolt to stick. This doesn't de-rust the entire bolt but it does loosen the bolt so that you can unscrew it.

, If your bolt is very rusted and old, it's time for a trip to the hardware store to buy a new one.

Center punch the broken bolt as close to the center as possible.,
Drill out the center of the bolt.,
Thread a hex nut onto the bolt.,
Weld the bolt to the nut.,
Remove the bolt.",How to Remove a Broken Bolt2," Just like you would using the extractor, you want to use a hammer and a center punch to mark the center of the bolt.








, Use a bit that is roughly one-quarter the diameter of the bolt and drill it out.








This method of extraction is typically reserved for bolts that are too corroded to be removed with an extractor, so you do not need to worry as much about tightening the bolt while drilling it out with a right-handed bit, but using a left-handed bit can’t hurt.

, With any threading the bolt still has exposed, tighten a hex nut onto it. You want to attach the nut firmly, but back it off around half a turn, so that it’s not completely flush with the surface into which the bolt is embedded., This is a quick weld, but you do not want this to be your first attempt at welding. If you need to, have an experienced friend complete the weld, or you can always practice on something else first with the information found at Weld.









Be especially careful if the surface into which the broken bolt is embedded is one that will melt to the steel bolt or nut. Because of this, this method works best against a surface such as aluminum, which does not easily weld to steel.

, After the weld has had time to cool, the hex nut has essentially been welded into place as the new head of the bolt and can probably be removed with a socket or a wrench.









The weld is strong, but it will not be unbreakable. For especially corroded bolts, the nut may have to be welded back in place more than once.
In order to break the corrosion bonds, try slowly working the bolt back and forth initially. Once it starts to loosen, continue working both directions but more so counterclockwise, so you can begin removing it entirely."

Select a glue.,
Clean both pieces with soap and water.,
Apply glue along one of the broken edges.,
Press the two pieces together.,
Allow the glue to set.,
Shave away any excess glue with a razor blade.",How to Glue Glass1," You'll need a specialized glue made to bond with glass, or the glass will come apart again as soon as it is cleaned.


Silicone based adhesives are transparent and strong once dry, but can be toxic.Aquarium glues fall under this category.Ultraviolet (UV) curing acrylic resins are excellent for repairing clear glass fragments that fit snugly together. They require exposure to sunlight or a UV lamp to set.Opaque or colored glass may block some of the UV light, causing a weaker bond.
If you are repairing an object that will be exposed to water, make sure the glue is waterproof. Most silicone adhesives and some UV resins are waterproof.
If you are repairing an object that will come into contact with food or drink, check that the glue used is made for this purpose. Some adhesives are toxic even when dry.;
, After cleaning, wipe each piece dry thoroughly with a clean cloth. The pieces will bond best if they are clean, dry, and oil-free.









Wear latex gloves while preparing and gluing the surfaces. This will prevent oil from your hands from rubbing off on the glass, and protect you from toxic or messy adhesives.
Difficult stains can be scrubbed off using steel wool., You only need a small amount, but make sure the entire broken edge is covered. You only need to apply glue to one of the broken pieces.








, Ensure the broken surfaces are aligned and hold in place for at least one minute.








, This will take somewhere between a few minutes and 24 hours depending on the type and brand of glue. Even once it seems firm, avoid applying significant force for 24 hours.


UV curing adhesives require exposure to ultraviolet light. A few minutes in direct, bright sunlight or under a UV lamp should harden the glue. Allow more time for opaque glass or less intense sunlight.
Silicone based glues require several hours at least to set. They do not require sunlight and will set in most weather conditions (5%–95% humidity; 40º–100ºF=5º-40ºC).For large flat pieces of glass, fix them in place with a glass clamp or another clamp specialized for holding fragile objects. Avoid cracking the glass through over-tightening.

, Check in on the glass before it's done setting. Excess glue may have oozed out of the joint and begun to dry. Carefully shave away this excess glue with a razor blade and wipe the surrounding area clean.









Both UV and silicone glues will dry completely clear, so the fracture should be well concealed.

Disconnect the stapler.,
Disconnect the magazine follower.,
Lay the staples over the magazine rail.,
Unlock the follower and ready the stapler.,
Test out the staples.",How to Load a Staple Gun2," Start disconnecting the stapler by switching the “on/off” button to “off” on the compressor. This switch will be found behind the tank. The tank is usually cylindrical and contains the pressurized air. Now disconnect the hose release by loosening the nut beneath the gun. While most nuts can be loosened by hand, you may need to find the right screwdriver to loosen the nut.Now your stapler should be fully released.


If your gun has a safety trip, put it in place before moving forward. A safety trip prevents the gun from firing off while reloading.

, On your pneumatic stapler, the magazine follower is a rod that sets the magazine in place and will be underneath the front. Squeeze the lever and pull away from the stapler to remove the magazine.Pull the follower all the way out. Once the magazine is pulled out, it will be locked into position., Taking an entire strip of staples, lay them leg-first into the rail. The staples should be able to move freely, without getting caught, up and down the rail.


If your staple row has broken, you can load several smaller ones together.

, Unlock the follower by squeezing the lever and releasing it.The stapler may automatically push the staples back into the staple gun. If not, give it a small push, and it should automatically engage.

, Plug your compressor back into the bottom of the pneumatic gun and reconnect the hose to the stapler. Put on protective gear for your eyes and ears and then power on the compressor.Push the stapler against a piece of wood and pull the trigger. You should have one clean staple as a result.


Test the stapler gun by stapling into a scrap piece of wood. Try to use a piece that is as close to the thickness of the actual items that you are stapling together or are made from the same material. For example, if you are stapling into particle board, use scrap pieces of particle board to test the stapler.

, Look at the stapler from the back. There should be a small button or push-trigger to release the magazine. Push this button and give the magazine a wiggle.


Some staplers have a pull mechanism. If your stapler doesn’t indicate whether to push or pull, you can try both with caution.

, Sometimes the magazine will be sticky or roughened up if the stapler is old. Pull on the magazine gently. You should be able to pull it out without requiring much force.


If the magazine is stuck, try using a small flat head screwdriver to gently pry it out.

, Pick up a row of designated staples and drop it into the track, legs first. Push the magazine back into the stapler until there is a click. Using paper or cardboard, test your stapler to make sure it works.

For example, working outdoors or in a room with more than one window.Position your work area between windows or between a window and open doorway.
You should also set up a box fan or two to blow air away from you.
A room that has an exhaust fan works well, too.;

Make sure you are also following the directions on the acrylic cement closely to avoid any mishaps.

, Whether you are planning to glue in a workroom, a garage, or even your kitchen, you want to make sure that the surface area you’re using is compatible with acrylic cement. Try to stick to an area that’s concrete, metal or wood. Do not glue acrylic on a surface containing glass or paper.

, Make sure that the borders of the acrylic you want to join are flat and free of bumps or cuts. Acrylic cement will not adhere or sink into grooves and crevices like regular glue does on wood or paper. Instead, it softens the acrylic and chemically bonds the pieces together, so it's important they are as flat as possible.If you notice any rough areas, use a router (a power tool with a shaped cutter) or light sandpaper to ensure that the edges are perfectly smooth and square. However, do not sand the edges so that they become round.
Make sure that any surfaces being bonded together are lightly sanded and not shiny, as a very smooth surface is tough to bond together.

, Once you have sanded and smoothed the sides of your acrylic, wipe over it with a clean cloth and alcohol. Using Isopropyl alcohol will help guarantee that all dirt, dust, and other fragments have been removed. It will also remove any residual oils left by your hands, which can interfere with gluing.


Be sure that your surfaces are totally dust-free – this is really important to the process.

, The most common glue for acrylics is a solvent-based glue like Weld-On 4, which can be found on Amazon for under $15. This glue should also come with its own applicator bottle and needle. To use, simply fill the applicator bottle, via a funnel, until the bottle is about 75% full.Once filled, squeeze the bottle gently to allow some of the air inside to escape.

, Place the pieces of acrylic together as you want them to be joined. They should meet at a 90-degree angle. You can then use a combination square to guarantee that the pieces are angled correctly. Once set up, use your hands or a clamp to hold the sections together.


Always do a dry run first, making sure the pieces fit before applying any glue.
It helps to assemble the object together with adhesive tape. Then the adhesive can be placed accurately without juggling the parts.

, Turn the bottle upside down and place the needle above the edge where the two pieces of acrylic meet. Squeeze the bottle with mild pressure as you move along the joined edges. You want to pull the bottle towards you. The acrylic cement should run in between the joined edges and fill in any seams or spaces as you move it along.Try to lightly squeeze the bottle and move it without stopping, this will ensure you don't over-glue the acrylic.If you are gluing for a box corner joint, apply the acrylic cement to the inside edge of the sheeting. However, if you are gluing for flat joints, apply the cement to both sides of the sheeting.Do not allow the acrylic cement to touch any piece of the acrylic you do not want to be glued. Acrylic cement will permanently damage any surface it touches. If you do drip acrylic cement onto the acrylic, allow the cement to evaporate. Do not wipe it off.

, Most acrylic cement will take around 10-15 minutes to set initially. During this time you can use your hands or a clamp to hold the edges together. Once they are secure, they should take 24-48 hours to cure to full-strength.If the pieces have been adhered well, the dried acrylic cement will be clear. Before this time, the acrylic should appear as a cloudy white.

, If there are any excess or overlapping pieces of acrylic, you can cut these off with a router (a power tool with a shaped cutter). However, be careful of heat generation, which could melt the acrylic. You should also make sure the acrylic is properly set before you try to manipulate it in any way.

There are some people making bump keys without original keys as guides. To do so, you need an electronic caliper capable of measuring the distance between pins in the lock -- a complicated maneuver reserved usually for burglars without access to an original.;
, This how-to will use certain terms and phrases to refer to parts of the key. Knowing the simple terms will help you make a more effective key.



Length: the length of the key from its tip to the end; the longest measurement of the key.

Groove: a dip or indentation in the serrated edge of the key. Each groove is next to at least one peak.

Peak: a tooth in the serrated edge of the knife. Peaks can be steep or flat, but jut outwards from the body of the key. Each peak is next to at least one groove.

Maximum depth: the length of the deepest groove on the key. The deepest groove should never cross the track.

Track: the narrow indentation along the key's length. Different keys have differently sized tracks. The track falls roughly in the middle of the key length-wise.

Shoulder: when the key is inserted, the shoulder sits at the top and right outside the lock's entrance. The shoulder stops the key from being inserted too far into the lock.

, You need to know where each groove is along the length of the key, as well as the maximum depth that any groove has on the key. Lay your real key over your blank key. The only difference between the two is that the real key is serrated where the blank key, your bump key, is not. You only have to trace that serrated edge. The maximum depth should never cross the track, which is the indent going through the length of the key., Place the key so that the track and bottom are in the vice and the top sticks out. You will need to file the key into the shape you've outlined. You can set the original key aside.If you do not have a bench vice, find another way to hold your key securely while filing it down. You must be able to file down to an accurate depth, so having it somewhere it can't move is crucial.

, Use the file, keeping the peaks in place. Your biggest goal is to never go lower than the maximum depth of the original. Just get the key into the rough shape of the original so you can fine-tune it into a bump key.

, The biggest thing to focus on is the depth of each groove. You never want to go past the tread running along the bottom of the key, and you never want to go deeper than the maximum depth of the original key.


Do not worry about the sharp peaks between grooves for now -- they come next.
You should have the same number of grooves as real the key.

, The peaks of your blank key are probably too high and might cause your key to get stuck in the lock. File down the peaks so that they are a few millimeters high. The right height is one that triggers your lock but doesn't get stuck; you may have to experiment and practice to find the right height.Your peaks should be of equal height to one another.
The peaks just need to be high enough to catch in the lock.

, Your final bump key should look like a saw with an evenly serrated, jagged edge. The little, toothy peaks, shouldn't be too steep, and the grooves should be evenly spaced right where the grooves on the original key are located. It is okay if the grooves are flat-bottomed., Insert your bump key into its respective lock, noting where the key stops it from going any further in. This is the shoulder, which exists between the grooves/peaks, and where your fingers grasp the key in order to use it. The shoulder exists to stop the entry of a key into a door at exactly the right location so that the grooves and peaks align with the lock., The shoulder controls how far the key goes into the lock, but you don't want the shoulder there. Using a bump key, you want to be able to control how far the key is going into the lock to jiggle the lock open. Getting rid of the shoulder allows you to position the key as you want while tapping it in. Use your file to wear the shoulder down to the height of your peaks, at least. , This is an optional step, but can help you fit the key in.The tip is the part of the key that inserts into the lock first. If you are having trouble fitting and jiggling the key into the lock, try filing down the tip of the key by 1/4 to 1/2 of a millimeter.


You will need to fit small rubber spacers on this area, allowing you to ""bump"" the key against the lock so it recoils back a bit at you.
This is called the “minimal movement” method. , See where the shoulder used to be? Using your permanent marker, draw a dot or line where the key emerges from the lock. This mark should be right where your bump key's shoulder used to be., Slide them onto the key and position them where your key's shoulder used to be, starting at that mark you drew. To use a bump key, you want bouncing rubber where a real key has a metal shoulder. This way, the key will bounce back out a little every time to hit it into the lock. A good bump key will jiggle around in the lock fluidly until it properly aligns with the lock, and will not get stuck.If you do not have rubber rings, you can still test your bump key. You will have to reset the key in the lock after every time you hit it, though. This is called the “pull-back” method. Any little rubber ring will do. You could use gaskets from the plumbing section of a hardware store, farm equipment, and hosing.

, If you push on your bump key and hear a click, then move on to the next step. If you do not hear a click, jiggle your key or consider filing half a millimeter off from the tip of the key.


If you have rubber rings, your key should bounce back to its original position in the lock every time you push in and let go. Without rubber rings, you must pull your key back out one notch after pushing it in once., Using one hand, apply light rotational pressure. It should be as if you were trying to turn the key to unlock the door. , Hold a small hammer, the back of a screwdriver, or another mallet-like object in the hand not holding the key. Hit the key straight in the direction of the lock, bumping it several times while still rotating the key slightly. This will probably take a number of tries. Jiggle the key if needed.


With rubber rings, you can hit many times in quick succession.Without rubber rings, you must pull your key back out one notch after pushing it in. This can get tedious, but it is not impossible., Keep it in a safe place and use it only for legal purposes. Note, however, that improperly made or used bump keys can permanently damage locks. Only use your bump key when you are absolutely sure you need it, as it can cause more headaches than it is worth if you aren't careful.


The actual ""bumping,"" or knowing how to turn the key and how hard to hit it, will take some practice. Each lock is slightly different, but you'll learn to get the feel for it with some practice.

Use blocks of wood to steady the door.,
Compare the hinges and measure the door.,
Remove one of the old hinges.,
Prepare the jamb and door for the new hinge.,
Install the new hinge.,
Repeat the process on the second hinge.,
Test the new hinges.",How to Install or Replace Door Hinges2," Move the door so that the entire hinge is exposed, and place blocks under the door to steady it. When replacing a door hinge, you won’t remove the door. Placing blocks underneath will help support the door and prevent it from falling over.








, Make sure that your new hinges match the old hinges in size and edge shape. Additionally, use a measuring tape to verify that the current hinges are in the right locations. The hinges should be placed so that one is 7-inches from the top of the door frame, and the other is located 11-inches from the bottom of the door-frame. If these are incorrect, you’ll need to go about the aforementioned steps on cutting the mortise and preparing the door jamb for the new hinge.








, Start at the top hinge, and remove the screws holding the hinge leafs in place. Carefully pull them away from the door and the jamb, and check to make sure the wood under the hinges is in good condition. You may want to plug some of the old holes with a small wood wedge, especially if some of the holes have stripped out.








, If the old door hinge had been attached for some time, you may need to do a little repair work on the jamb and door. Sand down the wood if necessary, and add a new coat of paint or stain to match the pre-existing wood.









If the replacement hinges are sized differently from the old ones, fill in the mortise holes in both the door and the door frame with wood putty. Use a metal scraper to fill in the screw holes or plug them with a small wood wedge.
Allow the putty time to dry, and sand it smooth and flush with the surface.
Paint or stain the repair to match the rest of the door and trim.

, Place your new hinge over the location of the old one. Use a drill or screwdriver and the package screws to secure the two sides of the hinge to the jamb and the door. Place the hinge pin in the hinge to secure the new hinge.








, Move to the next hinge, and use a drill or screwdriver to remove it. Replace it with the new hinge and new screws, holding it in place to make sure the hinge doesn’t get jostled out of location. Insert the new hinge pin when the new hinges are secured.









If you have a third center hinge, you should replace it at this point as well.

, Remove the blocks from under the door, and try opening and closing it multiple times. If the door opens without any problems, then your job is finished!

Soak rusty hinges in PB blaster.,
Gently tap the end of the pin with a screwdriver.,
Repair the pin, if necessary.",How to Lubricate Door Hinges2," If you're struggling to remove the hinge pin from a sticky door, soak it in some penetrating lubricant spray for up to 12 hours before trying to remove it. WD-40 is another product commonly used for the purpose. Spray a liberal amount of penetrating spray onto the hinge and let it sit.


Many people starting forcing the pin out with a hammer, but if it is very rusted, this could damage the wood of the door, break the hinge, and leave you with a bigger repair job on your hands.

, After letting it soak, use the end of the screwdriver to tap the pin through the hinge, pushing it out gently. This can be a more effective way of getting the pin removed from the hinge to lubricate it.


Use something small enough to push the pin out. The tip of a pair of pliers, even an ink pen or another small thin tool might be appropriate for the job. Find something the approximate size of the hinge you're working on.

, Roll the pin on a flat surface to see if it is bent, and examine the pin for signs of wear. If it's very rusty and bent, it's good to spend a little bit of time straightening it out and cleaning it up before re-installing it, so you can avoid a squeaky door in the future.


If it's bent, straighten it out by putting it on a cement floor and tapping it with a hammer to bend it back into shape.
Use emery cloth to sand down the pin, removing the rust. This will help the pin fit more loosely, creating less resistance and less potential for squeaking.

Decide on materials and glue.,
Prepare your materials.,
Paint a thin layer of glue over the object.,
Apply a second layer of glue to a small area.,
Attach your decorations to the prepared area.,
Add a last layer of glue over your decorations to seal them in.,
Spray with a sealant to ensure durability and water resistance.,
Wipe off excess glue and let dry.,
Finished!








",How to Glue Glass2," You could decorate a glass jar with fabric or paper cutouts, or make a 3D mosaic by placing ceramic or glass tiles over a flower vase. Each combination of two materials can only be bonded by specific glues.


Browse your hardware store or art supply store and read the glue labels to see which one is suitable for the materials you chose.
A glue that dries clear is preferable for most art projects.

, A few simple steps will quicken the decorating process and ensure that the glass bonds strongly.









Wash the glass thoroughly with soap and water.
Dry the glass with a clean paper towel.
Empty some glue into a plastic container. This will make it easy to apply with a paintbrush, and cause it to dry slightly for a useful tacky consistency.

, Cover any areas you intend to decorate. Wipe off any excess blobs and wait for it to dry.








The setting time for the glue varies depending on the type of glue used. In most cases 5-10 minutes should be enough.

, Once the first coat has dried, adding a small amount of glue to an area will make it wet and tacky, preventing your decorations from slipping.









Wait another 5-10 minutes for this to take effect.

, If they slide off, wait for the glue to dry a little more and try again.









Apply, wait, and decorate each area in turn. Feel free to apply glue to a new area while you're still decorating the previous one.

, Let dry.








, Let dry for 15 minutes.








, Allow the glue to stand 24 hours before handling the object roughly, then enjoy your new decoration!

Inspect the walls.,
Inspect baseboard molding.,
Determine if any dimples or bumps in the wall are aligned directly above each other - including those that were found on the baseboard molding.,
Accurately measure the distance between the vertical rows of the nail / screw heads found above.,
The measurement found between will repeat.,
Locate a stud by finding an electrical outlet, preferably one not in close proximity to corners, doorways or windows.

,
Remove the wall plate from the outlet.

,
If the stud is not visible, carefully probe against the outside the box (to the left and right) with a very thin screwdriver or awl (a short, straight piece of coat hanger cut at a 45 degree angle works very well; bend it at a 90 degree angle to hold comfortably).,
Probing at a light switch, since they are generally at doorways, will not provide an accurate indication of where additional studs may be - as mentioned above.,
Project the stud closest to the desired location for the support of the shelf, picture, etc.,
If no evidence found, carefully probe directly above the baseboard where is meets the wallboard.,
Once found, continue to probe to determine the leading and trailing edge of the stud.,
Project the center of the stud vertically to the height desired.,
Once satisfied, install the support fastener.",How to Find a Wood Stud in a Wall to Hang Pictures On," With your head close to the walls to look across the surface, look for dimples and / or bumps. Lightly mark the dimples and bumps with a pencil. The dimples should only be the size of of a nail or screw head, and the bumps the same size to slightly larger. Try to find two or more close together across the wall's surface left and right and up and down. If none can be found where needed, continue on to the next steps.;
, Look directly at the molding along the entire length for exposed nail heads or evidence of wood filler placed over the nail heads. If not plainly evident (covered, painted, etc.), again, lightly indicate the locations with a pencil. Try to find two or more nail heads left and right along the molding.

, The more found in a vertical row, the more likely it is that under the bumps and dimples are the nails or screws that were used to secure the wallboard to the studs.

, It will likely be 16 or 24 inches (40.6 or 61.0 cm), with the 16 inch (40.6 cm) measurement being far more common.

, Use the repeating measurement to help project the location of the next stud. The 16 inch (40.6 cm) centered studs will be found at 16"", 32"", 48"" etc. from nearly any stud found. Likewise, the 24 inch (61.0 cm) centered studs will be found 24"", 48"", 72"" etc from nearly any stud found. Places where the distance may be less than the 16"" or 24"" multiplier can occur at wall corners, doorways and windows.

,,, Press the probe in into the wallboard or plaster at an angle pointed away from the box. Since most electrical outlets boxes are installed before the walls are finished, they are supported by studs. The box would likely be supported on the right or left side, by the stud. If the probe passes unobstructed into the void beside the box, the stud is likely on the other side. Probe the other side similarly. If it only passes a short distance before stopping, this is likely the stud location. If it does not, it is possible that the outlet was installed after the walls were finished, and the wallboard or lathe is supporting the outlet instead of a stud. Try the same procedure at another outlet on the same wall.

, Of course, if a location above a switch is needed, the switch box should be probed similarly to the outlet box procedure to determine which side of the box the stud is located.

, Using the measurement multiple determined above, find the stud 16, 32, 48 etc., or in the case of 24 inch (61.0 cm) centers, 24, 48, 72 etc. inches away from the closest stud found - along the baseboard molding. Lightly mark this spot on the baseboard with a pencil. With a specific area to look for evidence of a stud, carefully look again for dimples and / or bumps in the wall, or filler in the baseboard.

, When voids are found, move left or right about 1/4"" or less and probe again. Continue to probe until the probe finds the stud.

, The stud should be approximately 1 - 1/2"" thick. Ideally, any screw or fastener to be secured to the stud should be located in the center of the stud for maximum holding power.

, Probe this location straight in and if obstructed, probe thru the same point at a 45 degree angle to the left and then right. Push hard when probing at the angle. This is to help ensure that the location is not at the edge of the stud.

, Patch any plaster and replace any wall plates.

This will allow you to know exactly where to chisel out the wood of the door so that the mortise plate fits nice and flush on the surface. You want the mortise plate to be flush. If it is not, the door will likely not shut correctly, or may not close at all. Also, the finished look of a correctly set mortise plate is much better than a plate that protrudes from the surface. Be sure to use a sharp pencil so that your mark is right next to the edge of the plate. If it is not, you'll end up with a hole that is too big and it won't look as nice when complete.;
, Be sure to use a sharpened chisel as the end result will be much cleaner, not to mention easier to do. First, score the perimeter of the area with the chisel. This basically boxes in the area that will be removed. If you skip this step, you will likely remove material past the marked area and the finished project will not look clean and professional.

, Generally you will need to chisel out about an 1/8"" of the door surface; but that will depend on the type or brand of latch that you are installing.

, You may do this several times as you work on chiseling out the area. This particular latch that we are installing is a Nostalgic Warehouse latch which comes in two pieces, the latch itself and the decorative mortise plate. Combined the two pieces are about 1/8"" thick so the mortise depth needs to be 1/8"" for them to fit flush with the door edge surface.

, Make sure that the curvature of the end of the latch is placed correctly so that the curved part strikes the jamb . This is a common mistake. Really not that big of deal except that you have to take everything apart and put it back together again.

, Once this is complete you can move on to installing the hardware itself. Most brands of door hardware have very similar latch types so this article can be applied to the majority of applications.

, On many basic keys, there are numbers you can check on the shoulder or the front head of the key. On normal house keys, a number might look like SC-1 or KW-1.

, Sometimes stores try to copy keys that cannot be copied on normal blanks. Certain types of keys cannot be copied by regular locksmiths, such as ones for Primus locks and ones meant for college dorm rooms and apartments.

, It's very easy for larger department stores to screw up your key if you don't tell them the year or model car you have. Also, some newer models of cars have electronics inside, and car doors or the ignition may not work if you copy them from a regular key blank.

, You can sometimes tell if the clerk is not certain whether the key will work. Sometimes, if the clerk takes a long time, or no time at all, he or she may have chosen an incorrect key blank.

, Years of use in the lock causes wear in an original key, possibly causing it to not be able to be copied correctly. If this is the case then an original key will have to be made.


Note that it's generally the flat parts, not the pointed corners, that operate the lock, so a key with some wear may still copy correctly.

, If you copy a key based on copies, they will slowly gain more errors. After the fifth generation of copies, those keys may fail to work in your lock, or work improperly.

, Many times, locally owned businesses copy keys better than department stores. It may cost a bit more, but it's definitely worth it.

, You can sometimes copy a key from a broken or bent key. A locksmith needs to find out the numbered combination of your lock and needs to cut you an entire new one if it is broken in a bad spot or if the machine cannot grip the broken pieces.

Buy a can of WD-40.,
Attach the applicator straw to the nozzle of the can.,
Insert the straw into the opening of the lock.,
Spray the WD-40 into the lock.,
Test the lock.",How to Fix a Sticky Lock1," Run down to your local hardware store and purchase a can of WD-40. WD-40 is a common household lubricating oil that can be used on everything from bicycle chains to door hinges. If your lock isn’t in real bad shape, a little squirt of WD-40 will probably be all you need.WD-40 is generally a great product to have on hand whenever there’s a need for an all-purpose lubricant.Avoid using any lubricants that aren’t appropriate for home improvement use, such as cooking, botanical or sewing machine oil. Most oils will just attract dust that then forms new layers on the locking mechanism, making the problem worse.;
, Hook up the red applicator straw that comes included with the can of WD-40. These straws are thin and flexible and fit right over the opening of the nozzle where the oil comes out. The addition of a straw will allow you to penetrate deep into the inner workings of the lock, lubricating it more effectively.


Some newer containers of WD-40 feature permanently-attached straws. Keep an eye out for these, as they’re just what you need.A straw will also keep the spray of the lubricant confined inside the lock where you want it, rather than all over your front door.

, Place the end of the straw into the opening of the lock where you normally insert your key. Guide the straw as far in as you can to make sure you’re hitting every part of the locking mechanism that might be sticking with the WD-40.

, Press down on the button on the rear of the WD-40 canister to begin releasing the lubricant into the lock. Don’t be afraid to use a liberal amount of oil—a sticky lock needs the attention. Hold down the spray button until the WD-40 begins to overflow from the lock opening.Wearing gloves while handling lubricants can help prevent a slippery mess.

, Let the WD-40 sit for a few minutes. This will give it a chance to start breaking down the dust and dirt accumulated inside the lock that’s impairing its movement. Once it’s had some time to set up, slide your key in and out of the lock a few times and observe how smoothly it moves. If it doesn’t meet resistance, your work is done. If the lock still sticks a bit, you may need to try a more heavy-duty lubricant such as powdered graphite.Make sure you’ve properly coated each part of the locking mechanism by running through the locking and unlocking action a few times. After you've applied WD-40 to the lock, the interior pins should disengage with no resistance and the cylinder should easily rotate when you turn your key.
Lubricate the locks around your home with WD-40 regularly to keep them maintained.

Select a light bulb size.,
Wrap wire around the base of the bulb.,
Cut the tip of the silicone caulk nozzle.,
Squeeze the silicone into a plastic cup.,
Dip the bulb into the silicone.,
Coat the bulbs.,
Hang the bulbs to dry.,
Place the bulbs in a nightlight or lamp.,
Turn on the lamps or nightlights.",How to Coat Something in Silicone2," Dipping a light bulb in silicone is a fun and creative project that allows you to spruce up a typical light bulb. Choose what type of light bulb you would like to use. If you would like to make a small votive light, select a 60-watt candelabra bulb. Select a 60-watt standard light bulb if you are using it in a desk lamp.

, Secure some craft or jewelry wire around the base of the bulb by tightly wrapping it around several times. Leave a string that is about 4 or 5 in (10 to 13 cm) long, or long enough for the bulb to be secured as it is hanging to dry.Wire can be purchased online or at an arts and crafts shop and can cost between $3 to $8.Use a pair of pliers to clip the wire.

, Silicone caulk comes in a tube and can be purchased at a general store or a hardware store. It typically costs between $3 and $10.To open, use a pair of scissors or a box cutter to carefully slice off the tip of the nozzle.Be sure to use 100% silicone. You can use either white or clear silicone.

, Use a clear and disposable plastic cup to hold the silicone. Hold the nozzle above the cup and gently squeeze the contents into the container. Fill it up about half-way.Add several drops of a scented oil like cinnamon or lavender into the silicone. The bulb will give off a pleasant aroma as it glows.
To add some color, use a few drops of oil-based paint and mix it with the silicone., Hold the cup securely with one hand. In the other, grip the base of the light bulb. Dip the bulb into the center of the cup into the silicone mixture., Once you have dipped a bulb in the silicone, twirl the bulb a couple of times to evenly coat the surface. Be sure not to submerge the base of the light bulb.Create an elongated, decorative tip by pulling the bulb out of the silicone quickly. You can dip the bulb into the mixture several times to achieve the look you desire., Use the metal wire to fasten the bulbs in a safe place to dry. Hang the bulbs on a coat hanger, but be sure that they do not touch. Suspend the hanger in a safe, dry, bright place to dry. Leave them to dry for several days. Silicone caulk can take 24 to 48 hours to dry completely., Purchase a small nightlight or lamp at a home goods store or a general store. If the nightlight has a cover, gently slide it off to remove. Once the bulbs are dry, remove the wire. Secure the silicone-coated bulbs into the light sockets.Be sure the lamps are not connected to a power source as you insert the bulbs.

, Plug in the lamps or nightlights to showcase your unique, quirky light-bulbs. The silicone coatings will add a warm, diffused glow to a bedroom or hallway.


If you added drops of an essential oil, you should be able to smell a hint of the aroma as the bulbs glow."

Purchase silicone roof coating.,
Use this product on a flat or gently sloped roof.,
Clean the roof.,
Repair any damage on the roof.,
Seal seams on the roof.,
Mix the silicone coating thoroughly.,
Apply during a warm day.,
Use a paint roller to apply.,
Let it dry for two to six hours.",How to Coat Something in Silicone3," Visit your local hardware store and talk to an employee about adding a silicone coating to your roof. Coating your roof with silicone is an environmentally-friendly way to repair and restore your roof. The silicone coating can protect against water damage and ultraviolet light, and its reflective surface can help you cut back on energy costs.A 5-gallon (19 L) bucket of silicone coating can cost between $80 and $200.To cover an area of 100 sq ft (9.2 sq m), use about 1.5 gallons (5.6 L) of the silicone coating., This product works best on flat roofs or roofs with a gentle slope. Do not coat a steep roof with an incline of 20° or greater. The coating could make the roof slippery and dangerous., Before applying the product, clean the roof to remove dirt and debris. Be sure to clean the gutters and remove any plants that may be growing on the roof. Rinse the roof with water using a pressure washer or a hose. Allow it to dry completely., After washing your roof, repair any cracks, splits, or blisters to make the roof water-tight before applying the silicone coating. Use a roof sealant and apply the product directly to the damaged spot with a paintbrush.Cement, rubber, silicone, or fibered roof sealants can be purchased online or at hardware stores and range between $10 to $50., Use the sealant to secure any curbs, transition areas, or areas where different materials meet. Sealing these areas can help ensure that the roof is water tight., Use a paint-mixing drill or a wooden paint stick to thoroughly mix the product.This will blend the product and remove and clumps that may have formed. When you are not using the product, keep the container sealed.

, For the best results, apply the silicone coating to your roof on a warm day in the morning. The ideal temperature should be around 65° F (18° C) and no higher than 90° F (32° C)., Pour the product into a paint tray and use a paint roller to lift some of the product onto the roller. Opt for a 1 to 1.5 in (2.54 cm to 3.8 cm) lint-free paint roller. Try to work quickly as the product may dry or collect moisture.On rubber surfaces, apply a primer coat to create a consistent thickness. , If you apply multiple coats to the roof, allow it to dry for at least two to six hours between coats. The coat will fully cure in 48 hours. If you wait 48 hours to apply another coat, you may need to wash the roof again before application."

Get a tube of powdered graphite.,
Cut the plastic tip off the end of the bottle.,
Hold the tip of the bottle up to the lock.,
Inject some powdered graphite into the lock.,
Try your key in the lock.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Fix a Sticky Lock2," Powdered graphite is a special dry lubricant that can be found in most hardware or department stores. It is designed to encourage smooth movement between two surfaces without attracting grime, which means it won’t gum up like oil-based lubricants. If your lock is so sticky that you can barely get your key in and out, you may need something as tough as powdered graphite.Once applied, the graphite particles form a fine layer on the surface of the metal, lubricating and “brushing” away dust and dirt.
A small container of powdered graphite can be purchased in most places for as little as $2.

, Most containers of powdered graphite have a solid plastic film covering the tip that will need to be removed prior to use. Take a utility knife or sharp pair of scissors and snip the plastic off the end of the nozzle. Be sure to make a large enough opening that the graphite can flow freely., Place the end of the nozzle up to the opening of the lock. Depending on the size of the bottle, you may be able to actually fit the nozzle part of the way inside the opening. If not, just hold it flush to the lock. It should still be able to penetrate deep enough to lubricate the locking mechanism.Make sure you’re holding the bottle level so that graphite doesn’t escape around the opening.
Consider covering the area of your door around the lock to guard it from stray graphite particles

, Squeeze the bottle gently to release a few puffs of powdered graphite into the lock. Try not to use an excessive amount—graphite is a potent substance, so a little bit will go a long way. Allow the graphite to start working on the lock for a minute or two.Start by using a little bit of lubricant and apply more if the lock still sticks.
Handle powdered graphite carefully. Otherwise, the fine black dust can get everywhere, staining surfaces and creating a big mess.

, Test the lock by inserting and removing your key once or twice. You shouldn’t have any trouble getting it in and out of the lock now. Turn the key in both directions to see how fluidly it moves.Sliding your key in and out of the lock will help spread the graphite around inside to the place where it most needs to be.

, If the lock still feels a little sticky, hit it again with a few more blasts of powdered graphite. Test the lock after each application. Once the graphite has distributed through the lock, it will begin to clear away the gunk that’s been hindering the lock’s movement, leaving you with a fully functioning, hassle-free door.


For especially stubborn locks, try squeezing a little graphite onto the door’s latch as well. This is the part of the locking mechanism that moves in and out of the door frame when you turn the knob. Lubricating the latch can help ease the keying action.If you still don’t have any luck after trying powdered graphite, call a professional locksmith to come out and take a look at your locks.

You can find the website at: https://www.friendsofanimals.org/spay_neuter_certificate_information

Be sure to search the website first to establish that there are providers in your area that work with the organization.
The certification, which covers the entire cost of the procedure, is $61 for a male cat and $85 for a female cat., CareCredit provides low interest credit for veterinary procedures. CareCredit won't make the procedure cheaper, but it can help you pay for it when you are temporarily short on cash.You can apply for a credit line at: https://www.carecredit.com/apply/.

, After you have located providers through ASPCA or animal shelters, call them and ask how much they charge to spay or neuter cats. If the price is more than you can stomach, tell them so. Because many providers consider it an important public service, some will lower their prices.Do not be aggressive when negotiating. Don’t offer a price—this might offend the veterinarian. Just tell the veterinarian that you don’t have enough money and ask if they are willing to be flexible with the price.

, This is the distance from the center of the knob to the near edge of the door. The majority of the locks are 2 3/8 inches (6 cm) for interior doors and 2 3/4 inches (6.5 cm) for exterior doors. Many locks today will be adjustable to fit either size, but you will want to make sure.

, Most locks are 36 or 38 inches above the ground. Make sure that your lock is consistent with the other locks in your house. Measure from the lock to the finish.

, Purchase a lock at a home improvement store or a locksmith that meet the specifications you took. You don’t have to buy the exact same lock as last time if you were unhappy with it. Just make sure it fits the measurements of your door.


Make sure you buy a lock that comes with a template. That will make the installation process much easier.

, There will generally be two or three screws that you’ll need to remove with a Philips head screwdriver. Remove the screws and then pull each half of the doorknob away from the door. You will be left with an open hole in the door. 








You may also need to use a wire tool or a paper clip. If your knob or lock has no screws on it, insert a paper clip into the small hole on the side of the doorknob. This should depress the knob latch and will allow you to pull the knob off., The latch is the final piece of lock equipment you need to remove. After you unscrew the two screws it should come out easily. The lock is now ready to remove.








, When you buy a lock from a store it will come with a cardboard template that shows you exactly how the lock will fit onto the door.Place this template over the hole in your door and make sure that everything matches up. If the template does not match up exactly with your hole then it means you bought the wrong lock.









Take the lock that you removed back to the hardware store and ask them for a lock of that size.

, Place the new latch directly back where the old latch was. It’s best not to reuse your old screws. Insert the new screws into the door edge to steady the latch.







, Put one half of the doorknob or lock through the outside part of the door and the other through the inside part the door. They should meet in the middle and connect. Don’t force them together, but allow them to slide together easily. Now replace the screws. Remember that the screws will be replaced on the inside so that intruders can’t unscrew your lock from the outdoors. Test the lock to make sure it is sturdy.








, Lock and unlock the door a couple of times to make sure the lock is working correctly. Have someone try to enter from the outside so that you don’t accidently lock yourself out if your key doesn't work. The lock should not be jiggling at all – if it is unsteady that means you need to retighten the screws. You also may not have connected the locks correctly.








, Damaged locks put you at a higher risk for a break in. Check once a year to see if your lock has severe rust or tarnish. Rusted locks can be forced open easily, and an intruder can notice the rust from the outside., If your house was broken into then that means the security of your locks are compromised. They might have a key and plan to do it again, and if they forced the door open then the lock probably isn’t strong enough.

, It’s a good policy to change the locks when you get a new roommate. The old roommate may have given you the old key back, but there is no guarantee that he didn't get it duplicated before that. You probably trust your roommate, but this is a good safety precaution.

, Even if you think you just lost the key under the couch somewhere, there is always a chance that it was stolen. Replace the locks in order of security priority. This means that locks leading to the outside are the once that you should deal with first, followed by locks to different rooms inside.

, Once you unscrew the knob there may be a ring sitting around the cylinder that enters into the hole in the door. If your door has a retainer ring you'll need to buy a new lock/knob that includes a retainer ring., Some locks have color-coded pins that allow you to rearrange their order without replacing the entire knob. This allows you to get multiple uses out of a single knob. Remove the knob and check if there are multi-colored pins in it. If so, you may only need to buy new pins rather than an entirely new lock., If your new lock isn't working it may be the keys and not the lock. Sometimes locksmiths make errors.


If your new key isn't fitting into the lock or is getting jammed it may be the fault of the key. Don't assume you installed the lock incorrectly. Make sure you gave the locksmith the correct key to copy."

Check that the deadbolt performs its job as advertised.",How to Change a Lock," This is usually printed on the latch, but can also be found on the key — useful if the plate has been painted over, or is a leftover from an old doorknob set. You won't need an exact replacement of your old lock, but knowing the brand, style, setback, and features of the old lock will help ensure that your new lock looks, fits, and works as advertised.


Replacing your lock with another of the same brand and basic style will help ensure that no modifications will have to be made to the door itself.;
, Often, front and back door locksets will be larger than interior locksets. Knowing in advance which size you need will save you headaches later.


Draw a tape measure from the latch edge of the door to the center of the doorknob or deadbolt lockset. Most contemporary locksets are either 2-3/8 inch (6cm) or 2-3/4 inch (6.5cm) diameter.
The bolt or latch in many new locksets are adjustable for both, but make sure before leaving your hardware store to keep from having to backtrack.
Older locksets may vary in size, but are generally smaller, requiring more extensive carpentry (and greater woodworking skills). If that's what you have, try checking vintage renovation stores for a ""new"" lockset.

, Release the springs holding the knob in place. The doorknob should come off easily, leaving you only with a decorative cover. If the springs on the knob cannot be accessed before removing the decorative cover, remove the interior cover first before removing the knob.

, The screws for the cover may or may not be visible once you remove the knob. If they are, simply remove them and set them aside. If they are not visible, look along the edge for a hole, where they sometimes hide an allen bolt. If there are no holes or hidden screws, the plate is simply snapped in place — use a thin flathead screwdriver to gently pry off the cover, exposing the locking mechanism.

, Remove the screws that secure the interior lock section to the exterior half. These are found on the inside half of the knob. Once both screws are removed, simply pull each half of the knob straight away from the door.


Don't let the door close or you will either have to re-insert the half of the knob with the ""blade"" on it or use a screwdriver or butter knife to unlatch it.

, Remove the two screws from the latch assembly on the side of the door. Remove the strike plate on the door jamb as well.


If your new lock is the same brand and model as the old one you may be able to keep your existing latch plate and strike plate. Hold the new plates up to the old and compare — if they're the same, it is better to leave the old ones in place if possible. Removing and replacing screws tends to weaken their hold in the door.
If you can't get the new screws to bite, you may have to shove a small splinter of wood (or two) into the screw hole and snap them off flush with the edge of the door (toothpicks work well for this).
Another alternative is to purchase longer screws, but make sure that the screw heads are identical to the ones provided by the manufacturer or they may not seat properly and cause problems.

, Chisel out any uneven recesses in the latch so that your new latch will fit perfectly. Place the new latch into the recess. If the new latch rests snugly into its recess, don't worry about adding the screws until the remaining parts of the lockset have been installed.


If the new latch has trouble staying put in its recess, fit the screws into the latch and then tighten down.

, Slide the outside parts of the lockset into the hole, through the latch assembly. Holding them roughly parallel to the floor, insert the inside set, sliding it onto blade of the outside part of the lockset. Insert the mounting screws, and tighten them down.


Make sure that the strike plate lines up with the new lock. If it doesn't, it's advisable to replace the strike plate.

, Test this with the door open. If something is amiss, you don't want to be locked out!

, Your new doorknob should be fairly springy, opening and closing with ease.

, This will allow you to have access to the interior of the deadbolt lock.

, A couple of quick turns using your Allen wrench (or hex key — they're the same thing) should be able to loosen the deadbolt mechanism from the inside. Remove the inside cylinder and outside cylinder.


If your deadbolt lock has decorative caps over the screws, use a punch and hammer to knock the caps off center and then grab them with pliers. Then use the Allen wrench to unscrew the mountings.

, This is not the best option, and it requires a strong drill bit, but it will help remove a deadbolt.


From the outside, drill into the cylinder in the middle of the deadbolt lock where the tumblers are found. Remove the tumblers.
Alternately, drill on both sides of the deadbolt, halfway between the top and bottom. Drill through on both sides until the exterior covering comes out.
Insert a screwdriver into the latch and turn the knob lock.

, Take the old deadbolt out and clean up any remaining debris or dust from the deadbolt recess.

, Make sure the top of the deadbolt is facing up. After lining it up, load in the deadbolt and fasten to the side of the door with two Phillips screws. Be careful not to over-tighten.


Once you've installed the deadbolt on the side of the door, use a screwdriver to test the functionality of the deadbolt.

, The tongues of both cylinders are flat on one side and curved on the other. Fit both tongues into the cylinder so that the flat sides are touching each other. For ease of installation, fit one cylinder in first, and then the other; fitting in both at the same time can be difficult.

, Screw in both screws and fasten tightly, but not so tight that the deadbolt is off-center.

, Fit your key into the deadbolt and turn. Look for a nice fluid turn. Check that the deadbolt is centered.

, Once the screws have been removed, the faceplate can be pulled out. Generally, you can pull it straight out, though in some cases you might need to twist the faceplate counterclockwise before pulling it out., Once the interior faceplate has been removed, the faceplate that is on the outside of your door can also be pulled out. You will probably need to twist it counterclockwise before pulling it out.


Sometimes there will be screws in the exterior faceplate as well. If so, unscrew these as well, before attempting to pull it out., The set plate is the piece of metal that faces the doorframe and connects the bolt to the doorframe. It is the part of the lock that is visible on the side of the door. There should be a screw on the top and the bottom of the set plate. Remove both screws., The bolt is the piece of metal in the center of the deadbolt that, when locked, fits into the jamb hole in the doorframe to hold your door closed. It is usually attached to the set plate, so that once the set plate is unscrewed, both can simply be pulled out.In some cases, the set plate and bolt are not one piece. If so, once the set plate is removed you can pull out the bolt separately.
If you did not unlock your deadbolt prior to removal, you can still remove the bolt. Just look for where the bolt connects to the locking mechanism and use a screwdriver to twist it open., To ensure that your new lock fits in its opening, use a tape measure to check the size of the hole where your lock used to be. Then, measure the “setback,” the distance from the doorframe to the hole. Finally, measure the thickness of your door.


In most newer homes these measurements are standard. The hole is generally 2 1/8th inches. Most bolts are also adjustable to accommodate the size of your setback. It doesn’t hurt, however, to be cautious and get all measurements., Bringing these with you will make it easier to find a lock that fits your door. It will also make it possible to get a new lock that is compatible with your keys.To establish that your existing keys still work, you might want to get a deadbolt that is produced by the same brand as your current deadbolt. The brand name should be the set plate, the piece of metal that holds the bolt and connects it to the door frame.

, Tell them about the measurements you took and show them the lock and key. They should be able to point you in the direction of models that are compatible with your door.

, Deadbolts are stronger than other types of locks and are your primary defense against forced entry. Thus, you should buy strong locks from a reputable brand, to ensure that no one can force the door open.


Your new deadbolt should have a metal strike plate.
The bolt in the deadlock should fit all the way into the jamb hole in the doorframe.
The screws that hold the deadbolt into the door should be at least three inches long., The bolt and set plate should slide directly into the hole in the side of your door that faces the doorframe. If the bolt and set plate are separate, slide the bolt in first, and then put the set plate over it to secure it in place., There should be holes on the top and the bottom of the set plate. Insert screws into both to secure the set plate and bolt into place.


This should seem familiar; each step in installing your deadbolt will mirror the steps you took to remove the deadbolt.
Every time that you insert a screw, you can begin by using your hands to get the screw in place. Eventually, however, you should progress to using a screwdriver or power tool to ensure that screw is fully inserted and secure., The facepiece that is on the outside of your door should have a long piece of metal sticking out of it. Your bolt should have a hole in the center. Slide the piece of metal into this hole in the bolt., The interior facepiece should have two pieces of metal that fit into two holes in the bolt. Slide the interior facepiece into these holes.Altogether, there are three holes that run along the bolt. One, in the center, connects the exterior facepiece to the bolt. The other two, to the left and the right of this central hole, connect the interior facepiece to the bolt.

, The interior facepiece will have two screws on it. The exterior facepiece might have screws, but this varies depending upon the model. Slide these screws in with your hands and then insert them securely with a screwdriver or power tool.The screws should come standard with the deadbolt. It is best to use the screws that come with the deadbolt too ensure that they fit correctly

, Some deadbolts have decorative covers that conceal parts of the facepieces. Consult instructions to verify if and how these are to be installed. Generally, they are snapped on to the facepieces.

Unlock and open your door.,
Measure your lock.,
Remove the retaining screw.,
Insert the key into the lock.,
Remove the cylinder.,
Put the key into the new cylinder.,
Replace the lock.,
Screw the retaining screw back into the lock faceplate.",How to Change a UPVC Door Lock," There are different variations for upvc door locks, so initially, try to identify the brand of the lock on your door. Some common brands include Avocet, Fulltex GU Ferco, Mila, Roto, and Yale, just to name a few.Knowing the brand of the lock will help tremendously in finding a replacement lock.


Upvc door locking points can come in various styles (hook, deadbolt, pins, etc.). However, regardless of the intricacy and style of the locking point, the lock cylinder is normally the universal portion of the lock that gets replaced.;
, Open your door so you can see the inside edging of the door and the side of the lock faceplate. You will need to have full access to the side of the lock faceplate to detach the lock.

, Usually, upvc locks are sized and measured using two standard reference points. The first point of measurement is from the center of the circular portion of the keyhole on the front of the door, up to the center of the square spindle (the connection point where the handle of the door is located). This is called the PZ measurement. The second point of measurement is from the center of the circular portion of the keyhole, to the edge of the lock plate (the exposed plating on the inside edging of the door). This is called the backset measurement.


Some locks will have two spindle holes, but always take the measurement from the upper spindle hole.A common example of measurement dimensions is 92 millimeters for the backset, and 35 millimeters for the PZ.
Depending on the width of the door, the length of the locking cylinder may vary. To measure the length of the cylinder, measure horizontally across the width edge of the door, from one keyhole to the other (interior keyhole to the exterior keyhole).

, Located in the faceplate on the side of the door, the retaining screw is usually even with the bottom of the lock cylinder and keyhole.Use a screwdriver to twist the retaining screw to the left, loosen it, and remove it from the faceplate.


This screw is what holds the lock in place.
The lock cylinder is the portion of the lock within the door. It is the encasing into which the key is inserted through the keyhole.

, Once the key is in the lock, turn the key either right, or left about 10 degrees. The direction of your turn will vary depending on which side of the door you’re on. You’re turning the key only about 10 degrees so you can line up the cam (the inner latch of the lock) with the body of the lock, and remove the lock cylinder smoothly.


This part takes a little bit of trial and error, so try turning the key both directions.

, Experiment with gently wiggling and tugging on the key while it’s inserted in the lock and turned to both the right and left positions.In one of the turn positions, the lock cylinder should start to come loose with moderate tugging. Once the cylinder comes loose, pull it toward you, out of its socket.

, Now that the original lock cylinder has been removed, take out the key from the original cylinder, and place it into the new lock cylinder.


The new lock cylinder can only be secured into place with the key situated inside.

, Turn the key in the new cylinder so the lock cam is flush with the body of the cylinder. The cam needs to be flush with the cylinder body so it can fit smoothly back into the empty socket. Insert the new cylinder all the way into the socket, just as the old cylinder was positioned. Turn the key a little bit so the lock cam can correctly position itself within the socket. Leave the key in the lock.


You are essentially reversing the steps you took to remove the original lock cylinder.

, Insert the retaining screw back into the screw hole. Use a screwdriver to twist the screw to the right, and secure it back into place.


Test the lock by turning the key both right and left a few times, and gently tug on the key when it is turned to both the right and left position. This tests to see if the lock cylinder is secured in place.
Only remove the key from the lock once the retaining screw is secured back into place.

A cat that has not been spayed is significantly more likely to suffer from uterine infections and breast cancer, both of which are deadly in a majority of cases., A female cat will go into heat four to five days every three weeks, making nearly a third of the time the owner spends with their cat hellish. A female cat in heat will scream incessantly, making obnoxious noises that can make it impossible for the owner to get a good night’s sleep., A female cat in heat is also more likely to mark its territory with urine. Even if it knows how to use the litter box, it will spray all over the house to attract the attention of a potential mate., A cat who has not been neutered is at risk of developing testicular cancer. Unsurprisingly, this can be unpleasant for the cat, expensive for the owner, and likely sad for your whole family; testicular cancer is often deadly., Unfixed males are more likely to suffer from prostrate disease and hernias. While these are less dangerous than cancer, they can require surgery., A male cat who has not been neutered will do anything to get outside of the house and go out on the prowl for a mate. Once the cat has escaped, it is subject to many life-threatening dangers: cars, predators, and competing males. If it does manage to mate, it puts itself at a high risk of contracting STDs.Intact males suffer from extraordinarily high rates of feline HIV., Intact males produce an especially pungent urine. Furthermore, they are more likely to want to mark their territory. Thus, they are likely to stink up much of the house and ruin furniture., Intact male cats are aggressive because their hormones are telling them to fight with male competitors. If they don't have any male cats to fight with, they are inclined to take out their feelings on their owner instead., Intact males feel a strong need to mark their territory. One of the ways that they do that is by scratching. While an neutered male can be distracted with a scratching post, an intact male will want to scratch everything in its territory., You can’t expect other people to have the same priorities as you. The arguments that make sense for you, might not be the ones that matter to someone else. Try to figure out what matters to the other person and tailor your arguments to that.For example, if the other person complains about the expense of neutering their cat, talk to them about how expensive it can be to buy new furniture or pay to fix an illness that could have been avoided if their cat were fixed.

, People are turned off by arguments that are too extreme or emotional. You are more likely to get your point across if you recognize the other person’s concerns and explain why they should consider an alternative point of view.


For example, if the person is really drawn to the idea of their cat having its own babies, explain that although that might be nice, there are already kittens in need of help., The movement to neuter pets saves millions of lives yearly. In the 1970s, about 24 million dogs and cats were put to sleep annually because of overpopulation. In 2007, that number had dropped to 4 million. This huge drop is largely due to campaigns that have made fixing pets more popular., An intact cat will suffer from a variety of behavioral problems. Most of these issues stem from a single cause: the cat is more interested in finding a mate than it is in establishing a relationship with the owner.

, On average, fixing a cat costs about $200. However, there are many programs that subsidize the procedure, making it possible to perform it for much less money. The ASPCA offers an online database of low-cost neutering services; search this database to find a provider nearby., While fixing cats can be affordable, many of the problems associated with an intact cat are not. Raising a litter of cats is not cheap nor is replacing ruined furniture. It is extremely expensive to treat some of the diseases that intact cats are susceptible to.For example, an operation to fix a hernia can cost as much as $1,000., For a variety of reasons, many people are drawn to the idea of natural birth. Remind them that parenting is about more than giving birth. Adopting and saving an unwanted kitten is better parenting than birthing a litter they can't care for., Encourage the person you are working with to visit a veterinarian they trust to discuss the benefits of neutering or spaying their cat. Alternatively, look for professionally-made materials; The American Humane Association offers a 30-page brochure entitled “The Case for Early Neutering.” The brochure is accompanied by a video. If the person you are trying to persuade doesn’t believe you, you can give them these items as a gift.

",How to Use a Chisel1,"

A paring chisel has a thin blade beveled at an angle of 15 degrees.



 


Paring uses the knife-like edge of a paring chisel to slice off small amounts of wood.






When paring, push the paring chisel into the wood while the wood lies flat on a surface.





;
,


The more secure the fit, the more control you will have when pushing with force into the wood.

,


When you pare, you are not taking off large amounts of wood, so you can pare with or against the wood's grain.

Use a jigsaw.,
Use a circular saw.,
Use a mitre saw.,
Use a reciprocating saw.,
Use a door trimming saw.",How to Cut Wood Using Various Power Tools," Various blades might be fitted to suit different types of solid wood, such as plywood, chipboard as well as hardboard. Jigsaws are specifically suited to cutting timber. It can create straight or curved cuts.


When generating a cut, position the wood on the bench and make sure the cutting area is clear to make certain you don’t cut through anything you don’t want to.






Cuts are made as the sharp edge rises upwards through the timber. Which means neatest side will be on the underside. Bear this in your mind while placing the particular timber for a cut, specially if chopping solid wood which has a coated or melamine surface.






Jigsaws often have adjustable rates of speed and are available having an airborne dirt and dust removal ability and also variable base dish perspectives.;
, These are used for cutting timber, MDF, block board and ply board. It makes direct line cuts. Like with a jigsaw, the actual cut is done as the cutting blades rise up-wards through the timber, so the neatest side will be on the underneath.


When making a new cut, place the actual timber coated surface upon a bench and make sure the cutting area is clear to make sure you don’t cut through what you don’t mean to.






Circular saws generally feature varying chopping capabilities, adjustable speeds, a variable line of cut indicator, a depth adjuster, a remote lower guard lift lever, a dust removal facility and safety switch. Various attachments as well as blades usually are obtainable.






Circular saw accessories are also available, which may be fitted to the top of your electric drill.

, This is used for all types of general-purpose joinery, such as chopping skirting planks, dado rails and architraves. It can make virtually any cut when a specific angle is essential, which includes angled and titled cuts. A mitre saw is a ‘fixed’ saw meaning that it doesn’t need to be moved manually because it slices the actual wood. You must therefore consider extra care to never place your hands in the way when generating the cut.


To use a mitre saw, you should make certain that the timber you would like to cut is actually clamped tightly as even a tiny amount of movement can impact the cut as well as result in a poor joint.
A mitre saw should be used with a saw stand or possibly a work table to support your timber and saw whilst you carry out the work.
Chop saws are the simplest forms of mitre saws. These include a saw that's suspended above the actual timber on a hinge. To produce a cut you pull the saw straight down towards the timber. How big your blade determines the size of cut you can create.
Sliding mitre saws tend to be more superior. As well as including the same capabilities as a chop saw, they also have a sliding feature in order that the saw can be slid along the rail or perhaps guide. What this means is they are often used to produce a much wider cut than a chop saw will make.

, Reciprocating saws are often used for demolition work instead of building work. This is because they are most suited to making quick and ‘rough’ cuts. They are not suitable for any sorts of accurate cutting. They're therefore normally used for jobs such as taking out old window frames or even cutting up tree roots. It makes rough, basic cuts - similar to the kind of cut a chain saw would likely create. Because of its shape, a reciprocating saw can often be used to make cuts in places that other power tools would be not able to accomplish.


A reciprocating saw needs to be held in both of your hands when in use. Proper care has to be taken to keep your saw steady. Placing the end of the tool against the wood may help maintain it in place.






When utilizing a reciprocating saw it is possible to find the blade caught in the timber, so you should take care to plan your cuts carefully and be sure that, wherever possible, your wood you might be cutting can not ‘close up’ around the blade. Lubricating the blade can also help.
Reciprocal saws often have adjustable speed settings. Some are available with a blade change facility that doesn't require a different tool (while some need an Allen key). Several reciprocal saws feature an orbital blade motion which often can help make cutting faster.
Cordless reciprocal saws are available, which may be a good choice for use in difficult-to-reach areas.

, This is used for trimming the lower edges of doors whilst they're in position. It makes simple shaping cuts. A door trimming saw ought to be held in both hands and really should be used slowly and steadily.


Your saw ought to be used when the door to be cut is shut. You need to push the actual saw gradually into the bottom of the door until the edge meets the door and won't allow you to push the saw any further forwards. You should then slide the saw very carefully along the fringe of the door with a steady speed, keeping the sole-plate in contact with the floor to guide you. You must stop prior to reaching the edge of the door to ensure you don't damage the frame. Your cut can then be finished while the door is open.






The only distinction between different types of door trimming saws is the depth of cut and also height of the blade from the ground.

Clamp the two pieces of wood firmly with wood clamps.,Wipe away any excess glue before it dries.,Clean the joiner according to product directions before storing when not in use.",How to Use a Biscuit Joiner,",

Use as many biscuits as needed to secure the pieces of wood.

,

The biscuit process allows some leeway in aligning the pieces of wood, so perfect alignment is unnecessary.

,,,

Apply pressure to release the blade, allowing it to cut the wood.
The joiner's cutting blade will retract while it is idle.
The crescent shaped slots may be longer and larger the joiner biscuit; this allows a user to better align the joined pieces just before the glued joiner biscuit starts to set.

,,,,

Upon being clamped, the compressed biscuit will expand to fill the crescent shaped slot and create a strong bond between the two pieces as it dries.

Use a firmer chisel for deeper cuts in both heavy and light woodwork, such as shaping a mortise.,
Keep the flat side flush against the wood.

,
Use a mallet, not a hammer, to drive the firmer chisel because the mallet absorbs and distributes the impact.

,
Take thin shavings when cutting or risk splitting or damaging the wood.,
Raise or lower the chisel handle to control the depth of the cut.

,
Repeat action and sharpen blade as needed.

",How to Use a Chisel2,"

The cutting edge of a firmer chisel is straight and square.






It is ground and sharpened like a plane iron.






The firmer chisel has a heavier blade than a paring chisel, and its angle is 20 degrees.







,,,


Give the chisel a sliding or shearing motion when cutting across the end grain of wood.

",How to Use a Chisel3,"

Gouges have curved points and long handles.






There are 8 standards of degrees to the curves, and the gouges come in several widths.






Gouges can be used to carve into wood or to remove wood around a design to bring the design into relief.

",How to Use a Chisel4,"


Masonry chisels are broader and shorter than woodworking chisels and are typically made of a single forged piece of metal.
Masonry blades are typically duller than those of wood chisels as they are meant to work by force rather than by finesse.

,


Do not fasten or drill into concrete that is not older than 28 days.
Look for an anchor that will drill into older concrete if it has aged. Certain anchors, such as the Tapcon screw, will not work on concrete that is old because lead threads can deteriorate and the screw will not go in deep enough.

, These will use most of the same anchors as a concrete base, but a wedge anchor and a drop-in anchor should be avoided.

, You do not want the end of the fastener to get too close to the bottom of the concrete when you drill. This can create an unsupported edge which can reduce the amount of weight the concrete can hold.

Experiment with the various functions your saw is equipped with to learn the correct procedure for using them when applying the tool to a finished project.",How to Use a Power Miter Saw," These saws come with a variety of functions and in several sizes, so choose one that will meet your needs. Here are a few differences in these machines:


Size. This is determined by the blade diameter, and normally varies between 8 and 12 inches. The diameter of the saw's blade will determine how wide and thick the material you are cutting can be.
Action. There are three types of power miter saw:
Standard miter saw: The basic, standard miter saw will make a perpendicular cut through a board or other material at angles typically ranging from 45 degrees left (counterclockwise) to 45 degrees right (clockwise). An angle scale and locking device keep the blade correctly aligned.
Compound miter saw: Adds the ability to tilt the blade at a specified angle from vertical, to cut a compound angle.
Sliding miter saw: The saw slides along a horizontal arm, similar to a radial arm saw. It can be pushed through the material being cut, which allows a much wider piece of stock to be sawed.

;
, In electrical tools, the power to do the job the tool is designed for is generally considered the amperage rating of the tool, or its horsepower. A standard miter saw is designed to draw (use) between 12 and 15 amps or electrical power, and operate on 120 volts (in the U.S.). For cutting tough or very large pieces of stock you may need to select an industrial rated machine which is much heavier and may require special wiring.

, Once you have decided which saw you want, and what features it will need, you need to get your hands on it. These machines can cost between $80.00 USD to over $1,000 USD, so if the project is a one time event or you are on a tight budget, you may consider if purchasing one is a good investment.

, For very long material cutting, you may find it necessary to work on a floor, but a work bench or improvised work table makes operating the saw much more comfortable.

, The first section will be general safety rules like wearing safety glasses, using the correct type of extension cords, and making sure the electrical power is sufficient for the machine. Make sure you understand the tool's requirements before operation as overloaded electrical circuits can damage your saw or cause a fire in your workshop.

, You should find an angle scale and an angle indicator on the front of the saw's bed, a blade guard, a power switch or trigger, and a mechanism for locking the saw in position when it is not in use. Other features, such as laser guides, saw tilt scales, and locking clamps for securing the workpiece vary from saw to saw.

, Raise and lower the saw several times before turning it on to become familiar with the path the blade takes as it will saw through the stock. This will make it easier for you to avoid accidents when actually cutting with the saw.

, Start with a small piece of scrap material to test the saw with. Make sure it is long enough to fit securely against the backrest of the saw's bench and to allow you to hold it in position while it is cut. Very short pieces of stock are difficult to cut safely without clamps, and cutting near the end of a piece of stock can allow the drop (the piece that is cut off) to be thrown by the blade when the cut if complete.

, When joining stock cut at different angles, you will find basic shapes are fairly easy to fit. To join two pieces of stock at a given angle, the angle of the cut on the end of each piece is half the angle of the joint. For example, to make a square (90 degree) corner, cut the ends of two pieces of stock at opposite 45 degree angles.

, Practicing with scrap material will make it less likely you will make a mistake when you cut your finished work. Notice that the blade begins cutting the stock on or near the front edge (unless it is a very wide piece), so you will want to make cut marks or measurement marks on that side of the stock, or use a square or angle square to mark your work piece all the way across before cutting.

, Once you are comfortable with your knowledge of the tool's features and performance, you should be able to begin the project you chose the miter saw for.

Use a 3/16 inch (0.47 cm) or a 1/4 inch (0.63 cm) fastener for smaller, light objects that can be held while you fasten them to concrete.
Use a 3/8 inch (0.95 cm), 1/2 inch (1.75 cm) or 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) diameter fastener on objects of medium weight, that require assistance from others to fasten to concrete.
Use a fastener with a 5/8 inch (1.6 cm), 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) or 1 inch (2.54 cm) for heavy objects that must be mechanically fastened to concrete.

, A female fastener will have a screw or bolt drilled into it, and will require a setting tool and a hole spotter.

, Some fasteners have an exposed steel rod sticking up through the nut.

Take a powerful magnet and place it on the wall surface.,
Move the magnet around in a logical grid type pattern over the surface of the wall; feeling for a slight 'pull' on the magnets passage over the walls surface.,
The feel or strength of the 'pull' will depend on the power of the magnet and the size and depth of the fastener.

Gather your tools.,
Switch off the water supply.,
Remove decorative parts of the faucet.,
Take off the faucet's handle.,
Remove the stem with pliers.,
Take out the old cartridge with pliers.,
Bring your old parts to a hardware store, if necessary.,
Determine if you need to replace the o-rings.,
Insert the new washer.,
Reassemble the stem.,
Put the cap back in place.,
Plug the drain before beginning the process.,
Make sure the replacement washer is an exact fit.,
Call a professional plumber if replacing the washer does not fix a leak.",How to Change Washers in the Kitchen Faucet," This way, you'll be prepared for the process. To disassemble your faucet, you'll need the following:A pair of pliers
An adjustable wrench
A phillips or flathead screwdriver;
, You do not want water pumping into the faucet while you're disassembling it. Under your sink, you should see a couple of valves just behind the pipe.Switch these valves to the off position. Turn the valves clockwise to do so. This will prevent water flow while you work.
Turn the hot and cold faucets on to drain the water between the spigot and the shutoff valve.

, These are the small caps on top of the faucet. They may read ""hot"" or ""cold."" You can remove them by simply inserting a flathead screwdriver just underneath the caps. Gently pry the cap off. It should come off without too much effort.It's a good idea to wrap the screwdriver cap in a cloth prior to removing the cap. This will prevent you from chipping or denting your faucet.

, You should see a small screw just underneath the cap. This is attached to the washer. You must loosen it to remove the handle of your faucet. Use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screw.Once the screw is removed, gently wiggle the faucet's handle back and forth. Eventually, it should come loose. You can then pull out the handle.
Not all faucets have a handle. If yours does not, you can skip this step. However, you should still remove your washer's screw.

, The stem, sometimes called the bonnet, is a small circular piece that sits above the washer's valve that looks something like a donut. Gently clamp your pliers around the bonnet and pull it out of place.Some stems cannot be pulled out with pliers. If you can easily twist the stem, this means you will need to twist it off instead.
Make sure to place the stem in a safe place. You will need it later when inserting the new washer.

, You now have access to the cylinder shaped washer contained inside your faucet. Using your pliers, pull the washer out of place.There are o-shaped rings, called O-rings, that suction the washer to the faucet. You will have to grip your pliers tight and pull with a little force to remove the washer.

, If you've never disassembled your faucet before, you may not know what kind of washer you need. If you don't already have a replacement on hand, take the parts you removed to a hardware store. Find an exact match for each part.If you're unsure where to look at the hardware store, ask a worker.

, Worn out o-rings can cause a faucet to leak as easily as a worn washer can. If the leak is coming from the base of the faucet, the o-rings are probably worn. Place a pair of replacement o-rings at the bottom of the faucet before inserting a new washer., You simply slip the washer in place. From here, you're basically working in reverse order. The washer should fit the same as the one you removed.Make sure you place the washer in the exact same position as the original one.

, Either screw the stem back on, or place it back over the washer. Then, place the screw you removed back in place using your Phillips head screwdriver. Make sure you tighten the screw to get the stem secure.If you removed the handle, put it back in place before placing the screw back in place.

, This the easiest part of the process. You simply snap the cap back on. Now, your faucet should no longer leak. You can turn the water back on and run your faucet.Once the cap is in place, turn the water valve counter clockwise to switch the faucet back on.

, This assures that nothing goes down the drain. There are a lot of small parts involved when you replace a washer. They can easily slip out of your hand.If you don't have a plug for your faucet, simply place a wet rag over the drain.

, You want to make sure the o-rings fit the washer exactly. Otherwise, your water will not run properly. If you are uncertain what type of o-rings you need, take the old o-rings to a department store. You should be able to find a match there., There are many problems that could cause a leaky faucet. Worn-out seals, loose parts, or broken plumbing can cause a leak. These problems will be difficult to correct on your own, so you should contact a professional."

Mark the back of the wrench at the center of the drive of the wrench.,
Measure from that mark to where you would position your hand while using the tool and make a second mark (or a line).,
Secure the square head in a bench vise, making sure no other part of the wrench touches the vise.,
Align the torque value to the setting of the distance you got in step 2 x 20 pounds (9.07 kilograms).

,
Dangle a 20 pound (9.07 kilogram) weight from marks you drew in steps 1 and 2.

,
If a click from the tool is heard, lift the weight and slowly move it toward the wrench head until the clicking stops.,
Measure the distance between the square head and the click mark you just made.,
Use the formula Ta=Ts x(D1/D2).,
Check your math several times and adjust your wrench accordingly.

,
Note that the distance that matters is the distance from the center of the drive head to the place you hang the weight.",How to Calibrate a Torque Wrench1,";
, Determine the distance between the two marks.

, Move the handle to a horizontal position.

,,, Make a tentative mark and repeat the step to make sure the spot is correct.


If there is no click at first, move the weight away from the head of the wrench until you hear a click. Make a tentative mark and repeat to make sure the spot is correct.
You can make your mark more definitive after two or more checks land in the same spot.

, This is the other number you will need for your calibration equation. To find the true amount of torque, multiply the distance by 20 pounds (9.07 kilograms).

, Plug your numbers into this equation, remembering that Ta is torque applied, Ts is your torque setting, D1 stands for the distance you found in step 2 and D2 stands for the last distance you found.

,, It has nothing to do with where you usually put your hand. It is foot pounds. The feet refers to the moment arm. In this case, the moment arm is the distance from the center of the drive head to the place you hang the weight.


So, if you hang the weight 1 foot (0.3 m) from the drive head center line and hang a 20# weight you are applying 20 pounds x 1 foot (0.3 m) to the drive head or 20 foot (6.1 m) pounds.
If you hang the weight 6"" from the center line of the head, you would have 10 foot (3.0 m) pounds ( 20 pounds x 0.5 feet (0.2 m) = 10 foot (3.0 m) pounds. The wrench handle should be parallel to the floor when you do this but for more exact measurements, account for the extra weight of the pivoting wrench handle itself, measured from the hang point. This would typically be ~1 lb for inch pound size wrenches and ~ 2 lbs for foot lb size wrenches if you don't have a weigh scale.

Use an aerosol lubricating oil.,
Spray the oil right onto the hinge.",How to Stop Squeaky Door Hinges1," Lubricating oil is perfect for fixing squeakiness. Suitable oil may include WD-40, 4-in-1, or other brands. Ask your hardware retailer if you're not sure what's best for your needs. (See ""Tips"" below on alternatives in a pinch.)


The oil used should be capable of penetrating the hinges. An alternative to aerosol is to get a can or container that has a thin nozzle able to access the hinge area.;

Choose a strong magnet.,
Enclose the magnet in heat shrink tubing.,
Seal the heat shrink tubing.,
Glue the tubing into an empty pen case.,
Test it out.",How to Use Magnets to Locate Studs2," The strongest readily available magnets are neodymium magnets, also known as rare earth magnets. You can use any size of magnet, but a small one will work fine (say 1 cm / 0.4 inches).

, Place the magnet inside heat shrink tubing of the appropriate diameter. One flat surface of the magnet should be visible. This gives the magnet a flexible wrapper, making it easy to manipulate.

, Heat the heat shrink tubing until it holds the magnet securely in place.

, Take the inner components out of an old, pen. Place the heat shrink tubing inside the pen, with the magnet poking out at one end. Hot glue it in place. The pen case will give you greater control over the magnet's position, and reduce the effect your hand has on the magnet's response.


Test the pen case first to make sure it does not repel or attract the magnet.

, Hold the pen very lightly, such that the tip is free to move. Now test it out against a wall. Move vertically, then horizontally to find the stud. Once you find a stud, mark the wall with a regular pen to note its position.

Take a test cut; does it give a full-width shaving?",How to Make Your Own Try Plane,"

The main (centre) block is 600mm x 75mm x 62mm.
These are the finished dimensions you want to end up with.
You will also need to rip two side blocks (cheeks).
Each should have 600mm x 75mm x 8mm finished dimensions.;
, Square the edges.,

Choose one face to be the sole and measure back 200mm from the toe.
Scribe a line straight across the sole at this distance.
This will be the location of the mouth which houses the cutting plate and collects the shavings.
Mark up each side of the centre block at an angle of 50°.
These lines start at the scribed line and angle back toward the heel of the centre block and, when cut, will form the bed for the cutting plate.
Draw a second line on each side starting 4mm forward of the scribed line, but angled at 60° in the same direction as the other layout lines.
This will be the abutment for the wedge (which allows depth adjustment and secures the cutting plate).

,

(Discard the resulting wedge.)
The larger section is the bed block (with the 50° ramp).
The smaller piece is the toe block.

,,,

Scribe a line straight across the top face of the block 170mm back from the front edge.
From this line, mark the sides of the block at 65° angled toward the heel of the toe block.
Again, on the sides of the block, strike two more lines.

Start from a point 3mm above the sole and located on the 65° line you just laid out.
Extend a line upwards, this time at a 75° angle (toward the toe of the toe block).


The laid out area defines the throat opening and the throat walls will be 8mm inside the cheeks as described in the next sub-step.

,

Using a marking gauge set at 8mm, mark down the front edges and the top face of the toe block on both sides. These lines delineate the sides of the throat area. A portion of the 8mm stock on the toe block will be removed to act as a wedge abutment (to hold the wedge firmly in place against the iron).
On the top face, draw a line diagonally from the front edge (8mm out) back to the front of the throat. At the point where the two angles meet on the side of the throat, mark this height along the front. Make a diagonal line from this height out to the sides of the block, stopping 3mm up.

,

Clamp the toe block in a vice.
Cut to the waste side of the layout lines using a tenon saw.
Make additional cuts to make it easier to chop out the waste.
Remove the material between the lines using a chisel and mallet.
Cut the top section of the throat first, then re-position the block in the vice and saw and chop out the lower section.
With the waste material removed, use a paring chisel to clean up the surfaces.
That completes the cheeks and centre blocks.
They are ready for gluing up.

, This one needs to be 58mm wide by 190mm tall cut from 3mm thick tool steel., Leave it so the iron touches the front about 1mm up inside the throat, then start gluing up the cheeks and centre blocks.

Apply glue to the sides of the centre blocks and sandwich them between the cheeks.
Make sure the gap for the mouth is correct and start applying clamps.
As you apply clamping pressure, the pieces may move around, so a gentle tap to re-align the pieces may be needed.
Use plenty of clamps in the glue-up, particularly in the throat area.
Leave they assembly overnight to cure.

,

Make sure to remove any glue on the bed and abutments, otherwise it will interfere with the fit of the iron plate and the wedge.

,,
This refinement makes it easier to remove shavings from the throat.,,

Clean up the worst of the saw marks with a belt sander, then
bring the surfaces to a finished condition with a cabinet scraper.

, Clean up the saw marks with a block plane, and shape the wedge on a disc sander.,

It must fit snugly against both sides simultaneously.
Mark the abutments with a pencil to see where the wedge fits and where it doesn’t.
Cut back the ears as necessary.
Shape the top edges and cut a chamfer (bevel) on them after the wedge is fitted.
Check to see if the iron will project through the mouth. (Probably not.)
Clamp the plane upside down in the vice and, using a small mill file, remove small amounts from the front edge of the mouth.
Test the iron again and continue removing small amounts with the file until the iron just peeks though the mouth.
Refit the wedge and make a test cut. You may need to open the mouth a little more to allow the plane to cut without the shavings choking in the mouth.

,, Use rasps and sandpaper to complete the smoothing.,

Make sure the iron won’t foul on the tote when you try to remove it.
Drill out the waste and then chop and pare the mortise to a snug fit.
Glue the tote in place.

, The chamfer on the front end of the plane will need to be finished with a chisel.,

Sand the plane body lightly with 320 grit paper.
Coat plane and wedge with boiled linseed oil.
Repeat and remove excess after ten minutes.
Leave to dry overnight.
Rub a coat of paste wax onto the plane (avoiding the bed and abutments), then buff it off.

,

Use offcut stock.
This serves as a place to rest your thumb while you are planing and also as a place to strike when you want to remove the iron.
Drill a 25mm hole 25mm deep in the front of the plane, 110mm back of the toe
Glue the knob in place, and the plane body is finished.

, Fit the wedge and set the iron projection for a fine shaving – the iron should barely protrude from the mouth., If it doesn’t, make sure the iron is projecting squarely. If you find the plane won’t consistently take a very fine shaving, you may need to flatten the sole.

Stick a sheet of 120-grit abrasive paper on a flat surface and, with the plane iron retracted but the wedge fully tightened, give the plane a firm push over the sandpaper.
Take a look at the sole to see where wood has been removed. Give the plane another stroke or two to ensure that any bumps have been removed, and test the plane again.
Finally, you may need to open up the mouth a little if you find that it’s choking when you try to take a thicker shaving.

",How to Stop Squeaky Door Hinges2," Look for the round hinge pin that sits between the flat plates on the hinge. This hinge pin holds the hinge plates together.

, Be careful not to slip, so as to avoid scraping your knuckles.

, This will remove any dirt or rust which might be causing the squeak.


If you roll the pin on a flat surface, you might see if it is bent. If the pin is bent, you can put it on a cement floor and tap it with a hammer to straighten it out.






You can also scrape paint and grime that collects in the hinge with a nail after you remove the pin.






If you sand down the pin with sandpaper, you can remove the rust and the pin will fit more loosely and the hinge will have less resistance.

Use silicone caulk if you need a neutral-colored waterproof sealant.There are two main types of caulk – silicone and acrylic latex.,
Use acrylic latex caulk if you need a colored water-based sealant.,
Remove existing caulk from your work surface.,
Clean the surface.,
Use blue painter’s tape to mask off areas and ensure straight lines.Apply strips of the tape to protect any surface area where caulk shouldn’t appear.",How to Caulk1," Silicone caulk is a completely waterproof and flexible sealant. It will bond with a lot of different kinds of surfaces. Silicone is a good choice if you’re caulking outdoors, or wet indoor spots like around shower stalls and bathtubs. It’s quite expensive and doesn’t do well in high-traffic areas.Silicone caulk is ideal for areas of high moisture that need to remain mildew-free.
Silicone caulk is typically only available in three shades – clear, white, and almond.Silicone caulk cannot be painted over.;
, Acrylic latex caulk is easier to use and cheaper than silicone. It can be used for a wider range of projects and it comes in a rainbow assortment of colors to match bathtub and sink glazes. Acrylic latex is water-based so it’s best used indoors. It is not as durable as silicone caulk and won’t last as long.Since acrylic latex is water-based, it is possible to paint over it.Acrylic latex caulk shrinks up more than silicone. It also dries much harder.
Acrylic latex caulk is not suitable for tiling or areas with direct sunlight.

, Old caulk must be removed before you add more. Use a utility knife, razor scraper or painter’s tool to cut away existing caulk. Use quick, sharp strokes. Keep in mind that metal blades aren’t ideal to use around plastic fixtures. Use a tool with a plastic razor blade, which you can get at any home improvement store, to avoid damaging the plastic.For concrete and masonry applications, use a wire brush for removal.Home improvement stores sell caulk remover products that will chemically remove old caulk. Keep in mind that these products will damage plastic surfaces.

, Use a brush or vacuum to remove any remaining debris from the work area. Scour the surface clean with a dry, nonabrasive sponge or pad.Use rubbing alcohol to remove soap scum and body oils from a bathtub or shower stall.Dry the area completely before you begin caulking.


Both kinds of caulk need a clean surface, but if you’re using silicone, it’s imperative that you remove all debris and residue from the surface before you begin.
For silicone clean up, soak a rag with mineral spirits (such as turpentine) and wipe the surface down with it. Then use a damp rag to wipe the surface down again.

, Put them down vertically on either side of the area you plan to caulk. The painter’s tape acts as a guide to ensure your caulk lines are straight and uniform. The end result will look more polished and professional if you use painter's tape.

",How to Caulk Around a Toilet," If your toilet already has a caulk seal around the base, you’ll want to remove it rather than apply caulk directly over it. You can find dedicated caulk removal tools in home improvement stores, which have special blades made to scrape and scoop caulk. Run this tool along the joint between the toilet and the floor to scrape out any old caulk.


If you don’t have a caulk removal tool handy, you can also use a utility knife to remove old caulking.
You can make an old caulking job easier to clean up by applying commercial caulk removers before scraping. If you do, make sure to check the product’s label to prevent any possible damage to your floors or toilet.;
, After clearing the joint of any caulk, you’ll want to get the area as clean as possible. Scoop out any debris, such as paint chips, dirt or rust. Use a general purpose bathroom cleaner and a rag to clean in and around the joint. The cleaner you can get the area, the better of a seal you’ll be able to apply.


If any water or other liquid gets in the joint, do your best to dry it. If you can’t quite reach it, make sure to allow enough time for it to dry properly. Caulking over liquid will trap it, which can cause damage to your flooring.
After cleaning, you can wipe the area with rubbing alcohol to disinfect it., Not only will this help you get a straighter, smoother seal, but it will prevent any caulk from getting on your floors. Put masking tape on either side of the joint, one following the toilet’s base and the other along the floor. If you’re particularly worried about your caulking abilities, you can use a second strip on either side to double the width of masking tape and protect more of your floors.Since most toilets have a round base, you’ll probably have to use several strips of tape to properly follow the curve. Tear up pieces a few inches long, and apply them to the floor, following the curve of the toilet’s base.Alternatively, you can also buy masking tape that comes curved and is more flexible than typical tape. This will save you some time in taping up your floor.

, Caulk usually comes in a tube. 100% silicone caulk is best for use on a toilet since it’s more resistant to water than other types of caulk, such as acrylic. Silicone caulk is typically a bit more expensive than other types, but that extra money will save you the problems that come with an improper seal.


It’s important to match the color of your caulk to your bathroom. White usually fits most styles, but you’ll still want to give this some thought., While the tube holds the sealant, the gun is what allows you to deliver it. The main part of the gun is the plastic body, which holds the tube. The plunger is a metal pole with a flat end that runs the length of the body. At the back of the body, you’ll find a metal release, usually shaped like a trigger. Push this forward and you’ll be able to pull back the plunger. You can then insert the caulk tube and push the plunger into the back of the tube., Pull on the trigger and keep the caulk gun at a 45 degree angle. Keep your pressure on the trigger consistent and the movement of the caulk gun slow and smooth to ensure a better seal.


Pushing the caulk rather than pulling it along will make it more difficult to create a consistent seal.
You may want to have a folded up piece of cardboard available nearby to lay the caulk gun onto if you need to stop for any reason. This will prevent caulk from dribbling onto your floors., Run your finger along the caulk seal. This will push caulk deeper into the joint, sealing it more fully. You’ll also be scooping off any extra caulk, resulting in a cleaner joint. You can dip your finger in water or rubbing alcohol if you’re worried about the caulk sticking to your finger.You can discard any caulk buildups directly in the garbage. If you placed a piece of cardboard down to hold your caulk gun, you can simply collect the caulk there for disposal later.
If you’re worried about dirtying your hands or irritating your skin, you should wear gloves for this step.
You can also buy dedicated caulk finishing tools to clean up your seal, however this isn’t strictly necessary., If you used masking tape, it should peel off quite easily. Pull the tape at a 45 degree angle away from you. If you got caulk on the tape, be careful as you peel it to avoid spilling the sealant on your floors. Masking tape usually shouldn’t leave any sticky residue, but if it does, you can use a product like Goo Gone to get rid of it., You don’t need to apply any cleaning solution to the sponge; you’re relying on its absorbency to clean up any spilled caulk. Pass the sponge around the base of the toilet, picking up any caulk around the joint. Make as many passes as you need to clean up the joint, rinsing the sponge between passes.,,"

Know your purpose for the staple gun.,
Look for a well-made, solid staple gun.,
Choose staples.",How to Buy a Staple Gun," This will determine what type of staple gun to purchase. The types available include:


Hand/manual staple gun. This is useful for small projects that don't require repeated use, especially for around-the-house projects, such as repairing screens, sticking wires to skirting boards, fixing upholstery. It can also be used for craft projects, including stapling fabric or canvas to screens/frames.
Powered staple gun. This runs on electricity and can be light or heavy duty, depending on your needs. This is good for stapling carpet, heavy upholstery (leather, vinyl), adding trim and moldings, etc.
Compressed air powered staple gun. This is for heavy duty, repeated work, such as on a building site. Such guns use staples in various types and sizes. If the gun does not have a depth/power control, then you need a good add-on air regulator to keep the air pressure to the best pressure and keep the crown from being ""countersunk"" (cutting right through roofing paper, underlayment or deep into shingles), ruining or damaging and weakening materials that may more easily rip loose and fly away in a high wind.;
, Whatever the purpose you need a staple gun for, it should come from a reputable manufacturer and be of excellent quality.


Check the construction to make sure that it is welded together properly, that there are no loose/missing/crooked parts, etc.
Check for rust resistance and durability.
Is there an easy way to tell whether the staple magazine is full, partially loaded or needs refilling?
Ask the store assistant for a test demonstration. How does it feel to hold? If you have any issues with your hands or wrists, check that the staple gun feels comfortable and is adequately ergonomic for you. This is vital if you will be using it for long periods at a time.
Ask about the warranty provided.

, Home-use staplers use lengths up to 5/8 inch (15mm). There are also staples with a specially curved crown that can fix thin cables on to walls or skirting boards.
Builders and roofers may use staplers that fire wide-crown roofing staples of 1 inch (~ 2.5cm) crown and depth up to 1.5 inches (3.75cm).

Get a high quality caulk gun made of sturdy metal.,
Cut the caulk tube’s nozzle to the desired bead size.,
Insert the caulk tube into the gun.,
Place the nozzle tip on the spot where you need to begin caulking.,
Check the neatness of your bead.,
Pull the painter’s tape up.The tape needs to be pulled up before the caulk dries.",How to Caulk2," Caulk guns cost between five and ten dollars at any home improvement store. Make sure you get one that is made of heavy duty metal. Solid-shaft caulk guns produce very smooth lines and generally get better results.Solid-shafts are a better choice than notched-shaft caulk guns., Trimming the nozzle allows the caulk to flow freely out of the tube. You can control the size of the caulk line, also called the “bead,” when you make the snip. The further down on the nozzle you make the cut, the wider the bead will be. For quick, basic jobs, trim the end of the nozzle straight across.Cut the nozzle at a 45-degree angle if you need more precision and control.
Check inside the nozzle for a foil seal. If it does have a foil seal, use something sharp and narrow (like a long nail) to puncture it.

, There will be a long, hooked rod on the end of the gun. Pull it all the way back. This will open up the gun so you can insert the caulk tube. Situate the tube base into the gun first. Then tilt the nozzle end of the tube into the top part of the gun.Turn the hooked rod so that the hooked part is facing up and the side with the teeth is facing down.


Gently squeeze the trigger to get the caulk flowing and then it’s ready to use., Apply gentle and steady pressure to the trigger. Caulk will begin to flow. Pull the caulking gun along the line or area to be caulked. Keep squeezing the trigger gently as you go to ensure a continuous release of caulk. Move the gun at a steady speed. The caulk will form ""beads"" as it emerges. Try to get one continuous, even bead along each length.


Keep a damp rag (dipped in water or mineral spirits) handy, for fast wiping of mistakes.
It is always better to use less caulk than too much. You can always add more on a second pass.

, Don't run the length of the bead any longer than around 5 feet (1.5 meters) before stopping and assessing your work for neatness. If the caulk bead already looks neat and uniform, leave it alone. If it needs to be smoothed out, use a caulking tool, a putty knife, your finger (dampen it first) or a damp rag to pull along the joint and press the caulk smooth.It is far easier to neaten caulk as you go, while it is still damp. Get to it within two to five minutes of application for best results.If you don't stop frequently to neaten the caulk, the earlier portions might dry before you can neaten or mend errors. You’ll have to scrape off dried caulk if you want to neaten it.

, Lift the edge of the tape up slowly. Pull it away from you and at a 45-degree angle.Do this carefully and try to avoid touching the fresh caulk. You can pull the tape up immediately after you create the bead if you like, but definitely get it up within a few hours. If you go any longer, the caulk could skin over.


Allow the caulk at least 24 hours to cure before disturbing it or getting it wet."
"
Use a squeeze tube for small, interior caulking jobs.,
Caulk overhead with a pressurized can of caulk.,
Practice applying caulk first.",How to Caulk3," A caulking gun isn’t necessary for all caulking jobs. Use 5 ounce squeeze tubes when you have a small, indoor project.Remove the cap from the squeeze tube, then trim the end off the nozzle with scissors. For the most control over caulk flow, cut the nozzle at a 45-degree angle.


Squeeze the bottle with steady pressure so your bead will look uniform and neat.

, Pressurized cans are usually about 7 ounces a piece. They are ideal when you need to create a uniform bead while you’re caulking overhead, or any other time you are caulking with only one hand.You should be able to obtain pressurized cans of caulk at any home improvement store.

, If you’ve never caulked before, it’s best to get a feel for how the caulk flows before applying it. Even if you have caulked before, it’s a good idea to get a feel for the specific caulk you’re using for this job. Practice by applying caulk on the inside corners of a cardboard box or on some other throw-away material.


Work on creating a steady flow and uniform bead.
Once you’ve got the hang of it, move on to the actual caulking task."

Find the locking mechanism.,
Bend the tie’s loose end back.,
Depress the bar.,
Pull the loose end back through the cube.",How to Open Cable Ties1," If you look at a ready-to-use cable tie, notice that one end tapers to a point, while the other is capped with a tiny cube. When used, the pointy end is fed through a slot in the cube to form a loop and then pulled tight. The cube is the locking mechanism that keeps the tie from worming back out through the slot, so look for that.





;
, Notice how the loose end tends to curve over the locking mechanism once it’s fed through it. You want access to that side of the cube, so bend the tie back to expose it some more.







, Look underneath the loose end where it comes out of the cube. Use your fingernail or any tool you may need (like a nail or pocket-size screwdriver) to push down on the bar that you find there. This releases the locking mechanism.







, Keep pushing down on the bar. As you do, use your other hand to slowly draw the loose end back through the cube. Once it’s out, you’re all done!

Gather the tools and materials you will need for the project.,
Select lumber of similar thickness.,
Edge and size the boards so they fit snugly together along their edges.,
Mark the location of the biscuits to be glued between the boards.,
Set the cutting depth of the plate jointer.,
Cut the biscuit slots with the plate jointer.,
Clean out the biscuit slots to remove sawdust or debris.

,
Fill the slot about one fourth full of a good quality wood glue.,
Spread a small amount of glue along the edge of the board you are mating to the one you have inserted the biscuits into.,
Fit the two boards together and make sure they are properly aligned.,
Sand or plane down the finished side of your laminated plank when the glue has completely dried.

",How to Make a Biscuit Joint," It is very helpful to have a good, flat, sturdy workbench for this woodworking operation. Briefly, you will need at least the following:


A plate jointer, also known as a biscuit jointer.
A saw.
Measuring tape.
Square.
Wood glue/ Carpenter's glue.
Clamps.
Lumber.;
, You can laminate lumber together of differing thicknesses if only one side will be visible, or if you have access to a power plane, but ideally, you will begin with sized, square material of the same thickness.

, If a beaded look is desired, a rounded edge common in nominal lumber is acceptable, as seen in the scrap material used for the illustrations.

, Generally, the distance between biscuits will determine how strong the finished plank will be, and thinner lumber will hold better if the spacing is kept to a minimum. One inch nominal lumber joins fairly well at a twelve inch biscuit spacing, two inch lumber can be cut at sixteen to eighteen inches on center with good results.

, For single row biscuits, you will want to place the joints at the center of the board's edge, for double rows, cut each row at one third of the boards thickness.

, Make sure the lumber is secured or held tightly, as considerable force is required to push the blade into the work piece.

,, Press the precut biscuits into the slot, and notice if excess glue runs over its edges. This excess can end up on the finished surface of your work, making it almost impossible to stain uniformly later if you desire to do so.

, Fill the respective biscuit slots one fourth full as you go.

, Then clamp them tightly and allow the glue to dry.

"
Refrain from trimming them.,
Anticipate wear and tear.,
Use reusable cable ties instead.",How to Open Cable Ties2," If you want to use the same tie over and over again for different things, don’t cut the loose end off once it’s in use. All that excess may be unsightly, but remember: once you snip it off, you’ll only be able to use that tie for bundles of the same size or smaller., Keep in mind that single-use zip-ties are designed for just that. Even though you can technically undo them and use them again, expect the plastic teeth to possibly wear down the more you undo and retie them. Also keep in mind that manipulating the locking mechanism can damage it. The tie may develop a looser grip over time, so avoid using old ones to tie anything that really, really needs to be secured., If you’re constantly using and reusing single-use ties for short-term projects, consider another option. Invest in some cable ties that are specifically designed for reuse. These cost a little more (and may not be ideal to use for one long-term project since they are much easier to open), but the money may be worth it if it saves you time."
"
Worm your hands out.,
Spring the locking mechanism open.,
Snap the tie in two.",How to Open Cable Ties3," First, be sure to squeeze your hands into fists with the tops of your hands facing up when your hands are being bound. This will make them as big as possible (and thus make your restraints larger, too). Then, when no one’s looking, relax your hands and turn your palms toward each other. Focus on worming your thumbs out first to make the rest easier.Always try this method first, since another method will require you to tighten the cable tie (which will make trying to do this afterward much tougher).

, If you’re being held with other prisoners, coordinate between yourselves. Find a shim of some sort that’s small and firm enough to manipulate the bar inside the locking mechanism. Have one person use that to free the other by lifting the bar from the zip tie’s grooved tracks. Once it’s lifted, pull the tie free of the mechanism.Possible shims could be a nail, screw, fork, pin, pen, pencil, key, or the corner of a credit card. If nothing’s in reach, try your fingernail.
This is method works best with a partner, but you can also attempt it on your own.

, For this, you want to hold the cable tie’s locking mechanism (which is where the tie is weakest) in between your hands. Use those and/or your teeth to get the mechanism into position and pinned between your hands or balls of your thumbs. Then grip the tie’s loose end between your teeth and pull to tighten it as much as possible. Next:Raise your hands above your head and then swing them down in toward your stomach as fast as you can.
As you swing them down, focus on touching your shoulder blades together and sticking your elbows out like wings.
Repeat if needed until the locking mechanism snaps in between your hands.

Determine the size and depth of the thread that you want.,
Refer to a technical publication for the exact measurements for hole size.,
Drill the hole to the correct diameter and depth.,Secure the workpiece firmly.,
Apply an appropriate lubricant such as oil, WD-40, or a proprietary formula.,
If the tap set has a separate handle or rod, insert it.

,
Hold the tap in line with the hole and turn it clockwise.,
Every few turns, back the tap out (counterclockwise/anticlockwise) to clear away chips of loose material.,
When the tap has reached the required depth, back it out, clean out chips and any cutting fluid or lubricant, and try your screw or bolt in it.

",How to Use a Tap," What size screw will go into this hole?;
, For example, if you want to use a 1/4-20 screw then you must use a #7 drill bit. Your set of taps may also state the appropriate hole size to use with each tap.

, Remember that taps generally cannot thread all the way to the bottom of a blind hole, so a blind hole must be a bit deeper than the required thread depth.

,,


WD-40 is not any good as a lubricant on anything other than aluminum because it is just Kerosene (with the CAS of aviation grade fuel oil).
Never lube cast iron unless you can flood it with a water based coolant which is just for chip flushing. Otherwise use compressed air.

,, Try to keep it very straight as you turn, this is important. You may feel the material breaking.

, This is especially important in a blind hole, one that does not go all the way through the workpiece.

Purchase a grommet kit.,
Punch a hole in your fabric.,
Insert the grommet with the raised end.,
Snap the grommet together.",How to Install Grommets1," Commonly available in outdoors, craft, and home repair stores, grommet kits are available to reinforce holes in fabric, usually in the neighborhood of 5 dollars. The kit will include:

Grommets
Washers
A base to stabilize the grommets as you install
A grommet hole punch
Some larger kits will include grommet pliers, which are used to pinch the grommets into placeAdditionally, you'll need a hammer and scissors for the job;
, The hole punch included is usually just a small metal cylinder with the correct diameter for the grommet. To punch a hole, you'll hammer the punch into the fabric to start a hole that you can finish with scissors.

Flatten your fabric over a stable surface (a spare piece of scrap wood or a workbench is appropriate) and hold the punch in place as you would a nail, where you'd like the grommet and hole to go. Give a few sharp taps with the hammer.
If you can't punch straight through with the punch included, make a small X in the hole outline you've created with an X-acto or fabric knife, and cut the inside of the circle out.If you're installing lots of grommets (like in a home made shower curtain or tarp) make sure you go around the edge and measure the distance between the grommets before you go punching holes.

, A grommet kit should consist of two varieties of pieces that will snap together to create each grommet. Get one of each and compare them. One will have a raised inner edge and will look taller than the other half, and you should insert this end into the bottom of the fabric, facing up.

Place the other half of the grommet on top of the raised edge on the other side of the fabric.

, If you've got grommet pliers, all you need to do is ensure that both sides are aligned properly and use the pliers to snap both sides of the grommet together.If your kit came with a base (a small, nipple-shaped metal platform) then you should use the base to stabilize the grommet as you hammer it together. It shouldn't take much more than a single good whack with the hammer.

Choose the right auger for the job.,
Don steel-toes boots and leather gloves.,
Break up the soil if it's especially hard.,
Hold the auger upright by the handle, with the shank perpendicular to the ground.,
Dig down about 12 inches (30 cm).,
Return the auger to the hole and continue digging and dumping the dirt.",How to Use an Auger1," You need to consider what kind of soil you'll be digging in, how many holes you will dig and whether you have someone to help you run the auger.


A hand auger can be operated by 1 or 2 people. This is best if you only have 1 or 2 holes to dig, because it takes a lot of work to turn the handle.
A power auger uses a gasoline engine to turn the auger, but it can be dangerous if it runs into a rock or other obstruction. The auger will stop suddenly, which can cause the top to jerk, knocking you off your feet or even breaking your arm.
A wheeled auger is a power auger mounted on a wheeled frame, so there is less chance you'll be injured if it stops.
A tractor auger is safest because you operate it from the tractor seat. If something goes wrong, you are at safe distance.;
, If you use a power auger, you also need hearing and eye protection. Don't wear loose clothing that can be caught in the auger.

, Your auger will work best if the first few inches or centimeters is easy to dig into. Use a spade, digging tool or clamshell post-hole digger. If the ground is still too hard, soak the area with water.

, Begin turning the handle or start the motor.


If a powered auger stops suddenly, immediately release the throttle or hit the kill switch stop the motor.

, Raise the auger out of the hole and dump the dirt off the blades. If you don't regularly dump off the dirt, the auger will become too heavy to raise easily. It may even get stuck in the hole.

, Most post-holes are about 3 feet (1 meter) deep. Augers can dig much deeper, however, if you use extension rods.

Wear safe clothing and eye protection.,
Wear ear protection if drilling regularly.,
Protect your lungs when necessary.,
Choose the correct drill bit.,
Fit the drill bit firmly into the chuck.,
Clamp small pieces together.,
Handle the cord safely.",How to Use a Drill Safely1," Avoid baggy clothing or dangling jewelry that could catch in the drill as you lean over it. Wear safety goggles or glasses that cover the sides of your eyes, to protect them from flying debris.;
, A handheld electric drill produces about 90 decibels, which is just enough to cause hearing damage after prolonged exposure.Most cordless drills are quiet enough that hearing protection is not necessary.


Impact drills (hammer drills) are the loudest handheld drills, producing over 100 dB. Hearing protection is recommended whenever using them.

, If the project kicks up a lot of dust, wear breathing protection. A dust mask is only good for short-term comfort. Use a respirator if you drill regularly or for long periods of time, or if the material you are drilling is a known respiratory hazard.


Each respirator is rated for certain types of hazards. Make sure the one you use is suited to your project.

, Using a bit made from the wrong material can cause the bit or the material you're drilling to break. You can use a general-purpose bit on most wood; a masonry bit for stone, brick or concrete; an HSS (high speed steel) bit on most metals; and a carbide or diamond-tipped bit on very hard, brittle surfaces such as porcelain, glass, or glazed tiles.There are many specialized bit designs, so consult the drill manual or bit manufacturer if you're not sure which bit to use.


When drilling a hole for a screw, there's an easy way to find the right size bit. Hold the screw up directly behind the bit. The bit should hide the shaft of the screw from view, but the screw threads should still be visible on both sides., The chuck is the clamp in the ""jaws"" of the drill. This holds the drill bit in place as it spins. To replace a drill bit, make sure the drill is off (and unplugged if corded), then loosen the chuck by rotating it. Depending on the drill, you may be able to do this by hand, or you may need a chuck key located in a compartment in the top or handle of the drill.Insert the drill bit into the chuck, then tighten again. Make sure the bit is straight and secure, and remove the key before you turn on the drill.


Each chuck has a maximum size. Most drills made for home use in the United States have a chuck of size 1/4"", 3/8"", or 1/2"". The shaft of the drill bit must be smaller than this size (but the tip can be larger).Run the drill and watch the bit spin in the air. If it wobbles from side to side (or looks like a blurry cone), the bit is bent or not secured correctly. Discard bent bits, since they can easily break during drilling., If you are drilling into a small, loose piece, clamp it down firmly before you drill. Do not hold the piece down with one hand while drilling, as the drill could slip and injure you., If the drill has a cord, never leave it stretched across a pathway when not in use. Never pick up the drill by the cord. If you are drilling in a wet or muddy area, use a cordless drill instead.If you need to plug the drill into an extension cord, check the drill manual for the minimum wire gauge (or go with 16 gauge if you're not sure).Do not chain multiple extension cords together, use indoor extension cords outdoors, or use an adapter to plug a three-prong cord into a two-prong outlet."

Choose your reamer.,
Place the material you need to bore in a vise or steady it with clamps.,
Drill the hole.,
Apply lubricant to the material.,
Ream the hole.",How to Ream a Hole1," Hand reamers work best in soft materials such as wood or plastic. Begin by choosing the size reamer to which you need your hole bored out. A hand reamer will have a square shank and depending on the size of the reamer, you’ll fit the shank into either a tap wrench or crescent wrench to turn it.A hand reamer allows for great accuracy after considerable practice.;
, Since a reamer is a precision tool, you don’t want your material moving around as you ream the hole.

, Because a reamer is an enlarging tool and not a cutting tool, you must drill out the hole with a standard drill bit before reaming it.You want to use a drill bit approximately 0.016” smaller than your reamer to ensure that you don’t oversize the hole.


For instance, if you know that you need to ream your hole to 1/2”, then you’d want to drill the hole first with a 31/64” drill bit.Drilling a hole too small and leaving too much material left for the reamer to clear can lead to the reamer deflecting off the material, which is called chatter. Chatter leads to poor finishes and can also damage your reamer.

, Based on the material into which you’re boring, you may need to apply cutting fluid to lubricate the reamer. Though less common with hand reaming, it’s not unheard of.

, Now that the hole is prepped, you can use your tap wrench or crescent wrench to ream the hole. You will likely have either a straight flute reamer or a left-hand spiral flute reamer, which refers to the direction of the blades that actually enlarge the hole. In the case of a spiral reamer, you will need to turn counterclockwise.

Select the right grommet.,
Measure.,
Push one side of one flange through the opening.,
Install grommet edging.,
Feed the wire or tube through the opening, if you didn't already.",How to Install Grommets2," Grommets used for this purpose are typically made of rubber or plastic and are used to protect against the sharp edge of a hole in a panel that wires need to pass through. Is it to provide a finished appearance on a desk? Does it need to provide some strain relief (protection against sharp bends) to the object passing through it? Select one that's right for the job.


Typically, the holes and grommets are larger for these purposes, which serve to reinforce the edge of the hole and protect the objects (usually wires) that pass through.

, Measure the object that will pass through the grommet, as well as the diameter of the tube, wire, or bundle that you wish to protect. If you're putting a fitting or connector through the grommet, make sure to take that into account.

Measure the hole that the grommet will fill or, if possible, drill or punch correct the hole according to the recommended size for the grommet. Smooth the edge of the hole as much as possible.

, Work all the way around the opening, bending the grommet as required. If you have access to the opposite side of the material, it may help to pull the grommet through or simply to hold it in place.


A soft object, such as this plastic soldering aid, can assist in pushing the grommet to fit the hole.






A dab of personal lube (K-Y for example) around the outside and slot of the grommet is very helpful, it's oil free, inert, and dries clear with no residue. Wipe off excess.

, Typically, a small plastic covering will be used to finish the edge. Choose the correct thickness of grommet edging for your edge and push it over the edge you wish to protect. You may have to pull the sides open a little bit with your fingers as you go.


Depending on the application, a bit of appropriate adhesive can help to hold the edging in place.

, When you've installed your grommet, you're ready to feed the wires through the hole, confident that they're protected.

Choose an auger, also called a pipe snake.,
Push the cable into the drain until it hits the obstruction and stops.,
Turn the crank or use the motor to turn the bit clockwise.,
Stop cranking when the bit stops turning.,
Push on the auger to see if it pushes the obstruction through.,
Watch to see if the drain becomes unclogged.,
Consider working on large or stubborn obstructions from the other side.",How to Use an Auger2," Consider factors such as the age of the house and what plumbing problems you've had before. While a simple auger may not be adequate for every situation, a power auger requires you to lug a heavy spool around to clear the smallest drain clogs.


A hand-cranked auger is a long cable with a threaded bit that pushes down into the drain until it contacts the obstruction. A hand-crank turns the bit, which bores into the obstruction
A power auger may come with its own motor or it may be attached to a drill that uses a motor to spin the bit. The motor makes getting through the obstruction easier and faster. You can reverse the motor to help pull the obstruction out of the pipe.

, Leave 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) between the drain and the crank so you can operate it easily. If you have too much cable between the drain and the crank, it may kink.

, The bit will push against the obstruction, which may be enough to clear it. If not, the bit will bore into the obstruction.

, If you are using a power auger, stop when the motor slows down.

, If that doesn't work, pull to see if you can break up the obstruction. If you are using a power auger, reverse the motor a few times to see if the obstruction breaks up.

, If it doesn't, use the auger again to bore into more of the obstruction. Keep working until the obstruction is completely broken up and the water drains well.

, Find the clean-out pipe, which may be close to the house on the outside or in the basement or crawlspace. Thread the auger through the clean-out pipe and work as before.

Drill a pilot hole.,
Drill with steady pressure.,
Adjust the clutch.,
Avoid overheating the drill bit.,
Do not force a jammed bit through.",How to Use a Drill Safely2," In many cases, you'll get better results if you start with a drill bit a little smaller than the final hole size. Drill a shallow ""pilot hole,"" then switch to the larger bit to finish the job. The pilot hole will help prevent your drill bit from slipping, and reduces the chance of splitting wood or other damage.Very brittle materials such as ceramic and glass require extra care. Make a small ""X"" in masking tape where you want the hole, to help prevent slipping and chipping. Instead of drilling the pilot hole, place the drill bit over the X, then gently tap it with a hammer to create a small dent.

, Hold the drill steady and push it into the material you're drilling. If it takes more than light force to drill the hole, you're probably using the wrong bit., Each drill has a twistable collar to adjust the torque, often with a series of numbers on it. The higher the number, the more torque (rotational force) the drill will apply. If you are having trouble penetrating the material, increase the torque. If you are over-driving screws (burying them too deep), or if drilling too deep could damage something, lower the torque.


Some models mark the highest torque with a drill bit icon., If you are drilling through hard materials or drilling at high speeds, the drill bit will encounter an immense amount of friction. This can rapidly overheat the bit, to the point where it becomes red hot or burns the material you're drilling. Start at low drill speeds, and only increase the speed if the drill isn't moving smoothly. If you're drilling through hard materials, or drilling many holes in any material, stick to slow speeds and pause occasionally to give the bit a few seconds to cool down.


When drilling glass, ceramic, or stone, give the bit a steady supply of water to keep it cool. One way to do this is to build a ""dam"" out of putty or modeling clay around your drilling area. Fill the area with water so it flows down into the hole. ""Pump"" the bit up and down so the water can reach the tip.Even if the drill bit doesn't look hot, give it time to cool down before touching it.

, If the drill bit gets stuck in the material, don't try to force it out by running the drill. Unplug the drill, separate the bit and the chuck, and remove the bit using manual tools."
"
Affix the material firmly to a flat surface with clamps or a vise.,
Use a center drill bit in the press to mark your hole accurately.,
Drill with a bit 0.016” narrower in diameter than the hole desired.,
Clear the hole.,
Affix your reamer into the drill chuck.,
Ream the hole.,
Stop the spindle before removing.",How to Ream a Hole2," If you’re boring completely through the material, use a set of vise parallels to help support it while keeping it raised enough to drill through.If you do use parallels, tap the material down with a rubber mallet to ensure that it’s tight against the parallels and won’t move once you begin drilling., A center drill is a much smaller, pointed bit that allows you more precision in starting a hole at an exact mark before drilling it out with a larger bit.A dab of cutting fluid should be applied when boring tougher materials such as metals to lubricate the bore and extend the life of all bits., As with hand reaming, you still want to use a 1/64” smaller drill bit to bore your hole before reaming.A drill press will allow more control and accuracy than a hand-held drill, especially on harder materials and denser metals, which is why a drill press is recommended.

, Especially when reaming a metal piece, you want to clear any filings from drilling the hole before reaming. Use a small round file to work away any filings., You’re now ready to place the reamer into the drill chuck and tighten it down. For high precision jobs, you may also consider using a floating reamer holder. A floating reamer holder allows the reamer to float, meaning it gives the reamer just enough movement to guide it into the hole in case of a slight misalignment., You can now lower the press and ream the hole. However, you want to set your press to roughly 1/3 of its usual speed because reaming with a press should be done at a much lower RPM.Once again, make sure that you use cutting fluid to lubricate the reamer.

, Once you have reamed your hole, you want to turn off the press and allow the spindle to come to a complete stop before you raise the press.This will help ensure a smooth, clean ream.

"
"
Set your material firmly in the lathe spindle.,
Bore an initial hole with a center drill bit.,
Drill a pilot hole.,
Ream the hole.,
Retract the reamer while the lathe is still running.",How to Ream a Hole3," Since the lathe will spin your material instead of the drill bits, you want to make sure that the point you want to bore is at the center of the axis.

, As with a drill press, you still want to begin by using a center drill bit to begin your bore with more precision.If your lathe doesn’t have a coolant delivery system, ensure that you apply lathe coolant for every bore for cleaner finished products and to extend the life of your tools., Using a reamer on a lathe is still intended only to enlarge an existing hole, so you’ll need to first use a slightly smaller drill bit to create the hole. Similar to reaming with by other methods, you want to use a drill bit approximately 1/64” smaller than the reamer you’ll need to use.Once more, ensure that you’re applying plenty of cutting oil as you bore the hole.

, Once you have drilled the pilot hole and cleared any filings, you’re ready to ream the hole. Insert the reamer into the chuck of the tailstock (the portion that you move forward toward the lathe spindle), power on the lathe, and ream the hole.For high precision jobs, you can use a floating reamer holder here like you can for reaming in a drill press to correct for any minor misalignment.

, To ensure the smoothest ream possible, retract the tailstock while the lathe is still running by steadily pulling it straight out. Do not ever reverse direction of the spindle like you would to back out a drill bit."

Understand the parts of the Vernier caliper.,
Read the scales on your Vernier caliper.,
Check the scale of your smallest divisions.,
Clean the object you are measuring.,
Unlock the screw.,
Close the jaws.,
Slide one of the jaws against the object.,
Read the main scale where it lines up with the sliding scale's zero.,
Read the Vernier scale.,
Add the numbers together.",How to Use a Vernier Caliper," A Vernier caliper has main jaws that are used for measuring external diameter, as well as smaller jaws that are used for measuring the internal diameter of objects. Some models also have a depth gauge. The main scale is fixed in place, while the Vernier scale is the name for the sliding scale that opens and closes the jaws.;
, Each scale of your caliper reads like an ordinary ruler. Typically, a caliper has a main scale marked with numbered inches or centimeters, plus smaller divisions between them. The sliding (Vernier) scale should have a label engraved on it to tell you what it represents.


If the sliding scale doesn't have a label, you can assume the numbered divisions represent 1/10 of the smallest division on the main scale. For example, if the main scale's smallest lines represent 0.1 inches, then each numbered division on the Vernier scale represents 0.01 inches.
The main scale is ""life size,"" while the sliding scale is magnified for easy reading. This magnification system allows the Vernier caliper to measure more precisely than a ruler.

, Before making a measurement, count the number of lines between two numbers on your Vernier scale. Use this to determine how much distance each of the smallest lines represents.


For example, the numbers on a Vernier scale represent 0.1 inches, and there are five unnumbered lines between them. 0.1 inches ÷ 5 = 0.02 inches, so each of the unnumbered lines represents 0.02 inches.

, Wipe it off to make sure there’s no grease on it, and that there’s nothing in the way that will interfere with an accurate measurement.








, If your Vernier caliper has a locking screw, loosen it before you begin.









Twisting something to the right (clockwise) will tighten it, while twisting it to the left (counter clockwise) will loosen it.

, Before measuring anything, close the jaws and faces to zero out the reading so that you get a precise measurement. If you don’t do this, you won’t start with your scales lined up at zero when you take your measurement, and you will have to correct for the zero error.








For example, if the zero on the sliding scale lines up with 1 mm on the fixed scale, you have a positive zero error of +1 mm. Subtract 1 mm from all measurements to get the right result.
If the zero on the sliding scale is to the left of the main scale zero, you have a negative zero error. Slide it so the zeros line up, while watching another mark to see the size of the error. For example, if the 0.5mm mark moves from the 1mm mark to about the 2.1 mm position, the zero error is -(2.1 - 1), or -1.1 mm. Add 1.1 mm to all measurements to correct this.

, The caliper has two types of jaws. The larger ones tighten around an object, to measure the distance across it. The smaller jaws fit into an opening, and can then be pushed outward to measure its internal diameter. You can adjust either pair of jaws by sliding the smaller scale. Once you've got one of the jaws in position, tighten the locking screw if there is one.








, The main scale on a Vernier caliper typically tells you the whole number plus the first decimal.Read this just as you would a ruler, measuring to the zero mark on the sliding (Vernier) scale.


For example, if the 0 on the sliding scale lines up with the 2 inch mark, your measurement is 2 inches. If it lines up past 2 inches by six tenth-inch marks, your measurement is 2.6 inches.
If the result is between two lines, just use the smaller value. Do not try to estimate a value between the two lines.

, Find the first mark on the Vernier scale that lines up perfectly with any line on the main scale. That mark tells you the value of the additional digits.


For example, the 14 on the Vernier scale aligns with a line on the main scale. Let's say the scale represents 0.01 inch increments, so the 14 represents 0.014"".
It makes no difference which line on the main scale it aligns with. We've already taken our reading from the main scale; don't take another one.

, Add the main scale and Vernier scale results together to get the final answer. Make sure you use the correct units as labeled on each scale, or you won't get the right answer.


In our example, we measured 2.6 inches on the main scale, and 0.014 inches on the Vernier scale. Our final measurement is 2.614 inches.
The digits don't always line up this neatly. For example, if the main centimeter scale reads 0.85, and the Vernier 0.01 cm scale reads 12, adding them together results in 0.85 + 0.012 = 0.862 cm.

Purchase or make your own water level.,
Fill the jug with water, and place it on a high surface.,
Attach one end of the tube to the jug, and place your mouth on the other end.,
Pull out the tube from the water bucket once it is nearly full.,
Hold both ends of the tube vertically so that no water can escape.,
Have a helper stand at the location you want to level.,
Use chalk to mark the spot on the wall where the water line inside the tube falls.,
Repeat the leveling process until you have reached the end of the surface you are leveling.

",How to Use a Water Level," There are several quality levels available to purchase at a very minimal cost. If you opt to make your own, you can use a water jug, milk carton, or a clear plastic tube.;
, This will allow you to get the water into the tube.

, Begin sucking on the tube to get the water flowing. Siphon, or suck, on the tube hard enough to get the water moving but not enough to get a mouthful of liquid. Once you get the water moving a little, it should flow freely.


Alternatively, get a bucket (or use the bathtub or kiddie pool), and put the whole tube into the bucket slowly from one end, so it fills with water.

, Make sure you perform this action before the tube is completely full to prevent the water from spilling as you are moving around.

, Tap your finger along the tubing to loosen and expel any trapped air bubbles. Hold the ends of the tube even with one another, and verify that the water lines up equally. If it does, you are ready to go. If it does not, you need to continue tapping the tube, as it's likely that air bubbles are still trapped.

, The person must hold the tube against the surface you are leveling at a predetermined height. For example, if you are trying to draw a straight line on a wall, choose a height you want the line at, and have the person hold the tubing at the desired height.

, Have your helper move further along the surface you are leveling, hold the tube up to the predetermined height, and mark the spot where the water line is.

Use water to cool the drill tip if necessary.,
Test the drill bit when you are finished.,
Get a piece of scrap wood.,
Measure and mark it with a 59 degree angle.,
Cut a slot along the mark.,
Check the slot.",How to Sharpen a Drill Bit by Hand," When you are ready to sharpen a drill bit, slide it into your drill bit jig so that the end of the drill bit hangs over the edge slightly. Make sure that the drill bit fits snugly in the slot. It should fit right into the central groove in your jig.Then, place the tip of the drill bit near the grinding wheel. However, do not press the drill bit tip against the grinding wheel until after you turn it on.;
, When you are ready, turn on the grinding wheel and push the drill bit towards the grinder. Slide the sharpening jig back and forth with one hand as you hold the drill bit against the grinder with the other hand.You will also need to turn the drill bit slightly as you grind it down. Turn it clockwise slowly.
It is important to make the edges as symmetrical as possible.Using a jig will make this much easier than grinding a drill bit free hand.

, If you have a lot of grinding to do, then you may need to dunk the tip of the drill bit in water once every minute or so to make sure that it stays cool. Keep grinding your drill bit until all of the edges are even., After you finish grinding down your drill it, it should be much more effective than it was. You can try out your newly sharpened drill bit on a scrap piece of wood, or even metal, to ensure that it is sharp.Keep in mind that if you are going to be drilling through metal, it is best to use a drill press. It takes a lot of pressure to drill through metal, even with a sharp drill bit, so a handheld drill may not be enough., A small piece of plywood is a good choice for making a jig, but you can use any type of durable scrap wood that you have laying around. The piece should be about a foot long and about four inches wide., A 118 degree angle is ideal for drill bits, but you will need to create a 59 degree angle on your jig to get achieve this angle. Measure and mark your wood before you cut it.If you have a protractor attachment for your table saw, then you can just set it to a 59 degree angle and use this to cut a notch in the wood.

, Turn on your table saw and slide your piece of wood towards the blade so that it passes over it completely. You can use a guide piece to keep the wood straight and push it across the blade.Cut a V shape into the wood. This will keep your drill bit in place while you sharpen it.
Wear safety goggles and keep your hands away from the saw blade.

, After you have created the slot in your wood, check it to make sure that it is large enough to fit your drill bit into. If it is not large enough, then you can cut it a little wider.Be careful not to make the slot too wide or it will not keep the drill bit in place.

Draw square lines.,
Align pieces of wood at a right angle.,
Make a 45 degree line.,
Read and mark angles.,
Mark a parallel line.,
Guide a portable circular saw.",How to Use a Speed Square," Use the speed square to mark lines on wood at exactly 90 degrees to the wood's edge. Hold the tool against the end of the board. The lipped edge on the speed square will help line it up. Use the side of the square to mark the needed lines on the wood. Use the square to locate and mark studs, positioning floor joists, and laying out stair stringers.;
, When building cabinets, boxes, or other furniture pieces, hold the speed square against the wood to measure angles before cutting or attaching pieces of wood.

, Put the square firmly against the board and mark the location of the diagonal edge to create a 45 degree line. As an isosceles triangle, the square's diagonal edge is exactly at 45 degrees angle.

, Look for the pivot point at the corner of the speed square. Each line along the diagonal edge represents 1 degree, and they go from 0 to 90. Hold the pivot point against the board, and adjust the square until the degree gradation needed is aligned with the edge of the board. Use a pencil to draw a line along the square.

, Press the square against the edge of the wood and place a pencil tip into the notch that measures the number of inches needed. Slide the square along the wood with the pencil in the notch. This will produce a straight line that runs parallel to the edge of the wood.

, Position the square flatly on the board to be cut. Slide the saw shoe against the square, and cut. The saw will cut steadily and accurately because the speed square is thicker than a framing square or combination square.

Identify induction sensors.,

Set the ammeter to auto.,
Take the reading and remove the ammeter.",How to Use an Ammeter," If your ammeter divides the range of current into settings, choose the highest setting. Next you should select the kind of current you’ll be measuring: AC (Alternating Current) or DC (Direct Current).

Choosing the highest setting on your ammeter from the outset will prevent you from blowing the meter’s internal fuse if the amperage is too high.Battery powered circuits run on DC. Other power supplies may be AC or DC, and some can alternate between both. Check the power supply manual or label to determine its current type.;
, This will only take you a second and it will save you some time wasted on false readings. Your ammeter should have two leads: an input (+) and an output ( - ). Hold these together with your ammeter on. If the resistance rating is low, your fuse is good.The resistance reading of your ammeter will be indicated on a display on the front of the meter. You may have to adjust the power range before it can read the low level of a working fuse.
Most ammeter fuses can be easily replaced or reset, though this process will vary according to your brand and model. Consult your ammeter’s manual to learn how to fix blown fuses.
If you adjusted the power range lower to check the fuse, reset the range to its maximum to prevent the fuse from blowing when taking the actual amperage.

, But before you do, make sure the power is off and all batteries are removed to prevent getting zapped. Now you need to create a break in the wiring between the negative ( - ) terminal of the power source and the power input for the item receiving power.

The ammeter will be tied into the circuit at this break so that electricity passes through the meter on its way to the item being powered, allowing the meter to take a reading.
You may be able to “break” your circuit by loosening the fasteners connecting wiring to the power source’s negative ( - ) terminal or at the power input for the item receiving power.
If you can’t create a break in the circuit at the negative ( - ) terminal or power input, you can cut, strip, and then resplice the wire.

, This process will depend on your model of ammeter. Essentially, the negative ( - ) end of your ammeter will connect to the power source side of the broken circuit. The positive end (+) will connect to the opposite side, so that the ammeter bridges the break.

Most ammeters use color coding to indicate positive and negative ends of a circuit. This may be different from country to country, but in many cases, red will represent positive and black negative.Your ammeter may have clamps that allow it to easily attach to wires. Another common model uses metal probes around which wire is wrapped or fastened.
You can also simply hold the leads of your ammeter to the bare wires of the broken circuit. Prevent exposed wire from touching anything while the circuit is engaged., Switch the power source back on or reinsert the batteries for the circuit. Electricity will now pass through the meter, causing it to display the amperage of the current.Depending on the strength of the circuit you’re testing, you may need to reduce the range for the power gauge until the display registers activity.
Bare wires shouldn’t touch anything while the circuit is powered. Doing so could cause the circuit to short, an electrical fire, or a false reading., Now that you have your reading, you can turn off power to the circuit once again. Remove the ammeter and refasten the circuit’s wiring or splice back together wire that’s been cut., Induction ammeters are different from in-series ones in that induction units won’t have leads or probes. Instead, they’ll have a single clamp or ring through which a wire will pass. The induction sensor reads current through the electromagnetic field given off by the electricity., Locate the negative ( - ) terminal for the power source. The wire that runs between this and the item being powered is your power input line. Open the clamp and enclose it around the power input wire.

Because of the way electricity is distributed in a circuit, if you clamp two different wires together, it will throw off the meter’s reading., Setting the ammeter to auto will allow the meter to automatically adjust the range it is measuring. This will prevent you from blowing a fuse in the meter. If you need to adjust any other settings, this is the time to do it., Depending on your model, there may be a button you need to push, like a trigger, before it starts taking a reading. Other units might take a reading as soon as they are set to auto. Unclamp the ammeter, turn it off, put it away, and you’re done."

Add the centimeter segments to determine the total length.",How to Read a Measuring Tape1," On a tape measure labeled with imperial units, the most prominent marks are usually the one-inch marks. These are typically marked by long, thin lines and fairly large numbers.Every 12 inches, there will often (but not always) be a foot marking. This is usually in a different color than the other markings — often red in contrast to the normal black markings. After each foot marking, the numbers next to each inch mark will either repeat from 1 - 11 again or keep counting. This can vary from tape measure to tape measure.
Note that the line next to the number marks each inch, not the number itself.;
, A half-inch mark is always centered between any two one-inch marks. It almost always has the second-longest marking (after the one-inch marks). There will be one half-inch mark between each one-inch mark, but there are two half-inches per inch.


Note that, starting with half-inch marks, not all lines may be labeled with numbers. In this case, you need to use the markings on either side to guide you. For example, the half-inch mark between inches three and four stands for 3 1/2 inches, even though it's not labeled.

, After half-inches come quarter inches. These markings are smaller (and sometimes skinnier) than half-inches but usually bigger than the densely-packed marks around them. They are evenly spaced between each half-inch mark and one inch-mark. There are four quarter-inches in one inch.


Note that lines marking a quarter of an inch sometimes aren't any different in size from eighth-inch marks. In this case, keep in mind that two eighths of an inch make a quarter. Count to the second eighth-inch marking after the inch marking — this is the quarter-inch (and the line in the same spot on the other side of the half-inch mark is the three-quarter inch.)

, Smaller still than the quarter-inch markings are the one-eighth-inch markings. These markings are centered between the inch marking and the quarter-inch marking, the quarter-inch marking and the half-inch marking, and so on. There are eight one-eighth inches per inch.

, The shortest lines of all on most measuring tapes are the sixteenth-inch marks. There are 16 of these tiny marks per inch — four in each quarter-inch.


Note that some very precise measuring tapes will mark down to one-thirty-second of an inch or even one-sixty-fourth of an inch! Use the same pattern for recognizing these miniscule measurements.

, When you are measuring a length, getting an accurate value just means seeing where the tape lines up. First, mark the spot where the measuring tape lines up with the edge of the thing you're measuring. Find the nearest inch before this point. Then, find the nearest half-inch before this point. Then, the nearest quarter-inch, and so on. Add up your inches and fractions of inches until you have an accurate measurement. This is a lot easier than it sounds — see below for an example.


Let's say that we've measured past the the one-inch mark, past one quarter-inch mark, and past one eighth-inch mark. To find our measurement, we need to add:



1 (our inches) + 1/4 (our quarter-inches) + 1/8 (our eighth-inches).




Since there are two eighth-inches in a quarter-inch, we can rewrite this as:



1 + 2/8 + 1/8 = 1 3/8 inches.





Adding fractions like 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and so on can be tricky. If you need help, see our article on how to add fractions with unlike denominators.

, On most metric measuring tapes, centimeters are the most prominent markings. Centimeters are usually labeled with large lines and, next to each line, a number. As with inches, the line marks each centimeter, not the number itself.If you have a measuring tape longer than one meter (100 centimeters), usually, the meter(s) will receive a special marking as well — often in a different color than the rest of the markings. After each meter, the centimeter markings may start over again from zero or continue counting. This varies from measuring tape to measuring tape.

, Some (but not all) metric measuring tapes will have medium-sized marks evenly spaced between each centimeter mark. These mark half-centimeters. These marks are usually not labelled with a number.


The metric system is in base ten, which makes it much easier to work with decimals compared to imperial measurements. For this reason, it's usually fine to refer to half-centimeter markings in decimal terms (i.e., 1 1/2 centimeters becomes 1.5 centimeters.)

, There are ten millimeters in a centimeter (and, thus, one thousand in a meter.)


If your measuring tape doesn't have 0.5 centimeter markings, the fifth millimeter after each centimeter marks the 0.5 centimeter.

, To measure with a metric measuring tape, first find the nearest centimeter before the distance you're measuring, then the nearest millimeter. You can use a 0.5 millimeter mark to help guide you if your measuring tape has them. Your measurement (in centimeters) will be a decimal where the tenths place is indicated by the millimeter marking. For example, see below:


Let's say that we measure past the 33 centimeter mark to the sixth millimeter marking. In this case, we can find our distance in centimeters like this:



33 + 0.6 = 33.6 centimeters





If we wanted our distance in something other than centimeters, however, we would need to shift the decimal place to compensate. For example, let's say that we want the answer above in meters. In this case, since there are 100 centimeters in one meter, we could use a conversion factor like this:



33.6 × 1 meter/100 centimeters = 0.336 meters





In general, to go from centimeters to meters, shift the decimal two places to the left, and to go from meters to centimeters, shift it two places to the right.

Measure 3 feet (or meters) from the corner of one wall and make a mark.,
Measure 4 feet (1.2 m) from the adjacent wall on the same corner.,
With a level or another straight object, span the distance between the two marks.,
Repeat the procedure from the three other corners.",How to Square a Room2," You can use any unit of measurement you want as long as you stay consistent.

, Make a mark.

, If the straight line between the two marks measures 5 feet (1.5 m), that particular corner is a perfect 90° angle.


The math technique that you use to measure the corner is called the Pythagorean theorem. It states that the squares of the smaller sides of a right triangle are equal to the square of the longer side: a2 + b2 = c2 Only right triangles can be used in the Pythagorean theorem, so if the triangle's numbers don't add up, the corner of the triangle isn't 90°.
You don't need to use 3-4-5 as your measurements. You can also double, triple, quadruple, etc. the measurements if your room is very large. Measuring 6-8-10 is the exact same as measuring 3-4-5.

, Take a chalk line and snap it over the middle of the room to connect two center points across from one another. Then go to the adjacent wall and snap another chalk line across the room. You should have a ""+"" sign that meets in the center of the room.

, If you are laying wood flooring, make sure to leave a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) buffer on all four walls, as the wood needs space to expand and contract. If you install the wood right up against all walls of a room, you'll likely get cracks in the wood when it doesn't have room to expand.


If you're laying tile, you don't have to leave any buffer space, as tile does not expand or contract.

Catch the hooked end on one side of the object you're measuring.,

Hold one end of the tape down at the start of your distance.,
Stretch the tape across your distance.,

If measuring around a round object, pinch the tape where it overlaps.",How to Read a Measuring Tape2," If you're using a retractable tape measure (the kind that comes in a small metal or plastic box that automatically sucks the tape back up when you're done with it) note that the end of the tape will almost always have a small metal notch at the zero mark. This is useful for holding the tape in the right place as you measure, so you may want to start by catching it on the edge of the object you're measuring.


On the other hand, if you're measuring something that can't be latched on to (like, for instance, the distance across a door frame), just press this metal notch into one side of the object.

, With the zero mark in place, pull back on the box to let more tape out. You can use one hand (or a friend) to hold the end of the tape in place as you pull it back. Let tape out until it stretches all the way across the distance you're measuring.


Try to keep the tape straight as you do this — if you let it sag (which is easy to do if you're measuring long distances), the results you get will be skewed.

, Now, look at the point where the tape meets the end of the thing you're measuring. The nearest number below the end of the tape is your number of units you're measuring and the markings between this number and the one above it correspond to fractions of the unit.


For example, if you are measuring across the front of your dresser and the edge of the dresser lines up right after the 24 inch marking, this means that your dresser is between 24 and 25 inches wide. If, for instance, it's three 1/8 inch marks past 24 inches, it is 24 3/8 inches wide.
You can also try putting a kink in the tape, then lining up this kink with the edge of what you're measuring. This is handy in certain situations, like for instance, when you're measuring into a tight corner.

, Most retractable tape measures will have a button or sliding switch that, when pressed, keeps the tape measure from being sucked back in. Some even lock automatically.You can use this to easily compare the sizes of different lengths and objects. For instance, the lock feature is useful for:


Quickly seeing which of two objects is bigger
Seeing whether something will fit through a certain space
Keeping the tape available for multiple quick measurements
Keeping a certain distance ""handy"" to avoid having to re-measure

, A manual tape measure (which looks a little like a long, skinny ribbon or a ruler made out of flexible material) lacks some of the convenient features of a modern retractable tape measure, but with the proper technique, it works just as well. To start taking a measurement, grab the ""zero"" end and line it up with the start of the object or length you want to measure.


Part of the problem with manual tape measures is that they're most useful for measuring only short differences because you have to be able to hold the zero end in place while you move the other end into position. Thus, most manual tapes won't be much longer than the human arm span. If you need to measure beyond your reach, you can try keeping the zero end of your tape measure in place with a weight or getting a friend to help.

, Now, take the slack of the object and lay it in a straight line across the object or distance you want to measure. Be sure to keep the tape tight to ensure an accurate measurement, but don't stretch it — most modern measuring tapes are made out of semi-flexible plastic.

, Just as you would with a retractable tape measure, look for the spot where the end of the object or distance you're measuring lines up with the tape measure. The distance indicated on the tape measure at this point is the distance you've measured.


For instance, let's say you hold one end of a tape measure in the tips of your fingers and stretch the other end all the way to the crook of your armpit to determine how long your arm is. If the tape measure stretches exactly halfway between the 27 and 28 inch markings, this means that your arm is 27.5 inches long.

, One advantage of ribbon-style tape measures over retractable tape measures is that their flexibility allows them to measure around objects. To do this, place the zero end of the tape on the object, wrap the tape all the way around it in as straight of line as possible, and note the point where the tape measure first passes the zero marking once again. This point is the distance around your object.


For example, if you want to find the distance around your wrist, place the zero end of the tape measure on top of your wrist, wrap the slack around and underneath, then line it up with the zero end on top. If it is, for instance, six inches at this point, then your wrist has a circumference of about six inches.

Be sure to measure from the surface of the jambs or frame, not from the short extensions that hold the window in place.A slide rule with extension may result in more accurate interior measurements.If you are using a tape measure, make sure you account for the width of the tape measure itself, which is usually printed on its label.;
, Your window may be surrounded by a plastic or aluminum jamb liner that slots around its vertical sides. This will be removed before the replacement window is installed, so measure its width and add it to the width of the window opening. If you cannot access the liner's width to measure, use 1/2"" (1.25 cm) as an approximation., From the windowsill surface closest to the window itself, measure the height to the top of the window opening. Do this at the left, center, and right edges, and write down the smallest result as the height.If your windowsill is sloped, measure from the highest point, which is usually right against your window., Measure the depth between the two stops that extend in front of the window frame. Try to measure at the shortest point, but it is not vital that you measure in three places as you did the weight and height.


If you cannot open your window, measure the depth on each side and add them together. Alternatively, approximate by measuring the depth on the interior side and multiplying by two. To the result from either of these methods, add the thickness of your glass pane if you know it. A single pane of glass varies in thickness, but 1/8"" (3mm) is a reasonable estimate.
There is usually a minimum depth required for installing a specific replacement window or storm window, but as long as the depth is larger than that minimum, you do not need an exact measurement.

, Measure the window opening from the top left corner to the bottom right corner and write it down. Measure the distance from the opposite corners (top right to bottom left) and compare with the first measurement. If these lengths are not equal, your window opening is not square or rectangular. In this scenario, you should let the manufacturer of the new windows or shutters know that the opening is ""racked"" and give them these measurements., Some manufacturers of replacement windows, storm windows, or exterior shutters may request that you order items slightly narrower than the size of your opening to make sure they fit. You may follow that manufacturer's instructions to reduce the size by the appropriate amount, or give them the exact dimensions of your window opening. The important point to remember is to be absolutely clear which method you are using, since if both you and the manufacturer narrow the window size, it may not fit at all.

Identify your caliper.",How to Read a Caliper1," Use the instructions for vernier calipers if your tool has two scales, one sliding over the other. If your tool has one scale and a round dial instead, see the dial caliper instructions instead.


If you are using a digital caliper, the measurement should be displayed on an electronic screen, typically with the option to switch between mm (millimeters) and inches (in). Before you take the measurement, close the larger jaws completely and press the Zero, Tare or ABS button to set the closed position to a value of zero.

"
"
Decide whether your product will be mounted on the inside or outside of the window opening.,
If mounting inside the frame, measure the depth of your window opening.,
Use three measurements to measure inside width and choose the smallest.,
Measure inside height with three measurements and pick the largest.,
Measure outside width and height at the largest points.",How to Measure Your Windows2," Most curtains or drapes are affixed on the top frame or the wall above the frame, while shades and blinds are usually attached inside the opening nearer to the glass.

, When measuring how deep your window is, it is vital that you measure in front of any obstructions that may get in the way of your blinds. For example, if you have a double hung window, measure in front of the outermost window, not the recessed window pane. (This is normally the bottom half of the window.) If you have any latches or handles, you may also want to measure in front of those.


If you are hanging half-length curtains or other short material, you may ignore obstructions that are not in the portion of the window covered by the curtain.

, If you are hanging your object on the inside of the window, measure the inside width at the top, middle, and bottom points of the window opening. (Windows, new or old, are not always even.) Take the smallest of the three measurements to make sure your blinds or other objects fit.

, Measure inside height (top-to-bottom) from inside edge to inside edge of the opening. Measure the height at the left, middle, and right points of the window. Take the largest of the three measurements to ensure the hanging material reaches the bottom of the window.


You may skip this step if you are hanging a short length of material at the top of the window and do not need it to reach all the way down. If you are hanging the short material partway up the window, you should measure to the height you intend to mount rather than the top of the window.

, If you are hanging an object on the outside of your window, measure the height and width of the opening from the outside. You may take three evenly spaced measurements and choose the largest of each, but if you intend to cover the entire window you may simply measure at what seems to be the largest point. Add 0.5–1"" (1.25–2.5cm) to both width and height if you want to be sure you fully cover the window.


If you are mounting the object above the window frame, measure the height between the intended mounting position and the window frame. Add this to the height of the opening.

Check for zero errors.,
Use an adjustment wheel if present.,
Calculate a positive zero error.,
Calculate a negative zero error.,
Subtract the zero error from all measurements.,
Adjust the jaws to take a measurement.,
Read the fixed scale value.,
Check the sliding scale for additional digits.,
Add the two values together to get your final answer.",How to Read a Caliper2," Loosen the screw or screws holding the sliding scale in place. Move the sliding scale until the larger jaws of the caliper are fully pressed against each other. Compare the 0 positions on the sliding scale and the fixed scale, which is engraved on the caliper body. If the two 0 marks are lined up exactly, skip ahead to reading the measurement. Otherwise, continue to the next step to correct the error.;
, While this is not common, some vernier calipers have an adjustment wheel on the sliding scale, which can be pushed to adjust the sliding scale without affecting the caliper jaws. If your model has this wheel, push it until the zeroes on the sliding scale and fixed scale line up, then skip ahead to reading the measurement. Otherwise, continue to the next step.


Watch the jaws closely to make sure you are not pushing a fine adjustment screw, which opens and closes the jaws by small amounts.

, If the sliding scale's 0 is to the right of the fixed scale's 0, read the measurement on the fixed scale that lines up with the sliding scale's 0. This is a positive zero error, so write this down with a + sign.



For example, if the sliding scale's 0 is at 0.9mm on the fixed scale, write down ""zero error: +0.9 mm.""

, If the sliding scale's 0 is to the left of the fixed scale's 0, take the following steps:With jaws closed, look for a mark on the sliding scale that lines up exactly with a value on the fixed scale
Move the sliding scale so that mark lines up with the next highest value. Repeat until the sliding scale 0 is to the right of the fixed scale 0. Note the amount of distance moved.
Read the value on the fixed scale that lines up with the sliding scale's 0.
Subtract the amount of distance moved from the value you just read. Write down this zero error, including the negative sign.

For example, the 7 on the sliding scale lines up with the 5mm mark on the fixed scale. Move the sliding scale until it is further right than the fixed scale, then line up the 7 with the next fixed-scale mark: 7mm. Note that you moved a distance of 7 - 5 = 2mm. The sliding scale's 0 is now located at the 0.7mm mark. The zero error is equal to 0.7mm - 2mm = -1.3mm.

, Any time you take a measurement, subtract your zero error from the result to get the actual dimensions of the object. Don't forget to take the sign of the zero error (+ or -) into account.For example, if your zero error is +0.9mm, and you take a measurement that reads 5.52mm, the actual value is 5.52 - 0.9 = 4.62mm.
For example, if your zero error is -1.3mm, and you take a measurement that reads 3.20mm, the actual value is 3.20 - (-1.3) = 3.20 + 1.3 = 4.50mm.

, Clamp the large, flat jaws around an object to measure an outside dimension. Insert the smaller, curved jaws into an object and expand them outward to measure the interior dimension. Tighten the locking screw to keep the scale in place.


Slide the scale to open or close the jaws. If your caliper has a fine adjustment screw, you can use this to make more precise adjustments.

, Once you have the caliper jaws in the right position, look at the fixed scale, engraved onto the body of the caliper. Typically there is an imperial and a metric fixed scale; either one will work. Take these steps to find the first couple digits of your measurement:Find the 0 value on the smaller, sliding scale, next to the fixed scale you are using.
On the fixed scale, find the nearest mark to the left of that 0, or exactly on it.
Read that mark's value just like you would read a ruler – but note that the imperial side of a caliper divides each inch into tenths, not sixteenths as most rulers do.

, Examine the sliding scale carefully, starting at the 0 mark and moving right. Stop when you find a mark that lines up exactly with any mark on the fixed scale. Read this value on the sliding scale as you would a regular ruler, using the unit engraved on the sliding scale.


The value of the fixed-scale mark makes no difference. You only need to read the value on the sliding scale.

, This should be a simple case of writing the fixed scale digits, then writing the sliding scale digits afterward. Check the unit engraved on each scales just to make sure.


For example, your fixed scale measures 1.3 and is marked ""inches."" Your sliding scale measures 4.3 and is marked ""0.01 inches,"" meaning it represents 0.043 inches. The exact measurement is 1.3 inches + 0.043 inches - 1.343 inches.
If you found a zero error earlier, don't forget to subtract it from your measurement.

"
"
Check for a zero error.,
Take the measurement.,
Read the scale value.,
Read the dial value.,
Add the two values together.",How to Read a Caliper3," Close the jaws completely. If the needle on the dial doesn't point to zero, rotate the dial with your fingers, until the zero is beneath the needle.You may need to loosen a screw at the top or base of the dial face before you can do this.If so, remember to tighten the screws again after you've made the adjustment.

, Close the larger, flat jaws around an object to measure the outside diameter or width, or insert the smaller, curved jaws into an object and expand to measure the interior diameter or width.

, The scale engraved on your caliper can be read just as you would a regular ruler. Find the value at the inner edge of your caliper's jaws.


The scale should be labeled with a unit, typically cm (centimeters) or in (inches).
Note that the inches scale of a caliper is typically an engineer's scale, with each inch divided into ten parts (0.1) or five parts (0.2). This is different from most rulers, which display sixteenths or eighths of an inch.

, The needle on the dial points to an additional value for more precise measurement. The units should be labeled on the dial face, typically 0.01 or 0.001 cm or in.

, Convert both measurements to the same unit, then add them together. For many applications, you may not need to use the most precise digits.


For example, the fixed scale displays 5.5 and is labeled cm. The needle on the dial points to 9.2 and is labeled 0.001 cm, so this represents 0.0092 cm. Add them together to get a measurement of 5.5092 cm. Unless you are working on a project that requires extreme precision, you can probably round this to 5.51 cm.

Multiply the length of the second space times the width of the second space.,
Measure the length and width of the third space.,
Multiply the length of the third space times the width of the third space.,
Add the square footages of the three spaces.",How to Measure Square Footage1," If you're having trouble finding the square footage, then it's probably because you're not working with a neat area with just one length and one width. The space might have squares jutting off in different places and could be shaped erratically. All you have to do is split up the space into even squares or rectangles. To find the square footage, or the area, of the entire space, you'll need to find the square footage of the individual spaces and then add them all together.









Draw faint lines separating the different sections.
Label them A, B, and C for your convenience.;
, Using a ruler or measuring tape, find the length and width of the first space you've created, Space A.









The length of the space is 12 feet (3.7 m), and the width is 15 feet (4.6 m).

, To find the square footage -- or the area -- of the space, just multiply the length times the width, just as you would do with any rectangle.









Ex: 12 feet (3.7 m). x 15 feet (4.6 m). = 180 square feet

, Let's say that the length of Space B is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the width of Space B is 10 feet (3.0 m).








, This will lead you to find the square footage of the second space. Here's how you find the square footage of Space B:









Ex: 20 feet (6.1 m). x 10 feet (3.0 m). = 200 square feet.

, Let's say that the length of Space C is 20 feet (6.1 m) and the width of Space C is 35 feet (10.7 m).








, This will lead you to find the square footage of the third space. Here's how you find the square footage of Space C:









Ex: 20 feet (6.1 m). x 35 feet (10.7 m). = 700 square feet

, Once you find the sum of the square footages of the three spaces, you'll know the square footage of the entire space. Here's how you do it:









Square footage of Space A + square footage of Space B + square footage of Space C = square footage of the entire space
180 + 200 + 700 = 1080 square feet

Find the approximation of square footage.,
Find the square footage of a space that's shaped like a half-circle.,
Find the square footage of a space that's almost regularly shaped.",How to Measure Square Footage2," If you're looking for an approximation of square footage, you can also try measuring the outside of your home and then subtracting any areas that won't be factored in to the square footage, such as the porch stairs or garage.









Ceiling and floor tiles are often one square foot in size. You can simply count these to get a close approximation of the total square footage.

, If there's a part of your house that's shaped like a half of a circle, you can find the square footage of the circle by finding the area of the space as if it were a full circle and then dividing it by half. To do this, simply measure the long line that cuts the ""circle"" in half to get the diameter.









Then, divide it by 2 to get the radius, and then plug that into the equation A = πr^2 where r is the radius, and divide by 2 to get the area, or square footage, of the half circle.

, If you're measuring a space that is almost fully a square or a rectangle, with only a small square or rectangular part missing, then measure the square footage of the entire space as if the missing part was filled in. Then, find the square footage of the missing part and subtract it from the overall square footage to find the square footage of the space. This will save you time.

Reinstall vial container.,

Repeat for other vials.",How to Replace a Swanson Post Level Spirit Vial,", Each of the three Spirit Vials are held on the Level Body using two methods: first, by a grey-colored Vial Retainer that snaps over the Vial and into the Level Body and secured by means of four-locking Retainer Tabs and, second through the use of an adhesive applied to the Vial Seat (on each end of the Vial) and the Vial itself. Removal of the Retainer is the primary step required in order for the Spirit Vial to be replaced., Then, using a flat screwdriver, GENTLY unsecure the first Retainer Tab on the backside of the level using the following method: Push on the ""flat face"" (the broad sloped grey surface) back toward the rear of the slot (away from the Vial) the Tab is fitted into. At the same time, exert a slight downward force to push the Tab part of the way out of the slot itself. Use your hand holding the Retainer to prevent the Retainer Tab from resetting itself.

Be careful. Patience is required here. The plastic tabs are soft, fragile, and become more so over time. It is not uncommon for them to break or become damaged during removal of the Retainer.

, Use the same procedure in the previous step to prevent resetting., Repeat Steps #02 - #03 for the opposite side pair of Retainer Tabs., Once the four Tabs have been successfully unseated carefully remove the Vial Retainer. Use caution as in many instances the adhesive the manufacturer uses to hold the Vials has leaked out during the manufacturing process onto the Retainer essentially fusing it to the Level Body. If this is the case, use the screwdriver to gently pry and lift off the Retainer., The Spirit Vials used in the Swanson Post Levels are typically held in place using both the Retainer and an adhesive applied to the vial itself. Using a screwdriver, gently pry the Vial out of its seat. Once the Vial has been removed, clean any residual adhesive from the Vial Seats to insure a proper fitting for the replacement. Keep the old Vial for comparing size with the replacement., Compare the replacement physically with the old Vial and note any differences in size. If the new one is too long to seat, sand the ends to fit. Use adhesive sparingly to assure the new Vial is seated firmly and cannot move. Adhesive may not be required unless the Retainer has been damaged and doesn't properly secure the Vial. Use a MILD adhesive (Do Not Use ""super-glue"", etc.) Place a small dab into the Vial Seat before setting the Vial and the Retainer.

Read the Safety Tips below before doing any sanding or using any adhesive. Be sure not to sand the Vial down to where there is a danger of the Vial breaking (shattering) during the sanding process or while the tool is being used.

, Insert the four locking Retainer Tabs into their respective slots and press down until you hear the Tabs snap into place. Check the reverse side to insure each Tab is properly seated., Repeat the above steps to change-out any of the other three vials that require replacement. If any of the Retainers are damaged or broken during removal they can be easily repaired using an adhesive...just remember not to use the STRONG adhesive to secure the Retainer to the Level Body in the event the Vials require replacement again at a later date."

Establish your own business, if desired.",How to Become a Locksmith," As a locksmith, you may install and repair locks for both buildings, automobiles, and safes. You may also need to make duplicate keys and offer forms of related assistance.


Many locksmiths work in a shop during normal business hours, but you should also expect to visit customers on-site when installing locks or assisting someone locked out of a vehicle or building.
Trainees usually start at minimum wage, but your earnings will typically grow quickly as you gain experience and demonstrate productive skill. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for locksmiths as of May 2012 was $37,560. Employment is expected to grow at 7 percent between 2012 and 2022, which is considered slower than average.Many locksmiths work an ""on call"" schedule, so you should be prepared to answer emergency calls outside of normal business hours. Some of the most successful locksmiths can spend around 80 hours per week on locksmithing duties, and self-employed locksmiths should expect to spend another 40 hours per week on marketing and administrative tasks.;
, Locksmiths rely on a wide range of skills, and improving these skills will allow you to have a more successful career.


You need good eye-hand coordination and spatial reasoning skills. If you're still in high school, consider taking courses in advanced mathematics, mechanical drawing, basic electronics, physics, metalwork, and carpentry. If you've already graduated, try honing these skills at a community college or on your own.
You'll also need to demonstrate adequate customer service skills. If you plan to eventually start your own locksmithing business, marketing capabilities will also be crucial.

, Before you begin any formal locksmith training, you should obtain your high school diploma or GED. In many states, you'll need at least this much education before you can qualify to perform professional locksmith work.


Locksmithing isn't simple work. Getting a basic education will provide you with the foundational knowledge you'll need to understand the more advanced mechanical principles used on the job.

, While you don't need a specialized degree to become a locksmith, most locksmiths complete some type of formal training. This training can last between three months and four years.Check into certificate or diploma programs at nearby community colleges, vocational schools, or state locksmith associations.
The courses included in formal training programs cover most locksmithing basics, including information about the structure of the lock mechanism and essential security features. You'll also learn how to pick locks, repair locks, and make keys.

, If you don't complete classroom training, your other option is to learn the necessary skills through an apprenticeship program. Completing both formal training and an apprenticeship can further improve your odds of being hired.

Most apprenticeships are unpaid, but they'll provide you with hands-on training in all aspects of a locksmith business, including both technical and administrative duties.
When choosing an apprenticeship, make sure that your mentor possesses a state-issued license or professional certificate, even if neither one is required by state law. Either option testifies to that locksmith's skill and credibility.

, Some states require you to obtain a state-issued license before you can legally practice as an independent locksmith.


The purpose of a state-issued license is to maintain professional standards and protect consumers. The exact requirements can vary by state, but typically, you'll need to submit a written application, pass a background check, and file your fingerprints with state and federal databases.

, If your state doesn't require you to obtain a state-issued license, you should check into some type of voluntary professional certification.Since certification is optional, you can work on obtaining it after you've already landed a job. If you're having trouble finding work, though, obtaining your certification first may help you stand out among other applicants.
The Associated Locksmiths of America (ALOA) offers several levels of professional certification, including: Registered Locksmith (RL), Certified Registered Locksmith (CRL), Certified Professional Locksmith (CPL), and Certified Master Locksmith (CML). Each level has its own exam, and you'll need to pass the exam with a minimum score of 70 percent.
Similarly, the Safe and Vault Technicians Association (SAVTA) offers exams for two levels of certification: Certified Professional SafeTech and Certified Master SafeTech.

, During the early stages of your career, you should try to get hired by an existing firm. In fact, some states require aspiring locksmiths to work for an established firm for at least one year before they can become professionally licensed.


Check with locksmith companies, security equipment manufacturers, DIY/hardware stores, shoe repairers, and large department stores. Any company that at least provides key-cutting services can give you the entry-level experience you need.
Most local locksmith companies are small, but there are large national companies that may operate franchises in your area. Larger companies usually provide 24-hour mobile/emergency services, so be prepared to work extensive hours if you land a job with one of those.

, You'll likely learn much more about the field from your peers, coworkers, and employers than you learned during your formal training and certification.


In this particular field, you should never assume that you've already learned all there is to know, even if you've been working in this career for decades. New laws and technologies continually change the industry, and as these changes occur, the way you do business as a locksmith might need to change, too. Others who have more experience with these changes and with other unfamiliar aspects of the industry can provide you with the practical hands-on knowledge you'll need when dealing with it all.

, Continued education isn't strictly necessary, but the industry will change as technology advances, and keeping up with those changes can help your long-term career.


Stay informed on the latest news concerning the newest laws and technologies in the field.
Continually check for opportunities offered by lock manufacturers, locksmith associations like the ALOA, and technical schools.
Continued education can help any locksmith, but it can be especially important if you wish to focus on certain specialties, obtain a higher form of certification, or start your own self-employed business.

, Joining a professional organization at the national or state level can provide you with access to a wider range of benefits.


Professional organizations allow you to network with other locksmith professional more easily and effectively. Some organizations also provide perks like legislative representation, insurance, and advanced education/certification.
At the national level, you could consider joining the ALOA. You can find out more about membership with this organization by calling 1-800-532-2562 or by visiting them online at: http://www.aloa.org/membership/aloa-membership.html

SAVTA is another national locksmith organization you could join. Visit them online at: http://www.savta.org/membership.php


, Since this field can be highly competitive, it may help to specialize in an area of expertise rather than relying on general skills. You'll need to complete some form of formal training regardless of which expertise you pursue.


For example, you could become an automotive locksmith or home security locksmith. If you study to become a forensic locksmith, you'll learn how to identify the cause of security breaches. If you become a security consultant, you'll learn how to help clients improve the effectiveness of their locks and other security devices.

, You can continue working with an established firm for the duration of your career, but many professionals choose to open their own self-employed locksmith business.


Before you take this step, do your research. This sector can be a competitive one, and if your area is already flooded with sources offering locksmith services, your business may not thrive.
Running your own business will require skills beyond basic locksmithing. You'll need to know how to run a business, manage finances, and advertise your services. Consider obtaining additional education and training to help you learn these skills.

The stand will stabilize your dial indicator while you take your measurements.If you do not have a stand, it is still possible to calibrate your dial indicator, but it will not be as easy.;
, The outer dial face can be moved by twisting the rim of the dial. Spin the outer face until the hand hovers over zero. Your calibration measurements will ensure that the dial indicator does read measurements starting at zero.If you discover errors, you will be able to correct for them by readjusting the outer face so that the hand hovers over the zero point.

, Stop at every 1/10 measurement to calculate errors. Continue to check for errors at 1/10 measurements for the first two revolutions of your dial., For the next five revolutions, stop at every half revolution to calculate for errors, rather than at the 1/10 mark.


If your dial indicator makes more than seven revolutions, check for errors at every revolution after your reach seven.Do not let go of the spindle because you will need to check for errors in the reverse.

, Follow the same error-checking procedure, but in reverse. Check the measurement at each of the same points, so for the first five revolutions you will stop at the half revolution to measure. Then check the measurement at the 1/10 marks for the remaining two revolutions., Displace the spindle five times using the same surface. Move the spindle quickly for some measurements and slowly for others. Write down each of the five measurements to check for deviations. Because you’re measuring the same surface repeatedly, each measurement should come out the same if your dial indicator is ready to use.If your dial indicator is showing errors, adjust the outer face and clean the spindle. Dust can accumulate on the spindle and cause issues with taking measurements. Repeat the calibration process until there are no errors.

, The hands will move when you press the spindle at the bottom of your gauge. The outer face, which can be turned by twisting the outer rim of the face, takes the smaller measurements, usually in one-thousandths. The inner face, which is small and stationary, keeps track of the number of revolutions.Some dial indicators may have more than one face. If yours does, consult the instruction documents for more information about the extra faces.
Your manufacturer will also print the range of measurements on either your dial indicator or the instructions that come with it. They commonly measure from .001-1.0 inch.

, The spindle extends from the bottom of your gauge and is used to take the measurements. To take a measurement, you will press it against what is being measured. The length of the spindle that can be inserted into the gauge during the measurement will correspond with the measurement that appears on the dial face., You should see 100 marks on the larger face that represent .001 inches. The length of your spindle and number of revolutions that the hand makes on the larger face when the spindle is fully inserted will determine how the marks on the small face are measured.


For example, if you can insert your 1-inch long spindle for 10 revolutions, then each revolution measures .1-inches., To take a measurement, you will need to displace space on your spindle. Align the base of the spindle with the item to be measured. Push the dial indicator against the item, counting the number of revolutions made to double-check your accuracy. Hold the gauge in place to take your measurement., Depending on how your small gauge is labeled, it could count just your revolutions or track the measurement. Take down the number of revolutions or the measurement itself if it's printed on the gauge.If the dial indicator did not make at least one revolution, then skip to reading the large gauge because the small gauge only matters if the indicator makes at least one full revolution.

, If your small gauge shows revolutions or does not provide a clear measurement, take the number of marks displaced and multiply it by the length that is represented by one revolution.For example, if one revolution equals .1-inches, then you would calculate three marks on the small gauge as 3 X .1=.3-inches.

, The big outer face should be marked with 100 notches. Most dial indicators will be labeled at the 5’s or 10’s to make it easier to read. Determine which marker the hand best lines up with, then take down the number.


Make sure that you count if the gauge makes complete revolutions. For example, it may completely circle once and then land on the notch next to 30. Remember to add the calculations from both the small and large gauges., Remember that the larger gauge represents a smaller measurement, so while the small gauge might measure in tents, the outer gauge measures in thousandths. If the hand is pointing at 30, then it means 30 thousandths.To calculate the measurement, divide the number by 1,000. For example, 30/1000=0.030-inches.

, Take both the small gauge and large gauge measurements and add them together. In the examples above, you'd have 0.3+0.030=0.330-inches. This is your reading from the dial indicator.

, Cut right at the border at the point where where the sides taper at the top and bottom. You may want to use a knife or razor blade to make a small starter cut in the taper so that you can easily get your tin snips or scissors in. Try to make the cutting line as straight as possible, but don’t worry about it too much, as you will trim them later.
/images/thumb/8/81/Make-a-Padlock-Shim-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Padlock-Shim-Step-3-Version-2.jpg

To maximize the metal you have to work with, try to avoid cutting too much into the flat part of the can’s side. Instead, err on the side of the taper.
Take your time when cutting the shims. The straighter and smoother your cuts, the better your shims will work. You’ll also be able to make more shims per can if you’re careful with your cuts.

, Try to make the cut as straight as possible––many cans have a “seam” that you can use as a guide. You want to be able to flatten out the piece of metal into a rectangle.

, Aim to round the shim so that its shape fits the lock shackle. You can do this by bending the shim around the shackle itself, or you can shape it around a pen or pencil (as long as the pen or pencil doesn’t have ridges). Your shim is now finished.
/images/thumb/d/d3/Make-a-Padlock-Shim-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-a-Padlock-Shim-Step-13-Version-2.jpg

Using a shim takes a bit of practice. It’s easy to bend them or tear them in the small space between the shackle and the locking mechanism, and it can be hard to get them into position. Fortunately, you can make many shims out of a can, and once you get the hang of it, the process will become much easier. Just don’t try to force anything, because if you get a piece of the shim stuck in the lock, it will make your job even harder.
Once you have driven the shim into the shackle housing, take the tabs you created and pull on them from side to side. Even if the shim itself doesn't move, this motion is vital to opening the lock.
Some locks require that you insert a shim into both sides of the shackle (both holes where the shackle enters the lock). If you can't seem to get the lock open with one shim, try two.
Once you hear a click similar to that of when you pull an unlocked shackle out of its housing, the lock will be able to be opened.

Obtain or locate the ""core key"".,
Insert the core key into the core as you would with any other key.,
Turn the key.,
Withdraw the turned key slowly from the lock.,
Place the core with the key still inserted, next to the new core.,
Inspect the cores.,
Remove the core key from the old core by holding the core in one hand and turning the key back to the locked position with the other hand.

,
Insert the core key into the new core and turn to the ""unlocked"" position.

,
Bring the core with the key inserted to the lock housing.,
Turn the core key back to the locked position.,
Withdraw the core key and verify proper operation of the lock and associated key(s).

",How to Change a Lock Cylinder," A core key is like a master key, but rather than unlocking doors and locks, it allows the withdrawal of the core or cylinder from the lock housing itself. Core keys will not unlock anything by themselves, but will make it possible to unlock a device without the need for a key. A simple screwdriver is all that is usually needed to open a lock that does not have a core. It should be evident that core keys need to be safeguarded similar to master keys.;
, This is the ""locked"" position.

, It will only turn about 10 degrees. Do not attempt to force the key further. This releases the core from the lock housing.

, The core will pull out of the housing as the key is withdrawn position. If the key is turned back to the locked position before withdrawing, only the key will be removed.

, The cores will most likely look very similar and keeping the key in one will help differentiate between the two.

, Many times they will look identical, other times they will not. It is these times that particular attention be paid. The difference most likely will be that the ""link"" between the core and bolt will be still attached to the old core. The link is a part that transfers the the rotating motion of the core to the dead bolt or latch mechanism (it usually consists of a piece of flat metal and or pins that attaches to the rear of the core). If this is the case, simply remove it from the old core and insert on the new core. If the cores look the same, the link will either be in the lock housing or it fell off some time after the core was removed. Verify the the link is indeed still in the lock. Ensure that link will line up with the core by visualizing the core aligning with the link. Nudge or adjust the link as needed with a screwdriver or needle-nose pliers.

,,, Align and fully insert into the lock housing. A core that can not be fully inserted indicates that there is misalignment of the link between the lock and core. Adjust it to allow mating between these components and try again.

, The core is now secured in the lock housing.

Find a basic ballpoint pen.,
Remove the cap from the end of the pen.,
Insert the tube of the pen into the U-lock keyhole.,
Push and twist the pen inside the keyhole.,
Twist until the U-lock unlocks.,
Take off the top bar of the U-lock.",How to Break a U Lock1," A basic ballpoint pen is the best tool for opening a locked U-lock. Find a standard “stick” pen, usually the cheapest types of pens that have the ballpoint on one end, a small cap to cover the other end of the pen, and a separate cover that you put on the pen when not using it.Make sure to use a cheap pen, as opposed to a more fancy kind. You need to find a pen that has an end cap that pops off, rather than one that screws off or can’t be easily removed.;
, Use your fingernails to pry off the small cap on the end of the pen. Removing the cap will leave you with an open tube that is roughly the same diameter as a standard U-lock key., After you remove the cap, insert the end of the pen with the open tube into the keyhole of your U-lock. It should comfortably fit within the hole.If the tube of the pen doesn’t fit inside the keyhole, it won’t work to open the lock. Find a pen that fits inside keyhole after its cap has been removed.

, Hold the U-lock with your non-dominant hand. With your dominant hand, grip the ballpoint pen and twist it inside the lock while pushing firmly.


Use your wrist rather than your whole arm to get the energy needed to push and twist.

, Keep twisting the pen, shaking the bar of the U-lock a little bit to add pressure. You may have to do this anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes if it’s your first time using this method. Twist the pen until you feel or hear the lock unlock.If you are unsure of whether the lock has opened, pull at the bar of the U-lock to check.
If you are applying pressure, you should feel the lock open.

, Pull the ballpoint pen out from the keyhole, then lift up the top bar of the lock out of the U-shaped sides. You have successfully unlocked your U-lock!"

Get the right doors.,
If installing/replacing a new door and frame, consider a fiberglass door that swings outward rather than inward (and don't forget using security hinges).,
Replace all windowed exterior doors with windowless doors.",How to Burglarproof Your Doors1," If your front and back doors are hollow, you need to replace them immediately. How do you know if your door is hollow? Simply knock on it. Hollow doors are merely sheets of veneer over a cardboard core. All exterior doors should be solid and made from the following materials:


Fiberglass
Solid wood
Solid wood core (a layer of veneer over solid wood)
Metal (Note: make sure metal doors are reinforced inside, and have what is called a lock block. Otherwise, they can be bent out of the frame using a car jack);
, Having a door open in this way helps absorb any type of forced entry.

, For maximum security, all doors should be windowless, and you should not have windows close enough to the door so that a thief could break the window and unlock the door from the inside.


If you do have sliding glass doors, glass door panels or nearby windows, however, cover the glass with a security grate or grille on the outside or a clear, unbreakable polycarbonate panel secured behind the glass on the inside.

Purchase canned air spray.,
Position the U-lock.,
Spray the canned air at the keyhole of the U-lock.,
Spray for about 30 seconds.,
Begin hammering against the keyhole.,
Hammer until the U-lock breaks.",How to Break a U Lock2," U-locks are very difficult to open by hammering or using force, but they are weakened and become brittle when cooled by air spray, meaning that they can be smashed open. Buy compressed or canned air at home improvement stores or online.Canned air contains the compressed chemical difluoroethane, which will cool the lock to around -13 degrees F (-25 degrees C).

, If your U-lock is locked but not connected to anything, breaking it will be easy. If the U-lock is locked around a bicycle or a door handle, it will a little more difficult to open, but it will still be doable.


Position the U-lock so that the bar of the U-lock is lying flat on the ground or is against a stable surface like a door or the bar of the bike rack.

, Hold the can of air spray about a foot away from the keyhole. Then hold down the trigger of the canned air and spray it directly at the keyhole., Spray continuously for about 30 seconds. You will notice the bar becoming white as the chemical reacts with the surface of the U-lock and chills it.


Be sure to aim the spray radius at the keyhole, where you will focusing your hammering.

, After about 30 seconds, the bar of the U-lock will have been chilled and should be brittle enough to break. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the U-lock by its loop against the ground or the surface that you positioned it against. Pick up the hammer in your dominant hand and begin to hammer against the keyhole.Keep your fingers away from the place that you are hammering. Also try to keep the U-lock stable and in position as you hammer.
Don’t be alarmed as you see the white powder on the U-lock come off in a mist as you begin to hammer.

, Keep hammering against the keyhole area of the U-lock. You may have to hammer for 30 seconds or so until a piece breaks off of the bar, after which breaking it will become much easier. Focus your hammering against the broken area of the lock. More sections will come off, until the bar breaks completely and separates from one or both sides of the U.Be patient, as it may take several minutes of hammering to break the U-lock.
Dispose of the remains of the lock when you are finished.

Take the right safety precautions.,
Turn on and angle your angle grinder.,
Cut through the U-lock with the angle grinder.,
Make another cut a few inches from the first cut.,
Turn off the angle grinder and remove the U-lock.",How to Break a U Lock3," An angle grinder is a power tool that is highly effective for breaking U-locks and most other kinds of locks. It’s the most powerful and quick method of slicing though U-locks, but in order to handle it responsibly you need to take a few safety precautions. You practice and feel comfortable with your angle grinder before using it on your U-lock. Put on work gloves to protect your hands, as well as goggles to stop any flyaway material from getting in your eyes.
Don’t wear any loose clothing or jewelry when you operate the angle grinder.
Make sure that you are using the right sized disc for the grinder and that the grinder is able to go up to maximum speeds.
If your U-lock is locked but not attached to anything, clamp it with a vice attached to a table. If the lock is fastened around a bicycle, adjust it so that when pressure is applied to it, it doesn’t move but stays in relatively the same place.

, Hold your angle grinder using both hands at an angle of 15-30 degrees. Hold your angle grinder a few inches away from the U-lock and turn it on., Use both hands to hold the angle grinder and slowly bring the blade against one of the U-shaped sides of the U-lock. Don’t be alarmed when you see sparks fly; even if they touch you they won’t hurt you. Hold the blade against the side of the U-lock until it cuts through. This can take anywhere from 15 seconds to a few minutes.Be very slow and deliberate when you use the angle grinder. Don’t push or exert force with the grinder. Just hold the blade against the lock and wait as it chips away.
If exert force while you cut, you will cut through the U-lock and then push angle grinder past it to cut whatever is behind the U-lock.

, If you are trying to take the U-lock off your bike or the handle of a door, you will need to create one more cut to be able to dislodge it. Use the same method to cut the U-lock as you did for the first cut, this time cutting through an area a few inches from the first cut. Stop when you complete the cut.

, After you finish using your angle grinder, turn it off. It’s important as a safety precaution to turn it off immediately after you are finished using it. After you make the second cut, a section of the U-lock should have fallen away to make a gap in the lock. Take the U-lock off, store your angle grinder, and throw away the remains of your lock!

Install deadbolt locks.,
Install a dead-lock.,
Secure sliding doors.",How to Burglarproof Your Doors2," With the exception of sliding doors, all exterior doors should have a deadbolt lock in addition to the lock built into the doorknob. The deadbolt should be high quality (grade 1 or 2, solid metal with no exposed screws on the exterior), with a throw bolt (the bolt that comes out of the door) at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The lock should be properly installed. Many homes have lower quality deadbolts or throw bolts less than 1 inch (2.5 cm). These must be replaced.

, Adding an additional lock will provide extra security when you are home. The dead-lock, sometimes called an 'exit-only deadbolt' is a deadbolt that does not have an external key. It may be clearly visible on the door from the outside, but it cannot be broken into without destroying the door, frame, or lock itself. While this security won't help directly when you aren't home, its visibility may discourage an intruder from trying the door.

, The best way to secure sliding doors is to install keyed locks at the top and bottom. You can also make or purchase a bar that swings down from the door frame to the middle of the door to prevent the door from sliding. At the very least, place a rod (a thick wooden dowel, for example) in the bottom track of the door to keep it from being opened. Regardless of the method you use, it's a good idea to reinforce the glass with polycarbonate panels, as recommended in the previous step.

Install cylinder guards around the lock cylinders (the part where you insert the key).,
Replace flimsy strike plates.,
Secure exposed hinges.,
Fortify your frame.",How to Burglarproof Your Doors3," Burglars can sometimes remove or damage lock cylinders by hammering, wrenching, or prying. Protect these with metal guard plates or protective rings on both sides of the door. Install guard plates with round-head carriage bolts to prevent them from being unscrewed. Free-spinning rings around the cylinders will prevent the use of a pipe wrench to twist out the cylinder. Many locks come with these already, but if yours doesn't, you can purchase them.

, The strike plate is the metal plate that surrounds the lock-set (the hole in the door frame where the lock bolt enters). All exterior doors should have heavy-duty metal security strike plates secured by four 3-inch screws. Many homes are built with lower quality strike plates or have strike plates that are secured with short screws that just attach to the door jamb, not the underlying stud.

, Hinges should be on the inside of the door. If yours are not, rehang the door or secure the exposed hinges with non-removable pins. You can do this by removing at least the two center screws of the hinge (on each side) and replacing them with non-removable hinge pins (you can get these at the hardware store) or double-headed masonry nails. Even hinges that are not exposed should be secured to the frame with 3-inch screws.

, Even if your door is strong and has high-quality, properly installed locks, a burglar may be able to gain entry by breaking or prying the door frame. Most door frame moldings are simply tacked to the wall, so a crowbar or a solid kick can easily separate the frame from the wall. Secure your door frames to the walls by installing several 3-inch screws along the frame and doorstop. The screws should reach the wall stud.

Install viewers.",How to Burglarproof Your Doors4," Viewers, also called peep holes allow you to see who is on the other side of the door. Install wide-angle viewers at eye level on all exterior doors. If you have to open your door to see, your locks won't do you much good. Try to find peep holes with covers to prevent people from looking back in with special tools, like a reverse peephole viewer.

Consider a wireless key finder.,
Compare prices and functionality before you buy.,
Track your keys through your phone.",How to Keep Track of Your Keys1," Wireless key finders are compact tracking devices that can be attached directly to your keychain. These key finders are often no bigger than a standard keychain and send out a tracking signal that can be seen via Bluetooth on your smartphone. They are wireless and easy to use, making them a top choice if you are looking for a technological option for keeping track of your keys.Many wireless key finders are also affordable and come with a rechargeable battery or batteries that can be replaced. The technology for key finders is also continuing to evolve and often new versions of a key finder will come out with even better functionality.;
, There are many wireless key finders currently on the market, at varying price points and offering different levels of functionality. You should compare at least one to two key finders before you buy to find the right one for you. Some of the more popular wireless key finders include:


Tile: This wireless key finder attaches to your keychain and can find your keys up to 80 feet away. It has a sleek, white design and a two way finding feature, where you can locate your keys with your phone and locate your phone with your keys through the key finder. It is also one of the more affordable wireless key finders at around $25USD and is compatible with Android and IOS smartphones. The downside of this wireless key finder is the batteries are non-replaceable, though they should last at least a year.Duet by Protag: This wireless key finder can track your keys up to 80 feet away and lets out a buzz when it locates your keys. It is compatible with Android and IOS smartphones, and the battery is replaceable. It also has a two way finding feature and a geofencing feature, where you can see the location of your keys on a map and get alerts when you walk out of range of your keys. Finally, this device is not very expensive, at around $30 USD.Pally Smart Find: Though this wireless key finder is on the larger end, about the size of a keychain fob, it can track your keys up to 90 feet. It also lets out a very loud alarm when you wander out of the range of your keys and it works on both Android and IOS smartphones. The device runs on two AAA batteries and boasts a two year battery life. It is also affordable, at $30 USD., Most wireless key finders can be used on a variety of smartphones, from Androids to iPhones. The smartphone must have Bluetooth capabilities and you will need to download an app that connects to the key finder to start tracking your keys.You will then need to attach the key finder to your keychain and set up the finder through an app on your phone. You can then easily locate your keys by checking the location of the key finder on your phone.
Many wireless key finders now have a two way finding feature, where you can locate your phone through the finder as well as your keys. You can locate your phone by pressing a button on the key finder. This option may come in handy if you tend to misplace your phone.
If somehow you lose track of both your keys and your phone, you can log into your account (made through the wireless key finder program) on a computer and locate both items that way.

Decide if you want to paint the entire set or just a few important keys.,
Create a small map that will help you to remember which key corresponds to a certain color.,
Get creative with this project.,
Paint the keys.,
Allow time to dry before using.",How to Color Code Your Keys Using Nail Polish," Either approach is fine, as long as it works for you. And bear in mind that painting your keys different colors must actually help you. If you're unlikely to remember what the “red” key is used for, there's little point in painting them. On the positive side, it shouldn't take too long to train yourself to know which color means which door.


Choose between painting the entire key head, entire key or just placing a discerning nail polish “dot” at the top of the key. It's not really recommended that you paint the entire key, as the polish will flake over time and it'll end up sitting in your pocket or bag with repeated use. Plus, too much color can look a bit tacky. In general, a small dot, especially in a subtle color like blue, black or even green, can easily organize keys without too much effort or in-your-face glare.






Consider adding specific colors to a base color for keys that are used at one spot, but in multiple areas. For example, if you have a set of keys for your office, but one key opens the front door and another one works in your office space you could paint all keys that are dedicated for office use the color red, but place a green dot on the key that opens your office.






Consider using day-glow colors so you can discern keys at night or in the dark. Some shimmery colors such as silver or gold may be effective for seeing at night too. Or, use glow-in-the-dark nail polish if you will be using the keys at night or in the dark. You might want to dedicate glow-in-the-dark nail polish just for that set of keys.





;
, While doing this may sound silly, if you're someone who has a lot of keys, it may be tough to remember which color corresponds with which key. Moreover, you need to plan ahead as to which color will fit with which key. It's a good idea to either make the map digitally or to scan in your map and keep a copy on your smartphone and computer, for ease of finding.

Write down each color and its corresponding key. Scan this in if done on paper or simply keep a file if done digitally. It's probably also a very good idea to keep a paper copy in your bag or wallet for those times when the cellphone battery has died.







, Although painting your keys in an effort to organize and categorize them is the name of the game, you may want to brighten up the simple dot and turn it into something with more of a flourish, such as:

Use artful designs to distinguish specific keys. Paint flowers, hearts or clovers on certain keys to help you distinguish which key belongs to which building.






Check out fingernail stickers to add to certain keys. Add small stickers specially made for nails or you could add other small stickers for fun.







, Once you've planned the color code and chosen the colors or designs, simply use the nail polish brush (or small brush if using other paint) and paint on the dot, colored head or other design. Do this over a prepared work space, laying down newspaper or similar to prevent staining if a spill occurs.

As you're painting the keys, if you make a mistake, don’t be afraid to erase with nail polish remover and try again. Since you're working with hard steel, you can re-do your keys if you don’t like the design.







, The polish should air dry quite quickly, but give it a good half hour to an hour to be extra sure.

Blow dust out of the keyhole.,
Spray the lock cylinder and opening.,
Lube the lock with a dry lubricant.,
Use WD-40 as a short term solution.",How to Lubricate a Lock1," Use a can of pressurized air or an air compressor to blow the dust out of the lock. Point the spray nozzle close to the keyhole and press down on the pressure button to blow air through the locking mechanism.





;
, Use a spray cleaner, such as WD-40, to clean the lock cylinder and opening. Spray the cleaner into the keyhole.







, In order to avoid the accumulation of dust inside the lock, you want to use a dry lubricant. Spray a dry lock lubricant, such as 3-in-one lock dry lube, into the keyhole. Insert your key and move it around to spread the lube into the lock.







, If you are in a pinch and just need to get your lock moving quickly, you could try WD-40. Spray WD-40 into the keyhole. Insert your key into the keyhole and open and close the lock in order to work the WD-40 into the deadbolt.








Keep in mind that WD-40 will attract dust particles and eventually gum up your lock. It should only be used as a short-term solution.

Keep your keys in a bowl by the door or on a hook.,
Place your keys in the same pocket every day.,
Decorate your keychain so it is easy to find in your bag.,
Use a belt hook to carry your keys around with you.,
Entrust a neighbor or a friend with an extra set of keys.",How to Keep Track of Your Keys2," As creatures of habit, we can train ourselves to remember where we put important items by making a home for them in our living space. This may mean designating a bowl by your front door as the keys bowl, the spot where your keys go when you get home. You may also have a brightly decorated keys hook right by your door so you can easily hang your keys when you go in and out of your home.Locating the home for your keys by the front door or an entrance you use often will ensure that you remember to put them where they belong as soon as you get inside (although this is, unfortunately, one of the first places a thief will look, too). Over time, this action will feel nature and habitual. It will also make it easier to find your keys in a moment of panic, as you simply need to look for them in their home.

, If you tend to lose your keys while you are on the go, get into the habit of putting your keys in the same pocket of your coat or the same pocket of your pants every day (just keep in mind that a coat can be a prime target for a thief). You can even integrate your keys into your daily dressing routine by putting on your clothing and then sliding your keys into your pocket as a final flourish. Sticking to the same pocket every day will ensure your keys are always in the same spot every day and remain there, even when you are on the go., Another option is to make your keychain bold and bright so it is easy to find the depths of your bag. A large, bright keychain is usually hard to misplace, especially if it has a unique decoration that is easy to identify.You may decide to make a woven keychain out of strips of plastic in bright colors, forming a long loop that attaches to your keychain to make it easier to dig out of your bag. You could also make a keychain by laminating photographs of family and friends and attaching a keyring to the small, square photographs. Personalizing your keychain could help it to stand out and mark it as clearly yours.
Another option is to attach a small pouch to your keychain so you can carry some cash and a few important bank cards with your keys. You may be less likely to lose track of your keys if you know they are attached to important items.
You can also buy decorative keychains that contain charms or decorative items to make it easier to find your keychain in your bag. Look for keychains that are easy to hold and have some weight to them.

, Another popular option is to use a belt hook or a carabiner clip, which are often used in rock climbing to secure ropes. You can loop your keychain through the belt hook and then attach it to your back belt loop so the keys are secure when you are on the go. Carabiner clips come in a variety of shapes and colors, and are often very durable.Carabiner clips make good belt hooks because they allow your keys to sit flat in your back pocket, making it easier to sit down while wearing your keys. If you have a lot of keys on your keychain, you may need to shift them out of the way while they are attached to your belt loop to sit down comfortably.

, If you tend to lose track of your keys on a consistent basis, you may want to leave an extra set of keys with a friend or neighbor as a precaution. Only leave the extra set with someone you trust and someone you can get in touch with easily if you do lose your set of keys.


Some people put a spare set of keys in a hidden area outside of their home, such as under a potted plant or above the door landing. Try to store the spare set in a spot that is hard to access to ensure they are difficult to find, as you do not want a stranger to be able to open your door.

Change the battery.,
Find the dials.,
Learn how the dials work.,
Set the clock.",How to Set an Analog Clock1," If you have to reset your clock, it’s likely that you need a new battery before doing so. Your batteries are usually found in a small box on the back of the clock. If there is no battery box on the back of the clock, a small rectangular hole in an indented rectangle is a good sign of a battery pack.


If there is no battery inside your clock, most battery packs have embossed letters inside the battery spaces telling you what size batteries to get.;
, Dials are usually located at the back of the clock. Sometimes you may have to remove a battery cover in order to get access to the dials on your clock.


If your clock has an alarm or a calendar, you may find that it has many dials. Your dials may have arrows or diagrams next to them that indicate their function.

, You can figure out how the dials work by experimenting. Turn the dials, and then see what happens on the face of the clock.


You should choose a dial and put your fingers on it firmly. Then turn the clock around so that you can see the hands moving, and turn the dial to figure out which hand it is connected to. There are a number of variables that can affect the function of the dials, so try to experiment: turn them both directions, and lift them or pull them out to see if this changes which hand engages.
Some clocks will use one dial for each hand. Other clocks will have one dial that moves both hands. There may also be a dial to set an alarm, which is usually a smaller hand that is a different color than the other ones.

, Check a phone or computer to find the current time. News and weather channels often display the time as well.

Clock insert for the hockey puck. From a craft supply store.;
, An inexpensive press is just fine for this project.
Forstner bit for the drill press, same size as base of the clock insert. See ""tips"" for an example of standard dimensions. A Forstner bit is designed to ""sweep out"" the region it is drilling. You can also do the job with an ordinary hole saw and a gouge, but it would be lots more work.

,


Remember your high school geometry? If so, you can use that technique.
Or just use a ruler, and estimate the centre location. Measure the distance from the estimated centre location to the edges of the puck, and keep moving the estimated centre, until you get the puck centre located.
Lines on the puck should, ideally, be kept to the central region so they will disappear when you drill out the hole for the clock insert.

,, You do not need speed, as hockey pucks are soft compared to metal. Rather, you are looking for accuracy. Also, using a slow speed means less risk of melting the edge of the hole.

, You do not want to drill all the way through.

,, The exact depth depends upon the clock insert you are using.

,, You are done!

Keep the clock in a vertical position.,
Unlatch the cuckoo door.,
Wind the clock.,
Nudge the pendulum.,
Turn the minute hand counterclockwise.,
Alternatively, turn the minute hand clockwise and pause.,
Never move the hour hand.,
Observe the clock for 24 hours.,
Move the pendulum down to slow the clock.,
Move the pendulum up to speed up the clock.,
Wind as needed.,
Adjust the cuckoo shut-off switch as needed.",How to Set a Cuckoo Clock," Before setting the clock, you should hang it on the wall where you intend to keep it. The clock must be in an upright position before you can set it.The clock should be 6 to 6.5 feet (1.8 to 2 m) above the floor.
Use wide wood screw (like a #8 or #10) that is long enough the fasten into a stud in the wall. You must choose a spot in the wall with a stud; do not attempt to hang the clock where no stud rests.
Place the screw in the wall at an upward 45 degree angle. It should stick out by about 1.25 to 1.5 inches (3.2 to 3.8 cm).
Hang the clock on this screw. The clock must be flush against the wall.
If the chains are still in their packaging, slowly remove the packaging and loosen any knots. Pull out the security wire between them. Do not handle the chains in this manner while the clock is horizontal or upside down since doing so can cause the chains to come loose.
One weight should be placed on each chain hook.
Make sure that the pendulum rests on the hanger at the bottom of the clock, near the back.;
, If the cuckoo bird's door is kept closed with a wire latch, you need to move the latch aside.


Failing to unlatch the door can prevent it from opening when it should. This can cause damage to your clock.
If the cuckoo does not call at the appropriate time even with the door unlatched, check the wire latch again to make sure that it did not slip back into a locked position. You should also make sure that the shut-off switch is not flipped into a silent position (when applicable) and that all clips, rubber bands, and Styrofoam packing materials have been removed from inside the clock.

, Grab the chain that does not have a weight on it and gently pull it directly down toward the floor.


Do not lift or otherwise touch the weighted chain as you wind the clock. There must always be some pressure on the weighted chain in order to keep it in place within the clock.
The unweighted chain may have a ring on it.

, Gently nudge the pendulum to either side using your hands. It should continue swinging on its own after you start it.


The pendulum should not rub against the clock cabinet and should swing freely. If this is not the case, then the clock probably isn't completely vertical. Readjust and try again.
You should also listen to the ticking. If the clock does not tick evenly on both sides, you should readjust the straightness of the clock until the ticking sounds even.

, Turn the long hand of the clock to the left until you reach the correct time.When done in this manner, the cuckoo call should set itself automatically. There is no need to pause and check the sound.

, If you turn the long hand to the right, you must pause at every hour (""12"") and half hour (""6"") mark before continuing to turn it.


Wait for the cuckoo call to finish playing before you turn the minute hand any further past these marks.
If you have a musical clock, wait for the melody to finish playing before you continue to turn the minute hand.
When setting a cuckoo clock that has both cuckoo birds and quails, you will also need to stop at the quarter past (""3"") and quarter until (""9"") marks. Wait for the call or music to stop before continuing.

, Do not turn the shorthand at all when setting the clock.


Turning the hour hand instead of the minute hand will damage the clock.

, Even if you purchased a new, pre-regulated cuckoo clock, you should observe it for a full 24 hours to determine if it is on time.


After setting the original time, compare the time on the cuckoo clock to the time shown on another trusted clock, watch, or time-keeping device.
Make sure to use a time-keeping device that can be trusted. Stick with a watch or similar device that has always been reliable in the past.

, If the clock runs too fast, slow it down by carefully moving the pendulum bob downward. This causes the pendulum to move slower.


The bob will usually look like a weighted disc or leaf.
Monitor the clock for the rest of the day to make sure that this adjustment was correct.

, If the clock runs too slow, speed it up by carefully pushing the pendulum bob up. This causes the pendulum to swing faster.


The pendulum bob will usually be in the shape of a leaf or weighted disc.
Continue checking the clock's accuracy to determine if this adjustment was correct.

, The frequency with which you need to wind the clock will vary depending on the model, but you'll usually need to wind it once every 24 hours or once every eight days.Each time you wind the clock, do so in the same manner used to wind the clock initially. Pull the unweighted chain down to raise the weighted chain up as high as it will go without resistance.

, The cuckoo noise of some clocks can be switched of manually as desired. Make sure that the switch is adjusted to either play or mute the sound as desired.


The switch can be found on either the bottom of the clock or to the left side.
Usually, you will need to flip the switch off to turn off the cuckoo call and flip it down to turn the call back on again. This can vary by model, though, so you may need to check with the manufacturer to verify the correct way to use the manual shut-off switch.
Never adjust this switch while the cuckoo call or song is actively playing.
Note that this feature is not available on every model. It can be especially rare for vintage or antique cuckoo clocks.

Gather the tools that you need in order to get started.,
Get started with a light bulb.,
Start by hollowing out the inside of the light bulb.,
Use needle-nose pliers to remove the metal tip from the bottom of the light bulb.,
Hold on really tightly on one side of the bulb.,
Break away the black glass carefully and remove it.,
Look at the bulb.,
Use a flathead screwdriver to carefully snap the interior tube, using the screwdriver as a lever from the bottom.,
Pull out any remaining wires and glass tube with the pliers.

,
Pour salt into the light bulb and shake it.,
Use a screwdriver to break off any remaining bits of glass around the interior edge.,
Obtain sand.,
Dry the sand and spread it out on a cookie sheet.,
Make sure that the sand is completely dry before continuing.,
Pour approximately one cup of completely dry sand about ¼ under the silver rim.,
Tighten up the plastic bottle caps on both light bulbs.,
Build the frame.,
Look at your work so far.,
Do a mock-up.,
Finish.",How to Make an Hourglass Clock Out of Light Bulbs," You need a flat head screwdriver, scissors, and needle-nose pliers for the beginning. Look at the ""Things You'll Need"" section for all of the materials required.

, Globe light bulbs work best for this project. Use a light bulb that is burned out, so as to save you money. Don’t use the soft white bulbs because they are a little too fragile to work with.;
, Place a cardboard box under the light bulb, so that it catches any falling glass. Goggles are needed in this step because it involves breaking glass. This is the part that is done by adults only.

, Carefully push up the sides of metal tip away from the black glass part.

, Yank out the metal piece. You will feel some little wires snap when this is done.

, This is done by firmly holding one side of the glass with pliers and twisting it up to break the glass. Hold on the bulb firmly––the black glass is quite thick and it takes some force to break. Be very careful while doing this step.

, You will be able to see the inside parts of the light bulb at this step.

, It will make a little sound as the gas escapes. Smash the remaining glass containing the tube. It takes a little force to do this, so hold on the light bulb firmly. The light bulb will not break, provided that you keep the screwdriver away from the bulb itself.

,, This will remove all the white substance from the inside edge of the light bulb.

, Now you have a hollow light bulb. That was the hardest part of this project.

, Make sure that you have enough sand to place in the cookie sheet. The sand can be bought either at a garden store or obtained free from a beach. If you are using beach sand, rinse it thoroughly to remove any non-sand materials.

, Put it into the oven at 350ºF/180ºC. Be very careful when taking it out, because it will be very hot. Wear suitable oven mitts.

, Any condensation left in the hourglass it will cause the sand to stick to the light bulb.

, Use a funnel or a folded piece of cardboard to make it easier to pour.

, This will hold the light bulbs tighter. Make sure that you place a hole in the center of both for the sand to flow through. The picture is similar, but it gives you an idea of what you have to do.

, This is the fun part because you can make it any way you want it to look. A simple hand saw can take care of the whole job. You will need measuring tape and a hammer for the nails. Also, you need four columns, a base, and a top for the frame.

, You are almost done; you can see that there are three columns in place.

, This is the part in which you set up your materials in the way that you want it to ultimately look. Once everything looks good in the mock-up, glue the light bulbs and build the frame around the light bulbs.

, You can now decorate your hourglass in any way that you want. The image in this step show an example of what a finished light bulb hourglass looks like.

Make sure you know how to change the time on your digital clock.,
With the shortwave radio / online receiver on, change the time on the  physical  clock to a minute after the current time.,
When the actual time reaches the stopped time, quickly confirm the time change on the digital clock.

,
Repeat.",How to Sync Your Clock with WWV2," Most digital clocks reset to zero seconds when you change their time.

,  Say like if it was 23:02:09 GMT+8 (15:02:09 UTC) , set it to 23:03 (15:03 UTC) on the physical clock.

,, With this single clock synced to the station, simply take this clock and use it to do the same with all the other clocks you own, replacing the station time with the time from your first synced clock.

"
Take the analogue clock and stop it when the seconds pointer is directly at 0 seconds, which would make it point to 12.,
With the shortwave radio / online receiver on, change the time on the  physical  clock to a minute after the current time.,
Wait until the real time is the same as the time set on the stopped clock.,
With this single clock synced to the station, simply take this clock and use it to do the same with all the other clocks you own, replacing the station time with the time from your first synced clock.

",How to Sync Your Clock with WWV3," This can be done by removing the battery quickly, or by pulling out the tab which lets you set the time on a watch.

,  Say like if it was 23:02:09 GMT+8 (15:02:09 UTC) , set it to 23:03 (15:03 UTC) on the physical clock.

, Replace the battery quickly, or quickly push the watch tab back in.

,"
"
Change the battery.,
Find the crown on your watch.,
Pull out the crown.,
Set the time.,
Push the crown in.",How to Set an Analog Clock2," If your watch has stopped, you may need to change the battery. You can find watch batteries at Radio Shack or Walmart, or you may want to take your watch back to the place that you bought it for a professional fix.


You can potentially scratch your watch if you try to replace your battery yourself. However, if you do want to pry off the back of your watch, you can do so with a small flat-head jeweler’s screwdriver. Insert the tip of the screwdriver into the indentation or tab that separates the front and back of your watch. Tap it with a hammer or rubber mallet until the back comes off. You should then be able to replace the battery (use a non-metal object to remove and replace the battery) and the back of the watch.If your watch is solar powered or movement powered, you may need to charge it in the sun, or wear it for a day or two before it is ready to set.

, This is the small knob on the side of your watch.Depending on how complicated your watch is, you may have buttons instead of a crown.

, On some watches, the crown will pull out to multiple levels. Usually, one level will change the date, and another level will change the time.


Experiment by pulling the crown out to multiple levels and turning it. If it doesn’t affect the minute hand and hour hand, pull it out or push it in to a different level.

, Turn the crown until the minute hand and hour hand are pointing to the correct places.


Usually the minute and hour hands will move together.

, This will set the time, and your watch will start running again.


Make sure that crown is pushed all the way in. If you don’t push it all the way in, your watch will not restart.

Gather the supplies.,
Cover the numbers.,
Mount the clock.,
Determine where you will hang the numbers.,
Hang the numbers and set the clock.",How to Make Clocks1," To make a floating clock, you’ll need the following tools: adhesive putty, wooden numbers ranging from 1 – 12, 4 different pieces of scrapbook paper, glue, an Xacto knife, pink ink and a clock mechanism kit.Wooden numbers can be purchased on Etsy or in a craft store.
The clock mechanism kit can be purchased on Etsy or in a craft store for around $5.
For a funkier look, try buying your wooden numbers in different fonts and sizes.;
, Use the glue to attach each of the wooden numbers to a portion of the scrapbook paper. Use the Xacto knife to carefully cut around the numbers to remove the excess paper.Set the numbers aside for a moment and allow the glue to dry.
Finish off the numbers by dipping the edges in the ink.
To seal the numbers further, paint on a protective coat of glaze.
For a more sophisticated look, forgo the scrapbook paper and instead spray the numbers with metallic silver spray paint.

, The clock will end up measuring about two feet wide, so pick a spot to mount it where you have a lot of room. Once you have selected the spot, use a ruler to determine the center of the spot. This is where you will hang the clock mechanism.


Secure the clock mechanism to the wall using the adhesive putty.
This clock looks great when positioned over a mantelpiece or low cabinet.

, Use a ruler to measure up one foot directly on top of the clock. Mark this spot with a pencil. This is where you will hang the number 12.


Measure one foot to the right of your clock and mark it with a pencil. This is where you will hang the number 3.
Measure down one foot below your clock and mark it with a pencil. This is where you will hang the number 6.
Measure one foot to the left of your clock and mark it with a pencil. This is where you will hang the number 9.

, Use the adhesive putty to hang the 12, 3, 6 and 9 on the pre-marked pencil spots. You can then use a ruler and pencil to space out and mark off where the rest of the numbers will hang.Use the adhesive putty to hang the remaining numbers.
Adhesive putty is easily removable, so if you need to adjust the placement of a number, you can easily remove it from the wall and remount it somewhere else.
Insert any batteries the clock mechanism may require and set the clock to the correct time.

"
Gather the supplies.,
Prepare the clock hands.,
Paint the trivets.,
Assemble the clocks.",How to Make Clocks2," To make this clock, you will need the following materials: 1 cork trivet, 1 hanging clock kit, 3 contrasting paint colors, white spray paint, a power drill, painter’s tape, paint brushes, scissors, a mixing palette, a water cup and paper towels.If you don’t have a palette, you can use a paper plate instead.
Try to choose paint colors in very bright colors.

, Use a ruler to determine the center of the cork trivet. Mark this point with an X and use a power drill to drill a hole through the marking. The hole should be large enough that the clock part can fit through.Clock hands come as part of a clock mechanism kit, which can be purchased online or in stores for around $5.
Clean up the cork board shavings and wipe down the area.
Spray the clock hands from the clock making kit with the white spray paint. Let them dry before proceeding.

, Use the painter’s tape to create interesting geometric designs on the trivet. You might try using the tape to create intersecting triangles or a giant X. Fill in portions of the trivet with paint, while still leaving other portions blank.Make sure to smooth out the tape to prevent color bleeding.
If you only have two different shades of paint, try mixing them together to create the third shade.
Give the trivets two or three coats before allowing them to dry.

, Once the paint has dried on the trivet, slowly peel the tape off the trivet. Touch up any scuffs or marks and allow the touch ups to dry. Finish the clock by assembling the clock making kit.Make sure to set the clock before hanging it on the wall.
Buy three times the supplies and make three times the clocks. Hang them in clusters on the wall or give the extras away as gifts.

"
"
Gather the supplies.,
Lay out the clock.,
Insert the photos.,
Cover the clock mechanism.,
Hang the clock.",How to Make Clocks3," To make a photo clock, you will need the following materials: 2 sheets of 18”x24” newsprint or poster paper, tape, a pencil, 12 pictures frames measuring 2”x3”, 12 photos measuring 2”x3”, a clock mechanism kit, a ruler, a sheet of cardstock measuring 8.5”x11”, scissors, blue painters tape, a hammer and nails.Try mixing and matching different colors and styles of picture frames.
A larger clock mechanism kit measures approximately 1 1/8"" and costs around $10. This can be purchased online or in craft stores.

, Place the two sheets of newsprint or poster paper on the floor, then attach them to each other using scotch tape. Place the clock mechanism kit in the center of the sheets, then arrange the picture frames around the clock mechanism.Experiment with positioning some of the frames vertically and some of the frames horizontally.
Play around with the layout until you find a design that works for you.
When you’re satisfied with the layout, use a pencil to trace all of the frames onto the sheets of paper.

, Place the photos you’ve selected for this project inside the frames. Have fun choosing photos for this project. Try to come up with a theme for your clock and choose twelve pictures that fall under that theme.Try choosing photos of twelve places you’ve been on vacation.
Choose twelve different photos of you and your significant other during key points of your relationship.

, Use a pencil, ruler and some scissors to cut the cardstock paper into a square or rectangle that is large enough to cover the clock mechanism.If the clock mechanism is small enough, cut the cardstock to be 3.25”x3.75” – the same size as the picture frames.
Use scissors or an Xacto knife to cut a hole in the middle of the cardstock. This is where the metal portion of the clock mechanism will go.
Follow the instructions on the clock making kit and put the clock mechanism together.
Use the cardstock cover you made in place of the “clock face” that the instructions will call for.

, Find a blank wall where you want to hang the clock. Use scotch tape to hang the newsprint tracing you made in step one on the wall. Use the frame tracings as a guide and hammer in the nails for each of the frames on top of the tracings you made.After you’re done hammering, pull the newsprint off the wall. The nails should stay in place and the paper should slide out easily.
Hang up all the frames and clock piece.
Place a AA battery in the clock piece and set the clock to the correct time.

Paint the clock face before you write the numbers down.,
Outline the clock and arrows with some glitter glue.,
Label the two clock hands, or make them different colors.,
Paint the rim of the paper plate a different color.,
Decorate the numbers.",How to Make a Paper Clock," You can move the hands yourself, but for that, you will need a brad or paper fastener. Here's a list of what you will need:


Paper plate
Paper
Brad (paper fastener)
Scissors
Crayons, markers, stickers, etc;
, A plate with pictures on it may look pretty, but you won't be able to see the numbers. Don't worry, you can color the plate later.


If you can't find a plain paper plate, use a regular plate to trace a circle onto a piece of paper. Cut the circle out and use it instead.

, If you have a very narrow rim, then write the numbers on the plate itself. Try to make the spaces between the numbers as even as you can. It might also be a good idea to write the numbers with a pencil first. You can draw over the numbers with crayon or marker later.


Try to write the 12, 3, 6, and 9 first. This may help you keep things even.You can also use foam or sticker numbers instead of writing them out.

, One arrow should be a little shower than the other one. Make sure that the bigger arrow can reach the numbers.


The big arrow will be the minute hand, and the small hand will be the hour hand.

, If you want to add color to your clock, now is the time. You can color the clock with crayons, paint, or markers. You can add stickers or even glitter to it. Try not to put too much on it, or you will not see the numbers. Click here for some more ideas.


If you used paint or glitter glue, you will need to let everything dry before moving on.

, You can use a ballpoint pen, a toothpick, or a wooden skewer to do this. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.


To find the center, flip the plate over so the back is facing you. Draw a huge X across the back of the clock. Make sure that the points of the X are touching the edges of the clock. The center of the X is the center of the clock.

, Line up the bottom of the arrows up first, then punch the hole through both arrows at the same time. This will make it more even. You can use a hole puncher to make this easier.If you don't have a hole punch, you can poke the hole using a ballpoint pen.

, Make sure that the hole in each arrow lines up with the hole in the clock.

, The pointy end should be coming out of the back of the clock.

, Separate the prongs first, then flatten them against the plate. You can use a butter knife to pull the prongs apart. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you. Brads can be very sharp.

, Turn the clock back over so that you can see the numbers again. You can now move the arrows around. Try not to pull or tug too hard, or the paper will rip.

, Take a few inches of ribbon and fold it in half to make a loop. Tie the two ends into a knot to keep them together. Turn the clock over so that you can see the back. Put a drop of hot glue close to the top. Press the ribbon down onto it and let it dry.


Glue guns can get very hot. Ask an adult to help you with this step.
You can also staple the ribbon to the plate instead.

, Cut a long, skinny rectangle out of some yellow paper. Cut a circle out of the same paper and glue it to the bottom of the rectangle. Wait for the glue to dry, then poke a hole near the top of the rectangle. Turn the clock over so that the back is facing you, and open up the brad. Slip the prongs through the hole in the rectangle, then flatten them again. Turn your clock back over and swing the pendulum.

, Be careful not to get any glue onto the brad, or you may not be able to turn the arrows anymore. Cut a wave-like shape around the edges of the brown paper, and pin it to your wall. Your clock will look like a grandfather clock!


Consider combining this with the swinging pendulum.

, If you want the paint the clock after you have written the numbers, you may need to re-write them. Some paint is translucent, and some paint is opaque.

, If you cannot find any glitter glue, then draw on the clock with some regular glue, and cover it with glitter. Tap the excess glitter off onto a sheet of paper. Use the paper to funnel the glitter back into its container.

, You can write ""hour"" on the little hand, and ""minutes"" on the big hand. You can also cut the hands out of two different colors, to make them easier to tell apart.

, This will make your clock look even more realistic. Colors such as black, brown, blue, or red will work great for this. You can also try using gold or silver paint.

, You don't have to write the numbers using marker. Try using stickers or foam letters instead. You can also try using a silver or gold permanent marker.

Consider using the Roman numbers instead: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Start at the 1 o'clock position with the ""I"" and continue around the rim. The XII should be at the top of the clock, where the 12 would be.

",How to Make a Bicycle Rim Clock,";
, Clean your rim thoroughly.

, The clock should be cheap, and should ideally have long hands. However, we will be making hand extensions, so if you cannot find a clock with long hands, do not worry.

, Carefully remove the hands.

, This will be used for the hand extensions.


Measure the radius of the bicycle rim and cut hand extensions for the clock accordingly. Generally, the hour hand should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm), and the minute hand will be 8 inches (20.3 cm). Paint them if you would prefer a different color.







, Allow to dry. Use only superglue, do not use a heavy adhesive. Using a heavy glue may mess up the clock's mechanism.

, (optional)


Place the hands back on the center of the rim.







, You can hot glue it but keep in mind if your surroundings becomes warm this is not advised. You can use industrial glue for durability.

,,,


Put in batteries and adjust the time. You should still be able to adjust the time as you would normally on the clock.

First remove the motor from the old case by removing the hands and unscrewing the nut on the front of the clock.,
Find a piece of hardboard or thick card about the same width as the old clock's diameter (20 cm or 8"" in my case), this is purely so that the hands are not too long or short.

,
Find the centre of your new dial by using the crossing point of the diagonals.

,
Next find the centre across one edge and draw a line through the centre point from here.

,
Using a pair of compasses (if projecting the Hour marks onto a conventional circle, draw two concentric circles with the inner one about 1cm (6/16"") smaller than the larger.

,
Using a protractor lined up on the centre line at the 0/180 line and using the centre of the board to centre the protractor, make pencil marks at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 degrees.

Strip back the cable jacket.,
Expose the wires.,
Place the cable wires in the jack.,
Terminate the conductor wires.,
Inspect the wires.,
Place a dust cap on the jack.,
Find a basic hand-powered punch down tool.,
Consider buying a battery-powered punch down tool.,
Get a multi-wire punch down tool.",How to Use a Punch Down Tool," You should leave about 2.5 inches (6 cm) at the end of the cable. Insert the cable into the cable stripping tool or modular crimping tool and spin it around a few times. You should see that the jacket is cut. Remove the jacket.








Stripping back the cable will help you remove the jacket to expose enough of the cable so you can separate it.;
, You should have a few inches of exposed cable once you remove the cable jacket. Gently pull away the wire pairs from the center of the cable so they fan out. Separate the wire pairs by twisting in a counterclockwise motion. 








Try to straighten the ends as much as you can since this can make them easier to terminate.

, Take the protective cover off the top of the jack and set the cable into the block of the jack. Insert each wire (conductor) into its own separate slot, making sure that the wire matches the A or B configuration. The conductor wires should be extending out of the jack.Consider whether or not you want to use the T568A or T568B wiring scheme. The T568B is becoming more popular since it can be used with older color codes as well as newer codes., Take your punch down tool and press it down on the conductor wires to cut them. The angled (cut) part of the blade should come into contact with the shoulder (the long sturdy side of the jack). This will also make sure the wires that are cut are flush with the jack.








Be sure to punch straight down and not at an angle. This will prevent the jack from bending.
You should hear a loud click when you punch down. This just means that you've terminated the wire correctly., Once you've finished terminating the wires, look at each wire to make sure there is no overhang out the side of the jack. You should also make sure that the edge of the cable jacket is near the base of the jack and the wires you just terminated. The wires should be securely in place.If you notice wires sticking out the side, take a wire cutter and carefully trim the wire so that it's flush with the jack.

, Snap the dust caps in place so that the wires are protected. This will keep the connection secure and can prevent strain on the wires. You can easily remove the dust cap if you need to make changes to wiring later. Simply pop off the dust cap using a flat-head screwdriver inserted into the indentation on the side.








If you can't set the dust caps back on the jack, your wires may not be seated correctly. Check the wires again to make sure they are secure and trimmed.

, If you'll only occasionally be terminating wires, you can find a simple punch down tool that relies on pressure to trigger a cutting mechanism.


These are usually the least expensive and you can purchase replacement blades if they become dull.

, If you'll be terminating lots of wires or need to do it quickly, you may want to use a battery-powered punch down tool. These usually come with lithium batteries that don't require much charging.


You can choose the voltage for your punch down tool as well as whether or not you'd like to buy replacement blades. You may want to buy the extra blades if you'll be terminating a lot of wires.

, You might find that you're still terminating so many wires that a standard punch down tool can't keep up with the work. Multi-wire punch tools work by terminating several pairs of twisted wires so you can terminate more wire more quickly.Multi-wire punch down tools are also more efficient than standard punch down tools. They can also decrease hand fatigue which is more common in standard punch tools.

Clear a circular area of bare ground and place a stick (gnomon) in the center.,
Find which way is north.,
Draw a new circle as large as you want to make your sundial, with the center where your east-west and north-south lines meet.,
Make a mark every 15 degrees on the circle (use a pebble).,
Find your approximate latitude, you can look it up online, or one way to find latitude in the northern hemisphere is to determine how far above the horizon the north star (Polaris) lies.,Extend a perpendicular line from the latitude stone to the north-south line

,
Draw an ellipse with the minor axis at this point, and the major axis where the circle intersects the east-west line.,
Extend a line straight south or north from each 15 degree mark on the circle to the ellipse and place a pebble at the intersections.,
Stand up a stick in the center of the circle.,
Watch for a shadow to be cast, whatever number that shadow is cast on, that is your beginning to find out what time it is.",How to Build a Temporary Sundial,";
, If you place pebbles throughout a day at the point where the sun casts a shadow from the tip of the gnomon, the stones will describe a hyperbola and North is where the shadow is shortest. A more accurate way will be to find east-west first. Draw a circle centered at your vertical stick, at a radius given by a morning pebble, then wait until afternoon when the shadow just touches the circle. A line drawn between these two points will be due east-west and you can draw a line perpendicular to this to find a true north-south line.

, A good radius is about the same length as your shadow stick.

, Start by dividing the arc between east and north in half, then divide each of these into three equal pieces. You should end up with 24 even spaces along the circle.

, Polaris is at the end of the handle of the little dipper. Once you know your latitude, mark the point on the circle that corresponds to that angle (counterclockwise) from east. If your latitude is a multiple of 15 degrees, you can use one of the pebbles you have already used.

,, The point where the ellipse crosses the north-south line will be 12 o'clock. The points where the ellipse crosses the east-west line will be 6 o'clock (AM to the west, PM to the east).

, These will be your hours. Note the lines extending east-west out from the inner circle in the diagram and inward north-south from the outer circle, the intersections determine the hour points and instead of drawing an ellipse, you can just find these points.


Your sundial should look like this (this image was done in a drawing program and the 15 minute marks were added, you can simply divide each hour into 4 with three smaller pebbles):

, The type of sundial you have just made is called an emblematic sundial. The exact position of the stick (gnomon) should change with the season (+/- 23.5 degrees) along the north-south line as the sun moves north and south of the equator, but this is a temporary structure so we will dispense with that for now.

, You must then correct for your longitude and the equation of time, and daylight savings time (if any).


Attached is a completed sundial with the construction lines removed and a declination line added. The mono (stick) should lie along the center of this in a position which corresponds to the time of year.

Look for the winding points.,
Obtain a clock crank or key of the correct size.,
Use the crank or key to wind the first weight.,
Repeat the process for the other winding points.,
If necessary, make adjustments carefully.,
Wind weekly, or as necessary.",How to Wind a Grandfather Clock1," If your grandfather clock is wound by a crank or a key, it should have one to three small holes on the clock face. Most commonly, these are located near the 3 (III), the 9 (IX), the center, or anywhere in the lower half of the clock face. If you do not see a hole, and your clock did not come with a crank or key, see the instructions for chain-wound clocks instead.;
, Newly purchased clocks of this type should come with a key or crank, but if you acquired a used clock, or misplaced the winding implement, you can find a new one online or from a clockmaker. Open the door protecting the clock face, and measure the width of each hole precisely using a ruler or tape measure with a millimeter scale (mm), or preferably a set of calipers that can measure in 0.25 mm increments.Purchase a crank or key with this shaft width for safe and easy winding. You may wish to purchase three or four winding implements in different sizes, in case your measurement was slightly off.



Note: When purchasing a crank, make sure the length of the shaft is sufficient to raise the crank above the level of the clock hands, so you can turn it 360º without damaging them.Some manufacturers sell keys in a numbered scale, rather than by shaft width. However, there is no single industry-wide scale, so referring to the exact millimeter size is recommended., Gently push the shaft of the crank or key into any one of the winding holes. It should be a snug fit, but do not force it in. Gently hold the clock face steady with one hand, and use the other to gently turn the crank. Try turning in both directions, and see which one moves smoothly; each individual clock winds either clockwise or counterclockwise. One of the long weights lower down in the clock should rise as you turn. Stop turning right before the weight touches the wooden ""seat board,"" or when the key no longer easily turns.If you cannot turn the key easily, or you do not see a weight moving, check to see if one of the weights is already at the top. If one or more of the chimes is turned off, the weight responsible for timing that chime will not fall, and does not need to be wound.
The weights are typically located above the pendulum. You may or may not need to open the lowercase in order to see them.

, If your clock has more than one weight, it should also have more than one winding point in the clock face. Move the crank or key to the remaining winding points, turning it in each one until every weight is nearly touching the wooden board above it.

, Now is a good time to check whether the clock is still displaying the correct time. If not, you may physically move only the minute hand to the correct time, moving it clockwise only. Always stop at the 12 (XII) and allow the clock to strike the hour before continuing.Do the same for other points if the clock chimes at additional times (typically the quarter hours at the 3, 6, and 9).


There are some clocks that can safely have their minute hand turned counterclockwise, but do not risk it unless you are certain. If the minute hand ""resists"" attempts to move it clockwise, and can move smoothly counterclockwise, you may have an unusual model that should be adjusted counterclockwise.If your clock is running too fast or too slow, find the knob or nut at the bottom of the swinging pendulum. Tighten it clockwise in order to slow the clock down, or loosen it counterclockwise to speed it up.

, Almost all grandfather clocks are made to run for seven or eight days without winding, so winding them on the same day each week will ensure that it never stops. If your clock stops before its regular winding time, however, you may need to wind it more frequently.

"
"
Look for chains hanging next to the weights.,
Gently pull on one of the chains.,
Repeat with the other weights.,
Make adjustments if necessary.",How to Wind a Grandfather Clock2," Open the door protecting the long, hanging weights in the clock case (not the pendulum). Most clocks have one, two, or three weights, but there may be more on unusual models. If you see a hanging chain next to each weight, your clock is probably chain-wound.


If you cannot find either a chain or a winding hole in the clock face, ask someone to help you look, or consult a professional clockmaker or clock repair shop.

, Grasp a chain hanging next to a weight that is not at the top of the case. Slowly pull down on the chain and watch the weight rise. Continue until the weight is almost touching the board at the top of the weight case, or until you cannot move the weight by pulling at the same gentle rate.Pull on the chain next to a weight, never the chain the weight is attached to.
It does not matter which weight you wind first.

, Each weight has its own chain. Gently pull on each of these until the weight associated with it has nearly touched the board above the weights. Your clock is fully wound once all the weights are in the top-most position.


Typically, the center weight controls the clock's timekeeping. If other weights are present, they control the hour strike, or the quarter-hour chime.

, Physically rotate the minute hand, not the hour hand, of the clock if you need to set the time. Rotate clockwise unless you feel resistance in that direction, and use your free hand to steady the clock face as you turn. Be gentle to avoid bending or breaking the clock hand, and stop and wait for the clock to strike or time before continuing to move the hand.


A nut on the bottom of the pendulum can be tightened to slow the clock down, or loosened to speed it up. Adjust this if you find yourself adjusting the time every week or two.

",How to Turn an Old Book Into a Clock," Select one that either has personal significance or one that matches the décor or theme of the room. Make sure the book is sturdy and can stand alone without much assistance––a book with between two and three inches (5cm-7.5cm) of pages is your best bet.


Evaluate your room to determine which colors and style work best. For some rooms, a loud, colorful book cover will enhance your style, while for other rooms, a more romantic, subdued book cover cover will work best. If you're going completely for style, you may want to troll some used book stores for the right fit.
Consider choosing a book that is symbolic of your life. If a certain book has made a significant impact on your life, it might be the ideal one to transform it into your clock. That way, it will always be on show to remind you of the journey you took with this work of literature.;
, You only want the clock for its motor and hands, so it doesn't matter what the rest of the clock looks like. However, do match the hand size and style to the size of your book - if they're too big, the hands may not fit on the cover.

, Pop open the top and gently remove the contents using the X-ACTO knife.


Make sure you don’t damage any portion of the clock when taking it apart––the hands can be fragile, so take care when disassembling the clock.







, First, open the book cover so that you only have to drill a hole in the cover, and not through the rest of the book. Then, carefully drill a hole large enough so that the clock's motor rod can fit through the hole.


Alternatively, consider other areas of the book cover than the center for placement of the hands. You don't have to be “by the book” with this clock––creative license is allowed. For example, if you find a clock with smaller hands, you could place the clock portion towards the top of left of center area of the cover. This could create interest and offbeat appeal.







, The motor will sit nestled inside the pages, so you’ll need to make an exact space using the actual motor as your model. To do this:


Place the motor behind the opened-out cover on the first page of the book, centered directly behind the drilled hole. Make sure that the motor is perfectly centered, as you will want the motor rod to fit through the cover hole.






Trace the motor with a pencil and then set it aside. Doing this will provide you with your stencil for cutting out the exact shape in the pages. It helps also to measure the motor’s depth, so you know how far into the book you should cut.







, Carefully slice away at the pages to create a nook for the motor. Drop the motor into the nook from time to time and try to close the book to determine if you have cut far enough into the book yet. Consider cutting fewer pages at first and checking the depth regularly until it's just right.

, Now you can assemble the clock using the hands and any decorative items to accentuate your new book clock.

, If the book tells the entire “story” and completes the décor, you may want to stop here. This is the basic body of the clock. You may like it the way it is or decorate it further:


Match the room décor. Add decorative numbers, jewels or small items to embellish it. You could also decoupage the clock with pictures to follow a theme.







, Check that it sits solidly without being likely to fall. This may require steadying the book or adding rubber feet.

Obtain a laser cutter.,
Create an image that you wish to cut.,
Choose the material you are going to cut your image onto.,
Check to make sure the lens is clean.,
Turn on your machine and get ready to cut.,
Set your laser cutter's line width and cutting speed and then cut out your image.",How to Use a Laser Cutter,"


You can opt to buy a laser cutting machine, however they are quite costly. If you do not want or need to purchase your own, you can see if you can rent or lease one. You can also check stores and the Internet for used models that will be sold at a lower price.;
,


Choose the image that you wish to cut. This can be from a camera, a drawing or an image you found online. The image will need to be uploaded to your computer and into software that works with your laser cutter. Most laser cutters will use software called CorelDRAW, but your model may have different software.

,


There are many different materials that a laser cutter can work with. Wood, acrylic and laser-safe plastic can both be cut and etched. Aluminum and glass can also be etched with a laser cutter.

,


Make sure that the lens is clean before starting to cut, or your image and cut may be off. To check the lens you will have to remove a few screws using a screwdriver. If the lens does need cleaning, use a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol to gently clean it.

,


Turn on the machine and wait for it to warm up before starting. Go to your computer and in your software program go to ""File"" and then ""Print."" A Preferences menu should pop up allowing you to choose the cutting method. Most machines will have 2 cutting methods: ""raster"" and ""vector."" ""Raster"" is used when you wish to engrave something, and ""vector"" is used when you want to cut out pieces.

,


You should set your cutting line according to the material you have, but also keep in mind that wider lines will take more time to cut and may result in a jagged cut. The cutting speed should also be set according the material you are cutting, but also whether you want to cut all the way through the material or just do laser etching. Once all your options are set, you can go ahead and cut your image.

Decode each binary digit.,
Read the hour by decoding the first section.,
Find the minutes using the same process as before.,
Decode the seconds.,
Combine the numbers to read the time.

",How to Read a Binary Clock1," The clock is divided into three sections, each containing two columns of lights. The first section displays hours, the second minutes, and the final section tells the seconds. The first column in each section represents the first digit (10's place) and the second column displays the second digit (or 1's place). Each column is composed of 2-4 lights, each representing a power of two. Starting at the bottom, the first light represents 20 (1), the second represents 21 (2), the third is 22 (4), and the top light represents 23 (8). In the picture, you can easily see this by the numbers to the left of each row.
Add the corresponding values of every light in the column that is lit to find the appropriate number. For example, if the bottom three lights are lit, the number is 4 (third row) + 2 (second row) + 1 (bottom row) = 7. (See the second digit of the minutes in the picture.);
, In the picture, the bottom light (first row represents 1) in the first column is lit and the second column is blank (0). Combining the digits, you get 10 o'clock.NOTE: the time is displayed in 24hr time. Subtract 12 from the number if it is 13 or greater. For example, 15 would be 3 o'clock.

, Again looking at the picture; in the middle section, the first two (bottom) lights in the first column are lit (second row represents 2 and the first row is 1; 2 + 1 = 3) and the first three in the second column are lit (third row represents 4, second 2, and first 1; 4 + 2 + 1 = 7), combining the two digits, we find it is 37 minutes past the hour.

, This can sometimes be tricky on an active clock because the seconds are ever changing. In the picture, the third light in the first column (third row represents 4) and the fourth and first light in the second column (fourth row is 8 and first is 1; 8 + 1 = 9) are lit, displaying 49 seconds. If you forget what number a light stands for, look at the number directly to the left of the row.

Mount the miter box to your workbench.,
Mark the cuts to be made on your board.,
Line the board up in the miter box.,
Cut the board.,
Remove the cut board and sand it smooth.",How to Use a Miter Box," Miter boxes are small and lightweight, and so present a risk of sliding around if used without mounting. To steady your miter box, first find a piece of scrap wood (3/4 inch (19 mm) plywood works well) that is slightly bigger than the box. Place the miter box onto the scrap wood base, and then secure it by drilling screws through the 2 holes in the base of the miter box. For further security, place the wood base on a scrap of carpet pad; this will keep the assembly from sliding on your work surface.
, First, make sure the board to be cut will fit in the miter box. If possible, it is always best to cut the board in a vertical position rather than laying it flat. Make the needed measurement on the board and then mark the position of the cut with a pencil., Place the board into the miter box, and line up the pencil mark with the appropriate guide slot. Hold the board against the front fence with a clamp or your non-dominant hand to steady it., Keeping the board steady with your other hand, place a backsaw into the 2 guide slots and lower the blade onto the board. Back-saws cut on the pull stroke, so make sure that your first stroke pulls the blade towards you. Continue sawing the board using smooth, continuous strokes, keeping the saw in the guide slots at all times., After making the cut, remove the board from the miter box and discard the scrap end. If there are any rough edges to the cut, you can sand them smooth using sandpaper. Sand using coarse-grit sandpaper first, and then switch to a finer grit."

Decode the seconds the same way as hours and minutes.",How to Read a Binary Clock2," The lights in the right column still represent 20, 21, 22, and 23 respectively, but the left column continues the pattern. Starting from the bottom, the first light represents 24 (16) and the second 25 (32). There is no need to continue past 25 because 59 (the highest number needed) can be written as 111011 (25 + 24 + 23 + 21 + 20 = 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 59).Remember: the clock uses lights instead of digits; on is 1 and off is 0.

, Using the watch as an example, the last two lights, on the top row, are lit (2 + 1 = 3), so it is 3 o'clock. Note that the LEDs on the watch are arranged in rows. The lights may be arranged in columns or rows, but reading it is the same. Remember on is 1 and off is 0. The hours on the watch can be written in binary as 0011 which is 3 in decimal.

, Again looking at the watch, we have 011001, on the bottom row, which corresponds to 24 + 23 + 20 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25 minutes.

Finished.

",How to Make a Bacon Alarm Clock," Cover surfaces with a drop cloth or newspaper or consider spray painting your oven outside. Tape and cover all the parts you don't want to paint.;
, If the oven is new it won’t need a lot of cleaning; however, you will want to ensure that any dust or debris is removed before applying the spray paint.


Cover the window portion of the toaster oven with painter’s tape. You’ll want to see the bacon sizzling away inside the oven so don’t coat the window with paint.

, Cover the entire oven evenly with paint. If you want to apply two coats, make sure the first coat is completely dry before applying the second coat.


Make this toaster oven something special by creating a little piggy face on the front. Since pigs are pink, pick up a can (or two) of high temperature auto engine paint. Although this paint may be found at craft stores you can also hit the automotive outlet for paint too. Of course, if you're a dude and having a pink pig in your room isn’t very manly, pigs come in other colors like black, grey or white.

, This will form the nose.

, This makes the piggy nostrils. If you want, you can color these black later, using a Sharpie to add detail to the nose.

,,, Paint it.


Add black nostrils to the nose after the paint has dried using a black Sharpie pen. Draw two circles for the nostrils.

, Cut the wood into two squares.

, Paint.

,, Drill the side of the toaster for screws to add the nose with.


Screw the nose on the side of the toaster.







,, Curl the fuzzy wires into the shape of a pig's tail.


Drill the other side of the toaster for a screw to fit in, this is where you are going to put the pig's tail.






Install the screw.






Make sure you shave off the end of the fuzzy wire just to be sure it won't heat up and potentially catch fire. Once shaved, it should be easy to tie the fuzzy wire to the screw you installed.






Attach the tail to the toaster's body.







, While the method above may work well for you, there are some different options that you might wish to consider for attaching the features to the oven:


An alternative way to decorate the exterior of the toaster oven would be to use a hot glue gun to affix the nose to the middle of the window and the googly eyes to the metal area above the window of the oven.
Instead of wood, use felt. Cut out two large circles from the pink felt. Use the craft wire to construct pointy piggy ears on top of the oven. Apply the wire with hot glue to the toaster and allow it to dry. Wrap the wire with the felt circles and secure around the base of the wire. Trim excess material if necessary.

, You may want to test drive the timer to ensure you have set it correctly.


Plug the oven cord into the timer and the timer into the wall. Follow the instructions on the timer for setting the time.







, If you have your timer plugged into the wall, the piggy toaster oven should not start cooking until the designated time. However, you should have the oven set so it's ready to cook. Synchronize your alarm clock with the digital timer of the oven.

, There are a few ways to approach this:

Place frozen bacon in the toaster oven the night before. On the one hand, the bacon could sit in the toaster oven for a few hours, thaw and be perfect for cooking. However, be absolutely certain that allowing meat to sit out for a long period of time will most likely attract bacteria, causing it to be unsafe for eating. This is especially so if your room is warm.






Set another alarm to wake you up a few minutes before your toaster oven is set to activate. Head to the kitchen refrigerator to grab a few pieces of bacon and place in toaster oven.






Keep a small refrigerator near your toaster oven where you will maintain your bacon supply. Set another alarm and when it goes off, simply roll over, remove the bacon and place in toaster oven.







, Not everyone likes their bacon cooked the same way so you may want to adjust settings during the first few days to cook it the way you like it.

Understand the cutting process.,
Get the proper tools for the job.,
Set up your work in a safe environment.,
Place the stock you are going to cut on supports at a comfortable working height.,
Mark your cuts with a soapstone marker, allowing for grinding if a precise fit is required.,
Hook up the gauges to the appropriate tanks.,
Make sure the acetylene regulator is turned off by backing the “tee” handle out a few turns, then turn the gas valve on top of the tank on.,
Turn the oxygen regulator pressure off or down and then adjust the oxygen pressure.,
Put your gloves and goggles on before lighting the torch.,
Light the torch.,
Adjust the acetylene valve until you have a yellow flame about 10 inches (25.4 cm) long.,
Turn the forward oxygen valve on slowly.,
Open the oxygen valve more to increase the flame size until the length of the inner flame is just over the thickness of the steel you are intending to cut.,
Bring the tip of the inner flame to the surface of the steel you are going to cut.,
Push the cutting valve handle down slowly to release the oxygen jet, which ignites the molten steel.,
Begin moving the torch tip slowly along the line of your cut when the jet is cutting through the steel.,
Continue cutting until you have parted the metal or finished the cut.,
Cool the workpiece with plenty of water.,
Chip the slag from the cut.",How to Use a Cutting Torch," The initial combustion of the acetylene gas heats the steel to a molten state. By adding a pressurized stream of oxygen, the cutter ignites the steel to burn through the kerf of your cut. This is why this process is called burning steel, and steel and carbon steel are the only materials it is used to cut. Aluminum, stainless steel, and other metals and alloys cannot be cut with a cutting torch.;
, Besides the torch assembly, described in detail throughout the steps, you should have the following:



Fire extinguisher. For most uses, a compressed air and water extinguisher will work, but if oil, plastics, or other combustible materials are around, an ""ABC"" extinguisher is recommended.






Marking and measuring tools. These will help you lay out your cut correctly, and can include a soapstone marker, a square, and a ruler.

Safety equipment, including a set of cutting goggles and heavy leather gloves.

Proper clothing is a must. Do not wear loose-fitting clothes, clothes made from flammable synthetic materials, or clothing with frayed or torn edges that may ignite more easily than tightly woven clean hemmed garments. This also means no loose pockets of cuffed pants or shirts that would allow slag to catch and burn through. Fire retardant clothing is recommended but, if not available, wear well fitting cotton clothes. Nylon and most other common synthetic clothes will rapidly burn if caught on fire!


Sturdy, leather-soled work boots are recommended, since rubber-soled shoes will allow hot slag to burn through pretty quickly. Laced boots are preferable, since slag can drop into the top of pull-on types like engineer's boots and cowboy boots.

A striker for correctly igniting the torch. Using matches or a cigarette lighter is very dangerous; a striker is made especially for igniting torches, and reduces the risk of serious injuries.

, Working on bare earth or a concrete slab is highly recommended, since sparks are going to fly many feet from the cutting location. Dry material like paper, sawdust, cardboard, and dried plant foliage or grass can be ignited from 15 feet (4.6 m) or further. Do not allow the flame to contact concrete, especially fresh concrete, as it make cause it to expand and crack violently, sending small bits of concrete flying.

, A steel table is ideal since you can brace yourself to steady the torch while heating and burning it. Never use a surface that is flammable or has flammable materials spilled on it. Also, beware of material that has metallic oxide coatings, such as lead paint, chromate primers, and zinc plating, since inhaling the fumes from these can be toxic.

, You may use a permanent marker if a soapstone is not available, but the mark will tend to disappear just ahead of the torch flame. For very precise cuts, you may find a specialized jig will give better results, but that is not within the scope of this article.

, Typically, oxygen tanks and hoses are green, acetylene hoses are red, and they are paired together with the ends separated to attach to their respective tanks. The acetylene hose will have reversed threads, and the fitting will be a male type, to prevent accidental switching of these two hoses/gauges. Since the fittings are made of brass and can easily be damaged, tighten them with an appropriately sized wrench.

, Turning it one turn of the wrist. This is for safety reasons. Never allow acetylene gas pressure to exceed 15 PSI, at higher pressures, acetylene becomes unstable, and may ignite spontaneously or explode. To make sure the gas is regulated to the correct pressure, do the following:


After turning on the main acetylene tank valve, open the regulator valve by turning the tee handle clockwise. This should be done very slowly, while watching the low pressure gauge. Open only until the pressure indicated is between 5 and 8 PSI.
To vent the atmosphere from the acetylene hose, open the gas valve on the cutting torch handle until you hear gas escaping, then observe the low pressure gauge to see if the pressure remains steady during flow and ensure that you have this regulator set correctly.
Close the acetylene valve on the torch.

, To turn the regulator pressure down, back the regulator gauge up a few turns. When you’re done, proceed with the following steps to adjust the oxygen pressure:


Open the main oxygen tank valve all the way. The valve is a double-seated valve and, if it’s not opened all the way, the oxygen will leak out around the valve-stem O-ring because of the high cylinder pressure of 2200 psi.
Open the regulator valve slowly, watching the low pressure gauge as you do so, until the pressure reads between 25 and 40 PSI.
Open the oxygen valve on the torch to allow the atmosphere to vent out of the hose. Note that there are two valves on the oxygen side of the cutting torch assembly. The valve near the hose connections will control the flow of oxygen to the mixing chamber for the combustion, or heating operation of the torch as well as the oxygen jet side, so no oxygen should vent from the torch tip until either the cutting lever is depressed or the valve further up the torch is opened. To begin with, open this first valve several turns to insure sufficient oxygen is available for both functions. Next, open the forward valve slightly until the hose is purged (about 3 to 5 seconds for a 25-foot hose).
Close the forward valve.

, Check your work area one more time for combustible materials and you should be ready to go.

, Open the acetylene valve again, allowing the oxygen remaining in the mixing chamber to purge for a few seconds, then shut the valve until you can barely hear gas escaping. Holding the striker in front of the torch tip, with the tip facing inside the striker (or toward the ignition source, for electronic strikers), squeeze the handle. A small yellow flame should appear at the tip when the sparks from the striker ignite the acetylene.

, Make sure the flame begins at the torch tip; if too much acetylene is supplied the flame will jump, or be blown away from the tip.

, The flame color will turn from yellow to light blue as sufficient oxygen is supplied to completely combust the acetylene. Increase the oxygen until the inner blue flame begins to shrink back toward the tip.

, (For 3/8 inch cold-rolled plate or mild steel, a 1/2-inch inner flame is about right.) If you hear a blowing noise, or the blue flame seems erratic and feathery, there is probably too much oxygen at the flame; reduce it until the flame is stable and the inner flame is a clean cone shape.

, You will need to heat the steel with this flame until a molten pool of metal forms and luminesces at this location. For 1/4-inch plate steel at room temperature, this should take about 45 seconds; however, it will take longer for heavier material or material at low temperatures. Keep the tip of the flame steady and about 3/8 of an inch from the metal's surface to concentrate the heat in one location.

, If a violent reaction instantly starts, the steel has ignited, and you can gradually increase pressure until the jet is cutting completely through the metal. If no reaction occurs, the metal is not hot enough to ignite, so you can let the oxygen handle release and continue to allow the flame to heat the metal more.

, You should observe that almost all of the sparks and molten slag are being blown out the back or bottom of your cut. If this flow of superheated material slows or backs up, slow your forward speed or stop and let the metal heat more. It is better to cut too slowly than to try to cut too quickly.

, Make sure the slag and any droplets of heated metal do not get underfoot; even sturdy boot soles will burn through if you find yourself standing on a large piece.

, Or, allow it to cool naturally if you are in no hurry. Be aware that dipping a superheated piece of steel into a bucket or stream of cold water will create an instantaneous cloud of very hot steam.



This is only for mild steel, as water cooling will affect quench- and temper-type steels.

, You can also grind the cut smooth if a more precise fit is desired.

Obtain a piece of sandpaper.,
Cut through the sandpaper.,
Wipe down the scissors.",How to Sharpen Scissors1," A sandpaper sheet with 150-200 grit will work just fine, but you could even go for a little bit of a finer grit (bigger grit number) if you want smoother edges to your scissor blades. Fold the sandpaper in half, with the rough sides facing outward.


Have the rough edges face outward, so the sandpaper grazes against both blades as you cut the paper.;
, Cut through the sandpaper, cutting long strips, about 10-20 times.You will notice that the blades become sharper with every strip of sandpaper cut. Use full scissor strokes, beginning the cutting at the base of the scissors and extending to the tip.









Cutting through sandpaper is good for scissors that aren’t horribly dull, but just need some touch up sharpening.
The sandpaper also helps smooth out nicks and indents on the blades.
Some alternative cutting materials to sharpen scissors are emery cloth and steel wool., Wipe down the blades of the scissors using a damp paper towel to clean off any sandpaper bits that may have collected on the blades while sharpening the scissors.








"
"
Obtain a piece of aluminum foil.,
Cut the foil.,
Wipe down the scissors.",How to Sharpen Scissors2," Take a piece of aluminum foil, about 8-10 inches long, and fold it lengthwise multiple times so you have a thick, folded strip of foil.









The added layers of the aluminum foil will help sharpen the blades of the scissors multiple times with every cut of the foil.

, Cut strips of the aluminum foil with your scissors until you have cut the entirety of the thick aluminum strip. Use full scissor strokes, cutting beginning at the base of the scissors and extending to the tip.









Depending on the width of the strips you cut, you can sharpen your scissors blades a lot (by cutting many, skinny strips) or just a little bit (by cutting a few, thicker strips).

, Wipe down the blades using a paper towel dampened by warm water. This will get rid of any aluminum debris that may have clung to the blades as you were cutting.

Obtain a sharpening stone.,
Prepare the sharpening stone.,
Disassemble your scissors.,
Sharpen the inner side of the blade.,
Sharpen the cutting edge of the blade.,
Remove the burrs on the scissor blades.,
Wipe down the scissors.",How to Sharpen Scissors3," Sharpening stones can be found at most hardware stores, and can be used to sharpen any blade you have. Sharpening stones normally have two sides used for sharpening blades: a coarser, grainier side, and a fine side.If you have very dull scissors, you should start out using the coarse side of the stone, and then use the finer side of the stone to finish your sharpening.
If your scissors just need a light sharpening, you only need to use the fine side of the stone.

, Place a towel underneath your sharpening and lubricate it with either water or honing oil.









Stores sell “honing oil” in the same area that they sell sharpening stones, but any oil, or even water for that matter, works just fine for lubricating the stone.

, Remove the screw attaching the scissor blades together. You do this so you can sharpen each blade separately, and have more mobility when sharpening the blades.


More often than not, a flathead screwdriver small enough to fit in the screw’s head will work in unscrewing the scissors’ blades from each other.

, Place one blade of the scissors on the stone with the inner side of the blade (the flat, inside part of the blade that comes in contact with the material you’re cutting and the opposite inside part of the other blade), facing down. You want to create a nice, sharp angle between the inner blade (the part you’re currently sharpening), and the cutting edge (the top edge to the inner side of the blade). Where those two edges meet, is the area that needs to be sharp to cut things. Grip the handle of the scissor blade, and slowly pull the blade across the stone toward you, keeping the edge of the blade flat against the stone.








Repeat this action slowly and carefully until the blade has been sharpened. This should take about 10-20 pulls.
Repeat this step with the other blade of the scissors.
You should practice on some old scissors until you fully get the hang of how to sharpen blades.

, Grip the handle of the scissor blade, and tilt the blade toward you until the cutting edge (the beveled edge that meets the inner side of the blade) lies flat on the stone. With the blade horizontal to you, slowly pull the blade across the stone toward you, keeping that beveled edge flat against the stone. Match the angle as closely as possible and continue to slide the blade forward. Repeat this action carefully until the blade is sharpened.









If you started on the coarse side of the stone, finish with a few swipes on the finer side of the stone to give a nice, smooth finish.
If you have never sharpened scissors this way before, you might find it difficult to judge when the edge of the blade is completely sharpened. Consider this trick: before you start sharpening the blades, run the tip of a permanent marker across the edge of the scissor blade. Start sharpening the blade, and when the marker line has be sanded away off the edge, you’ve successfully sharpened the blade., When you’re finished sharpening the scissors, there might be some rough burrs of metal along the sharpened edges of the blades. These burrs can easily be removed by putting the scissors backs together, and opening and closing them a few times.Then use the scissors to cut through some kind of material like paper, cardboard, or fabric. This will further ensure the little burrs get knocked off the blades.









If the scissors are sharp enough for your liking, you’re finished. If you want them to be sharper, repeat the sharpening process.

, Use a damp paper towel to wipe down the blades of the scissors and clean off any stone bits that may have collected on the blades while you sharpened the scissors.

Fit the scissor blades around the mason jar.,
Cut the mason jar.,
Wipe down the scissors.",How to Sharpen Scissors4," Open the pair of scissors as wide as they can go, and position the blades around the sides of the mason jar.


The jar should be as far as it can go between the two blades. Hold the jar with one hand, and the scissors with the other hand.

, Squeeze the scissors closed, and slide the mason jar out from between the blades as the scissors close.This is the same way you would close the scissors if you were cutting paper or fabric. Use light pressure to close the scissors, let the glass do the sharpening work for you.









Repeat this process until the blades have a smooth, clean edge.
Be sure to use a mason jar that you don’t mind damaging, because the blades of the scissors might leave scratch marks on the jar.

, Using a damp paper towel, wipe down the blades of the scissors to clear off any microscopic glass pieces that may have gathered on the blades while you were cutting the mason jar.

Obtain a sewing pin.,
Cut the pin.,
Wipe down the scissors.",How to Sharpen Scissors5," This method follows the same principle of using a mason jar to sharpen your scissors, while utilizing a smaller tool.

, Squeeze the scissors closed, and slide the pin out from between the blades as the scissors close. This is the same way you would close the scissors if you were cutting paper or fabric. Use light pressure to close the scissors, let the metal pin do the sharpening work for you.









Repeat this process until the blades have a smooth, clean edge.

, Using a damp paper towel, wipe down the blades of the scissors to clean off any metal bits that may have collected on the blades while cutting the pin.

Understand that it is important to clean the pruning shears before sanitizing them.,
Use a garden hose to wash off the shears.,
Use a wire- or nylon-bristle scrub brush to scrub the dirt off, if necessary.,
Make a mixture of bleach and pine oil.,
Consider alternatives to the bleach mixture.,
Pour the disinfectant into a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket.,
Submerge the blades in the disinfectant.,
Remove the shears from the disinfectant.,
Keep the container of disinfectant nearby when pruning diseased plants.,
Be sure to sanitize your hands.,
Restock your disinfecting solution.",How to Sanitize Pruning Shears," Dirt and small bits of plant matter harbor bacteria and fungi, making it impossible to sanitize the pruning shears thoroughly.;
, The hose should be one with a spray nozzle attached to spray the dirt and debris off the pruning shears. Examine the shears closely to make sure they are clean.

, When the blades on the pruning shears become pitted, they should be replaced. Diseased organisms are very difficult to kill when they are embedded in pits in the metal.


The blades on some pruning shears can be replaced but usually, when the blades have become pitted, it is time to buy new pruning shears.

, Household bleach and pine oil cleaner can be used to sanitize pruning shears when diluted to one-quarter strength.


Mix 1⁄4 gallon (0.9 L) of bleach or pine oil cleaner into 3⁄4 gallon (2.8 L) of water.

, Isopropyl (70%) rubbing alcohol can be diluted with water to half strength and used to sanitize pruning shears. Disinfecting household cleansers like Lysol or Nature Cleancan be used at full strength.

, If you do not have a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket, use any other container that is deep enough to hold the full length of the blades on the pruning shears.

, Pull them open as far as possible to expose the cutting edges of the blades to the sanitizing solution. Let them soak for at least 5 minutes.


Simply spraying the disinfectant on the blades will not be effective. They must soak in the solution long enough to kill the bacteria and fungi.

, Spray them with the hose to rinse off the disinfectant or let them air dry before using them.

, Use a rag to wipe the dirt and debris off the blades after each pruning cut and set them in the disinfectant for 5 minutes.


Wipe the disinfectant off with a fresh, clean rag or hose them off and let them dry for a few minutes before making the next pruning cut.
Do not use the shears to prune the plants while the disinfectant is still fresh and wet. Sanitizing solution will damage the plant tissue of trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials.

, Do this when you have finished pruning one plant, and are moving on to the next, as well when pruning diseased trees, shrubs or perennials.


This can be accomplished by simply washing your hands with warm water and soap.

, Get fresh disinfecting solution after every ten plants or every two hours when tackling a big job where bacterial or fungal disease has been a problem.

Examine the shears to find the lap line.,
Set the proper angle of the clamp.,
Do a scratch test.,
Grind the blacking off.,
Test the shears.,
Only use the shears on cloth.,
Consider getting your shears professionally sharpened.,
Keep your shears well-oiled.,
Avoid rust by keeping the shears clean and dry.",How to Sharpen Pinking Shears," A different kind of metal with a slightly different color is used for the cutting surface on most good-quality pair of pinking shears. Hold the blade and look at it from the side: there should be a shiny metal on the bottom side, a distinct line, and a darker matte grey metal on the cutting surface.If you don't see this, the shears need to be replaced. They've worn out over time and there's nothing left to sharpen.
To sharpen pinking shears, you won't ever sharpen between the individual ""teeth"" on the blade, which would ruin the action of the shears and make it so they wouldn't cut properly. Instead, you want to sharpen along the flat edge of those teeth on the cutting surface, honing the teeth all the way from the ""peak"" at the top of each tooth to the ""valley"" at the bottom.;
, The blades of most pinking shears have an angle of between 0 and 5 degrees, and some have a slightly negative angle at which you'll need to set the the clamp to sharpen them properly. Estimate the angle, or start at 0 and perform a scratch test to see if the clamp is set properly.Secure the shears in the clamp so the flat side of the blade is perpendicular to the sharpening wheel.

, Use a permanent marker and blacken the flat blade side of the pinking shears you're going to sharpen. Make sure you darken all the way up to each peak and down to each valley. You don't need to color between them, just on the flat side you're going to sharpen.


Rotate the sharpening wheel with your hand (you don't need to turn it on) to scratch the blade quickly on it to see if you've got the clamp set at the proper angle. You should see the blacking start to wear off on the blade, not lower on the silver side or too high on the peaks. Adjust the blade accordingly before you start sharpening.

, When you've got the clamp set appropriately, turn on your machine and do a few passes with the blade. After three or four, turn it off again and examine your blade to make sure you're grinding evenly. If the black is removed, you're doing a good job. Do a few more passes, pausing every now and then to examine them, readjusting if necessary.


Move the shears across the wheel in only one direction, applying even pressure and being extremely careful to keep your hands and clothes clear of the wheel. Wear safety protection and follow the manual instructions.
When you've done the first, repeat the process for the second blade, maintaining the same angle.

, To make sure you've sharpened them evenly, cut some felt or other cloth. Properly sharpened pinking shears should cut with good action all the way down to the tip, and the teeth should pass between each other cleanly.


If you're still having trouble, do a few passes on a honing wheel to get the burrs worked out and get the blade even and clean on the cut. Also check the other components of the shears to make sure they're well-oiled and smooth.

, Trying to sharpen your shears by cutting into aluminum foil, Brillo pads, or sandpaper is ineffective and can end up damaging the blades by rounding them. Pinking shears need to be sharpened along the flat outside edge of each blade, not in between the valleys. Cutting aluminum or sandpaper rounds off the edges, making them duller and ruining the action, and does nothing to hone the flat side. Use your pinking shears on the appropriate materials and you shouldn't have problems.


A roll of heavy-duty foil costs as much as $5 or $6 anyway and you risk ruining your shears at no savings. Get them done properly, either by investing in professional equipment or taking them to a pro.Using a regular whetstone is also not recommended. It's very difficult to get the edge of the recessed blade flush enough with the stone, and you risk ruining the edge by trying. Take them in instead or invest in the right equipment.

, Getting pinking shears professionally sharpened at a fabric store costs $4-$6 dollars, less than the price of a new set, and much less than the cost of a rotary sharpening wheel ($300-$400). It's relatively cheap for the service, very fast, and you'll have the satisfaction of a well-maintained set of shears.


If you're unsure where to get your shears sharpened, go into a fabric store and ask where they get their scissors sharpened. If not there, they should be able to recommend a place in your area that sharpens knives and shears.

, A common complaint about pinking shears, especially old ones, is that they take a lot of hand-strength to use. Keep the connection screw well-oiled by adding a little dab of sewing machine oil every now and then when they get sticky. The sewing machine oil is specially made to not stain fabric, so it's a good choice if you're worried about getting your projects dirty.


If you don't want to run out for new oil, you can try a dab of any regular cooking oil, coconut oil being especially effective.

, You shouldn't regularly need to clean your shears, but if you get them dirty make sure you dry them immediately and thoroughly to avoid rusting.


To remove rust, soak the blades for a few minutes in tiny amount of bleach (1 tsp.) in a bucket of water. Scrub them vigorously with a wire scouring pad or a Brillo and clean them with clear water. Dry the shears thoroughly and apply lubricating oil.

Protect your hands and face.,
Clean and polish the head of the axe.,
Clamp the axe in a vice.,
Select a bastard file.,
Inspect the bevel of the axe.,
File with a steady motion into the blade.,
File repeatedly along a fan-shaped area.,
Switch to the other side when you can feel a burr.,
Measure the edge with a bevel gauge.,
Hone the edge with a coarse whetstone.,
Hone with a fine whetstone or a leather strop (optional).,
Protect the blade from rust.",How to Sharpen an Axe," Take these steps to avoid injury while sharpening an axe:

Wear thick leather gloves.
If your file does not have a finger guard, cut a slit in a piece of leather and fit it onto the file.Wear safety goggles to protect against metal dust.
A dust mask is optional for hand sharpening. A respirator is recommended if you use power tools (but see Tips below.);
, If there is any rust on your axe, clean it off with a rust eraser or steel wool. Further polishing is mostly a matter of aesthetics, but not too difficult to accomplish:








Sand with coarse-grit aluminum oxide or silicon carbide sandpaper. Rub the axe head with even pressure, moving from the poll (hammer end) to the blade.
Repeat with finer-grit sandpaper.
For excellent polish, repeat with extra-fine sandpaper and/or finish by applying a metal polish with a rag. (You may wait on this step until after sharpening.)

, Clamp the axe horizontally for easier filing, or vertically for a more even edge (as this allows you to alternate sides). If clamping horizontally, you may wish to tilt the axe to the angle of the bevel (usually 20 or 30º), so you can hold the file parallel to the table. This is easier than judging the correct angle by sight.







, A 10–12"" (25–30cm) bastard mill file (coarse, single-cut, and slightly tapering) is the best choice for most axes.Shorter bastard files do not have the same density of teeth, so the length is not just a matter of convenience.You may use a smaller mill file for hatchets.









Clean clogged file teeth with a file card. If the file is new, rub soft chalk over it to prevent clogging., Most axes have a slightly convex edge, about 20–30º. Broader, more convex edges are more suitable for hardwood or frozen wood, as the curve pushes wood out of the way to protect the edge. Carving axes have a straight, triangular point.Decide on your axe's shape before you begin sharpening, and keep a close eye on the edge as it develops. In most cases, you'll want to match the existing bevel, following the curve of the blade to remove an even layer of metal., Hold the file handle in the palm of your dominant hand, with your thumb resting on top. Curl the fingers of your other hand around the tip of the file. Stand with one foot well in front of the other so you can use your shoulders to push the file. To prevent the file from rocking back and forth, lead with your forward hand, then transfer smoothly to a push with the handle by the end of the stroke.







, File into the edge in steady strokes. Create a fan-shaped curve on the blade by varying the starting point of your stroke: start close to the edge at the top of the axe head, start about 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) when at the center, and curve back down to the edge again at the bottom of the axe head.








Do not make contact with the blade on the return stroke, as this will not sharpen the axe and may ruin your file.
Use a file card or wire brush to remove metal particles from the file when buildup occurs.

, Once you feel a burr on the side you are not sharpening, turn the axe over and repeat the same steps on the other side of the edge. Continue sharpening until the burr returns to the first side.








Switching sides more frequently throughout the process may result in a more even edge., Also called a sliding bevel, this is simply two hinged arms which you can tighten to any angle using a nut. You can easily make this yourself out of scrap lumber.Set your bevel gauge to the desired angle using a protractor (usually 25º or so), then slot it over your axe edge. If the angle is off, file further to remove material where needed.








, Apply honing oil or sewing machine oil to the extreme edge, then rub the tip of a coarse whetstone along it in a circular motion. Hone both sides alternately to move the burr from one side to the other, until it is nearly gone. This burr is the ""feather edge,"" or a very thin, bent end. Run your finger along the edge to track its shape.








""Water stones"" made from clay or sandstone hone more quickly, but also wear down faster. They require water instead of oil to float away the metal particles., To remove the feather edge completely, repeat the same honing process with a finer whetstone, or strop it away from the edge with a strap of leather. A perfectly honed edge will not reflect any light, but a couple small nicks are not a big deal.

Most whetstones are two-sided, with a coarse and a fine side. Examples with a finger groove in the middle are safer.
Repeat the honing (at least with the coarse stone) each time you're about to use the axe.

, Wipe the blade with light machine oil, then rub in a mixture of beeswax and more oil. This works best when the steel is warm.

Acquire a handle suited to your axe.,
Remove the old handle.Because you won't be using the old handle, it doesn't matter if you damage it.,
Clean the eye of the axe.Even if you take your time to eject the old handle from the blade, there may still be debris in there.,
Mark the kerf of the new handle with a pencil.Many storebought handles will come with a pre-made kerf.,
Test fit the handle.,
Strike in the handle.In order to fit the handle into the blade, force will be needed even in the kerf offers space inside the blade eye.,
Shorten the handle if necessary.,
Fill in the kerf with a wedge.Filling in the opening on the other side of the axe's eye will prevent it from moving around as much.,
Add metal wedges in the eye.To secure it further after wedging the kerf, add metal wedges by hammering them into place.,
Saw off the protruding wedge.After you've worked on securing the handle from protruding side, it's a good idea to saw it down.,
Tighten a loose handle with extra glue.If you have followed through with all of the stability measures and still aren't sure the handle will hold, you can fill whatever cracks that remain with glue.,
Protect your handle with a coat of mineral oil.Bottles of mineral oil are relatively cheap, and can be used to restore life to a drab handle.,
Put your axe to use.",How to Replace an Axe Handle," Axe handles are typically standardized, meaning that it should be easy for you to find a handle that fits your axe's blade. Axe handles may be purchased at a home hardware store. If you're networked with any woodworkers, they may be enticed into carving you a handle for a fee as well.


Purchasing a new axe outright is an option if you're going to the store to pick up a handle. Due to the fact that handles can be replaced fairly easily however, this is only recommended if you're strapped for time and need a new axe in a hurry.
If you're truly a DIY type, you might consider making an axe handle from scratch. Keep in mind, however, that this will require a lot of exact measurements and precise woodworking.;
, Get out the old handle however you can. Here are a few ways you might go about it:


Drill into the handle through the hole in the axe. Once you have a sufficient hole, insert a metal wedge and thrust it out by hitting the wedge with a hammer.Hammer out the handle outright by using a chisel. Don't be afraid to bash it hard. After all, the old handle will be replaced as soon as it's out of there.
Saw off the handle, then hammer out the bit of handle that's still inside the blade.

, Push out the excess pieces with a chisel, then smooth out the insides. Using sandpaper on the inside of the axe will ensure that all of the old handle has been properly removed.


The ""eye"" refers to the hole in the axe blade that the handle fits into.

, The ""kerf"" refers to the saw wedge in the top of the handle. This allows the handle to fit into the eye of the axe. Find the point on the handle where the kerf ends and trace a pencil line around the handle. This will offer a visual reference of how deep your handle needs to go.

, The handle may need few tries to get in properly. Push it in and try to get it in manually at first. Next, tap it in lightly with a blunt piece of wood. Each time you push it in, check how far it gets in based on the bottom of the kerf. Although you shouldn't apply very much pressure when you're first starting out, this will hopefully give you a proper idea of the measurements the top of your handle needs to be. Take measurements following each test fitting.


Cut down the handle as the test fittings suggest. If an inch of kerfed handle is sticking out, for example, it means you'll have to shave down an equal amount of your handle accordingly.
Don't strike the handle with a metal hammer. Metal risks damaging the wooden handle.

, Take a piece of blunt wood and strike the other end of the handle. Use the handle like a wedge and try to push it into the


Avoid excessive force when pushing in the handle. This includes striking it on the ground or using a steel hammer.Instead, pick something blunt that will deliver sufficient force without risking damage to the handle itself.

, After you have test placed it a few times, you should be able to narrow down how much of the axe's top handle needs shortening. The handle should be able to fit all the way into the axe blade's eye. If it can't fit, narrow it down to a point where it could fit into and fil all of the hollow space within the blade.


A rasp is a serrated tool meant to cut down wood smoothly.Files and rifflers may also be used to file down a length of wood.
Allow at least half an inch between the bottom of the kerf and the main handle., You can do this by lightly tapping a thin wedge of wood into the kerf, and securing it with layers of carpenter's glue.

, This will add another layer of protection to your axe and help ensure that the kerf's wedge doesn't fall out of place.


Adding the wedges diagonally can help improve stability.

, Sawing down the protruding side will maximize the force of your swing. Keep a few millimetres on the end of the handle for good measure.

,


Using glue may make it difficult to replace this handle when its use runs out. If you're the sort of person who goes through a lot of axe handles, it may be best to skip out on the glue.
Chair Doctor is a highly recommended product for this. It is a thin viscosity liquid designed to fill in loose gaps.

, Drip some mineral oil into a handcloth and apply it consistently to the axe handle. Let it sit for a few minutes afterwards while the oils soak in.


Because oil will help block out moisture, it's especially important to use mineral oil on your handle if you're using or storing the axe in a moisture-heavy environment.

, After you replace the handle, it should serve you well for months or years to come. Your handle's longevity will depend on how well you take care of the axe. Don't swing it irresponsibly, and store it in a safe place when you're done with it. Excess force in your axe swing can be avoided if you remember to sharpen the axe's blade regularly.


Always use a proper chopping block.Making sure the object you're chopping has a solid foundation will limit the risk of potential injury.

Cool the drill bit with water in between holes when drilling multiple holes.

",How to Drill Through Granite," Consider other alternatives before you start putting holes in your granite, especially when you’re working with something as expensive as a granite countertop.;
,, For small diameter holes, you can use a small dot. For larger diameter holes, use a template or draw a precise circle that corresponds exactly with the diameter of the hole you’re drilling.


If you’re concerned that the drill bit will wander, you can clamp a piece of scrap wood with the appropriate sized guide hole over your drilling target.

, For maximum safety and effectiveness, place a clamp on either side of the hole you’re drilling.

,


Make sure the drill bit is specifically designed for drilling through granite and that it can handle the depth of drilling your application requires.
Diamond core drill bits have a good reputation for drilling through granite with ease; a good one should be able to get through a ¾-inch (1.9 cm) slab in less than a minute.

,


Some drill bit manufacturers recommend using water to cool and lubricate the drill bit while drilling. Others say you won’t need to do that for their bits. Either way, water will serve to reduce the amount of granite dust in the air.
If you use water, form a dam around the drilling area using plumbers putty.
If you don’t use water, you can have someone use a shop vac to vacuum the granite dust as you drill.

If your sheet is thick, do peck drilling, going a little at the time so that you can remove the shavings from your hole and allow the drill time to cool.",How to Drill Plexiglass," Acrylic chips can easily fly off during drilling and be a health hazard.;
, These bits have a different geometric structure that is designed to puncture acrylic more easily and they are less likely to melt plexiglass. They are available in hardware stores and online.


You can also use a drill press working at about 500 to 1000 RPM. Acrylic drill bits are available for drill presses.

,, This will make it less likely that you will chip the back of the board or scratch it when the drill bit goes through.

, Use as many clamps as is necessary to secure the sheet. For larger sheets you will need more clamps.

, Acrylic is known for chipping near the edge when it is punctured.

, Turn the drill on.

, You do not need to center punch acrylic like you do with metal.

, Aim for a feed rate of about 3.5 inches (89mm) per minute. Acrylic drill bits will produce plastic shavings. Once they start to surround the drill bit, you can stop and remove them to get a better view of what you are doing.

, This will also help to prevent melting.

Blow out the dust.",How to Drill Into Concrete," Drilling concrete is much easier with a hammer drill, or a rotary hammer for large jobs.These tools fracture the concrete through rapid hammering, then drill to scoop out the broken material. A normal rotary drill makes the job much slower and more difficult, since concrete is not easily shaved away in layers the same way wood and metal are. Pay extra for a hammer drill rental for any job larger than a few holes drilled through cosmetic (non-structural) concrete, such as the softer mix found in modern countertops.It's usually worth it to pay more for a more powerful hammer (at least 7 to 10 amps) from a well-known brand.Other beneficial features include a speed setting, depth stop, comfortable grip, and a second handle for your other hand.;
, Read the user's manual and learn what all the knobs and controls are for. Make sure you are comfortable with your tool before moving on to the next step.


Follow all safety instructions. This includes wearing safety goggles to protect your eyes from chips of concrete, hearing protection, and heavy gloves to protect your hands from abrasion and hot drill bits. A respirator is also recommended for longer projects that create a lot of dust.

, A carbide-tipped masonry bit intended for hammer drills (or labeled ""rotary/percussive"") are designed to withstand the force of hammering and drilling dense concrete. The flutes of the drill bit must be at least as long as the hole you plan to drill, since they are important for directing dust out of the hole.Rotary hammers require specialty drill bits, called SDS or SDS-MAX (for holes up 5/8"" in diameter) or Spline-Shank (for holes 3/4"" or larger).Reinforced concrete is much more difficult to drill if you need to drill deeper than the steel rebar. Switch to a special rebar-cutting bit once the drill hits metal.Slow down and pause occasionally to prevent overheating.

, Some drills have a depth setting or depth control bar. Read the user manual and learn how to use it. If your machine does not have depth control, measure and mark the required depth on the drill bit with a pencil or masking tape. If you're not sure how deep to drill, follow these guidelines:Because concrete is a hard, dense material, screws embedded 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep are sufficient for hanging light-weight objects. Heavier-duty projects require longer screws or concrete anchors, which should list the minimum embedment on the packaging.
Add an additional ½"" (6 mm) to the embedment to allow room for the dust that accumulates during drilling.You can reduce this length if you plan to remove the dust afterward (described below).For hollow concrete blocks or thin concrete surfaces, check the fastener specifications. Some plastic anchors require a solid backing, and will fall out if you drill through the other side.

, Hold the drill with one hand like a gun, with your index finger on the ""trigger"". If the drill has a handle for your other hand to hold, use it. Otherwise put your other hand at the back of the drill.

, Mark the point on the wall where you want to drill using a soft pencil with a small dot or cross.

, Place your drill on the mark and drill briefly, using a low speed (if your machine has speed control) or in short bursts (if it doesn't). Make a shallow hole (⅛ to ¼ inches / 3 to 6 mm) to help guide your drill for the real hole.If the project requires a large diameter drill bit, consider using a smaller drill bit for the pilot hole. This will increase the drill's stability., Turn on the hammer function if your drill has one. Place the drill in the pilot hole, keeping it exactly perpendicular to the concrete surface. Start drilling with firm, but not forceful, pressure to push the drill forward. Gradually increase the drill speed and force if necessary, but make sure the drill is stable and under your control at all times. Concrete is not a homogenous material, and the drill bit can easily skate if it hits an air pocket or pebble.Apply enough pressure to hold the drill in place, but do not force it forward (this increases wear on the bit and can even break it). You will learn the right amount of pressure from practice.

, Bring the drill back slightly and press it back in again every ten or twenty seconds. This helps pull dust out of the hole.Occasionally stop the drill and pull it out to let it cool for a few seconds. This is especially important for ordinary rotary drills, since they can easily overheat during a lengthy drilling process.

, Sometimes, a drill does not go as expected. If you hit an especially hard piece of concrete, insert a masonry nail into the hole and hammer it in to break up the concrete. Take care not to drive the nail too deep to easily remove. Insert your drill back and continue drilling.If you see sparks or see metal, you have hit rebar. Stop drilling immediately and switch to a rebar-cutting drill bit until you are past the obstruction.

, Removing dust improves the strength of concrete anchors. Use a squeeze bulb or can of compressed air to remove concrete dust from the hole, then vacuum it up.Leave your goggles on while doing this to protect from dust and debris.

Choose the drill.,
Place the bead in putty.,
Mark the hole.,
Submerge the bead in water.,
Touch the bit to the bead.,
Slowly drill through to the other side.,
Check your work.",How to Drill Holes in Beads1," You can use a hand-held rotary tool or a conventional cordless drill, but either way, the tool should be fitted with a drill bit no larger than 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).Note that smaller beads will require the use of even smaller drill bits.
When drilling holes in glass or stone beads, you will need to use a diamond-tipped drill bit due to the hardness of the material.
For wooden beads, a common drill bit or carbide drill bit should work well enough since these beads are made from a much softer material.;
, Press the bead firmly into toy putty or poster putty. The side you intend to drill into should face up.


The purpose of the putty is to keep the bead still and stable as you drill into it. If preferred, a small clamp or similar surface could be used instead.
Keep a thick layer of putter pressed beneath the bottom of the bead to prevent the drill tip from accidentally drilling into and damaging another surface.
Holding the bead is not recommended. Due to the small size of the bead and the power of the tool, the tool could easily slip as you drill into the bead, injuring your hand in the process.

, Place a small dot on the bead using a fine-tip permanent marker. This dot should be centered directly over the spot you want the hole through.


The dot can serve as a guide for the tip of your drill bit. It is not strictly necessary, but it might help you keep the hole centered.

, Place the putty and clay in a shallow tray, bowl, or cup. Add enough water to the container to keep the bead just barely submerged.The water will help keep the drill bit cool as you work, thereby preventing the tool from overheating during the process.
To further reduce the risk of causing damage to your work surface, you may also want to place the dish of water on top of an acrylic cutting board. Alternatively, you can place a thick leather pad into the container if the container is large enough and the pad is small enough.
Note that this can be dangerous when used around corded drills, which is why a cordless tool is strongly recommended. No matter what type of drill or rotary tool you use, however, work carefully to avoid getting excess water on the tool. Never hold the tool with wet hands, either.

, Bring the drill bit down vertically over the bead so that it lightly touches the mark you created earlier. Turn on the tool for a second or so before switching it off.


If the tool is drilling into the bead correctly, you should see some of the material come off and mix into the water.
Quickly check the surface of the bead when you switch off the tool. You should already see an indentation where the hole is supposed to go.

, Position the tip of the bit over the indentation and switch the drill back on. Gradually work your way through the entire bead until the bit comes out of the opposite side.


For best results, drill into the bead for one second, then pull the bit back up for another second. Drill back into it for another second and pull it back up for one more second. Repeat until you make it all the way through the bead.Drilling in this manner washes the hole as you drill it and puts less pressure on the bead. Less pressure means a smaller risk of cracking or breaking.
Make sure that you drill into the bead at a straight, vertical angle so that the finished hole is even.
Stop as soon as you feel the drill bit break through the other surface. If you stop too soon, you can always continue drilling the hole until you complete it. If you stop too late, you may damage your working surface.
Depending on the depth of the bead and the material you're working with, the drilling process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes.

, After you finish drilling through the bead, pull the bit all the way out and turn off the tool. Check the hole to make sure that it is even and clear.


If the hole looks finished, then the process is complete.

",How to Drill Metal," High speed steel (HSS) bits will work for most kinds of metal, as will carbon steel bits coated with titanium nitride (TiN). For very hard metals, use a cobalt steel bit.






;
, This step is not necessary if drilling into a large, heavy steel object like a wall or stud.








, Measure this area with precision, since it's harder to patch a mistake in metal than to patch one you've made in wood.








, Hit it lightly with the hammer to mark your drill point and create a starting divot.








, The chances are small, but the sparks thrown by drilling metal can sometimes start small fires. A nearby fire extinguisher will help you keep a small fire from getting out of control.








, You may also want to wear a long-sleeved shirt with a closed collar as well.








, Make certain it's set level to the drill angle you want. Newer drills will have integral leveling bubbles to help with this.








, For hard metals, drill slowly and steadily. Soft metals will require a faster speed because the metal shaving may melt if you go too slowly. Even with soft metals, don't us a speed higher than medium.








, Keep the bit spinning until you've removed it entirely from the metal.

Choose the right tools.,
Secure the bead.,
Drill slowly straight through the bead.,
Check the results.",How to Drill Holes in Beads2," If possible, use a toothpick to poke a small hole or indentation into the bead before you bake it.


The indentation should be centered over the position you plan to drill a hole through.
This indentation can serve as a guide when you start drilling into the hardened, baked bead later.
If you forget to make the indentation before you bake the beads, you can still poke a hole into the bead just after it bakes, while the clay is still warm and partially soft. You will need to use a rigid metal pin or needle instead of a toothpick, however.
If you are working with polymer clay beads that were baked long ago and cannot create any indentation, consider at least marking the spot you want to drill a hole through with a pencil or marker.

, Since polymer clay is such a soft material, you should not use a power drill or power rotary tool to create a hole. All you need to use is an unpowered drill bit.


The drill bit should be about as small as the size of the desired hole. This means sticking with drill bits 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) or smaller.
Common drill bits should suffice. There is no need to use a harder bit material.

, Place the bead in a small patch of toy putty or poster putty so that it will remain still during the drilling process.


Alternatively, you can hold the bead with pliers or in between your fingers. Since you will not be using any power tools, it should be safe to hold the bead.
A small clamp could also be used, but it usually isn't necessary.

, Position the drill bit directly over the indentation. Use your fingers to twist through the bead, continuing at a steady pace until the bit pierces through the opposite side.The drill bit should be straight and perpendicular to the guiding indentation previously created on the surface of the bead.
Make sure that you are twisting the bit straight through the bead. Apply as little pressure as possible and avoid forcing the bit through the bead.
Alternatively, you can hold the bit still while twisting the bead onto it.
If you are unable to twist either the bit or the bead by hand, you could use a manual crank-style hand drill to ease the bit through. Do not use any power tools, however.

, After drilling a hole into the bead, remove the bit and examine the hole to make sure that it is complete and even.


At this point, the process is complete.

Select piercing pins.,
Push the pin into the bead.,
Twist and continue pushing.,
Pull the pin back.,
Reshape the bead as needed.,
Bake the clay.,
Remove the pin and check the hole.",How to Drill Holes in Beads3," Purchase clay bead piercing pins from any manufacturer that produces tools for working with clay.If you are unable to find bead piercing pins, sharp skewers or large sewing pins might work well enough. The instrument you use simply needs a sharp, pointed tip and a sturdy metal shaft similar in thickness to 20 gauge wire. It also needs to be long enough to completely pierce through at least one bead.

, Lightly grasp the bead in between your fingers using your non-dominant hand. Using your dominant hand, gently push the sharp pin tip into the spot the hole needs to be at.


Your fingers should be positioned on the smooth side of the bead and clear from the entrance or exit point of the desired hole.
Hold the bead just lightly enough to keep it steady, but do not squeeze it.

, Twirl the piercing pin between your fingers as you push it through the entire bead. Continue twisting and pushing until the pin pokes out from the opposite side.


You may also need to twist the bead lightly as you insert the pin.
Keep the pin straight as you push it through. Work slowly and gently to minimize possible distortion to the shape of the bead.

, After pushing the pin all the way through to the other side of the bead, pull it back into the hole by about 0.4 to 0.8 inches (1 to 2 mm)


As you push the pin through the bead, a little speck of clay will usually poke out from the opposite side. By pulling the pin back in, you can pull this speck back and prevent it from hardening onto the outer surface of the bead.

, Mild distortion is fairly common, so you might need to use your fingers to gently reshape the bead before setting it.


With the right piercing pin and the right technique, you may not encounter any distortion at all. It can take practice before getting the process right without misshaping the bead at all, though, so you should expect a little difficulty the first time you try it.

, Place the skewered beads on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or wax paper and bake them as you would bake any polymer clay piece.


Check the instructions on your polymer clay label to determine the correct temperature and correct amount of time. In most cases, you will need to bake the clay beads for 15 to 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).
Most pins should be oven-safe, so you shouldn't need to remove them prior to baking. Check periodically during the baking process to make sure that the pin is not melting or smoking, though.

, Remove the finished clay beads from the oven and wait a few minutes for them to cool slightly. As soon as they are cool enough to touch, pick up each bead and pull the pin out through the entrance of the hole.


It is best to remove the pin while the clay is still somewhat warm and soft.
Check the hole after you remove the pin. It should be clear and complete from side to side.
Once you finish this step, the process is complete.

Improvise if necessary.",How to Drill a Lock," Some tubular locks have a center pin made of hardened steel, while others have a ball bearing in the middle pin to prevent drilling. In either case, drilling will prove ineffective and alternate lock-picking methods must be used. If you are unsure if the lock is made with a hardened center pin, consult a local hardware store or locksmith and give them as much information as you have on the lock.








It's also important to double-check and make sure that you're working with a basic tumbler lock that you'll be able to knock out, and that there aren't other locking mechanisms on the door that'll keep you out. Disable any alarms before attempting to drill a lock.;
, Since you're using a pretty primitive method to get the lock open, you won't need many sensitive tools to get the job done properly. If you need to drill through a lock, you'll need:









A variable-speed power drill. You want a well-maintained and powerful power drill that you'll be able to use to break the lock mechanism. It would be very difficult to do this by hand.
Several sizes of drill bits. There's no one drill-bit that'll be better than others, because you want to match it to the size of the lock. Have a few on hand to experiment with.

, For the most part, if it's going to work, you'll be able to get it started with a bit that's about an eighth of an inch wide. If you don't have a bit that size, go with something in the neighborhood. You want it relatively small, going through the mechanism, rather than drilling it out completely.








, This will create a guidance point for drilling. The point should be just below the shear line, the dividing line between the inner and outer cylinder of the lock, which will keep the drill bit on the center plug. This should be high enough to effectively drill through the pin tumblers.









If you have difficulty finding the right place to sink your guidance hole, you can purchase a lock-drilling template. Templates for a variety of locks are available at locksmith shops and hardware stores.

, This destroys the pins inside the lock cylinder, allowing you to force the lock open. Most locks have about five tumbler pins to drill through, although some have six or more.









You should feel more resistance as the drill bit encounters each pin, then a decrease in resistance as the bit cuts through the pin.
If the drill binds while drilling, you may need to put the drill in reverse and pull it out of the lock to draw out excess metal filings created by drilling through metal. Lock-drilling templates for a variety of locks are offered for sale by locksmith businesses and hardware stores.

, Feel the drill work and try not to work too quickly or press too hard, as this may jam or break the drill bit. If you're having difficulty getting the bit to drill through the pins, you can stop at any time and lubricate the drill head with a little water or a synthetic oil lubricant to make the drilling easier.









Keep the drill level while drilling. If you drill at an angle, you can accidentally drill through unnecessary metal and damage more of the lock.

, After going through with your smaller bit, take it up a notch. Attach a 1/4-inch (6.5mm) or larger drill bit to your drill, and go through the lock again with the larger bit to break up the pins more and open the lock.








, Turn the locking mechanism in the same direction as you would with a key. If you drilled correctly, the locking mechanism will turn, and you will gain entry to the previously locked door. If the lock still will not turn, you may need to destroy the entire lock cylinder, as described below.








, Some locks may be more complicated, meaning that you’ll have to drill through the entire lock assembly to open the locked area. Switch to either a larger 3/4 inch (19 mm) drill bit or a specially made cylindrical tubular lock bit. Tubular lock bits are generally 3.75 inches (9.53 cm) and similar to hole saws used to drill larger holes for installing locks in doors.









Drill through the entire mechanism. This will destroy the entire lock. You will then be able to access the previously locked area."

However, the one major rule is that you should never drill a hole in tempered or safety glass.Tempered glass will shatter upon contact with the drill. To determine whether glass is tempered, look at the four corners of the glass. If the glass is tempered, the manufacturer is supposed to etch the glass at each of the corners.
Another caution: When drilling, do not wear loose clothing or long, dangling accessories like necklaces, bracelets, and shirts with long fringes. It’s critical that you not wear anything that can be caught in a power tool. It’s also a good idea to wear protective goggles and gloves when drilling.;
, If you have a power drill at home already, you can probably use that. Otherwise, you can buy a standard power drill at most home center stores.


Drilling a hole in glass does not require a specific drill – it just requires the right drill bit. It’s important not to use the drill’s full power or top speed when you drill a hole in the glass, though. You could end up cracking the glass. Think about the drilling like you are slowly carving away at glass rather than drilling a hole in it. Locate the speed dial on your drill, and adjust it to a lower level. This will help you slow down the process.

, To drill a hole in glass requires having a drill bit that is specifically equipped to drill through glass. This is very important; you can't just choose any bit you have lying around. Ask at a local hardware store, as they will make sure you purchase the right one. Glass drill bits are pretty common, and you can also buy them online.


One possibility is a carbide bit that is made for drilling glass and tile. Carbide bits have a spade shaped point and are also made to withstand the friction of drilling in glass or tile.You can find carbide bits at many home centers. Just go to the area where they sell drill bits or ask a salesperson. One issue with cheap bits, though, is that they can get dull fast or even break.

, These bits drill glass, sea glass, wine bottles, glass block and other harder materials like marble and stone. Diamonds are a harder substance than glass, so they are perfect for drilling hard substancesDiamond drill bits can be used to drill holes a quarter of an inch or larger. You can choose a rounded end or core bit. Diamond bits will create a smoother end product. Diamond bits are traditional for glass drilling; they will drill many holes with one bit and rarely cause breakage if properly used.
For very small holes, you can choose a small diamond drill bit with a solid, flat end, or tip. These are available in very small sizes, as small as 0.75 mm.You could also purchase a diamond grit hole saw. You will need an autostart quick change mandrel tool. These pieces fit on your drill. Use the mandrel on your drill to create the first hole in the glass. Then, put the saw on the drill and place it into the hole you created with the mandrel. Drill the hole through. , You could use an ice cream tub or a plastic photographic tray. You don't want to drill through into a table or something like that.


Put a bit of newspaper at the bottom of the container. This will prevent you from drilling a hole through the container itself.
Another option is to place the glass on an extremely flat surface where it is completely supported. If you can, put a rubber pad or other firm, cushioning material underneath it, but the glass must be flat and supported. In other words, don't hold the glass up as you drill or something like that.
At all times be cautious about safety. Make sure that you aren't drilling in an area where you could damage something, and you want to make sure that power tool cords are not near water.

, This will help prevent the bit from slipping as you start drilling. You could use cereal box cardboard for this purpose.


Another approach is to tape the inside and outside of the glass you will be drilling with packaging tape or painter’s tape This will stop the glass from splintering.
Tear off two pieces of the tape. Place the pieces on the glass in an X pattern over the spot where you want to drill a hole. Never drill within 3/4"" of any edges.
Make a reference mark on the tape on the spot where you want to drill the hole. This will help guide you as you get ready to drill., You want to drill slower when you are drilling into hard materials; you can find charts online that provide recommended drill speed for different materials, including glass.Chuck a small bit into a variable speed motor drill. Make sure it is secured tightly. It is best to start with a bit maybe about 1/8"" or 3/32"" in size. You only want to create a dimple in the glass at first.
Then, remove the cardboard or tape and drill faster, at about 400 rpm. If you drill too fast, your drill bit could cause burn marks around the tip. If it seems necessary, swap in a larger bit to enlarge your initial hole. The first hole is a ""pilot"" hole. It will guide the subsequent larger bits as you work your way up to the size of your finished hole, When drilling glass, you should keep the drill at low or medium speeds. When you are close to breaking through, slow it down even more because this is when the glass can be the most fragile.


If you press too hard on the glass with the drill, you could crack it. Hold the drill perpendicular to the glass so that you prevent chipping. You'll want to use lighter pressure if you're new to drilling to make it less likely you make a big mistake. Another approach is to drill half way through, flip the glass over (carefully) and drill through the back side of it until you meet the other hole in the middle., This is very important. Pour a little oil or water on the area that you are drilling. Water is the most common coolant used on drill bits. You will need to use more coolant if you are drilling a harder surface.The coolant will keep the drill bit or saw and glass lubricated and cool. If the glass gets too hot while drilling, it can crack and break.


Coolant should be applied both before and during drilling.
You could put a bottle with water in it and a small hole in it at the drill hole. It will trickle out and onto the hole as you drill the glass, cooling it.You could also spray a mist of water around the drill bit instead to keep it lubricated. Again, remember to be very careful of electrical cords and water. Try putting the water in a squirt bottle and apply it as you drill. If white powder forms as you drill, you should apply more coolant, and slow the process down.
You could also place a wet sponge under the glass as you drill to act as a coolant.Or you could cover the glass with a small amount of water before drilling - basically put it in a shallow water bath in your container.

;
, An ordinary steel drill bit may fail to penetrate the tile, or cause it to shatter. Search for an appropriate bit using the following guidelines:









Glass or tile bits are shaped to reduce the risk of shattering brittle materials. These should be carbide-tipped.
Diamond bits are more expensive, but can drill through extra-hard tiles. You may need these for modern porcelain tiles (made since the late 1990s), because they’re much harder than ceramic tiles.Masonry bits are made from carbide-tipped steel. These are strong enough to drill through, but their shape increases the risk of shattering porcelain and other brittle tiles.
As a last resort, use high speed steel (HSS) bits. Expect these to wear down after one or two holes.If drilling a large hole for plumbing installation, use a hole saw bit made from one of the above materials. Make sure its central pilot bit is also made from a suitable material.

, Ideally, the tile should not chip or break. In the event that it does, your eyes should be protected.








, Tape over the area in an X shape, marking the site of the hole. This will help give the drill bit some traction, reducing the chance of it slipping. The tape also makes chipping less likely on the outer rim of the hole.








, A drill bit may skip and jump around on the tile's smooth surface, unless you make a small pilot hole to steady it. Hold the drill bit over the center of the X and tap it in with a hammer. Tap gently to avoid damage, repeating until you've made a small dent through the surface of the glaze.








If you're using a solid drill bit larger than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), consider drilling a pilot hole with a smaller bit first.

, Set your drill to a low speed and apply modest pressure to the surface. Allow the drill to work slowly, rather than push hard and crack the tile. This may take three or four minutes.









Applying too much pressure can cause the tile to blow out and crack on the backside, creating a weak spot in the tile and often a much larger hole than originally intended.
Diamond bits are especially vulnerable to damage from fast drilling. Drill no faster than 600 rpm for diamond bits below ½ inch (1.25 cm), or 450 rpm for bits from ½ to 1 inch (1.25—2.5 cm)., Friction from drilling hard materials creates a great deal of heat, which can scorch the drill bit or even break the tile. Protect your project and extend the lifespan of the drill with a constant trickle of water. You may use a small hose, or an assistant with a squirt bottle or glass of water.









""Pump"" the drill every 15 to 20 seconds with a tiny up-and-down motion. This draws water to the tip of the bit, where friction is greatest.The drill bit should never feel more than slightly warm. If it gets hot, stop and wet it until it cools down.
As an alternative, lubricate the drill with drilling oil.

, You can switch back to a regular drill bit for this process if you prefer. Continue to drill slowly and patiently, as it is just as important to maintain the wood or drywall behind the tile. Damaging the backing board can make it difficult to anchor your screw or whatever you plan to insert.







, You can repair hairline cracks without having to replace the tile, as long as the tile is still firmly set. You can use specialized ceramic tile repair kits, but a two-part ceramic epoxy will work fine. Mix the two components together using a piece of scrap wood, then spread over the crack using a clean rag. Wipe up the excess using a second rag.








Take care not to get the epoxy in the grout lines between tiles.

, There are two ways to make the repair invisible:









Before filling, mix the epoxy with epoxy tint the same color as the tile.Or, after filling, paint over the repair using an oil-based enamel paint marker.

, Purchase a replacement tile for any damage wider than a hairline crack. Bring the tile to a home repair store to find a match for size, shape, and pattern.









Note the thickness of the tile as well. A thinner replacement will need a layer of mastic to raise it., Carefully cut away the grout around the broken tile. A grout saw will make this task go faster, but you can use a hammer and chisel instead. Work slowly all the way around the tile, to allow for safe removal without damaging the surroundings.








, Use a hammer and large chisel to break the tile apart. Angle it away from you and start from the center to reduce damage to backing.








Wear gloves and safety glasses. Lay down cloth to protect surrounding surfaces from ceramic shards.

, Scrape off the existing adhesive using a putty knife. Spread a new layer of thin-set mortar onto the wall or floor.









Follow label instructions for mixing the mortar. You may need to wear a dust mask.

, Make sure the tile is flush by tapping it in place with a rubber mallet, or a piece of wood wrapped in cloth.Scrape out any excess mortar from the grout lines with a screwdriver.








, Let the tile dry overnight, or as specified in your mortar instructions. Mix the grout, then add a thin line around the tile using a plastic putty knife. After a week, apply grout sealer over the grout to protect from moisture.

Determine which bolts need to be lock wired.,
Torque bolts needed for lock wiring.,
Create a plan.,
Remove the bolts; For this step it is recommended to keep the bolts organized as they are removed.,
Add a nut to the end of the bolt and secure to vice.,
Use a center-punch to mark the location of the hole.,
Adjust the drill press speed.,
Install 1/8” drill bit in to drill chuck.,
Align the center-punch mark and drill bit.,
Start the drill press and gently start to drill.,
Apply cutting oil to drill bit and drilling surface.,
Back out drill and clean hole.,
Continue steps 11-12 until hole is drilled all the way through the bolt head.

,
Use a lager diameter drill to chamfer drilled edges.,
Remove any sharp edges with file.,
Follow correct lock wiring procedure.",How to Drill Bolts for Lock Wiring," Bolts that meet this criteria are usually fasteners that will cause machine failure if they are to loosen during operation. Or they are bolts that will pose a safety threat to the operator if failure occurs.;
, Follow the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) specifications for the correct amount of torque to apply to the bolt. Fasteners of different sizes require different amounts of torque.

, Since the bolts are now in the position they will be in during operation you can determine which direction the holes will need to be drilled in the bolt. Once determined you will want to mark the direction on to the head of the bolt. A paint stick if the most effective however, any type of marking will be sufficient as long as it does not compromise the structural integrity of the bolt.

, Later the bolts will be installed back to their original location; keeping track of which bolt came out of what hole will aid in this process.

, By adding a nut on to the bolt will create a level surface on the side of the bolt head. Keeping the bolt head level and perpendicular to the drill will greatly aid in the drilling process.

, The use of the center-punch will keep the drill bit from “walking around” on the drilling surface.

, Most drill presses have a set of pulleys located on top. Follow the drill press manufactures’ procedural guidelines when performing this step. Hardened bolts will require a slower drilling speed. A drill speed greater than 1100 revolutions per minute (rpm) is NOT recommended.

, A higher quality drill bit is recommended. Bolts are usually made from hardened steel; this material can be extremely difficult to drill through. Using bits made from Cobalt or a High Speed Steel (HSS) Titanium coated material are strongly advised.

, Correct alignment is critical be sure to be as accurate as possible during this step.

, Light drill pressure is all that is required for a successful hole. Resist the temptation to apply large amounts of pressure; as this could lead to over heating the cutting surfaces or lead to catastrophic failure of the drill bit.

, Squirt cutting oil on to hole every 30 seconds. Proper lubrication is essential for the drilling process. The lubrication reduces heat and friction between the material being drilled and the cutting surfaces of the drill bit. A petroleum based cutting/ drilling oil is recommended.

, After 45 seconds to 60 seconds of drilling back the drill bit out of the hole and remove the shavings that have formed during the drilling process. This step will ensure that the flutes of the drill bit do not clog with shavings. Figure 12-A depicts when this step is necessary.

,, This is a recommended “trick of the trade.” Install a drill bit in to the drill press that is two times the diameter of the hole and start to drill the hole slightly. This process will create a chamfer on the end of the hole. This chamfer will reduce stress risers in the bolt and will create a softer surface for the lock wire.

, A single bastard straight file will work the best. However, any type of file will work fine.

, Lock wiring or sometimes referred to as safety wiring is a skill that requires training and practice to be done CORRECTLY. Due to the complexity of this process we will not discuss this procedure any further. Click here for lock wiring instructions.

Familiarize yourself with some basic terminology.,
Use the measuring tape to calculate the distance from the bottom of the first floor to the top of the second floor.,
Use a calculator to calculate the stair riser length or the number of steps you'll need.,
Decide on a length for the treads (the horizontal sections of your steps).,
Take the number of risers you have determined you'll need and subtract it by 1 (if you have found that you'll need 20 risers, for example, decrease that number to 19).,
Subtract the riser height from the total height from first floor to second floor.,
Measure from the bottom of where the first tread will be placed, keeping in mind that the tread will be 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, to the top of the first riser.,
Measure for a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang on the tread.",How to Measure for Stairs," The vertical section of a step is referred to as the ""riser,"" and the horizontal section is called the ""tread."" The ""stringer"" runs the length of the stairs and provides support.;
, Note that this measurement should be made to the top of the second floor, not to the bottom of it.








,

Divide the height from the first floor to the top of the second floor by a predetermined height of your choice for the riser. The typical height of a riser is 6 or 7 inches (15 to 17.5 cm). The answer you get will indicate the number of stairs you need.
Round your calculation up or down if dividing the height to the second floor by your preferred height for the riser does not give you a whole number. For example, if the answer you obtained in the first problem was 8.5, divide your total height from top to bottom by 8 and 9 in turn. The answers from these problems will give you the riser heights for each scenario, 8 steps and 9 steps. Choose which height sounds better to you.

, You do not need to make any measurements for this, but you also do not need to choose a number at random. The typical length for a tread is 10 inches (25 cm), so you'll want to stay around that number.








, Calculate the total length of your stairs (as opposed to height) by multiplying this number of risers (minus 1) by the length of a single tread. If you're using 10 inch (25 cm) treads and need 20 risers, you'll multiply 10 inches (25 cm) by 19 to get 190 inches (19 times 25 cm equals 475 cm or 4.75 m). This is the total length of the stairs.
, This answer will tell you the location of the first tread. Find the location of the second tread by subtracting the riser height from the distance from the first floor to the first tread. Continue this to find and mark on a diagram the location of and distance between all treads.
, This is the length you need to use when cutting horizontal sections into your stringers, the two pieces of lumber that run the length of each side of the stairs to provide support.








, If you're using a 10 inch (25 cm) tread, cut it at 11 inches (27.5 cm) instead so that you have some of the tread hanging over the riser.

Compare estimates.",How to Measure Carpet," Use either a paint program on your computer, graph paper and a pencil, or even just plain paper. Start with an outline of the whole first floor. Then divide that space according to the layout of the rooms you have on that floor.Don’t worry so much about making your drawing 100% accurate when it comes to proportions. As long as it roughly matches the layout of your house, you’re fine.;
, First, add any interior spaces that may be within each room, like closets or pantries. Then add any permanent standing fixtures that take up floor space, like cabinets or stairs. Finally, mark any areas where the floor height differs between rooms (or even within them).


Floors with different heights should be treated as their own space, even if they’re within one room. For example, if part of your living room is a step lower than the rest, mark that step on your diagram.

, Create a separate diagram for each floor to your home. Outline each, divide according to rooms, and fill in key details for your upper floors and basement. With connecting stairs:Include them in your diagram for each appropriate floor, but treat these as their own space to be dealt with separately., Determine which rooms and spaces you need to measure. First, shade in any rooms that won’t receive carpeting at all. Do the same with any interior spaces where you want to keep the floor bare while carpeting the rest of the room. For example:Say you want to carpet a bedroom, but not its closet. Simply shade the closet out.

, Pick one side of your home to represent your length, and its perpendicular side to be its width. Once you do, stick to this throughout your home, even if the shapes of individual rooms tempt you to switch it up. For example:Hallways tend to be long and narrow, so it seems obvious to denote the longest measurement as its length and the shortest as its width. But if a second hallway meets another at a 90 degree angle, do the opposite to express your measurements consistently from one end of your home to the other.

, Once you decide on which side of your house is the length and which is the width, measure each room in that order. Measure the length first with a tape measure and mark that number down on your diagram. Then do the same with the room’s width.Measuring each room’s dimensions in the same order will ensure that your notes remain consistent as you move from room to room.

, Say you’re carpeting a bedroom and you want to include the closet. Anticipate the floor area in the closet to require a separate piece of carpeting for installation. Measure the length and width of the bedroom by itself, then repeat inside the closet.

, Expect perfectly square and rectangular rooms to be the easiest to measure, since you only need to take two measurements. However, other rooms may follow a different shape (or have permanent fixtures that take up floor space and create a new shape). In this case, break the room up into smaller areas and measure each individually.


For instance, if you have an L-shaped room, break it into two areas. Start with the length of one area, and then measure its width. Then do the same with the remaining floor space.
Now say two sets of cabinets face each other from opposite walls in a square room. This transforms the floor area a T- or H-shape. Measure the length and width of the floor space between the cabinets. Repeat with the remaining areas.

, Avoid mistakes. Double-check your work by measuring each room a second time before moving on to the next. If you find that you made a goof the first time around, correct your diagram if you already recorded the incorrect measurement.


Always use a pencil to mark your diagram so you can erase mistakes. This will make your corrections easier to read. This in turn will minimize the risk of reading the wrong information when you tally up your totals.

, Don’t worry about measuring your stairs, even if you plan on carpeting them. Expect the material needed for these to vary depending on a number of different factors. For now, just forget about them and worry about the rest of your house. Then, when you start fielding bids from installers, ask each for their own estimate regarding your stairs., Before you start tallying up the square footage of each room, keep in mind that you’ll want more carpeting than the room’s exact square footage. Plan on purchasing extra material. This is needed for:Mending mistakes
Creating seams
Matching patterns

, If you’re purchasing the same type of carpeting for every room, keep things simple. Plan on adding an extra 10% to the total square footage for all rooms once you figure that out. However, if ordering more than one type, then:Round each measurement (length and width) up to the next half-foot before you start calculating each individual room’s square footage. For example, if one room measures 15’6” L x 20’3” W (4.72 x 6.17 m), round up to 16 x 20.5 feet (4.88 x 6.25 m).Then plan on adding an additional 5% of the total square footage once you determine that.

, First, create a list of all the rooms to be carpeted. Include the dimensions for each one. Then find the square footage of each room by multiplying its length and width. For example: 1) Master Bedroom: 16’ L x 20.5’ W = 328 square feet; 2) 1st Bedroom: 12’ L x 10’ W = 120 square feet; 3) 2nd Bedroom: 12’ L x 10’ W = 120 feet, and so on.Treat each interior space as its own separate line item. For instance: Master Bedroom Closet: 10’ L x 3’ W = 30 square feet.

For odd-shaped rooms with multiple measurements, list each area separately. With an L-shaped living room, for example, enter line items like “LR Area #1” and “LR Area #2.”

, If you’re using just one type of carpeting for your whole home, simply add up each individual square footage from your list to find the total. If using more than one type, only add each line item that will use Type 1. Then do the same for each additional type of carpeting that you’ll be using.You want a separate total for each specific type of carpeting to be used in order to budget accordingly, in case one type is more expensive than another.
However, for quotes regarding labor and installation, you really only need the general total. So if you’re using more than one type, add up the total square footage for all types, too.

, If you didn’t round up your measurements before calculating each room’s square footage, then multiply your total square footage(s) by 0.1. Add that figure to your total.If you did round up, err on the side of caution. Multiply your total square footages by 0.05 and add that number to the total. For example, if your total square footage is 1600:An extra 10% would bring it up to 1760 square feet (1600 x 0.1 = 160, and 1600 + 160 = 1760).
An extra 5%, on the other hand, would bring you up to 1680 (1600 x 0.05 = 80, and 1600 + 80 = 1680).

, Always do some comparative shopping before settling on a carpet installer. Arrange for at least a couple different companies to visit your home and give you an estimate (minus any stairs). Ask each estimator how much material is needed to do the job. Compare this with your own estimate. Then:If their estimate seems pretty close to your own, ask them for a second estimate that includes any stairs you want carpeted, too.
If, however, their initial estimate is way higher than what you came up with on your own, move on to the next company.

Take careful measurements.",How to Measure a Box1," If the box opens at one end, arrange the open side up. This way, it'll be easier to measure the inside.


You will need a tape-measure, a ruler, or any other standardized distance reference. You will be measuring your box in either inches or centimeters, depending on your location and your purposes. Be sure to use a reference that displays the relevant units.
Keep writing materials at your disposal: a pen, a pencil, or word processor. You could also use a phone or other handheld device. Write down each measurement as you take it, lest you forget.;
, You will need to know the length, the width, and the depth.If you are trying to figure out whether something will fit inside the box, then you need to measure the inside. Box sizes for mailing and shipping always correspond to the inner dimensions of the container.


Measure the length: Hold a tape-measure or a measuring stick along the longest inner side of the box. Press the tip of the measure into one corner of the box, and stretch the tape along the length of the long side to the adjacent corner. Record the number where the non-zero end of the tape-measure meets the adjacent corner of the box. If the box is rectangular, you can assume that the other ""long"" side is the same length.
Measure the width: Hold a tape-measure or a measuring stick along the shorter inner side of the box. Press the tip of the measure into one corner of the box, then stretch the tape across the short side to the adjacent corner. If the box is rectangular, you can assume that the other ""short"" side is the same length. If the width matches the length, then the box is square.
Measure the depth: Press the tape-measure into the bottom of the box, along any side, and stretch the tape up to the open top of the box. Keep the tape perfectly parallel with the creases in the corners of the box, and record the number that sits where the tape measure meets the top edge of the box.

, If the walls of your box are particularly thick, the exterior measurements may differ somewhat from the interior measurements. If the walls are very thin, you can probably just use the interior measurements. In any case, you will need to know the length, the width, and the height.Measure the length: Hold a tape-measure or a measuring stick along the longest outer side of the box. Hold the 0-end of the measure against one corner of the box, then stretch the tape along the length of the long side to the adjacent corner. Record the length.
Measure the width: Hold a tape-measure or a measuring stick along the shorter outer side of the box. As with the length, hold the tip of the measure against one corner of the box, then stretch the tape along the short side to the adjacent corner. Record the width.
Measure the height: Hold the tip of the tape-measure against the bottom of the box, along any side, and stretch the tape up to the open top of the box.

, In most casual cases, you can round to the nearest inch or centimeter.If the box must hold an object of a very specific size, and you are not absolutely sure that the object will fit – record the nearest half-inch, quarter-inch, or eighth-inch. Most tape-measures are accurate to the nearest millimeter (1/10 cm) or 1/16 inch. This is all that the casual box-measurer will need.

Draw a diagram of your roof on a piece of paper.,
Find the area of triangular sections.,
Determine the square feet of rectangle-shaped sections.,
Get the total square feet.,
Calculate the amount of materials you will need.",How to Measure a Roof1," Label each section of the roof. You will write your measurements on the diagram to make it easy to make the roof's size calculations. Being able to see where you have been and what you have already measured will help make the process go more quickly.;
, This is not as difficult as you might think. The area of a triangle is half the length times the width (L x W / 2). Use a tape measure to measure the length of the eave and the length from the center of the eave to the opposite point. Multiply these two numbers together and divide by 2. Mark this number on your diagram as the square feet for this section.

, Use the measuring tape to measure the length and the width of the squared off sections. Multiply these two numbers together, and that is the square-feet total you will mark on your diagram.

, Add up the square feet you determined for each section. The sum of these numbers is your total square feet of the roof.

, Roofing materials are determined based on the number of ""square"" a roof is, not the number of square feet. To calculate the square of a roof, take the number of square feet and divide it by 100.

There are many different roof styles, some relatively straight-forward and others more complex, depending on the shape of the home and other practical concerns. The way that you construct the roof and plan for its construction will depend most of all on how you want it to look. Some basic roof styles include:


A-Frame roofs. A-frames are tall, symmetrical frames, requiring only one type of rafter to be constructed.
Gabled roofs. A gable is an extended section of roof that extends from one wall, perpendicular to the roof.
Mansard roofs. By including an extra joint in each rafter, a mansard roof slopes in such a way as to allow for living space in the area of the roof.
Hipped roofs. These roofs slope on all sides, creating a dynamic effect for the home, but requiring a large number of rafters be constructed of variable sizes to account for the slope.;
, The framing style of the roof refers to the actual components of each roofing truss and the design of the structural foundation of that roof. Partially, these will depend on the style of roof you've selected, but you'll also have some wiggle-room depending on the design elements of the house. There are dozens of truss designs, but some of the most common for home building are discussed below.


Fink trusses are the most basic, consisting of a basic rafter, joists and jack supports. You can get these manufactured off-site or you can construct them yourself. You can also have them constructed with ""room in attic"" cut-aways to allow for livable space among the rafters.
Scissored trusses are recessed slightly in the center of the rafter, allowing for a vaulted ceiling indoors.
Clerestory trusses are a-symmetrical, with one joist extending beyond the rest of the rafter to allow for a windowed-wall along the roof.

, If you're going to cut your own rafters, or hire out a contractor to do it, the most important step in the process is measuring them correctly and calculating the size of the rafters that will be necessary for the home that you're building.Rafters are carefully constructed geometrical structures that require careful planning to pull off. You need to calculate:


Run of each rafter (in feet). This measurement refers to the total length of each segment of the rafter. Basically, each truss will be made of two rafters, making the width of the house the length of the run, times two.
Rise (in feet). The rise refers to the height of each truss, measured from the bottom of the roof segments to the top-most point or peak of the roof. Think of this as the total height of the roof itself.
Pitch (in inches). The pitch of the roof refers to the amount the roof slopes for every 12 inches it extends horizontally, and it usually given as a fraction. A pitch of 7/12, for example, would mean that the roof rises 7 inches every foot that it extends.
Length of each rafter segment (in feet). After determining the previous measurements, you'll need to calculate the length of each individual segment of the trusses–the lumber for the run, for the diagonal, and for the sloping sections of each truss. This will depend on the design of each truss and the geometry of the previous measurements., A construction calculator is pre-programmed with the Pythagorean formula necessary for quickly calculating the angles of right triangles, so you can accurately measure the angles necessary for the seat cuts to build the trusses. You can do it out by hand if you want, but roofers almost universally use construction calculators to do this quickly and accurately.


You should already have the run and the pitch measured out, but you'll need to calculate the ""adjusted"" run by subtracting the width of the ridge beam, the center beam in the roof segment that attaches both rafters and makes the truss segment.Divide the adjusted run by two to get the actual length of each run (the longer of the two sides that make up the right angle of the triangle made by each rafter). On the construction calculator, you can press the ""Run"" button to program that number in for further calculations.
Next, input the pitch of the roof, which you should have already calculated for your design. Upon inputting this information, the calculator will spit out all the info you need: the length of the diagonal segments, the interior measurement of the rise cuts, etc.

, For most load-bearing requirements, a roof truss will need to be placed every two feet along the walls. Depending on how wide the home is, you can divide the total length in feet by two to determine how many trusses will be needed. More complex roof designs will need to account for this accordingly.

, Most home builders attempting to frame a roof themselves will contract out the actual construction of the rafters by supplying the measurements necessary and having them delivered, or by supplying the architectural design plan and getting the trusses appropriate. Load bearing specs will vary from design-to-design, making it a complicated job for the DIY weekender. You'll still be able to raise the roof yourself, if you want, and save money on labor. If you want to take on the design and the construction of the rafter segments, the next section outlines the necessary cuts and construction.


If you're hiring out the construction of your house, ordering pre-fab trusses also helps to keep the cost down, and material waste to a minimum. You won't have to pay for the time of the laborers constructing the trusses, as well as the materials that go into it. Nowadays, buying the trusses pre-made is nearly universal.

, In general, dense softwoods like yellow pine or fir are preferable to spruce or lodgepole pine, to account for the support necessary. You'll need a lot of it. After you've done the measurement described above, you should be able to calculate the rough amount of the lumber you'll need for the project, and order enough to account for waste and error.


To keep the weight light, 2X4 inch (5cm x 10cm) nominal boards are suitable, as long as the bracing and the member connections you've calculated are accurate. For larger roofs or more complicated designs, denser lumber may be required.
Though it will cost more, it's absolutely essential to get high-quality straight-grained boards that are very dense, well-seasoned, and straight as arrows. If you're building a roof for a home, the lumber must be top-notch. Avoid splitting, knots, and barked edges when selecting lumber.

, Without worrying about marking your seat cuts, you can cut each chord that will go into the rafter to a workable size, if necessary, by leaving at least a foot (preferably two) of extra length on each end. Set up your lumber on saw-horses and measure out the individual sections of rafter, keeping them in separate piles, like by like. You can use a circular saw to make the cuts. The ridge beam and the bottom chords can usually be cut to size.


When cutting the ridge beam (the center board that conjoins both sides of the truss) make sure to measure the height-above-plate (HAP) and mark it on the ridge. When you're measuring the ridge joint, it's important that you account for the width of the wood from the diagonal chords of the rafter.
If the lumber you purchased is already more or less cut to size, you don't need to worry about trimming it. Start by making the seat cuts to fit them together and trim them as necessary.

, Plumb cuts are the angled cuts made on the pitch-end of each diagonal chord in the truss. The angle of the cuts made on the pitch-end of the rafters will depend upon the rise you've calculated. To measure out your cuts, you'll need a pencil, a framing square, and movable stair gauges to make accurate cuts.


Input the pitch of the roof that you calculated above (we'll use 7/12 for reference, throughout) on the framing square. On the body of the square (the longer side) input the 12, and input the 7 on the ""tongue"" (the shorter side of the square) by lining up the stair gauges at the corresponding point on the square.
Line up the square with the pitch-end of the chord and mark the line with a pencil. Some carpenters like to make this cut before moving on to making the seat cuts, because it gives the board a nice edge to grip the measuring tape onto. Other carpenters prefer to make all the measurements at the same time and all the cuts at the same time. It's up to your personal preference.

, Seat cuts are made on the end of the diagonal rafter chords where they ""seat"" onto the wall. If you're working from scratch, seat cuts need to be made to fit the individual runs onto the wall caps, leaving some length on the end to extend past the wall and create an overhang.


Start by marking the plumb line, the horizontal line that marks where the wall will meet the rafter. You should be able to calculate this quickly on the carpenter's calculator.
Line up the square with the plumb line, then rotate it 180 degrees, realigning the square on the other side of the board, leaving at least 1.5 or 2 inches of bracing for the top edge above the seat cut, and at least 4 inches of width for the support on the top cut.
While you're at it, some carpenters like to measure the rafter overhang, since you've got the square on that end of the board. Depending on the design, that usually will involve making two cuts to square up the end of the board, leaving usually about 6 inches or so of overhang beyond the seat cut.

, Depending on the design of the trusses you're making, any number of bracing joints will be necessary. A super-basic A-frame roof will require anywhere between 4 and 8, depending on the size of the rafters, with plumb cuts necessary for each angle in the brace.


Very simple trusses work on a principle of thirds. You can divide the length of the entire bottom run by three, then measure out that distance across the run to determine where the braces need to go. You can mark the center point, then scribe your cuts along each bracing board, depending on the length. Again, this is a very basic method of bracing a simple truss. more complex trusses will require more complex bracing calculations.

, After you've measured out the necessary cuts for the individual segments, make cuts on a circular saw or a table saw for the most accurate cuts. Clean up the ends with sanding paper and you're ready to fit the rafter joints together.


Again, some carpenters prefer to make individual chords at a time, or work from rafter-to-rafter, making complete ones and moving on to the next. It's up to your personal preference and work flow.

, Nail the members of the individual trusses together with nails long enough to secure both sections of wood and short enough to not stick out the other side. Use metal bracing at each intersection to secure the joints. Gussets or truss-plates made specifically for joining rafters are also available to reinforce the rafters.


It's a good idea to stack rafters on top of one another on a tarp to keep them level and out of the way. This process will likely take a couple of days, at least, making it important that you care for your rafters in the meantime, especially in wet conditions.

, Before you lift up the rafters and start installing them on the walls, it's important to install the ridge board into place across the width of the walls, to rest the center point of each truss onto. This is simply a long lumber assembly that will brace each rafter in the center. You might need to brace it underneath, as well. It may also be important to install supplementary ridge boards along the walls, to provide extra surface on which to secure the trusses.

, In general, a rafter needs to be placed every two feet, at least, for maximum load-bearing support and security. Cap plates are little metal braces that will secure the trusses to the walls. If you've made seat cuts, you may not need to use caps, but it's always a good idea to use them. Secure them in place according to your measurements.

, When you're ready to place a rafter, secure each end upside down on the wall, using three or four helpers at least to support the weight on ladders. Swing each rafter up into place by attaching a rope to the pitch and pulling it up from the ground, swinging away from the rafters you've already set up. This is a delicate process, and requires the help of several other people to negotiate it correctly.

, Nail the run joists into the cap plates, checking the placement with a carpenter's level. Depending on the size of the roof you're making, bottom supports may be necessary, especially for larger or commercial construction projects. When you have a few trusses in place, nail your end braces over the second gable truss along the peak, securing it to the other trusses. This will help to keep everything level and plumb.

, Sub-fascia boards are used to connect the wall to the end of each rafter. While not strictly necessary, many carpenters will use these for aesthetic purposes and extra support.With a carpenter's level, draw a level line to the bottom of the first rafter tail, adjusting to the tail hits the end of the overhang. Put a mark there, make the same measurement on the last rafter tail, and draw a straight line connecting the two points, marking the bottom of all the rafter tails, trimming them with a circular saw, if you didn't do this when you were cutting the rafters originally. Cut and nail the sub-fascias plywood to the rafters, extending as is necessary at the ends to make up for the overhang.

, After you've braced and installed all the rafters, you're ready to start installing a layer of roof sheathing–basically just plywood, over which the weather stripping and shingles will be installed–nailing it to the outside of the rafters accordingly. Depending on the shape of the roof, the amount and the shape of the sheathing will vary.


Start the sheathing along the bottom of the trusses, setting the first pieces on either end, then moving to another side so the seams will be staggered and the roof will be strong.

Be sure that the work pieces have stopped.,
Wipe the measuring faces of a precision measuring tool and the to-be-measured surface of the work piece so as to prevent the measuring accuracy from being negatively affected by dirt or dust.,
Never put precision measuring tools together with hand tools, such as cutting tools, files, hammers and drills for the fear of bumping the precision measuring tools.,
Use your tools for their purpose.,
Maintain temperature.,
Be aware of the immediate area.,
When having discovered some abnormal phenomena on a precision measuring tool, such as rough surface, burr, rusts, distortion of the body or ineffective movements, users should not be allowed to fix it on their own, not to mention fix it with hammers, files or emery cloth for the fear of augmenting errors.,
Users should clean the tools after use.,
Periodic maintenance should be applied to precision measuring tools.",How to Maintain a Precision Measuring Tool," Measuring work pieces on lathes should be carried out only after the work pieces have stopped; otherwise, the accuracy of the tool may be negatively impaired due to wear of the measuring faces and accidents may occur.;
, It is not advisable to use such precision measuring tools as vernier caliper, micrometer and dial indicators to measure those forged roughcasts or abrasive-bearing pieces (like carborundum), because the measuring faces will be abraded and accuracy will fall.

, Never put them on lathes either to prevent them from dropping from lathes and breaking down due to vibration of lathes, especially in the case of vernier calipers which should be laid flat in specific cases to avoid distortion.

, Precision measuring tools should not be used as substitutes for other tools. So it is not advisable to use vernier caliper as line markers, micrometers as small hammers or steel linear as screw drivers and cutting scrap wipers. It is not proper either to take precision measuring tools as toys, take flinging a micrometer with hands for example. These behaviors will lead to the falling of accuracy of precision measuring tools.

, Temperature does have a substantial impact on the measuring results. Precise measurement of work pieces should be carried out only under the condition that the temperature is around 20 °C (68 °F). Generally, measurements can be carried out under room temperature, but the work pieces and the measuring tools should share the same temperature. Otherwise, the result of measurements will not be accurate due to the characteristic of distortion of metals subject to temperature changes. Precision measuring tools are subject to the changes of temperature, too. They should not be put under direct sunshine, because measurements will not be achieved when the temperature rises. Never put precision measuring tools near heat sources such as electric cooker and heat transmitter to protect the tools from being distorted by heat thus disabling accuracy.

, Precision measuring tools should never be put near magnetic area, such as magnetic worktable, to avoid being magnetized.

, Users should send the flawed tool to the repair depot and use it after it is repaired right!

, Tools except those made of stainless steel or framed by protective materials should be daubed with anti-rust oil, put in a specific case and kept in dry places to be free from being rusted.

, Long-used precision tools should be sent to authorized calibration facilities periodically for test and calibration to avoid product quality problems caused by unreasonable reading errors of the tools.

Choose your chalk.,
Grind chalk into a powder.,
Mix the chalk with some water.,
Use the paint.",How to Make Chalk Paint1," Thick sidewalk chalk works the best for this. You can also use regular chalk, like the kind teachers use on chalkboards. If you want something more vibrant, you could try soft chalk pastels (not the oil kind).


This method creates a washable sidewalk chalk. It will not work on furniture or DIY chalkboards.;
, The easiest way to do this would be with a food grater.If you don't have any graters on hand, place the chalk into a plastic bag, then smash it with a hammer until it is fine and powdery.


If you are using a food grater, make sure it's not one that you actually cook with. Use a separate one.

, Pour the powdered chalk into a plastic container. Stir in up to ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water.If you used regular chalk or a chalk pastel, try 1/4 to 1/3 cup (60 to cc milliliters) instead.


Plastic food containers and clean, empty yogurt containers work great for this.
If the paint is too thin, add some more chalk. If the paint is too thick, add in a little bit more water.

, Dip a paintbrush into the paint, then draw designs on the sidewalk or driveway. Let the paint dry, then marvel in your artwork. To clean up the sidewalk or driveway, simply wash it down with water.

Select a jigsaw suitable for your project.,
Select the correct blade for the material you are going to cut.,
Prepare your workpiece for your cut.,
Measure and mark the cut line you need for your project.,
Place the material you are cutting on saw horses or a workbench, or clamp it in a vice, depending on which is best suited for your purpose.,
Make sure you have sufficient light to see your cutting marks easily.,
Position the blade close to the edge of the material where you will begin your cut.,
Guide your saw along its path by twisting the back of the saw in the opposite direction you want the blade to travel, keeping the blade aligned with the cut line.,
Stop the saw if sawdust or debris accumulates blocking your view of the cut line, or if this material interferes with the travel of the saw.,
Complete your cut by continuing through the material, being careful to support any piece that may drop when the cut is finished until the blade is free of it.,
Use a sander or plane to finish edges that become spalled or rough from the cutting process.

",How to Use a Jigsaw," There are several different features you should be aware of, since not all jigsaws are created equally.


Power source. Battery operated jigsaws are more portable than saws with power cords, but they are also heavier, and likely will not have the motor torque heavy cutting requires.
Scrolling saws have a knob on top that allows the blade to be rotated without having to rotate the whole saw assembly, making it useful in tight working areas.
Orbital action saws can actually provide thrust to the blade while it moves in its normal up and down motion, greatly increasing its cutting speed.
Speed control may be important in your work, and jigsaws may come with multiple speeds, variable speeds, and single speed functions. Variable speed saws are best for cutting different materials, particularly metal, where a lower blade speed will increase blade life, and plastics, where very low cutting speeds will prevent the material from melting, rather than cutting.
Blade locking mechanisms can either use a quick change, tool-less type, or an allen or machine screw clamping system. For obvious reasons, the quick-change blades are especially useful when performing different types of cuts frequently.
Built in lights and dust blowers are also helpful when trying to cut accurately where seeing your cut mark is difficult.
Amperage should be considered when you plan to cut thicker or harder to cut material, such as thick hardwood lumber. A saw with a low amperage rating (4 amps or less) will not perform like a heavy duty saw with a rating of 8 or 9 amps.
Pivot base jigsaws allow you to make cuts are various angles, up to about 45 degrees depending on the length of your blade and the thickness of the material you are cutting.;
, A jigsaw can be used to cut almost any material from plywood to stainless steel sheet metal if the proper blade is used. Here a few blade characteristics to be familiar with:


Blade composition. Jigsaw blades are made from high speed steel, hardened steel, and bimetal composite metals for cutting metal.
Teeth per inch. The TPI of a blade should be matched to the thickness of the material you are cutting. Three to five teeth should engage the material you are cutting at all times. An example of this would be, when cutting 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) material, you will want a blade with 12 to 16 teeth per inch, where cutting 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) material will be easier and smoother using a blade with 24 teeth per inch.
Blade width is important, as well. For turning tight corners, a narrow scrolling blade is best, for cutting fairly straight lines, especially in thicker material, a wider blade will perform well.
Make sure you use the right blade for your saw, as the tool-less"" saw blades will not fit a screw clamp saw, nor will the clamp-in blade fit the tool-less saw.


, Once you have selected the blade/saw combination you will use for your project, you will want to prepare the material you are cutting for the cut.

, For shapes like sink cut-outs in countertops, using the actual sink to scribe a cut line is your best option. For other shapes or special projects, creating a template for your cut out of paper or cardboard may make the process easier and more accurate.

, In most cases, clamping or having the material you are cutting clamped or fastened in place makes using your jigsaw easier. Having both hands free to guide the saw is very valuable, especially for precision work.

, You will be looking underneath the body of the jigsaw at the blade as it cuts, and that will mean you are probably working in a shadowy area.

, For plunge cutting or inside cut-outs, skip down to those steps. Begin your cut by slowly squeezing the trigger of the saw, and when it is running at the desired speed, push it forward into the material you are cutting.

, If the saw begins to load up, or sounds like it is straining, slow down your forward speed. Trying to cut too fast will overheat the blade, and even the saw's motor, and may result in splintering in the material you are cutting.

, For finished materials, sawdust accumulating underneath the saw may mar the surface, so blowing the debris ejected by the blade during cutting may be necessary. Restart the saw after you clear the cutting line by backing it up slightly, never turn the saw on while the blade is engaged in the material you are cutting.

, Allowing the material to drop or bend before the cut is done will cause the blade to bind, and may result in a splintered cut towards the end.

Measure the space where the box will sit.,
Calculate the area of each side.",How to Measure a Box2," If you are planning to fit the box into a specific space—say, you are building a planter box for your garden, or you are stacking boxes of belongings into a moving van&messy;make sure to check your box measurements against that space.


Measuring a space is much like measuring a box. If your box needs to fit along three axes—length, width, and height—then measure those axes. If your box only needs to fit into a two-dimensional space on the ground, and height is not an issue, then only measure the length and the width.
If you can physically bring the box to the space where it will rest: do so. This is the easiest way to ascertain whether the box will fit. If you cannot do so, visit the space with a tape-measure and the box dimensions that you wrote down. Imagine that the box is sitting in the space before you, and use the tape-measure to mark out the edges of the box.

, Simply multiply the length of a side by its width to find the area. In most cases, you will not need to know the area of the box sides – but it may come in handy to know how many boxes you can fit into, say, a five-foot-by-five-foot storage space.


For example: If the bottom of the box is 10 inches wide and 15 inches long, you can multiply 10"" x 15"" to get 150 square inches. This is the area of the bottom of the box.

Consider whether you need to know the volume of your box.,
Know the volume of whatever you'll put into the box.,
Multiply length by width by depth (L x W x D).If your box is square or rectangular, this will give you the volume in cubic inches.",How to Measure a Box3," If you are filling the box with a material that flows—like earth, sand, a liquid, or a gas—rather than large, discrete objects, then it may behoove you to calculate the volume.


Volume is measured in cubic inches, cubic centimeters, cubic feet, etc. A ""cubic inch"" describes a cube with three measurements—length, width, and height—that each measure exactly one inch. In order to find the volume, thus, you will need to multiply the length of the box by the width of the box by the depth of the box.If the box has thick walls (thicker than, say, a quarter inch), be sure to multiply by the interior depth rather than the exterior height.

, If you are filling a box with something, it is not enough merely to know the volume of the box. You will also need to figure out how much (of the earth, sand, liquid, etc.) you have, and compare that figure to the size of the box itself.


You might use a program for this rather than doing the calculations yourself. Try searching online to find a suitable one.

, For example: if your box is 10 inches wide, 15 inches long, and 9 inches deep, you'll multiply 10"" x 15"" x 9"" to get 1350 cubic inches. You can use an online unit converter to find the volume in liters, gallons, or other units.


If your box holds an irregular shape, consider using an online volume calculator for more complicated equations: http://www.calculator.net/volume-calculator.html

Simple artwork like text is the easiest artwork to cut with a vinyl cutter. All keyboard fonts are considered vinyl cutter ready vector art (VCRVA or VCVA). All text on all the Windows or Mac included fonts can be typed directly into a vinyl cutting program. This includes fonts like Symbol. Alternatively, you can draw shapes and prepare vector art specifically for vinyl cutting with a graphics program like InkScape, Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator. Usually, when people want to vinyl cut an image, creating clean vector art is the most time consuming process but yet it is the most important.
Creating clean VCRVA is even more time consuming because adequate thought has to go into figuring out what portions of your design you are going to keep and what portions you are going to remove or 'weed' away.
If you take a photograph and bring it into a cutting program like Flexi Starter 10 and automatically convert it into vector art you will likely have a mess to clean up. Vector art format differs from bitmap or JPEG art format in that vector art contains lines and arcs to define the picture whereas bitmaps and their equivalents are just a pattern of pixels without any edge definition. Your vinyl cutter can cut lines, arcs and circles but cannot cut a pixel so all artwork must be converted to vector art so your vinyl cutter can cut it properly. It turns out that Flexi interpreted the yellow as 8 shades of yellow and created edges between the different shades of yellow and separated these edges onto different layers. In the end, a simple black, yellow and blue image ended up being 25 different colors and had edges on 25 different layers. Most of the issues associated with vinyl cutting are related to vector art quality.;
, Also, if your artwork is complex, consider sending it out to an outside vendor to have it vectorized for you. There is also software available such as Vector Magic that can do auto-vectorizing and cleanup for you.

, Once you have created artwork in a program such as Illustrator, Corel Draw or InkScape, you will need to import it into a vinyl cutter program. There are several vinyl cutter programs available on the market. The most common is Flexi Starter 10 (and numerous private label versions of it) followed by programs like SignCut. These programs will lay out your artwork on your vinyl, create weeding lines, create a weeding frame or box, allow you to make copies in rows and columns, scale and rotate, layer the cuts and do several other functions and finally, send the cutting commands to the vinyl cutter.

, Different vinyl cutters will have various methods to connect up to your computer. Many if not most these days connect up through the USB port. Once you have established the connection between your cutter and your computer (some drivers may need to be installed) you will need to choose the port or the specific cutter in the sign cutting software to establish the connection between your vinyl cutter and the software.


The vinyl cutting industry is more geared to PC's and not Macs. There are systems that are Mac compatible like SignCut but Flexi is not very Mac compatible in its current version. Make sure that your cutter is in the online mode and that the cutter and correct port are selected in the cutting software. This is very important to establish proper communication.

, Basically, vinyl material is roll fed into a vinyl cutter and hangs off the back side of the cutter on rollers or on a roller bar. Feed the vinyl under the pinch rollers and on top of the roller bar and then release the rollers to hold the vinyl in place.

, Blades usually come in angles from 20° to 60° or so. The larger the blade angle, the sharper the blade, but the quicker the blade will dull. 45° blades strike a good balance between wear and sharpness. 60° blades are sharper and are widely used.


Setting up blade depth and pressure or force is critical to getting good cuts. There are basically two parameters that need to be set to achieve good cutting. One is blade depth relative to the carriage and the other is pressure set by the cutter. These parameters vary in importance between machine manufacturers.
A good way to set blade tip height is to peel off the vinyl and expose the vinyl backing. Place the blade holder in the down position.
Some machines have a button control that will allow you to automatically push the carriage to the blade down position while for other carriages you will need to push down on the blade holder manually. Fasten the blade position so that the tip of the blade is slightly penetrating the top surface of the vinyl backing. From here, you will need to set the pressure.

, Set the pressure at a low level and send a cut to the cutter. Chances are that you will not cut fully through the vinyl. Increase the pressure by an increment of your choosing, move the carriage over and cut this same text again. Continue to do this and remember the pressure setting for each cut until you are penetrating the vinyl backing but not going through it.

, The one that weeds the best and leaves a slight impression on the vinyl backing is the optimized setting for this vinyl. This process of setting blade tip depth and pressure may need to be repeated each time you change vinyl type as the release liner thicknesses and vinyl characteristics will change from roll to roll and may require different tip depths or cutting pressures. Usually, once a cutter is setup for vinyl, you can cut that roll and additional rolls as long as it is all the same type of Vinyl.

, Use the cutting feature of your sign cutting software to send your artwork to the vinyl cutter. Cutting your artwork can take as little as a few seconds to several hours depending on complexity. Most simple signs and decals take just a few minutes.

, Advance the vinyl roll with the cutter control panel or release the rollers and pull your vinyl forward. Use rolling scissors to trim your vinyl from the base roll.

, Assuming you did a good job setting up your cutter your artwork should weed relatively easily. Weeding is the process of removing material that you don't want in your graphics. The smaller the features in your graphic, the more challenging weeding can become. Use a weeding pick to carefully pull up and remove the portions of vinyl that you don't want to transfer to your target surface. Strategically placed weeding lines are recommended to make this process easier. It is sometimes very difficult to weed all your unwanted material if it is all connected in one piece. This is also sometimes a time consuming and delicate process.

, With your image weeded, the next step to take will be to transfer your image from the release liner to the target surface. TIP: If you are applying your image to the inside of glass make sure to cut the mirror image so it appears correct when viewed from the outside of the glass. Transfer tape is similar to masking tape but has a different tack for adhering to your vinyl but releasing it on the target surface. Use a semi-transparent transfer tape to apply your graphics. Transfer tape comes in many widths up to about 48"". If you have an image that is 6"" tall but only have transfer tape that is 4"" wide you can lay multiple strips down to cover your image completely and overlap the transfer tape by ¼"" or so. You will want to use your squeegee with a felt sleeve to rub the transfer tape on the vinyl to insure good adhesion.

, Your target surface should be prepared by cleaning with rubbing alcohol or other similar cleaner to remove grease, oil and dirt. In addition, the surface can be prepared with an application liquid spray that will allow the vinyl to not immediately stick to the target surface. This will allow you to reposition the graphic on the target surface before allowing it to dry and permanently adhere and remove air bubbles. This saves lots of time and avoids having to redo the job.

, Peel the transfer tape away from the release liner and your graphics should come with your transfer tape. If they don't, push the transfer tape back down and use your squeegee again to stick the transfer tape to the decal. Take this decal and apply it to the target surface. From there, use your squeegee with a felt sleeve to smooth your decal on your target surface removing all air bubbles. Allow to dry if you applied application liquid and then peel off your transfer tape.

Find the length and wingspan/width of the scale model which you are constructing.,
Find the dimensions of your model with a ruler.,
Divide the real life dimension of either length or width by that of the model.,
Take the reciprocal of the number you just had.,
You have found out the scale of your model!",How to Determine the Scale of a Model," This can be done by simply searching up the type of model, and finding it's dimensions. For example, if you're making an Airbus A380 plane model, you would search up the dimensions of the plane, as this is the first step to finding the plane's scale.
, It doesn't need to be millimeter perfect, but use a ruler for fairly accurate results., So, say the real life object had a length of 55m, and the model had a length of 50 cm, or 0.5m, then do 55/0.5. This is equal to 110., So, after your division of 55/0.5, the answer is 110.

Taking the reciprocal basically means putting 1 over it as a fraction. So, the reciprocal is 1/110. Now, instead of this being a fraction, just make it into a ratio, so, it is not 1/110 but 1:110.

, You now know that in this example, 110 of your scale model will make 1 of the real life model."

Choose the grinder that is best suited to your project.,
Choose the proper discs.,
Carefully read all the instructions and guidelines, being sure you understand any recommendations from the manufacturer, before using your grinder.

,
Clamp your work firmly to a stable surface and make sure that the guard is properly secured.

,
Hold the grinder with a firm grip and against the bulk or body of your work rather than on the edge of it.

,
Move the grinder across the bulk or body of your work in the direction of the handle to avoid the grinder kicking back and the disc slipping, which may ruin your work and cause injury.",How to Use an Angle Grinder," Electric grinders are more powerful and are best for large jobs that cover a lot of surface area. Pneumatic grinders are less powerful, but easier to maneuver and are best for smaller jobs in tighter fitting spaces.;
, Sanding discs and polishing pads are used for finishing work, while cutting discs are used for cutting tile, masonry, steel or pipe and wire brush wheels to remove rust or paint. Grinding discs are also available for grinding metal and stone. Never use a cutting disk for grinding.

Carefully examine your knife.",How to Loosen up a Stiff Knife1," Tightness or stiffness in a knife comes from several sources and each needs to be handled a slightly different way. The typical causes are: Rust or aging, goop stuck on the knife, friction and tight hinges. Each of these is explored in the methods below, providing a solution for you to try.

"
"
Check to see what color the blade or hinges are.,
If the knife has only metal parts, simply give it a good soaking in a mineral oil.,
If the knife has non-metal parts, your job will be trickier.,
Repeat several times over the course of a week, buffing the rust and working the oil into the hinge(s).",How to Loosen up a Stiff Knife2," Does the blade or hinge look slightly orange? Or even slightly powdery or white? This could be caused by the metal in the knife oxidizing to the point of the blades adhering to the casing or each other.;
, Then, buff it clean in a day or two. Once you've done this, keep the knife oiled from then on.

, In this case, the metal parts need a good soak without getting the rust removal fluid on the non-metal parts. You can do this by masking the area off with tape, by using tiny brushes or ""Q-tips"", etc.

, Use a heavy towel or wear gloves to protect your fingers from the blade(s) during this process.

"
"
Observe whether the knife has some substance on the blades.,
Clean the ""goop"" off.,
Thoroughly oil the knife when you're finished cleaning.",How to Loosen up a Stiff Knife3," Is it sticky? Did the knife fall into something that is just not wiping off easily?

, How successful this will be depends on the type of ""goop"" it is. If you have no idea, it is best to start with the mildest cleaner available and progress to the strongest. Try cleaning agents in this order (rinsing and drying thoroughly in between): Water, ammonia, light mineral oil, ""tape remover"" or ""goop remover"" products from the store.

, This will prevent future oxidation.

"
"
Clean the knife thoroughly using the methods outlined above.,
Oil the knife hinges thoroughly.

,
Protect your hands with either heavy gloves or a heavy towel.

,
Place a drop or two of mineral oil in the hinge area.

,
Open and shut the blade repeatedly to create enough wear in the hinge to loosen it.

",How to Loosen up a Stiff Knife4," Sometimes a knife ""sticks"" because its blades were too snugly squeezed at the factory when the hinge(s) were pressed or riveted in. Loosen it as follows.

"
Inspect the knife for a screw at the base of the blade.,
Use a small screwdriver to loosen the screw holding the blade in place.,
Replace the clip if needed.",How to Loosen up a Stiff Knife5," It may be under the clip. Depending on the knife, you may need to remove the clip to access the screw., Be sure to not loosen the screw too much as the blade could potentially fall out., Check that the blade moves smoothly."

Start by cutting your yard sticks.,
After cutting it to size, drill your holes through which to put your screws.,
Now take your sixteen inch bar and cut a 1/4” deep notch between 5 7/8” and 6” from one side.,
Now take your angle plate and drill a hole, just big enough for your machine screws to fit through, in the center of one of the sides.,
Place the bar on the side of your board, with 8” of the notched side sticking out.,
Place the angle plate on the other side with the drilled hole not against the wood.,
Now for drilling into your mat cutter.,
Screw in the fittings and attach the squaring arm to the cutter.,Lastly stick the feet on the bottom of the squaring arm.",How to Make a Squaring Arm for Your Logan 301 S Compact Mat Cutter," If you are using metal rulers, align them and clamp them with your vise as you cut. Cut at exactly the three inch mark on one end, and the twenty six and 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) mark on the other. Brush up ends with a file or bench grinder.
, For example, you can make five holes., You can drill a hole and then cut to it with a hacksaw to make the notch. Drill holes big enough for your 3/4” wood screws to fit through. Now drill holes at 1 ½”, 7”, 9 ½”, and 14 ½” from the same side you cut the notch from., You can use the pre-drilled holes, but they will be larger than your screw and will allow for lots of wiggle room., Mark the place for your holes and drill them or, if you have a vise, clamp the board and bar together while you drill. Make sure to protect your wood. Fasten the metal piece with the ¾” wood screws., Drill the holes for it. Fasten with two of the wood screws it comes with., Place the attachment snugly against the cutter. You can clamp it together using the C clamps and a couple boards on the top and bottom. Or you can just mark the position of the holes. Note that these holes must be exact. Drill the holes. There should be three, one on the front and two on the side. Make them just smaller than the outside of the fittings with the machine screw threads on the inside (supply # 9). Before screwing in the fittings put some welders glue on them, following the glue’s directions. This will ensure that the do not come out, as the cutter’s wood is soft., Place the cut yardstick an top toward the bar edge. Place a square along the cutting edge and against the ruler to make it square. The yardstick inch marks and the square inch marks should be aligned. Drill the holes and fasten it with the 5/8” wood screws.,"

Gather your materials.,
Place the paper on a flat surface.,
Use a pencil to mark the start and end of your line.,
Place the ruler on the paper.,
Hold the ruler in place with one hand while cutting with the other.,
Erase the pencil marks you made in Step 3.",How to Cut a Straight Line1," You will need a 12” or longer metal ruler, a pencil, paper, and a craft knife. The process will be easier if you also have a cutting mat: these are widely available at hobby and fabric stores, have straight lines printed on them, and protect working surfaces so that you don’t end up scoring lines in your dining room table. “Sticky tack,” a removable putty-type adhesive, can help anchor the ruler.


X-ACTO knives are very commonly used by crafters, and are easily found in most craft stores and many superstores. If you don’t have one or don’t want to buy one, a box cutter will also work (as long as it’s sharp).
If you use a box cutter, straight razor blade, or other extremely sharp object, use extreme caution! Craft knives such as X-ACTO knives have safety handles that can help keep you from cutting yourself. Never allow children to use sharp knives without adult supervision.;
, If you have a cutting mat, place the paper there. Make sure your work surface doesn’t have any bumps or bubbles, as this will affect your cutting.

, Lightly mark your paper (so you can erase the marks later) with small dots or lines to show the beginning and end of your line.







, Line up the ruler alongside the marks you made in Step 3 to create a straight line between them.









If you’re working on patterned paper, such as scrapbooking paper, make sure that the line you’ve created is aligned with the pattern. If your line is straight but askew from the pattern, the final product will look crooked. Adjust the paper as necessary.
If you have sticky tack, place a small bit on either end of the ruler and press it onto the cutting mat (or work surface). This will anchor the ruler in place so it doesn’t move as you cut.

, Press the ruler firmly onto the work surface, or secure it with sticky tack. Place the blade of your knife right alongside the ruler and slice downward, pulling the knife carefully toward you. Repeat a few times to make sure the paper is completely cut through.









Don’t apply too much pressure with the knife as you cut. This could break the blade or create drag on the paper, making it tear instead of cut neatly.
You can also cut from side to side, rather than pulling the blade toward you. If you do this, move the blade in the direction of your dominant hand (towards the right if you are right-handed, towards the left if you are left-handed). This will allow you to see what you’re doing.

, If you can still see the pencil marks, gently erase them. Don’t press too hard on the paper with the eraser or you could tear the paper.

Choose the kind of sharpening stone you wish to use to sharpen your pocket knife.,
Lubricate your sharpening stone.,
Identify the bevel angle of the blade.,
Position the knife at the proper angle against the stone.,
Glide the knife along the stone.,
Sharpen the other side of the blade.,
Flip the stone over so that the finer side is facing up.,
Test your pocket knife for sharpness.",How to Sharpen a Pocket Knife1," No matter which type of stone you select, keeping to one that is at least 2x6 inches will make your sharpening job easier. The several options available for purchase that include diamond stones, ceramic stones, and whetstone.








Whetstone: These stones generally considered the easiest to use and are made from fine to coarse grit stone. You must soak your whetstone in cold, clean water for ten minutes before you sharpen your blade on it. Keep in mind that when a whetstone is used a lot, it often develops valleys or grooves where the knife is rubbed.
Ceramic Stones: These stones must also be soaked in water before use, but only for three to five minutes. They are harder than whetstones which means that they will sharpen your blade faster. Ceramic stones generally last longer than whetstones but are a bit more challenging to use.
Diamond stones: These stones come in several different varieties including harder, fine, and superfine. Diamond stones are very hard and very porous.In many cases, diamond stones are actually metal plates with small diamonds attached to their surfaces. These stones are the hardest sharpening stones and will sharpen your blade the quickest. Keep in mind, that diamond stones are also by far the most expensive sharpening stone.;
, If you are using a whetstone or ceramic stone, you should soak the stone in the water for the correct amount of time. Knife sharpening experts also recommend using a lubricant such as mineral oil. You can buy this oil at your local hardware store. The purpose of lubricant is to prevent the stone's pores from clogging up with filings and grit. It also reduces the heat caused by the friction that is created when the knife is rubbed on the stone. Too much heat can warp your blade.








Sharpening or machine oil can be used with a whetstone or ceramic stone, and thinned dish washing soap is handy for use with a diamond stone.

, This is also called the rough grind angle. The blade of every knife is honed at a particular angle to suit the purpose of the knife. Most pocket knives have a bevel edge of 25 to 30 degrees.








If you are wary of sharpening your knife without knowing the exact angle, you can go into your local knife shop for help, or call the manufacturer of the knife. You may also be able to find the specific bevel angle for your knife online.

, Maintain the knife's position with the blade facing away from you at the determined bevel angle against the whetstone when sharpening.









Holding your knife in the same position for a long period of time can be challenging. If this is your first time sharpening a knife, or you feel like your hands may not stay steady for long enough, you should consider buying a sharpening guide. Sharpening guides attach to the knife and hold it at a steady angle. Keep in mind that guides do not do very well with a curved blade., Sweep the knife down and off the end of the whetstone. Repeat as many times as necessary to produce a sharp edge, usually about 12 times. As you perfect your sharpening skills, this will become a more circular motion of the blade over the stone.









Blades that are curved or longer than your whetstone will need to be swept down and across the stone to evenly sharpen the entire blade.

, Flip the knife over and draw the blade across and off the whetstone, guaranteeing the angle. Do this between 6-8 times or until a sharp edge is accomplished.








, Run your blade, at its proper bevel angle, along the finer side of the stone. Doing this will remove any bumps or ‘burs’ that may have formed along the edge of the blade during the sharpening process.








Instead of using the finer side of the stone, you can also run each side of the blade down a honing rod at an angle more open than the one you held the blade at to sharpen it. This removes the burrs and fine tunes the blade's sharpness. Honing is also a quick way to refresh an edge in between sharpenings.

, Hold up a piece of paper, and try to slice down through the paper with your knife. A sharp blade will easily slide through the paper.









You can also test for any rounded part of the blade or imperfections by holding your knife up to a light (you could also use the sun) and looking for a bright light reflection. Reflections only exist when there is a rounded edge somewhere along your knife, or a section of a knife that is no longer sharp.

",How to Clean a Two Cycle Carburetor," These devices have small fasteners and parts which must be kept clean and safe while you work on them, and some have special fasteners that are difficult to remove without the right tools.;
, This will make it easier to keep the internal parts of the carburetor clean while disassembling it.

, It may be attached with clips or screws, you should be able to locate them by inspecting the housing visually. If you cannot remove the housing on the engine you are working on, consult the owner's manual or search specific information online.

, There are usually two threaded studs with nuts and washers that serve this purpose. Be careful not to drop these nuts in an inaccessible location beneath the powerhead.

,  If there is a spring clamp, be sure that you do not overstretch it while removing it.

, You can usually grip them gently with needle nose pliers and work them free. If clamps are used to attach them, remove the clamps prior to trying to remove the fuel lines.

, Again, note the position of the carburetor, most are symmetrical, so they can be reinstalled upside down, and the aforementioned linkages and fuel lines will not fit if that is the case.

, Brush any stubborn dirt off with a soft bristle parts brush, using a solvent like carburetor/choke cleaner or unchlorinated brake cleaning solvent to make the job easier.

, You can now ease the edge of the diaphragm up a little to look for dirt or debris underneath it in the fuel channels and the small reservoir. If debris is visible, use canned compressed air to blow it out. Use solvent to dissolve any gum or varnish present only if needed.

, For carburetors that have a large, visible build up of varnish or gum underneath the diaphragm, you may have to remove it completely, but in this case, you will probably need to buy a rebuild kit with new parts, as damage to the diaphragm is likely to occur while removing it.

, Again, remove the four screws (usually), and pry the cover gently off of the carburetor. If you damage the gasket, you will need to purchase a replacement, so be careful.

, If you see varnish buildup or trash in the screen, use a solvent (carburetor/choke cleaner) to dissolve it. For heavy buildup, you may need to fill a small, clean solvent proof container with solvent and soak the complete assembly for a short time to dissolve it.

, You can also spray solvent through the tubes where the fuel lines connect to the housing.

A cutting mat and sticky tack will help prevent damage to your work surface and keep the ruler in place.

, If you have a cutting mat, place the paper there. Make sure your work surface doesn’t have any bumps or bubbles, as this will affect your cutting.

, Lightly mark with dots or lines where you want your line to start and end. Don’t press too hard or the marks will be difficult to erase later.








, Place the ruler on the paper about one millimeter below where you want your line to be.








, Be careful when holding open scissors so that you don’t cut yourself. Only grip the top of the blade.









If you have craft or kitchen shears, they may separate at a center pivot point. If you can separate your blades, this may be easier and safer.

, Hold the ruler steady with one hand while you cut with the other. Pressing gently into the paper, swipe the blade of the scissors quickly along the ruler. Repeat this motion two or three more times.









Don’t press too hard with the blade or you could cause too much friction on the paper. This could end up tearing it instead of cutting it neatly.

, Using the crease you created as a guide, carefully cut along the paper with scissors.









If you don’t mind rougher edges, you can also tear the paper along the crease. This will give the edges of the paper a “fuzzy” look rather than the sharp line of scissors.

, If you can still see the pencil marks, gently erase them. Don’t press too hard on the paper with the eraser or you could tear the paper.

Gather your materials.,
Fold the paper where you want the cut to be.,
Open the paper and fold it in the opposite direction.,
Cut along the fold line.",How to Cut a Straight Line3," All you need for this technique are scissors or a craft knife, paper, and your hands. This technique works best with stiffer paper that will hold a sharp crease.

, Place the paper onto a hard surface and press firmly along the fold. The crease needs to be very sharp to provide the best guide for your scissors.








, Hinge on the fold line so that you are folding the paper in the same spot. Press the paper firmly along the fold again.








, You can use scissors or a craft knife to cut along the fold line. Move carefully so that you stay in line with the fold.

Start with smooth, wrinkle-free fabric.,
Prepare your cutting area.,
Align your fabric on the cutting mat.,
Check twice, cut once.",How to Cut a Straight Line4," Iron your fabric to remove any wrinkles and creases. Wrinkled fabric will cause jaggedness even if you cut a straight line.









If you're using a fabric like linen or cotton, using spray starch will give your fabric a bit more body and make it easier to cut., Place a ruled cutting mat on a flat, level, stable surface with good lighting. A cutting mat will help you cut straight lines in fabric, and it will also prevent damage to your work surface. Cutting mats are easily found at most craft and fabric stores.

, Use a horizontal line to make sure your fabric is lying straight. Place a metal-edged ruler across the fabric, and line it up along a vertical line on the mat.








, Double-check your alignment before you cut your fabric. Once you're satisfied, use a rotary cutter (kind of like a pizza wheel, but for cutting fabric) to cut the fabric along the edge of the ruler.

If you're using a fabric like linen or cotton, using spray starch will give your fabric a bit more body and make it easier to cut., If you have a cutting mat, use the lines on it to help ensure that the ruler is straight.









If you're cutting fabric that has a definite pattern or direction, make sure your ruler is aligned with the pattern. Depending on the fabric, this may mean you need to slant your line rather than cut a perfectly vertical line that skews the pattern.
You must use a metal ruler for this step! Plastic rulers will melt once you apply heat.

, If you have a fabric-covered ironing board, pin the fabric to the ironing board to keep it in place. Otherwise, you can just hold it securely with your hand.








, Applying gentle pressure, move the iron back and forth over the fold you just created. The ruler will help you press a perfectly straight crease.








, Place the ruler alongside one edge of the fold to help keep your scissors or rotary cutter steady. Cut slowly along the fold.

Create a cutting jig for your saw.,
Use a pencil and a straightedge to mark your line on the wood.,
Place the wood and cutting jig on sawhorses or a work table.,
Align your saw with the fence on your jig.",How to Cut a Straight Line6," This process is fairly simple, and you'll be able to use the jig every time you want to cut a piece of wood.

Use a sheet of 1/4"" plywood as your base. Cut a piece about 10"" wide and about 4' long.(If your project is much larger, make the base longer to provide more stability.)
Cut a piece of 3/4"" plywood to form a ""fence."" The fence should be a few inches wider than the width of your saw's motor and should be as long as your base.
Align the base and the fence at the ends and one long edge. Use wood glue and screws to glue the base and the fence together.
Clamp the jig to the edge of a work table. If you don't have one, you can secure a large sheet of plywood to two sawhorses and clamp the jig to the edge of that.
Align your circular saw with the fence and cut along the base. This will trim any excess and make sure the jig fits your particular saw perfectly.

, Mark the line you want to cut on the back side of the piece of wood: this will keep the front of the wood from splintering., Align the cutting jig with the line you just marked. Clamp the jig to the wood.

Place the ""good side"" of the wood face-down. Circular saws cut clockwise, which means that most of the splintering happens on the side of the wood facing the blade., Pushing the saw away from you, move the saw steadily and slowly along the jig. You should have a straight cut!"

Know that rods are better for ‘honing’ the edges of knives.,
Hold the rod by the handle, so that the rod’s tip is on the counter.,
Find your bevel angle.,
Swipe the knife’s edge along the rod.,
Switch sides so that you hone both sides of the knife.",How to Sharpen a Pocket Knife2," Rods are also known as sharpening steel. While rods will, in a sense, sharpen your knives, what are really doing with a rod is honing the blade--with the same result as sharpening your knife on a stone.There are several kinds of rods. The most common is the steel honing rod, which is also known as sharpening steel. It is a very effective and reliable way to sharpen your knife. Rods can also be made out of ceramic and diamond. Both of these materials are reliable because they are two of the hardest materials in existence. Diamond rods are known to create smoother blades, but both will sharpen knives very quickly., To be safe, place the tip on an old tea towel on top of your chopping block or cutting board (so that you don’t leave gashes in your counter tops.) The rod should be held straight up and down so that it is perfectly vertical.

, You must again determine the angle at which you should hold the blade against the rod. Pocket knives should generally be held at a 25 to 30 degree angle.


Go to your local knife shop or hardware store and ask them to determine the angle of your knife if you don’t feel confident that you have the right angle.

, You should swipe slowly and use a light touch--do not push the knife against the rod with a lot of pressure. Move the knife from heel to tip as you swipe it down along the rod., If your knife is relatively sharp, you should only have to swipe the knife along the rod a couple of times on each side. If your knife is very dull, you will have to swipe the knife several more times.

Assemble your supplies.,
Find a sturdy surface for mat cutting.,
Use only white, pebble surface mat board.,
Utilize the perfect edges on the sheet of new mat board.

,
Cut the piece you will need from the top right or left corner.,
Chose any brand or grade of utility knife.,
Keep in mind to always protect the piece you will be using for your mat.,
When you have finished, take the test the piece of mat board to be sure it fits into your frame.,
Place your art work on the mat and visually align it in the center.,
Use a ruler and measure in from the outside edges of your mat.,
Set your art aside.,
Cut the corners first.,
To cut the mat sides, repeat the steps described above.,
Use sandpaper on rough spots.,

Fold the mat and backing closed and tape from side to side on the outside to reinforce the hinge.

,
Place your art on the backing.,
Set the matted piece into the frame and check to see that there is nothing between the glass and the art, such as eraser crumbs, lint or fuzz.",How to Cut a Mat Using a Utility Knife,"  Have close at hand your art work that is to be matted, mat board, cardboard or foam core board for backing, a pencil, eraser, a metal ruler or one with a metal edge, a small piece of fine grain sandpaper or an emery board, and tape.;
, Be sure it is larger than the mat you will be cutting and protect it with stiff cardboard. The hard, compressed type of cardboard on the backs of pads of art paper are sturdy and hard to penetrate with knife cuts. Join one or more together with tape to create a larger piece, if necessary.

, Crescent brand can be found in the vertical bins at the craft store, near the frame department.

,,  Measure the inside of the frame you will be using and, in pencil, lightly mark the cuts to be done on the mat board to that size.

, Be sure the blade is new and perfectly sharp. For many types, you will need a screw driver to open the handle to position a new blade.

, If you should make a bad cut, the important part is saved. Align the ruler at your pencil mark and hold it securely against the board with enough pressure to keep it from slipping as you run the knife against it. All of the cuts you will be making will be done slowly, and with a light hand. The hand holding the knife should be relaxed and the knife held loosely. At first, your cut will barely penetrate the mat board. On the second and successive cuts the knife it will fall into the groove you established with the first cut. It will take two more light cuts, to be completely through the board. Turn the board and cut the second side. You might have to approach the table from a different direction in order to keep the proper position for cutting, with the knife cutting away from the good part of the mat, into the center or what will become the opening of the mat., If you have measured correctly, it should drop easily into place and be a perfect fit. Make adjustments at this point if necessary., Mats generally have at least a few inches of white showing around the art piece. If there is less that, find a larger frame., Determine how many inches on all sides you will need to have the hole in the mat be slightly smaller than the art piece. If there is a difference, traditionally, the bottom edge can be slightly larger. Write those four numbers on a piece of scrap paper for ready reference as you work.

, Measure in from the four outside edges of your mat and make a series of tiny, elongated dots in pencil, plotting the shape of the cuts for the interior of the mat or mat opening., Place the knife on the mat board with the point of the knife exactly aligned with the top corner of the mat and press hard, straight down, to pierce the board. Turn the work and repeat on the second side of the corner. Creating these ""L"" shapes at each corner will insure perfect corners in your finished mat. These corner cuts in the board will also be starting and stopping points for your side cuts.

, Always cut away from the important part. In this case have your ruler on the mat side and cut toward the center. Use three light cuts to get through the board. Don't attempt to tug or pull the center away. Keep cutting light strokes with the ruler until the center comes away and drops out., Sand in one direction inward from outside, or good side of your mat. Don't try to rub, tear or pull any imperfections. Use slow and methodical strokes of sandpaper or emery board.

, Use a pink eraser, an art gum or kneaded eraser. The ""pebbled"" surface of the mat board makes erasures invisible.

, This can be lighter weight and cheaper cardboard or a piece of foam core board. Make it slightly smaller than the mat's outside dimensions. Align the top edge of the backing with that of the mat and tape the two edges with a continuous strip of tape to form a hinge at the top.

,, Check to see it is aligned perfectly by closing the mat. Open again, and tape the art at intervals with two inch pieces of tape. Strive for neatness and cut, rather than tear these small pieces of tape.

,  Erase again, because new pencil marks will show up now. Check to see if you have signed your work and that the signature is showing. If you cleaned the glass, be sure it is completely dry before closing up the matted art in the frame.

Consider whether you need them first.,
Take care not to confuse pinking shears with scalloped edged scissors used for paper-craft.,
Look in a dressmaker's supply store for pinking shears.,
Select a good weight for the pinking shears.,
Take care of your pinking shears.",How to Choose Pinking Shears," Pinking shears aren't an essential tool in the sewing basket but they are a nice one to have. Besides creating non-fray edges for both stored and used fabrics, and seamed edges for sewn items, they make great edgings for easy jam jar lid covers and other crafty items, as well as making cute edges to craft projects that benefit from a naive art touch, such as small cushions and sachets. On the downside, a good pair will cost at least U$20.00, so if they are something you won't use all that often, so weigh up whether you want to own or a pair or whether you can borrow those of a friend or neighbor.;
, There are a lot of these available but they're absolutely no good for fabric because they're only made to cut paper. By all means have some for your paper-craft but don't mix them up.

, Things to look for include:


Quality manufacture
Trustworthy brand name

Stainless steel blades; lower blade extends for better control
Molded handles fit neatly and are strong (usually plastic; check it's quality plastic)

Ambidextrous (either left or right hand); if not, be sure they are the correct hand for your needs
Ability to try them in the store to see how they handle and feel.

, Pinking shears come in lighter and heavier weights. The need will be dictated by the type of fabric you're cutting but lightweight are probably easiest for most people to work with.

, Oil them periodically and have their edges professionally sharpened to ensure that they stay in the best condition.


You'll know that pinking shears are due for a sharpening when they stop cutting the fabric sharply but start either not cutting or are destroying the fabric.

",How to Drill a Hole in a Seashell (Without a Drill)," Take the following things into account:


Thickness: a thin shell may crack more easily, but a thicker shell is more difficult and takes longer.
Size: a large shell is easier to work with, but make sure you have the right size for your project.
Layers: some shells have layers that can crack off leaving a prettier layer underneath.;
, Make sure you have room for size of hole you want. Remember the closer to the edge the easier to crack.

,, Be careful.

,, Continue twisting vigorously until you reach the other side of the shell, twist for 5 more seconds then stop.

Soak the pot overnight.,
Use masonry drill bits.,
Place a piece of tape over the surface.,
Start small.,
Drill slowly.,
Increase the size gradually.,
Clean up.",How to Drill a Clay Pot1," Place the clay pot in a large bucket and cover it with water. Allow the unglazed clay to soak in the water for at least one hour, leaving it there overnight for best results.Thoroughly saturated terra cotta clay is easier to drill through. Water acts as both a lubricant and a cooling agent, which makes it easier for the drill bit to work its way through without causing damage to the clay or overheating.
When you are ready to drill through the clay pot, remove it from the water and allow any excess puddles of water to drip off the surface you'll be drilling through.;
, Carbide masonry drill bits should drill through unglazed, natural clay pots without much difficulty or damage.


The drill bit size and number of drill bits you'll need will vary based on the size of the hole you want to create. If you want to create a simple drainage hole, you'll probably want at least one 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) masonry drill bit.
To minimize the risk of cracking the pot, it's best if you use multiple drill bits when creating holes larger than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm). Start with a 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) drill bit and gradually work your way up in size until you reach the final desired hole diameter.

, Place at least one strip of painter's tape or masking tape directly over the spot you plan to drill through.


The tape can help prevent the drill bit from slipping as you work through the surface of the pot. It is not always necessary with soft, unglazed clay, but it can still help.
Multiple layers of tape will work even better than a single layer. This provides even greater traction and may help ensure that the tape will stick on the pot, even in spite of the moisture.

, If you're working with multiple drill bit sizes, start with the 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) bit.


If you only plan to use a single size, attach that drill bit to the drill now.Use a cordless drill with variable speed for the greatest amount of control.

, Bring the drill bit to the center of the spot you wish to drill through and turn on the drill. Work the drill through that spot at a slow, steady pace, applying as little pressure as possible.


Essentially, the only pressure you apply should be to help keep the drill steady. Allow the drill to do the work of actually drilling through the pot.
Working too quickly or with too much pressure could cause the pot to crack apart.
If you are drilling through a surface that is thicker than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm), you may want to pause and clean the debris away from the hole as you work. Doing so can help keep the drill bit cooler.Peel the tape away after drilling your initial hole. You may even pause to peel the tape away as soon as you first break through the surface, but doing so is not strictly necessary.
You shouldn't have a problem with the drill overheating if the pot has been well saturated, but if the drill bit does begin to smoke, you will need to dip the pot back into water for a few minutes to cool down the surface.
If you have a cordless, battery operated drill, you may even be able to touch the tip of the bit to water to help cool it, as well. Do not do this if you're using an electric cord drill, though.

, After drilling a small hole through the pot, change your drill bit for one that is 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) larger. Drill into the center of your previous hole using this new bit.


In this manner, you can slowly enlarge the hole while putting less strain on the clay.
Work as you did before, applying light pressure and drilling slowly.
Continue working through your various drill bit sizes in similar intervals until you reach the final desired size.

, Use a damp rag to clean off any dust and debris from the surface of the pot.


Inspect the pot to make sure that there are no deep cracks or chips.
This step completes the process.

Use glass and tile drill bits.,
Place tape over the pot.,
Choose a small drill bit.,
Keep the pot wet.,
Work slowly.,
Increase the drill bit size as needed.,
Clean things up.",How to Drill a Clay Pot2," Glazed clay pots are a little trickier to drill into than their unglazed counterparts, but it can usually be done using glass and tile drill bits.These drill bits have a spear point head, which allows then to cut into hard, brittle surfaces with less pressure. If you were to use a standard masonry drill bit, you would need to apply too much pressure to break through the hard glaze, and the pot would likely crack apart.
The drill bit size should match the diameter of the desired hole. If you want to create a standard drainage hole in a medium sized pot, a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) drill bit should work well enough.
It isn't strictly necessary, but you might also want to consider using multiple sizes to further reduce the risk of causing breaks in the clay. Start with a 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) drill bit and gradually work your way up through larger sizes until you reach the final desired size.

, Place one to four strips of painter's tape or masking tape directly over the spot you plan to drill a hole into.


The use of tape is especially helpful with glazed clay surfaces, which tend to be somewhat slippery. This tape gives the surface just enough traction to help prevent the drill bit from slipping as you start drilling.
One layer of tape should be enough in most cases, but multiple layers of tape will provide greater traction and are less likely to peel away during the process.

, If you do decide to work with several drill bit sizes, you should start with the 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) bit.


On the other hand, if you decide to use only one drill bit, simply attach that drill bit to your drill now.
A cordless drill with variable speed is strongly recommended. This will offer you the most control while drilling, and the fact that the drill is cordless makes it safer to use around water than a corded drill.

, Moisten the surface you'll be drilling through with water. Try to keep that surface consistently wet throughout the entire drilling procedure.If you're drilling into a recessed bottom, you can pour a small amount of water over the indented portion of the pot and work with that.
When you're drilling into a flat surface, it helps to have a continual dribble of water pouring over it from a garden hose or faucet.
The water acts as a lubricant, allowing the drill bit to work through the clay with greater ease and less pressure. It also acts as a cooling agent, which can prevent the drill from overheating.
Clay pots with very thin glaze may not need any water, but applying water to the surface as you drill still won't hurt.

, Position the drill bit over the spot you wish to drill through and turn on the drill. Use very light pressure and work through the surface at a slow, even pace.


The pressure you apply should be just enough to keep the drill steady. You should let the drill do the actual work of drilling through the pot instead of trying to force it through faster. This is especially important once you are nearly through to the other side of the pot, where the clay will be weaker.
Working too quickly will probably cause the clay to break.
When drilling through a clay surface thicker than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm), consider pausing in the middle of the drilling process and brushing away any chips or other debris. This can help prevent the drill bit and drill from overheating.
Once the drill bit breaks through the surface of the pot, you can pause your drilling and peel the tape away. If you don't wish to pause, though, you should at least peel the tape away after you finish drilling this first small hole.

, Once you've drilled a small hole into the pot, switch the drill bit for one that is 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) larger. Using this drill bit, drill through the hole you just created.


Center this drill bit over the center of the hole as you drill through it. This is a fairly safe way to slowly enlarge the hole.
As before, drill slowly and apply little to no pressure.
Work through the remainder of your drill bits in this manner, upgrading by about 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) each time, until you reach the final desired size.

, Wipe away any dust and debris using a damp rag, then inspect the area around the hole. Make sure that there are no deep cracks, chips, or other signs of damage.


This step completes the process.

Obtain a suitable drill to use for the project.,
Locate the place where you need to drill your hole.,
Use a center punch where it is practical to dimple the material you are going to drill.,
Try drilling a pilot hole with a small diameter bit.,
Attach a guide jig to the surface if the pilot bit doesn't bite and begin cutting without slipping.,
Use a drill press to drill precise holes if you have one available.,
Practice the technique you select on scrap stock or material if you need precise results, and remember, working slowly and supporting the material will make your job easier.

",How to Drill a Hole on Curved Surfaces," Metal cutting bits are generally acceptable for metals, and will work for other materials such as wood and plastic, but ceramics, glass, and concrete require special bits to produce good results. Here are some bits to consider:


High speed steel bits are good for most non-abrasive materials that are hard enough for the bit to bite. This includes steel, aluminum, brass, and other common metals. They will also suffice for drilling wood, but are not as likely to give good results if splintering or splitting is a problem.
Spade bits are suitable for wood, and give a fast, accurate cut, but can also cause splintering if the drill is allowed to wobble, or if too much pressure is applied.
Titanium coated high speed bits are preferred for drilling hardened steel, stainless steel, and cast iron, as they can handle higher temperatures resulting from cutting these materials.
Forstner bits give excellent results when drilling wood.
Auger bits give fast results with some splintering when drilling wood.
Carbide/Tungsten Carbide bits will drill through concrete and other hard aggregate as well as most stone materials. These can be difficult to start accurately, and also may require a percussion type drill like a rotary hammer or hammer drill to operate efficiently.
Diamond embedded bits and hole saw type drill bits are suitable for hard ceramics and glass, but these material may shatter if good technique is not used.;
, Measuring the distance between holes for multiple holes, aligning the hole with other members, and other factors should be considered when marking the hole.

, This is especially valuable when drilling a curved piece of metal, such as through a round metal rod or a section of tubing. You can also use a punch to dimple wood, and even ceramic tile if you are careful.

, If you are successful in drilling the hole without the bit slipping, and are satisfied with the results, step up to larger bits until you have a sufficiently large hole for your purpose.

, This can be done by clamping a piece of material on the sides of the stock being drilled to keep the drill in place when operating it.

, Ideally, if you can get access to one, a drill press with a V block or vise makes drilling accurate holes much simpler.

Measure the diameter of the hole you need to cut.,
Purchase the correct size tile hole saw.,
Make a small indentation in the tile.,
Secure the tile to a flat work surface.,
Begin drilling the hole in the tile.,
Keep the hole saw wet as it drills.,
Install the tile as usual.",How to Drill a Hole in Tile Using a Tile Hole Saw," The best way to do this is by placing the pipe, faucet, or other fixture directly onto the tile and tracing its outline using a wax pencil. If this is not possible, you can measure the diameter of the fixture using a tape measure. Note that your cut will likely not need to be perfect, as the trim ring of the fixture will cover the cut edges of the tile.;
, A hole saw is a circular cutting tool designed as a drill bit; hole saws are fitted into your electric drill's chuck just like any other bit. Hole saws made for cutting tile are coated with a carbide grinding surface and can be purchased at most home improvement stores. If you only need 1 size, match the diameter of the hole saw to your measurement. Otherwise, consider investing in a complete set of tile hole saws.

, Drill bits, including hole saws, tend to slip very easily on a smooth ceramic tile. To avoid this, you'll need to make a small indentation in the center of your circle for the drill bit to fit into. The easiest way to do this is by positioning a nail set onto the tile and tapping it gently with a hammer.

, To prevent the tile from spinning or slipping while you drill, you'll need to secure it. This can be done by either placing it on top of a nonslip material like rubber or neoprene, or by clamping it gently to your work surface.

, Fit your drill with the appropriately sized tile hole saw, and position the hole saw over the outline you drew in wax pencil. Run the drill and apply steady downward pressure as the cut is made. Note that stone tiles will require much more time and effort to cut through than ceramic tiles.

, Tile hole saws must be water-cooled when in use; overheating can quickly lead to breakage in the tile and will reduce the overall life of your tool. You can purchase water rings for your hole saw, which are rubber rings that adhere to your tile and allow you to keep the hole saw surrounded by a pool of water. Two other options are continuously spraying the bit with a spray bottle of cold water, and slowly pouring water from a pitcher onto the bit when in use.

, After the hole saw cuts all the way through the tile, stop running the drill and gently lift the bit out of the hole. The tile can now be installed just as you would any other tile.

, The blade has a free rotation, and you must lock the spindle in order to remove the bolt. You can do this by locating the hole in the spindle which will lock the rotation., Check to make sure the spindle is locked and there is no rotation., To determine the direction to loosen the spindle nut, the spindle washer, located underneath the nut, will indicate the tightening direction. In this case, the direction to tighten is counter clock wise, so to loosen we will go clockwise., This is done by the control lever on the head of the ratchet.

Switch ratchet to opposite mode (counter clockwise) to tighten the nut.

Engage the ratcheting mechanism if needed.",How to Change a Drill Bit1," The chuck is piece on the end of the drill that loosens and tightens to hold the bit. Grasp the chuck with one hand while you hold the handle of the drill with your other hand. Twist the chuck counterclockwise to loosen it. Another option is to pull the trigger gently while holding the chuck.








Loosening the chuck will open the jaws that clamp onto the drill bit.;
, Once you loosen the chuck, the drill bit that you currently have in the drill will start to wobble. You should be able to easily pull it out of the drill once the jaws that clamp it to the drill are loose.








Always inspect the bit when you remove. If it looks damaged or worn, throw it out so you don't accidentally use it again later.

, Hold the bit with your thumb and index finger so that the smooth part of the bit (the shank) is facing the jaws of the chuck. Insert the bit into the chuck and immediately pull it back towards you about a centimeter.








Keep your fingers on the bit and the chuck since the bit isn't secured and could fall out.

, Tighten the bit into place by giving the trigger a few short squeezes. Your other hand should still be loosely holding the bit in place while you do this.








Lightly holding the bit while squeezing will ensure that the bit is installed straight.

, If your drill has a ratcheting mechanism to apply extra pressure to the shank of a drill bit, you'll need to click it into place. To engage it, firmly twist the ratcheting mechanism next to the chuck in a clockwise motion."

Tap the Allen wrench with a mallet.,
Remove the chuck by hand.,
Replace thread-locking fluid on the screw (recommended).,
Mount the new chuck.",How to Change a Drill Chuck1," Loosen the jaws of the chuck to their widest extent. On most keyless chucks, you'll see a screw at the base of the chuck, fastening it to the drill case. Insert a screwdriver of appropriate size and turn clockwise to remove the reverse-threaded screw. The screw is usually coated with thread-locking fluid, so this may require some force.









Skip this step if your model does not have a screw.
If the screw is completely stuck, follow the steps below to knock the screw loose, then remove the screw and repeat the steps below.;
, Choose the largest Allen wrench you can insert. Turn the Allen wrench to tighten the chuck, until it is held firmly in place.








, This will reduce resistance from the gears to a minimum.







, Position the drill so the Allen wrench lies horizontal and overhangs your workbench. Give the end of the Allen wrench a sharp downward strike with a wooden or rubber mallet.Most drill chucks have a standard thread, so striking the Allen wrench in a counterclockwise direction should loosen the chuck from the drill. If you'd like to be certain, contact the manufacturer and ask whether your model is standard or reverse threaded onto the drill spindle.









This can bend or crack the drill casing if the strike is too forceful or at an angle. Start with light force and increase if necessary. This is especially important if you are just trying to loosen a stuck screw.

, Once the chuck is loosened from the drill casing, you can unscrew it by hand.








, Once you are ready to install a new chuck, dab a bit of thread-locking fluid onto the end of the screw. Roll it on your finger to spread the fluid evenly.If your keyless chuck has no screw, you may need to use thread-locking fluid on the threads of the chuck where it screws onto the drill.

, You can use the same tools to install a new chuck, or to replace the original chuck after cleaning:








Thread the base of the chuck onto the spindle.
Open the chuck.
Insert the Allen wrench and tighten by hand.
Insert the screw and tighten by turning counterclockwise.

Find a used plastic container used for washing machine detergent.,
Mark a slanted line near the bottom of the handle and across to the handle's top but on the opposite side of the bottle (see image).,
Carefully cut along the line.,
Get rid of the cap––you can pop it off with a screwdriver, saw it off or wrench it out using a vise.,
Discard the bottom of the container, or alternatively it can be used as a holder for other things.,
To eliminate sharp edges, run the heat gun along all the cut surfaces until the plastic softens and rounds itself out.,
Punch or drill a hole at the non-cap end of the bottle, which now finishes just after the end of the handle.,
Drill a hole in the workbench where you consider it will be convenient to hang the drill holder and supplement the screw with a washer to avoid tearing.,
Attach the drill holder.,
Try it out.",How to Make a Holder for an Electric Drill," Wash the container. Then use a hot air blower or a hair dryer to help peel off any labels still on it. Set it at a low level of heat, to avoid burning your skin or melting the container.


Choose the container that looks like a jar, the type which has an oval hole made for ease of handling.





;
, Cover this line with painter's tape. The barely visible seams that join together the two sides of the container will help you stick the tape symmetrically.

, Move the cutter with a sawing motion to avoid getting stuck.


Wear gloves to protect your hands while cutting and keep a steady hand.







, Hold the cap tightly in the vise until it cracks loose. You may have to move the bottle around a little to achieve this.


Again, be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands.

, For instance, mount it on a board in the same manner as in Part #3 for the holster below and it can hold the light that often comes with cordless drill/driver sets.

, This will avoid sliced hands while using the holster/container. DO NOT OVERHEAT as this will melt/warp the holster.


Wear gloves to protect your hands while heating and do not touch the plastic until cooled.

, Cut or poke a screwdriver/awl through this hole in a central position, making it about 2 to 3cm/1-1.5"" down from the new rim of the bottle. See the image for guidance. The drill holder is now completed and all you need to do is attach it somewhere convenient on your workbench.


Rotate the screwdriver or awl to get a neat hole.

,


You could also drill a hole for the chuck key, if desired. This will keep it handy and secure.







, Use a screw with a washer––the washer will prevent tearing of the plastic when the weight of the drill is added inside.


The screw and washer must be sturdy enough to withstand normal use.

, Use the holder to store the plugged-in drill. When you're finished, unplug and wind the flex around the drill. Done!

Insert the chuck key.,
Turn the chuck key counterclockwise.,
Remove the bit.,
Insert a bit.,
Tighten the chuck.",How to Change a Drill Bit2," If your drill came with a chuck key, you'll need to use this in order to loosen the chuck. The end of the drill key will look like a cog that has teeth. To insert the chuck key, line up the teeth so that they match the teeth on the chuck and insert the tip into one of the holes on the side of the chuck.


Many drills that use a chuck key have a secure place on the drill where you can store the key.
Typically you’ll see a key chuck on a power drill rather than a cordless model.

, As you turn the key, the jaws on the chuck will begin to open. Continue turning until the chuck opens enough to easily slide the drill bit out.









The jaws are the three or four pieces in the mouth of the chuck that extend to hold the bit in place.

, Pull the bit out using your thumb and index finger once the chuck is loosened. If the chuck is opened wide and you turn the drill face down, it may just fall out.


Inspect the bit once you've removed it. Check for damage or worn areas. If the bit is dull, you should replace it. If it's bent or shows signs of cracking, throw it out so you won't mistakenly use it again.

, While the jaw on the chuck are open wide, insert your new bit. Hold the bit with your thumb and index finger so that the smooth part of the bit (the shank) is facing the jaws of the chuck and insert it.Keep your fingers on the bit and the chuck since the bit isn't secured and could fall out.

, While holding the bit in place with one hand, turn the chuck key clockwise to tighten the chuck's jaws with your other hand. Make sure to tighten it firmly so that the bit is secured. Remove the chuck key.Remove your hand from the bit and turn on the drill to test it before using it.

Insert a hex socket into the chuck.,
Set the drill out of gear.,
Spin the hex socket in reverse with your impact wrench.,
Unscrew by hand.",How to Change a Drill Chuck2," If the method above failed to loosen your chuck, an impact wrench can provide more force. Insert a hex socket into the center of your chuck and tighten the chuck to hold it in place.If there is a screw in the center of your chuck, unscrew it first with a clockwise turn.
This method may have a higher risk of damaging your chuck or drill.

, Set the drill's gearbox to the locked position, neither forward nor reverse.

, Place the impact wrench onto the hex socket and set it to reverse. Engage the impact wrench in short bursts until the chuck loosens off the drill.

, You can now remove the chuck the rest of the way by hand.

Measure the diameter of the spindle.,
Buy a chuck removal wedge.,
Insert the wedge between the chuck and the drill.,
Hammer the wedge in.,
Insert a new tapered chuck.,
Remove the entire spindle.",How to Change a Drill Chuck3," Keyed drill chucks do not typically thread onto the drill. Instead, the chuck's tapered end inserts onto a matching spindle.Look at the gap between the chuck base and the drill, and you should see this spindle. Measure its diameter.

, This is a cheap, two-armed wedge. Choose one with a gap between the two arms larger than the spindle diameter, but as close to it in size as possible.


If you're in a hurry, skip to the end of this section for another method.

, Position the two arms of the wedge around the spindle in this gap.

, Hammer the thick end of the wedge until the chuck pops off the drill.

, Clean and degrease the tapered portions of the spindle and chuck. Place the chuck on the spindle and retract its jaws completely. Place a thin piece of wood over the chuck nose to protect it, then tap the chuck nose with a mallet until it fits securely onto the spindle., If you do not want to go out and buy a wedge, it may be possible to remove the whole spindle instead. This will only work if the chuck has an open center, allowing you to access the spindle beneath. Here's how to do it:Open the chuck all the way.
Place the chuck above a pair of vise jaws, with the spindle hanging loose beneath it.
Place a metal punch through the center hole.
Hammer the metal punch until the spindle comes off the drill.

Determine the damage to your tool.,
Make sure that the drill is disconnected from any power source.,
Remove the terminal wires from the switch after you have determined the problem with the tool is in the power cord.,
Remove the clamp that secures the power cord to the drill motor housing (this is a stress relief clamp that protects the internal connection).

,
Pull the cord out of the drill housing, and remove the factor boot, or cord protector from it.,
Find a replacement power cord for the drill.,
Strip the insulation jacket off of about 3 to 5 inches (7.5-12.5cm) of the replacement cord, then strip the conductor insulation back about 3/4 inch (2cm), being careful not to nick or damage the wire strands.

,Slide the cord boot onto the new cord, letting it slip down several inches from the stripped insulation jacket.,
Insert the wires into the holes (or clamp them onto the terminals) where the old ones were removed, making sure the same colored wires go on the same terminals.,
Re-install the cord clamp and tighten it securely, then slip the cord boot into its slot.,
Test the drill to make sure it runs.",How to Repair a Drill Power Cord," The tool in the illustrations has damage caused by misuse or poor tool maintenance, but the problem isn't always this obvious. You can take the following steps to try to determine where the problem is with your drill:


Make sure the drill is plugged into a receptacle that has the correct voltage. You might plug a similar tool into the same receptacle to test the power, and if the alternate tool works, you can continue.
Inspect the tool and its power cord. Most drills are double insulated, so if you see burnt connectors on the plug, or one is missing, you can assume that this might be causing the problem. Look for damaged insulation or other signs of a problem as well.
Smell the drill's motor where the vents are visible. If the internal parts have overheated, there will be a distinct odor of burnt plastic.
Hold the trigger in the ""on"" position and tap the drill lightly, making sure the chuck is in a safe position. Loose wires and bad brushes sometimes will allow the drill to run intermittently when you tap the drill.;
, Remove the drill's switch cover so you can test the wires and motor after you have completed the previous steps. If you have already determined the cord is damaged, you can probably skip the testing steps and proceed with repairs.


Test the drill's power cord for continuity with an ohmmeter to determine if the conductors are broken. This can be done by connecting the test leads to the prong on each side and the terminal at the drill's switch.
If you read continuity on each wire, you can test the switch itself. Squeeze the trigger while contacting the terminals on each side to see if the circuit through the switch is making a connection.

, Many drills (and other tools) have screw type connections at the switch; these are removed by simply loosening the screws and removing the wires. For stabbed in connections, you might insert a small diameter sharp instrument next to the wire to depress the locking tag that secures the wire, then pull the wire free from the connector.

,, If the power cord has obvious damage near the drill, you may be able to cut the damaged section from the cord and reuse it, although it will be substantially shorter than when it was new.

, If your drill is double insulated, you need to replace the cord with a two-wire cord the same size as the original; if it is grounded, use a three-wire, three pronged cord for a replacement. Do not use a two wire cord for a grounded tool.

,,, Tighten the clamps/screws tightly if applicable., Replace the drill switch cover, tightening all of its fasteners snugly.

, If it fails to operate, you may find you need to replace the switch or the brushes, but otherwise, you will need to replace the drill.

Add the areas together to find the total square footage of the room.",How to Calculate Square Footage of a Room," When calculating square footage of a room, you need to make sure that you can access enough space along your walls to measure the length of that wall without any obstructions.


Since some of the measurements will also need to be taken from the middle of the room, you may also need to move some items out from the middle. You could empty out the entire room to prevent any obstructions from getting in the way, but this is more work than you need to do. Instead, temporarily remove items from the middle of the room on an “as needed” basis to avoid putting in more effort than necessary.;
, If your room is a giant rectangle, then you do not need to split it into parts. For rooms with a more complex shape, however, you should divide the space into simplified shapes. Split it into separate rectangles, squares, triangles, and circles or semi-circles.







, If you need to maintain a visual guide of your room and its measurements as you work, you can sketch a rough blueprint of the room onto paper.









If you do not have paper handy or would rather see a visual map within the room itself, you could separate the sections off by laying flat yardsticks or painter's tape along the invisible edges.

, Measure the length of each wall as well as the length of each invisible dividing line in your room. To keep matters simple, separate the space into its sections as you measure instead of writing the entire length of each wall down as one measurement.









After taking your initial measurements, you should re-measure each edge again to verify that your original measurements are correct. This extra step can save your project if your initial measurements were off.
To simplify matters, the lengths of each edge are usually rounded off to the nearest foot or half foot.

, Use the basic area formulas for rectangles, triangles, and circles or semi-circles to find the area of each individual section.








Calculate the area of a rectangular section with A = L * W (length times width).
Calculate the area of a triangular section with A = 1/2 * B * H (1/2 times the base times the height).
Calculate the area of a circular section with A = π * r^2 (pi times the squared value of the radius).
Calculate the area of a semi-circular section with A = 1/2 * (π * r^2) (half the value of pi times the squared value of the radius).

, Once you have the square footage of each individual section, you can find the square footage or surface area of the entire room by adding the footages of each section into a single final measurement.








, As indicated before, the area or square footage of a rectangular section can be found with the formula A = L * W. Use a tape measure or yardstick to find the length and width of your first rectangular section for this equation.









Round your measurements up to the nearest foot or half foot.

, Multiplying the length and width together is all you need to do to find the square footage of this section.









Example: For a rectangular section with a length of 12 feet and a width of 10 feet:

A = L * W = 12 * 10 = 120 sq ft



, If you have other rectangular or square sections of your room, measure and multiply together the length and width of each.








, Add together the square footages for each of individual section to come up with a total square footage for the entire room.









If your room can be divided into sections in other shapes (triangles or semi-circles), save the areas of your rectangular sections and add them to those of the other sections of your room to find the total square footage.

, As indicated before, the area or square footage of a triangular section can be found with the formula A = ½ * B * H. Use a tape measure or yardstick to find the base and height of your first triangular section.









Round your measurements up to the nearest foot or half foot.

, Multiply the base and height measurements together to solve the first part of the equation.









Example: For a triangular section with a base of 10 feet and a height of 9 feet:

A = 1/2 * B * H
B * H = 10 * 9 = 90 sq ft



, Multiply the product of the previous step by 1/2 to find the area or square footage of that section.









Example: For a triangular section with a base of 10 feet and a height of 9 feet:

A = 1/2 * B * H = ½ * 90 = 45 sq ft



, For any other triangular section of the room, measure and multiply together the base and height of the section. Multiply this value by 1/2 to determine the footage of that section.








, Add together the square footages for each of individual section to come up with a total square footage for the entire room.









If your room can be divided into sections in other shapes (rectangles or semi-circles), save the areas of your triangular sections and add them to those of the other sections of your room to find the total square footage.

, As indicated before, the area or square footage of a circular section can be found with the formula A = π*r^2. If finding the area of a semi-circle, that formula becomes A = 1/2 * (π*r^2). Use a tape measure or yardstick to find the radius of your first circular or semi-circular section.









Round your measurement up to the nearest foot or half foot.

, Complete the first part of your equation for area by squaring the radius of your section, or multiply the measurement by itself.









For a circular or semi-circular section with a radius of 5.5 feet:

A = π * r^2
r^2 = 5.5 * 5.5 = 30.25 sq ft



, Complete the area measurement for a circular space simply by multiplying the squared value of the radius by π, 3.14.









For a circular or semi-circular section with a radius of 5.5 feet:

A = π * r^2 = 3.14 * 30.25 = 95 sq ft



, If dealing with a semi-circle instead of a full circle, you will need to complete the area measurement by cutting the previous value in half, or multiplying it by 1/2.









For a semi-circular section with a radius of 5.5 feet:

A = (1/2) * π * r^2 = (1/2) * 95 = 47.5 sq ft



, For any other circular or semi-circular section, measure and square the radius and multiply this value by π (3.14). If the section is semi-circular, cut this area measurement in half.








, Add together the square footages for each of individual section to come up with a total square footage for the entire room.









If your room can be divided into sections in other shapes (triangles or rectangles), save the areas of your circular or semi-circular sections and add them to those of the other sections of your room to find the total square footage.

, Measure the straight edges of each section. For the purpose of this example, consider a room that is divided into three rectangular sections, two triangular sections, and one semi-circular section.









The largest part of the room is a rectangle. Off the top and right sides of this rectangle are smaller rectangular sections extending the full length of the wall without connecting. A triangle connects off the right-side rectangle, spanning the rectangle's length, and a smaller triangle connects to a portion of the top section. A final semi-circular section lies along part of the bottom of the center rectangle in the room.
The large rectangle measures 12 feet by 10 feet.
The smaller top rectangle measures 12 feet by 2 feet.
The smaller right rectangle measures 10 feet by 3 feet.
The larger triangle has a base of 10 feet and a height of 9 feet.
The smaller triangle has a base of 5 feet and a height of 7.5 feet.
The semi-circle has a radius of 5.5 feet.

, Multiply the lengths and widths of each section to find the square footage of each individual section.









Section 1 = 12 * 10 = 120 sq ft
Section 2 = 12 * 2 = 24 sq ft
Section 3 = 10 * 3 = 30 sq ft

, Multiply the base and height of each section together. Find the area of each section by multiplying this value by 1/2.









Section 4 = (1/2) * 10 * 9 = (1/2) * 90 = 45 sq ft
Section 5 = (1/2) * 5 * 7.5 = (1/2) * 37.5 = 18.75 sq ft

, Square the radius of this section and multiply by pi, or 3.14. Multiply this value by 1/2 to find the area of the semi-circle.









Section 6 = (1/2) * π * 5.5 * 5.5 = (1/2) * 3.14 * 30.25 = 95 (rounded up from 94.985) * (1/2) = 47.5 sq ft

, Combine the surface area of the three rectangular sections, two triangular sections, and one semi-circular section. This sum will give you the square footage of the room.









Total square footage = 120 + 24 + 30 + 45 + 18.75 + 47.5 = 285.25 sq ft

Obtain a pair of post hole diggers.,
Select the location for the hole you will dig.,
Determine if there is any possibility of underground utilities being in the area you are digging.,
Begin digging by holding the post hole diggers by the handles, one in each hand, with the handles close together.,
Spread the handles apart to capture the soil in the jaws (between the hole digger's blades), using enough pressure to grasp it securely, then lift the hole diggers out of the hole.,
Swing the hole diggers to the side of your hole, then close the handles back together.,
Repeat the steps above, going deeper with each successive thrust.,
Wet the soil if you encounter very hard material or very sandy, dry material you cannot otherwise extract with a reasonable effort.,
Install your posts.'"",
When using concrete to set the fence posts in place be sure to use proper concrete working techniques to avoid weak fence post anchors.Some contractors prefer to dump dry pre-bagged concrete into the hole and sprinkle with water.,
Use the minimal amount of water to mix concrete for maximum strength.,
For large projects it is more cost effective to make your own concrete mix as opposed to using bagged concrete.,
How deep to dig the hole?,
Why use concrete?",How to Dig Post Holes," This tool is designed specifically for the task, and will enable you to do the job in the least time with minimum effort. There are a few things you need to consider, however, before starting.Check the soil consistency.
Rocky soils are difficult to use post hole diggers in, since a relatively small stone will prevent the cutting edge of the diggers from penetrating the soil. You can use a steel rock bar to loosen the rocks before using the post hole digger.
Very loose, sandy, and dry soils, or otherwise stubborn ground, are hard to remove from the hole, as the clamping action of the jaws is not as effective on these non-cohesive materials. If you have time, start the holes one day, fill them with water and come back to remove the much softened soil the next day.
Measure and mark the location of each fence post.
Post hole diggers have a maximum effective depth of about 3/4 of their handle length, so a five foot pair will dig about 3 1/2 half deep.
Very hard earth like clay is extremely difficult to dig with a manual pair of post hole diggers. A rock bar may work on dry clay.;
, If it is a single hole for a project like installing a flagpole, you can eyeball the location, but for fences and other projects requiring multiple holes, you may want to lay out the locations of you holes more accurately. Using stakes and a string line to guide you, and a long measuring tape to establish your spacing will help for this purpose. Plant the stakes on either end of the line that you want to dig along. Tie the string to one stake, pull taut, and tie to the other stake.The average spacing for posts is eight feet (2.4 m), though depending upon the structure you could space them further apart.

, For fencing around a field on private property, this may not be an issue, since the property owner should be aware of any utility right of ways on his land, but if there is any doubt, call your local utility locating service to be sure.Be sure to call your local utilities at least three days prior to digging to have your utility lines located. Depending upon your location, it may be illegal to begin digging without requesting a utility survey.

, Thrust the blades into the earth so they cut a plug out of the soil (and turf, if there is any present).If the soil or turf resists the digger's blade, you may repeat the downward thrust several times to cut into the soil and break it up. Rotate the diggers when in the ground for better results.
You should penetrate the soil several inches before extracting the soil (dirt) you are removing.

,, This will open the jaws and allow the soil you have extracted to spill out., If roots or other difficult material interfere with your progress, rotate the blades so you attack the obstacle from a different angle until they are cut through. Start narrow and make the hole wider as you go deeper. This will help stabilize the post. Moist soil will hold better than dry soil.

, Allowing the soil to soak up moisture will improve your success and make the job easier., Install the posts, pole, or other item for which you have dug your hole. Use fine gravel tamped down to the bottom six inches (15 cm) and set your post. Plumb the post and install cross bracing on opposite sides to hold the plumb.Plumb it up with a builder's spirit level if desired backfill the hole, and tamp the fill material to stabilize it.







, This would decrease the finished strength of the concrete by as much as 80% as you can not control even mixing or water proportions.

, A damp sand feel to the concrete is enough to complete the chemical reaction to make the concrete hard. Adding more water can help to make the concrete easier to place but will dramatically reduce the finished strength.

, Use 3 parts sharp masonry sand to 1 part type 1 (or type N) concrete for a strong mortar mix or add 2 parts gravel to bulk up each mix.


If you are setting a number of posts, consider renting a portable mixer.

, There is only one hard-and-fast rule when you're digging a fence posthole: Dig a hole for the post that is half as deep as the fence is high., Concrete makes a wooden post rot faster. The wood will rot sooner or later and you will have to dig out the concrete when you replace the post. Instead put a rock/slate into the hole for the post to rest on and fill around it with rocks/gravel and finally sand which you can pound down to keep the post straight."

Plan the layout.,
Cut the plates.,
Mark the plates for studs.",How to Frame a Wall1," Using a chalk line (a cheap tool for marking long, straight lines) and angle measuring tools, mark where the wall will be on the floor. Be sure to note any doors you intend to put in the wall.


Be sure that the wall meets other walls at a 90 degree angle at all four corners. A slight deviation now will lead to a less-secure wall later.
Note whether the joists (floor or ceiling girders) at the top of the room run perpendicular or parallel to your new wall.;
, Choose a strong, pressure-treated wood and cut 2” by 4” boards to twice the length of your wall, then divide those into groups of equal length. These are the plates, or base pieces, that will run just above and beneath the wall to anchor the frame. Make sure to always have two plates at the top.

, Lay the top and bottom plates down next to each other. Measuring every 16” from one end, carefully mark horizontally across both plates until you reach the end. Since the measurements are 16"" on center, you'll need to account for half the thickness and mark an “X” on the right side. These guidelines will help you know where to install studs.

Make a drawing of the floor plan in the room you are measuring.You will use this drawing to record your measurements.,
Measure the length and width of the room’s main area.,
Multiply the length and the width to get the main area’s measurement.,
Measure the length and width of any square or rectangular recesses.,
Calculate the area of any round recesses.,
Add all of the areas together to get the total floor area.",How to Measure a Room1," The drawing does not have to be to scale, but the more accurate it is, the more useful it'll be.


Since you are just measuring floors, including windows and doorways should not matter.
Include all areas involved in your project. For example, if you’re putting in flooring and have a walk-in closet you are also flooring, draw the closet.
In this hypothetical drawing, there is a bathroom on the right (which is a separate room, so it is not drawn) and a bay window to the left (shown with a half circle).;
, To calculate the area of a room, use the standard (Length) x (Width) = Area formula.Measure the maximum length and width at the widest points of the room.This is important and will help you get the correct measurements.


Move any items or furniture in the way of your measuring tape.
Having a friend hold the end of the tape could help.
Right now, you are only measuring the main area. Ignore bay windows and separate areas like bathrooms for this step.

, Use a calculator to ensure this measurement is accurate. For instance, if the room is 12 feet wide and 12 feet long, the area of the floor is 144 square feet. Your result is the measurement of the total floor area. Record this number on your drawing.

, These often include closets or bathrooms that you are part of a flooring or tile project. Measuring square or rectangular recesses is the same as measuring the main area of the room. Measure the width and length of the recess, then multiply the length and width to find the area of the recess.


Write down the result in the recess area of your drawing.
Repeat this step if there are multiple recesses in the room.

, Measure the longest length (usually through the center) and width of the recess.Do not measure further than the edge of the main area you already measured. Next, divide the length by two. Then, multiply this number by the width. Now, multiply the total by pi (3.14). Lastly, divide the area in half.


Record the number in the recess area of your drawing.
Now you have the area of the U-shaped protrusion in the room.
The area in a bay window recess should only be included as part of the area of the room if it has a floor (rather than a seat) and the ceiling is at least seven feet or 2.13 m high.

, Add the areas of all recesses to the main floor area. Now, you have the total square footage of your floor, and you can purchase carpet, flooring, or other materials accordingly.

Plan to sharpen chisels before using.,
Get a sharpening stone.,
Prepare the stone.,
Start with the flat side.,
Use a honing guide to set the bevel angle.,
Hone the bevel.,
Add a micro bevel.,
Strop the chisel.",How to Sharpen Chisels," A set of brand-new chisels won't be sharp enough to do intricate woodworking, so you'll want to sharpen them before you start on a project.They stay sharp for a long time, so plan to sharpen them about once or twice a year unless you use them very frequently.


If the chisels are old or have uneven or damaged bevels, it may be necessary to reshape them using a grinding wheel before sharpening. Hold the bevel of the damaged chisel flat to the grinding wheel to remove large gouges, dirt or rust.





;
, You'll need a stone with three levels - course, medium and fine - to achieve the sharpest edge. Sharpening stones are available at home and garden centers and hardware stores. The stone you choose will come with a lubricant (or recommend one for you to buy separately). There are two main types, both of which are quite effective:


Water stones use water as a lubricant. They are soaked in water for several minutes before use. This is the type of stone favored in Japan.
Oil stones are lubricated with petroleum-based oil before use.

, Get it ready according to the instructions that came with it. For a water stone, you will need to soak it in a water bath. An oil stone should be lubricated with the appropriate type of petroleum oil.

, The flat side of a chisel should be as reflective as a mirror once it's properly sharpened. Start by working it back and forth lengthwise over the course grit on your stone. Use both hands to keep it steady as you slide it back and forth. Your movements should be smooth and steady, rather than jerky. When the entire flat surface shows the intricate scratches of the stone's course grit, do the same thing with the medium grit, and again with the fine.The flat side is finished when it's as reflective as a mirror.


Do not move the chisel from side to side, or rock it back and forth.






Use the entire surface of the stone for a more even finish.Clean the blade and your hands between grits so the powder doesn't obscure your view of the chisel's surface.







, It's possible to sharpen a bevel by freehanding it against the stone, but it's very difficult to make sure you get the exact angle you want without using a honing guide. Fit the chisel into the honing guide and tighten the screws on either side to hold it in place. Depending on the type of chisel you have and what you'll be using it for, you'll want to set the guide to create an angle somewhere between 20 and 35 degrees.


For a paring chisel, set it at 20 degrees.
Standard chisels work well at 25 degrees.
If you don't want to buy a honing guide, it's common to make one out of wood. You'll need to saw a wooden wedge to the angle you want, superglue two strips on either side to act as rails (the chisel rests between these), then screw another strip of wood over the rails so you can tighten the chisel in place., Place the bevel flat against the coarsest grit on the stone. Using both hands to hold the guide, move the chisel back and forth over the stone in a very thin, stretched figure 8 pattern. When you can see the grit's scratches on the bevel, switch to the medium grit, then the fine grit, wiping the blade in between grits.


Use the entire surface of the stone as you sharpen.If you use the same area too much, a hollow will develop there, and it won't sharpen edges as easily from then on.
After honing the bevel, you may notice a slight recess on the flat side. This is called a hollow grind, and in Japan, chisels are sharpened that way on purpose, because it makes it easier to sharpen them the next time., In most cases it's fine to stop after honing, but if you want the chisels to be even sharper, you can add a micro bevel. It's essentially a miniature second bevel created at the tip of the bevel. This is an unnecessary step unless you're doing work that requires extreme precision. To create a micro bevel, adjust the honing guide to an angle 5 degrees tighter than the previous angle you honed, and repeat the honing process using only the finest grit.


You only need to do a few strokes on the finest grit to create a microbevel, since you're taking off so little metal., Some people like to finish with stropping, which gives the chisel a nice polish. Tape a piece of leather to a flat surface and cover it with an even layer of polishing compound. Rub the flat side of the chisel against the compound a few times, then rub the bevel (or microbevel) against it a few times. Wipe the blade when you're finished."

Secure your attachment.,
Make sure that the object you are deburring is locked in place.,
Turn on the deburring tool.,
Place the deburring tool against the edge.,
Go over the area two or three times.To ensure that the edge is completely deburred, it may be necessary to go over it with the deburring tool two or three times.,
Check the edges to ensure all burrs have been removed.",How to Use a Deburring Tool1," After you have selected the appropriate attachment for the job, attach the piece to your deburring tool. You may need to consult your user’s manual to determine how to attach the piece.


Make sure that the attachment is locked securely in place before you switch it on.;
, While some larger objects might stay put on their own, it will be difficult (and unsafe) to deburr a smaller item that is not secured in place. For example, a piece of furniture may not need to be secured, but a piece of wood or a pipe will need to be secured in place.


Try using a vice to secure smaller items and prevent them from moving around as you deburr them.

, Next, pick up your deburring tool and hold it firmly by the handle. Then, switch on your deburring tool when you are ready to use it.


You may want to start out by using the lowest setting and then increase the speed if necessary.

, Hold the tool so that it is right up against the edge you wish to deburr. For example, if you are deburring the edge of a piece of wood, then place the tool right up against the edge.








You do not need to press hard to deburr the item, just ensure that the tool makes contact with the edge of the object you are deburring.

, Start at one end and move all the way to the end, or select a starting point if you are deburring a circular item.








If you are deburring a pipe or other circular area, then you may just have to let the deburring tool rotate two or three times.
If you are deburring an edge, then you will need to drag the tool back and forth across the area two or three times.

, After you have finished deburring the item, remove the tool and turn it off. Then, check the edges of the area you just deburred to ensure that you got all of the larger burrs.If there are still some burrs left, then you can always go over it again.You can also sand the edges of the area you just deburred to ensure that it is nice and smooth. Use a fine grit sandpaper to sand away any minor imperfections.

Secure the bottom plate.,
Attach the top plate.,
Install the studs.,
Install blocking boards.",How to Frame a Wall2," Now that you've marked and measured your plates, lay the bottom plate out along the chalk line that marks where the wall will be. To make a stable wall, you will need to attach this plate to the concrete floor.


Use a powder-actuated tool, also known as a Hilti or Ramset gun, to join the wood and the concrete. Load the tool with a small bullet and nail and then hit the end so that it engages the bullet and shoots the nail through the wood into the concrete.
Once the two outer nails have been put in, follow your guidelines and put a nail in every 16” along the plate, near the center of the board.

, If the ceiling joists run perpendicular to the bottom plate, this is a fairly simple task; if they run parallel, you will need to do a bit more work first.


For parallel joists, attach short lengths of 2” by 4” blocking board perpendicularly between the two closest joists every 16”, and attach the top plate to these.
For perpendicular joists, attach the top plate to the ceiling using the joists. Use a plumb bob (a carefully balanced weight that hangs from a line) to align the plates and double check by measuring to ensure that the top plate is directly above the bottom plate. Then, nail the top plate to the joists or blocking boards at every interval.
As an alternative option, you can build the wall first and then stand it up. This may be an easier option, especially for amateurs.

, Studs are simply extra planks of 2” by 4” wood, or sometimes 2” by 6” for exterior walls, that provide support and definition for drywall and other finish surfaces.


Measure and cut. Each stud board should be cut so that it fits snugly between the top and bottom plates without tilting.
Insert the stud. Slide it end-on between the two plates, right over one of the nails in the bottom plate. Use a plumb bob and a corner to make sure the board is straight and squarely placed.
Affix and repeat. Use a nail gun to insert 3” nails on both sides of both ends firmly at a 45 degree angle through the stud and into the top and bottom plates. Repeat this process until you have installed studs all the way down the frame.

, Blocking boards add a bit of additional structure, and also serve as areas where cabinets, towel bars, or grab bars are hung. They can also serve as fire breaks in case of a house fire. They are made from the same 2” by 4” boards you've used for everything else so far.


Cut your blocking boards so that they will fit snugly between each stud, placing them about 4 feet (1.2 m) up, end-on between each stud. Firmly attach the blocking boards at both ends with 3” nails on both sides, hammered in at an angle of 60 degrees. You can vary the height slightly from block to block to make pushing tacks and nails into the finished wall a bit easier, if you want.

"

Take measurements in the space where the wall will go.,
Cut studs and plates to the appropriate lengths, given your measurements.,
Mark where the studs will go on the top and bottom plate.,
Assemble the frame.,
Fill in blocking boards.,
Raise the wall.,
Shim each section and check for plumb.,
Secure the wall to the beams or joists accordingly.",How to Frame a Wall3," You need to measure the total height of the wall and the width of the wall to be framed using a tape measure. The width will be used to measure the top and bottom frames, and the height will be used to measure the individual studs.


In general, when you're building a wall for a non-basement room, you will build the entire frame on the floor first, and then lift and move it into place before attaching it to joists and beams accordingly. To do this properly, you must know exactly how long each stud has to be to make the wall the correct height.
Buy enough 2 x 4 to fill the space. You'll need one stud the height of the wall every 16 in. along each frame, which will be the width of the wall. You can divide the width by 16 to quickly determine how many studs you'll need, and how much to buy.

, Using a circular saw, cut your plates and studs to match the measurements you took in the previous step. Start by cutting bottom and top plates that correspond to the width measurements you took for the wall to be assembled. Hold them against each other, to make sure every board is flush, and clean them up on the ends if necessary. Then cut the studs of the appropriate height.


Each stud needs to have the width of the bottom and top plate subtracted from the total height of the measurement you took, to account for the added space.

, Use your tape measure and mark along the top and bottom frames using a pencil line where the studs will go. Each stud will get three marks on the bottom plate and three marks on the top plate, marking the center point and the two ends of each stud where it meets the plates. For load-bearing security, a stud needs to be placed every 16 inches (40.6 cm), which needs to be measured very precisely.


Measure your first mark by drawing an ""x"" 16 inches (40.6 cm) from the end of the frame, then subtract 3 3/4"" from that mark and draw a line (at 15 1/4 in.). Use the shorter end of the framing square–the exact width of the 2 x 4–to measure from your line to where the other edge of the stud will fall. In other words, the ""x"" you drew at 16 in. will mark the center point of the stud, and the two lines will mark the sides of the stud. This is necessary to account for the width of the end studs, and that the center of each stud will be equidistant from the next.
To make your next mark, measure 16 in. from the first ""x"" and make another ""x"" to mark where the center of the next stud will be, subtracting and using the square to mark the end points Repeat this process on both the bottom and top plates, making the marks where every stud will be installed.

, Use your studs to lay out the frame of the proper size and shape, laying the boards out on the ground to assemble them.


Start with an end stud. Lay it on end against the top lip of the bottom plate and nail from underneath the bottom plate into the end stud, using 3” nails, square through the bottom plate. Be very sure that the boards are lined up squarely.
Continue attaching all the studs to the bottom plate, centering them using the lines. Using your markings, attach each stud 16” apart all the way to the end with 3” nails.
Attach the top plate. Now that all the studs have been attached to the bottom plate, lay the top plate along the free ends of the studs, and nail through the top plate to attach each stud with 3” nails.

, Blocking boards are 2” by 4” board segments that fit perpendicularly in between the studs, about 4 feet (1.2 m) up from the bottom of the wall. Measure the gap between the studs, cut extra board accordingly, and install them by hammering 3” nails through them into the studs at a 60 degree angle on both ends, securing them firmly into the studs.


Stagger the height of each blocking board so the nails can be used to secure the boards neatly. Line up the top lip of the second blocking board with the bottom lip of the first, then do the opposite with the next, repeating the pattern. This should allow ample space to nail them to each stud.

, With a friend helping you, lift the frame up from the top plate so that the bottom plate remains on the ground. Carefully slide the frame into place, double-checking all angles and be sure everything is properly positioned square.

, Now that you've got your wall placed, check to make sure it's straight and secure, flush against the joists on the subfloor. Shimming is the art of using slender pieces of wood to fill in any gaps between the ceiling and the top of the frame, the account of small human measurement error. You can buy these at most home repair stores, tapping them in from the side where there's a little bit of space.


To check for plumb, check to be sure the current section of wall is perfectly vertical. Use a level to assist you in doing this. Use your hammer to make small adjustments, banging the wall forward or back, if you need to.

, Start by attaching the top plate. Use 3 1/2” light construction nails and nail straight up through the framing at close, regular intervals as you plumb and level.


Attach the bottom plate. Again, use 3 1/2” nails, driving them through the plate into the floor.
Attach the end studs. Hammer 3 1/2” nails all along both end studs to attach them to the framing in the sides of the house.
Double check that the studs have been fastened and are level.

Subtract the area of the skylight from the ceiling area.",How to Measure a Room4," This is described in method one. If the ceiling is flat, by calculating the floor area, you now have your ceiling area as well. For rectangular and square rooms with flat ceilings, the area of the floor is the same as the ceiling’s area.If you have any extra parts of the ceiling that stick out or cave in, continue on to step two.

, This step only applies to ceilings that are not flat. Many ceilings also have alcoves and window bays that stick out; measure the width and depth of any alcoves or window bays.Record all measurements.


A ceiling that slopes or has recesses or variation of any kind will have a larger surface area than the floor, so keep that in mind when buying materials (i.e. buy a little extra).
Ceilings can be difficult to reach. If you are measuring a ceiling, ask a friend for assistance.
You will probably need a ladder to reach the ceiling for measurement.

, Add all additional measurements to the number calculated in step one. Write the total down.

, If you don’t have skylights on the ceiling, skip this step. Ceilings sometimes have skylights, and the area of these must be subtracted from the total ceiling area calculated in step three. Measure the length and width of a skylight to get its area. Then, multiple the length and the width. Now, you have the area of the skylight.

, Subtract the number calculated in step four from the total area of the ceiling. The result of this calculation is the square footage of your ceiling.

Match the deburring attachment with the inner or outer diameter.If you are going to be deburring a pipe, then you may want to use a deburring attachment that will go around the pipe edge or fit inside of the pipe.",How to Use a Deburring Tool2," Deburring tools are available in handheld sizes as well as larger power tool sizes. The size you need will depend on what you need to deburr. Choose the right tool for your job to get the best results.Hand deburring tools are better for small, precise deburring jobs.
Power deburring tools work better for larger jobs.

, There are many different types of deburring tool attachments to choose from.If your deburring tool came with a selection of attachments, then you may want to consult your user’s guide to determine which attachment is the most appropriate for your job.


Some attachments are better for certain materials, such as metal or plastic, while other attachments are better for certain shapes, such as circular items.

, If you have this type of attachment, then match it up with the pipe to see if the diameter is correct.








If you do not have this types of attachment, then you can still deburr the pipe. You will just need to use a different attachment work around the edges of the pipe.

Look at the two working surfaces of the planer, the tables.,
The outfeed table is fixed.

,
The blades should be set fractionally above the outfeed table.

,
This method will allow you to set them both to the same height and parallel to the table.

,
When the blades are a lot too high they will leave a scoop in the end of the timber.,
Set the blades a touch higher than the outfeed table and you will get a positive feel to the cut and this also allows for the blades to wear a bit.

,
To change the planer blades, PULL the power plug out.

,
Take out the old ones and give all the surfaces a good clean and dust, wipe with an oily rag etc.

,
Put the new planer blades back in at a guess for height and nip them up just tight enough to hold them firm, but still allow you to adjust them up and down with the adjusting screws.

,
Set both tables approximately level.

That space is your guide.

,
Adjust the blade and try again until your marks are like the photo above.

,
The pencil marks in the photos are about 15mm apart, this will set the blade about one millimeter higher than the fixed outfeed table.

Choose the appropriate hand plane for your job.,
Sharpen the blade of the plane.,
Adjust the angle of the blade.,
Plane the surface of the wood.,
Avoid tear-out by cutting along the grain of the wood.,
Check the accuracy of your planing.",How to Plane Wood1," Hand planes come in several different varieties. The main defining characteristic of each type of hand plane is size. The longer the body of a plane, the more accurately it will straighten wood, as the length of the body allows the plane to bridge peaks and troughs in the wood's surface. Shorter planes, however, are often easier to control for precise detail work. Below are a few of the most common types of hand plane you'll encounter, listed from longest to shortest:


A jointer plane typically has a body length of 22 inches (56 cm) or longer. These long hand planes are useful for trimming or straightening long pieces of wood, like boards or doors.
A jack plane is slightly shorter than a jointer plane, with a length from 12 to 17 inches (30 to 43 cm). It is more versatile than the jointer plane because of its shorter length and thus can be used to square both long boards and shorter pieces of rough lumber.
A smoothing plane is about 10 inches (25 cm) long and is the most versatile of all hand planes. It can be used for general smoothing and straightening of all projects.
A block plane is the smallest type of plane. This type of plane is too short to effectively straighten long boards, but is ideal for shaving very thin pieces from a surface or working in a tight corner.;
, The blade (also called the iron) of the plane needs to be razor sharp before use - even new planes should be sharpened. To sharpen the blade, first place a piece of 220-grit wet/dry sandpaper on a flat surface. Hold the blade at a 25 or 30 degree angle so that the bevel is flat against the sandpaper. Maintaining this angle, rub the blade around the sandpaper in a circle while applying downward pressure. When a burr (an accumulation of metal shavings) forms along its back, the blade is ready to use. Remove the burr by wiping the back of the blade flat across the sandpaper.

, When it comes to planing wood, the angle of the blade dictates how ""thick"" the shavings you'll take from the surface of the wood will be. If the blade angle is too deep, you can end up jamming the plane or tearing your wood. To adjust the blade angle, turn the depth adjustment wheel, which is the small wheel just behind the blade assembly. Adjust the blade's angle until the tip of the blade protrudes just below the sole of the plane.


It's good policy to start by using a shallow angle, then increasing the depth of the cut if necessary.

, Begin smoothing and flattening your wood by placing the plane at the edge of the surface. As you apply downward pressure on the front knob and press forward with the back handle, push the plane across the surface in a smooth, continuous motion. Work across the surface of your wood methodically, making sure to pay extra attention to any high spots or uneven spots on the surface of the wood.


A level or straight edge can help you find uneven spots in your wood.

, To smooth the surface of the board, you may find that you need to plane in multiple directions. However, always avoid planing directly against the grain. Doing so can cause the blade to ""catch"" under minute, angled imperfections in the surface of the wood. When this happens, the plane can tear small, rough chunks from the wood's surface, rather than shaving the surface uniformly. This is called ""tear-out"".


To fix tear-out, try re-planing the jagged spot along the grain of the wood or sanding it smooth.

, Ideally, after you plane your wood, you'll have a smooth, flat surface that sits flush with any adjacent pieces of wood. Check your wood's flatness and smoothness by laying a straight edge along its surface. The straight edge should sit flush against the face of the wood regardless of its position. If, in any position, your straight edge sits on the wood in a way that leaves gaps underneath it, you'll know that the section of the wood your straight edge is making contact with is a high spot.


A try square can be used to check the angle between two adjacent faces of the wood to ensure they sit at a perfect ninety degree angle.

Select a file size.,
Choose a file shape.,
Determine the degree of coarseness needed.,
Pick the right tooth geometry.,
Check the quality of the file.,
Clean the file.,
Apply chalk, oil, or lard to the file.,
Secure your work.,
File in only one direction.,
Cross file to remove material.,
Straight file for detail work.,
Draw file to finish a surface.",How to File Metal," In general, large files are relatively coarse. They leave a rougher finish, but remove more stock. Conversely, smaller files are finer. They remove less stock, but leave a smoother finish., Use a flat file for general purpose work, a square file for enlarging rectangular holes, and a round file for enlarging round holes. Use a triangular file on acute angles, and a half-round file to smooth curved faces of grooves., A bastard-cut file has the highest degree of coarseness, while a second-cut file has a medium degree of coarseness. A smooth-cut file is the least coarse option., For fast removal of stock, choose a double-cut file. For finishing, use a single-cut file. Choose a rasp-cut for rough cuts of soft materials, and a curved-cut file for automotive body work.Use a double-cut file to file brass, bronze, copper, and tin. These tough metals should be filed with a double-cut file as they are strong enough to withstand the metal and/or alloy.Rasp-cut files can be used for wood as well as lead and aluminum. This file has a series of individual teeth and produces a rough cut., Be sure that the file you choose to use is whole, rather than broken or chipped. Ensure the handle is intact and not loose. Check the teeth to be sure they aren’t broken, and look for rust, which should be removed before using the file.Soak your file in distilled white vinegar overnight to remove the rust. Then wipe off any residue and thoroughly dry the file before using it., There should not be any pins (bits of filed metal) stuck in the teeth. If there are, clean them out with a file card, stiff wire brush, or a piece of skinny wire or sheet metal. You can also use a scrap piece of hardwood to clean your file by pressing the wood against the file and scraping it along the grooves.You should clean your file often while you are working as well. Aim to stop and clean your file every 15 strokes or so to prevent pinning., Liberally rub chalk, or a small amount of lard or general-purpose oil, into the teeth of the file. This makes the file less likely to become clogged with pins in the future, as well as reduces the amount of metal dust when filing, and also protects the file.


You may want to wear gloves when applying chalk, oil, or lard to your file to keep your hands clean.

, It is important to secure your work with a vise or other clamp to keep it from moving around while you are filing. Mount the vise so that the stationary jaw extends slightly beyond the edge of your workbench, and be sure to place bolts in all the holes on the base of the vise and secure them with locking washers. Then, place the workpiece in the vise so that it is supported by the full clamping surface., You don’t want to use a back and forth motion with your file, as this will damage the file and likely your workpiece as well. Instead, only apply pressure on the forward stroke and lift the file away from the workpiece on the return stroke., For heavy cross filing, grab the handle of the file with the dominant hand and place the palm of the other hand on the end of the file. Angle the file diagonally to the work and press down firmly so that the file digs in and cuts the metal. Make long, slow strokes away from your body. Lift the file away from the surface on the return stroke to prevent dulling the file., For straight filing, use a small file rather than a large one. Grab the handle of the file with the dominant hand and place the fingers of the other hand on the end of the file. Point the file away from you and press it down firmly on your workpiece. Make long, slow strokes away from your body, and only file in one direction, rather than back and forth., For draw filing, place your hands on either side of the file with a gap slightly larger than your workpiece. Hold the file horizontally and make long, slow strokes away from your body with a firm pressure. Remember to only apply pressure on the forward stroke, and to remove the file on the backward stroke."

Perform a safety check before turning the grinder on.,
Protect yourself from flying metal sparks.,
Turn the bench grinder on.,
Work the piece of metal.,
Dip the piece in the water pot to cool the metal.",How to Use a Bench Grinder1,"


Make sure the grinder is tightly secured to the bench.
Check that the tool rest is in place on the grinder. The tool rest is where the metal item will rest as you grind it. The rest should be secured in place so there is a 1/8 inch (3 mm) space between it and the grinding wheel.
Clear the area around the grinder of objects and debris. There should be enough space to easily push the piece of metal you are working with back and forth on the grinder.
Fill a pot or bucket with water and place it near the metal grinder so you can cool off any metal that gets too hot while you grind it.;
, Wear safety glasses, steeled toed shoes (or at least no open-toe shoes), ear plugs or muffs and a face mask to protect yourself from grinding dust.

, Stand to the side until the grinder reaches maximum speed.

, Move so you are directly in front of the grinder. Holding the metal tightly in both hands, place it on the tool rest and slowly push it towards the grinder until it touches the edge only. Do not allow the metal to touch the sides of the grinder at any time.

, To cool the metal off after or during grinding, dip it into a bucket or pot of water. Keep your face away from the pot to avoid the steam created by the hot metal hitting the cooler water.

Note that surface planers generally require pieces of wood with one flat surface.,
Set the planer to your desired thickness.,
Optionally, set the depth stop.,
Turn the planer on and pass your wood through.,
Pull up on the wood as it passes the rollers to avoid snipe.,
Use ear, eye, and/or mouth protection as needed.",How to Plane Wood2," Surface planers are mechanical tools that use rollers and an adjustable set of spinning blades to plane a piece of wood to a uniform thickness automatically. Surface planers are a great time-saving tool for experienced woodworkers, but it's important to know that many surface planers only plane the surface of a piece of wood relative to the opposite surface. In other words, if the bottom of the wood isn't perfectly flat, the planer will maintain this imperfection on the top surface. Because of this, you'll want to use your planer for smoothing wood surfaces only if the flatness of the opposite surface is assured.

, All surface planers will somehow allow you to adjust how ""deep"" the wood will be planed. Often, this is via a hand-operated crank that lifts the planer's housing - the higher the housing, the shallower the planer will cut. As with a hand planer, it's wise to initially make shallow cuts. You can always cut more deeply, but you can't ""undue"" what you've already cut.


Often, the ""depth"" of the cut itself isn't displayed on the planer, but the actual thickness that the wood is being planed to. Thus, to plane a 2 inch thick piece of wood by 1/16 inch, you would set the planer to 1 15/16 inch and so on.
Note that most planers shouldn't be set to plane off more than 1/16 or 1/8 inch at a time - doing so is hard on both the wood and the planer.

, Many planers offer the capability to ""lock"" the planer from cutting beneath a certain depth via a mechanism called a depth stop. For instance, if the depth stop is set to 1 inch, the planer will not be able to plane the wood to a thickness less than 1 inch. This is a useful feature to have if you're worried about accidentally over-planing.


If you don't want to use the depth stop, set it to a very low level - one much lower than the thickness of your board - so that you'll never hit this lower limit.

, When your planer is running, carefully feed the wood into the planer in a straight, controlled motion. After the wood is caught by the rollers, it should begin to feed through on its own. Keep in mind that, as with a hand plane, you'll want your planer to cut along the grain of your wood to prevent tear-out. Repeat the planing process as needed until your wood is a desired level of thickness.


You can track your wood's process by scribbling lightly on the surface to be planed with a pencil before planing. As your planer removes high spots in the wood, you'll see the lines of your pencil begin to disappear.

, ""Snipe"" is a condition that surface planers can sometimes produce on a piece of wood. Essentially, the planer's rollers pull upward on the wood, causing slightly deeper cuts at the edges of the wood than in the middle. To counteract this, pull up on the end of your wood as it passes through both the front and back rollers of the planer. In other words, pull up on the ""back"" end of your wood as you feed it into the machine, then pull up on the ""front"" end of the wood as it passes out of the machine.

, Usually, mechanical planers are very loud. Prevent damage to your ears by wearing appropriate ear protection, like ear plugs or earmuffs. Additionally, planers produce lots of airborne dust, so if you don't have equipment in place to vacuum up the dust as it's being created (like a dust collector), you'll want to use eye protection and a surgical mask to protect yourself.

Grind a piece off the metal.,
Cut through a metal piece.,
Shape a metal piece.,
Sharpen a metal blade.",How to Use a Bench Grinder2," Move the metal back and forth across the grinder until the chunk of metal is gone. Holding the metal against the grinder in one place for too long will warm it up, and could damage the piece.

,


Hold the metal on the tool rest and turn it gently until the grinder comes in contact with the spot you want the cut.
Keep turning the piece until it breaks in half. Make sure you hold each end. Dip both hot ends in water when you are done.

,


Touch a piece of metal to the grinder at the spot where you want it to bend. Use a back and forth motion, as you would to grind a part off.
When you see the metal turning orange, it is warm enough to be pulled away from the grinder. Use both hands to bend the metal to the shape you want. Dip it in water once it is the right shape.

,


Rest the piece on the tool rest and hold it securely with both hands.
Slowly push the blade into the grinder, angling it slightly up or down so the grinder cuts metal away to create a pointed, sharp edge. Use the same forward-and-back motion, rubbing the blade across the bench grinder to prevent cutting into the blade or warming it up too much.

These machines are very much entry-level models, being sufficient to get you started, but if you progress much beyond very basic work you will soon find them very limited. Some even come with a stand and incorporate variable speed, but there is a definite correlation here between the price you pay and the quality you get.



 

;
, When you are buying a lathe, there are two capacities you need to consider. The distance between centers determines the maximum length of workpiece you can turn. For general work you will need at least 30in, and preferably 36in.

Incidentally, lathe dimensions are still mainly given in imperial measurements; for metric buffs the equivalents are 760 and 915mm. Longer beds are available, and whilst these may appear attractive, they can add to any vibration problems unless they’re properly braced, so this is one instance where it is better not to buy too much capacity unless you have the specific need for it.





Another useful measurement of size is the ‘swing’ of the lathe. This is the height of the main spindle above the bed and therefore determines the maximum diameter of work you can turn, unless the head rotates round.
For anything remotely approaching serious work, you need a swing of at least 9in (230mm), but in practice the bigger the better.







, A professional turner will probably need a heavy-duty floor-standing lathe, but for the home woodturning enthusiast a bench-mounted model will probably be quite sufficient. These bolt down to any convenient work surface, but this must be really solid. The advantage of mounting it on your own workbench is that you can get the center height just right – a serious consideration if you anticipate doing a lot of turning in the future.





, Several manufacturers provide leg-stands as an optional extra if you don’t want to build a bench. These stands vary from a rather crude folded steel or tube arrangement, to a more rigid affair with provision for a tool shelf.

Bear in mind that the performance of your lathe depends on how well it is mounted, so buy a leg-stand only if it looks man enough for the job.





A homemade wooden bench is often better at absorbing vibration than a crude metal stand, and it can change the whole operation of the lathe.
If you are short of space in the workshop, you can build in a lot of storage for tools or raw materials under the lathe, which also helps to give the structure a bit more mass.







, The bed is made from either heavy metal bars or tubes, but some machines still feature a flat cast bed. This may be quite crude on the cheaper machines, or a work of art on top-of the-range models.











The construction must be strong enough to support both the tail stock and the tool-rest without any flexing, and allow free and easy movement of them both.
It must also permit shavings to fall through unobstructed and should sit well clear of the bench, so you can slide the tools underneath it without banging the sharpened edges.

, This is the heart of the machine and needs to be really solid, and preferably cast. Fabricated headstocks are rarely heavy enough if you need to turn large or out-of-balance work.

The headstock also needs to have a good spread between the bearings to ensure maximum rigidity of the spindle. Some imported models have what looks like a huge headstock, but when you remove the belt cover the two spindle bearings are actually quite close together. A small bearing spread like this will cause problems with rigidity, particularly on large diameter work, so always look for a machine where there is plenty of distance between the bearings.





The bearings themselves should be good quality heavy-duty sealed ball races.
Some machines have a tapered bronze sleeved bearing which gives much greater support than ball races, although it does require occasional adjustment. However, when set up correctly this arrangement supports the spindle over a much greater length and provides totally smooth and vibration-free running.












, The headstock may be permanently fixed in line with the bed, or it may have the facility to swing round so that the spindle ends up at right angles to the bed for bowl turning.





This swinging head as an essential feature on a lathe; the real advantage is not only for bowl turning, but also for any turning where you have to work over the bed.

Swinging the head just a few degrees off-center allows you to work with the tool handles clear of the bed. Although you can still work off the standard tool-rest with the head swung a little, for big diameter bowl turning you will need an additional bowl rest to maximize the capacity.











If you are restricted with regards to space, many of the swinging head machines also allow you to move the headstock bodily along the bed, which is a great advantage if the end of the machine has to be up against a wall.







, The headstock spindle is threaded to take a range of screw-on accessories such as chucks, so you need one with a standard thread or you’ll be limited in the range of extras you can buy. On many smaller lathes, a thread size of ¾in x 16 tpi is the industry standard, which makes upgrading your machine less costly.






This means that you can then take all your threaded accessories with you, rather than renewing them with the lathe when you upgrade it. This is an important point, as you will often have a substantial investment tied up in chucks and other accessories.

, It is essential that your lathe is also equipped with Morse tapers in both headstock and tailstock. This is a universal means of installing centres and a range of other tooling, and does not restrict you to using only the original manufacturer’s fittings.






There is a huge range of Morse taper kits on the market, but if you buy a lathe with only screw-on fittings you are very restricted as to what you can use. Morse tapers are commonly No 1 or No 2 on the smaller lathes; the bigger the number, the thicker the taper. The tapers just push into the headstock and are then knocked out afterwards with a bar that runs through the main spindle.
If the spindle is solid, there needs to be a centre ejector which screws onto the spindle nose before you insert the taper. Take great with these tapers and keep them clean and undamaged, or they will start spinning inside each other, which as well as causing them damage, will lead to inaccuracies when you are using fittings such as drill chucks.







, A small lathe will need a motor of at least 1⁄3hp, particularly if you envisage turning bowls, but bigger is better in this case. In order to give some speed variation, the motor is usually fitted with a three or four-step pulley and a matching one on the spindle, to give a speed range from about 400 to 2000 rpm.

This is achieved with a belt, which is moved around on the pulleys to select the required speed. The traditional V belt has now virtually been replaced with the more efficient fl at poly V type, which gives a smoother, vibration free drive as it has no lumpy joint.





Some lathes achieve the speed variation in other ways.
This may be mechanical, where a lever operates two cone pulleys, so changing their diameter and therefore the speed. This system does work, but it is prone to wear belts very quickly and is rather noisy.
Also, you can only change the speed whilst the lathe is running. So if you finished the last job at top speed and now want bottom, you firstly have to switch the lathe on and reduce the speed before you can mount the work, all of which is a bit fiddly and time consuming.







, The ultimate for speed changing is an electrical speed control, which gives you infinite variation of speed at the turn of a knob. This is usually reserved for the top-of-the- range lathes, but in the past electronic speed variation has suffered from loss of torque at low speeds.

Fortunately modern electronic technology has largely overcome this problem, usually by operating a three-phase motor through an inverter off a single phase supply.





State-of-the-art electronic speed controls have memory functions that can remember a selection of favourite speeds.
They can also sense incidents such as dig-ins and then instantly shut down the power.







, Whatever your motor type, make sure that the switchgear is easily accessible and doesn’t get hidden by large workpieces. I prefer to have the switch (or at least a separate ‘off ’ button) at knee height for emergency situations when you have both hands full.

Some machines have a magnetic switch-box, which allows you to move it around at will depending where you are working.







, Motors with a reverse facility are a valuable aid for sanding, and are quite safe to use on between-centres work. However, if you engage reverse with a piece of faceplate work, there is always the possibility that it will unscrew itself, so lathes with reverse should feature a faceplate locking system., This needs to be as substantial as the rest of the lathe, as it has to provide firm support for between-centres work. Make sure that it slides freely and locks firmly onto the bed. The tailstock barrel is moved backwards and forwards with the hand-wheel and needs plenty of travel for drilling work.

It should be bored with a Morse taper to match the headstock, and should also be drilled right through to allow for easy removal of the tailstock centres and for long hole boring.







, The tool-rest assembly is another vital part of the lathe, the main requirement being that it is quickly and easily adjustable. The actual locking mechanism varies from machine to machine; some use a simple clamp and lever under the bed, whilst others use a cam type of lock, which is easier to use as it is accessed from the front of the lathe.

Always check this point before you buy.





The tool-rest itself needs some vertical height adjustment and should lock into the holder with a simple handle that works effectively; there must be no movement possible once it’s locked.
For general use the rest needs to be about 10in (300mm) long, and made of heavy cast construction so that there’s no vibration when you are working at the end of it. Alternative length rests are available. You will probably need a shorter one at some stage.
For very long work there is a rest with two stems, but this requires an additional tool-rest holder.







,

Consider the type of turning you will be doing. If you will mostly be turning spindles, then there’s perhaps no need for a swinging head model, but rigidity of the bed and good between-centres capacity are important features. On the other hand, if you think your main interest will be bowl turning, a swiveling head is vital but between-centres capacity is less important.
You’ll also need plenty of motor power for big-diameter bowls. If you want to do a bit of everything, try to decide on the biggest diameter you want to turn and choose a lathe accordingly.

, If you anticipate being an occasional user making a few simple furniture parts, then a basic model is all you’ll need. But if you think you will spend a lot of time at the lathe as your skills and ambitions grow, then you will need the extra power and weight of a larger machine.

As you go further up the range you will find this extra power and solidity allows you to turn more quickly and confidently. You can take deeper and more ambitious cuts, and the ease of use of features such as electronic variable speed control make turning more intuitive and enjoyable.

Decide which router you want to purchase.",How to Operate a Wood Router1,"


The most common wood router is a mid-size router that varies from 1.5 to 2.5 horsepower and comes either with a fixed or plunge base. This size router is used for a variety of tasks, including the trimming of laminates, routing of molding and the cutting of dadoes and rabbit joints. It usually comes with a .5-inch (12.7 mm) collet with a .25-inch (6.35 mm) adapter collet. You may also find European routers with a collett of 3/8-inch (8 mm).
Next is the trim or palm router. It rarely comes with anything other than a fixed-router base. It can be gripped in the palm of your hand and operated with one hand due to its size and can be used for laminate trimming; light edging, such as rounding over an edge; and to cut small dadoes and rabbits.
The heaviest and largest of the three types are the 2.5 to 3.5 horsepower routers. These routers come with a fixed base and are usually found in professional woodworking shops. They are also often found bolted under a router table and used in molding and trim work or dealing with hardwoods.;

, Push downward and move the router from right to left while holding down on the base. Let up when you have reached the end of your cut. The motor should move upward retracting the bit.

, These tables can be used with medium and larger sized plunge and fixed-base routers. They vary in size from stand-alone to bench-top.


The router is mounted upside down on a special plate that fits into a hole cut into a table top. Otherwise, it operates the same. The advantage is that it makes more accurate cuts and expands the use of a router.

Loosen the nuts on the knife lock bars, and remove the lock bars and knives.,
Jointer blades can be sharpened.,
The installation of the blades must be done with precision.,
Insert the knife lock bars and knives into the slots in the cutter head, and lightly tighten the nuts.,
Once you have all 3 knives installed, check them one more time for alignment, and make sure all the nuts are fastened tightly.",How to Change the Blades on a Jointer,"  Never work on a jointer that is plugged in.;
,,  If you have a spiral cutter head jointer your cutter head will have a series of small square knives, this article does not describe the process for replacing knives in a spiral cutter head jointer.

,  Make a  note of the orientation of the blades and lock bars.  This is a good time to clean up the crud on the lock bars and the cutter head with turpentine.

,  Some people have two sets of blades so that they can keep using the machine while the dull blades are being sharpened, others have one set and just wait until the blades come back from the sharpening shop.

,  The blades must be in perfect alignment with the out feed table.  If they are not you won't get good cuts.  Raise your in feed table until it is perfectly level with your out feed table.  The depth of cut gauge should read ""0"" when the two tables are level.  Use a straightedge to check the coplanarity of the tables and make any adjustment necessary to bring them into alignment.

,  The tricky part here is getting the blades level with the out feed table.  Lay your straightedge across the two tables, and rotate the cutter head so that the blade raises to its highest level.  When the blade is at the right height, you should be able to hear the faintest scrape against your straightedge in a quiet room.  If it moves the straightedge, it's too high, lower it.  If you can see a gap between the blade and the straightedge, it's too low, raise it.  Further, you need this alignment across the entire length of the blade.  Once you get it, tighten the nuts, and then check again.  Sometimes the tightening of the nuts changes the height of the blade.  It's a difficult process, and some people spend hours getting the alignment perfect.  I like to work from the back side of the Delta, as I can get a better view down the blades from both slightly above and slightly below the level of the tables.

,  Reinstall the knife guard and the fence, and plug the machine in. If your cuts aren't smooth and even, or if you get excessive chatter, check the alignment of the knives again, as this is a sign of poor alignment.

Sand the work piece when you are finished cutting if desired.",How to Use a Wood Lathe," Bench top lathes can be ideal for turning small projects like ink pens and yo-yos, larger machines may be used for making spindles used in furniture and handrail styles. Here are some differences in wood lathe specifications:

Bed length is the distance between centers, or the maximum length of the stock that can be turned.
Swing is the term used to describe the largest diameter stock that can be turned.

Horsepower is the amount of torque the lathe motor develops, which in turn will determine how heavy an item can be turned without overloading this critical component.
RPMs are the revolutions per minute the stock can be turned. Here, note that most, if not all lathes have variable speed capabilities. A lathe with a very low speed range allows the user to start a piece of odd shaped, unbalanced stock without excessive vibration, and high speed machines can speed the work while making obtaining a fine, smooth finish easier to achieve.
Weight and composition. Heavier machines with cast iron beds and steel frames offer a good, solid work platform, but can be difficult to move if you are operating it in a crowded workshop where you will be storing it when it is not in use.;
, A simple task might be to turn a square or irregularly shaped piece of wood to a true cylindrical shape, often the first step to forming a spindle or other round item., Lathe tools are called chisels. They feature long, round, curved handles to afford a solid grip and sufficient leverage to enable the turner to control the cutting edge accurately with minimal fatigue. Common wood chisels simply are too short and are ill-designed for this purpose. Here are a few of the many types turning tools you may find:

Gouges. These usually have specially shaped cutting edges for performing particular cuts, such as bowl gouges, with concave, curved cutting edges to form the smooth, curved surface of a bowl, or vee, or knurling gouges for cutting grooves or knurls in wooden spindles.





Scrapers. These are often flat or slightly curved chisels for removing wood from flat or cylindrical shapes, or for roughing out a shape.
Parting tools. These are thin, vee tipped tools for cutting off work pieces.





Spoon cutters have a spoon shaped cutting edge and are also often used for shaping bowls.
Other tools you may encounter are skew chisels, fluted gouges, spindle gouges, and nose chisels.

, A basic wood lathe consists of a bed, headstock, tailstock, and tool rest. Here are the functions of each of these parts.
The headstock consists of the drive train, including the motor, pulleys, belts, and spindle, and for a right handed turner, will be located on the left end of the lathe. Mounted on the end of the headstock facing the tailstock is the spindle and the spur center or for face turning such as bowls and plates, or other flat or face work, the face plate assembly.





The tail stock is the free spinning end of the lathe, and has the tailstock spindle and the cup center, as well as a hand-wheel or other feature for clamping or securing the work piece between the lathe centers.





The tool rest is similar to a mechanical arm with a metal guide bar to support the chisel used for turning the work piece. It usually can be adjusted by sliding the length of the bed at its base, with an intermediate arm that can swing from a parallel to a perpendicular position in relation to the lathe bed, and the upper arm, which holds the actual tool rest bar. This assembly has as many as three swivel joints, all of which tighten with a setscrew or clamp to keep it secure while turning is in progress.






, Keep your owner's manual handy for reference if you decide to purchase accessories for your particular lathe, for maintenance instructions, and for reference to capacities and specifications for your machine., For a beginner, using a softwood like southern yellow pine, lodge-pole pine, or balsam fir may be a good idea. Look for a piece with fairly straight grain, and few, tight, knots. Never turn a split piece of stock, or one with loose knots, these may separate during turning, and become projectiles traveling at a significant speed., For example, if you are going to begin with a piece of 2X4 lumber, rip it to a nominally square shape, such as 2X2. You can then chamfer, or bevel the square corners, effectively creating an octagonal piece, which will reduce the amount of wood that must be removed to reach your desired cylindrical shape., For a beginner, starting with a relatively short length, less than 2 foot (0.6 m) long for an intermediate, or medium sized lathe, is a good choice. Longer work pieces are difficult to true, and maintaining a uniform diameter along the length of a longer piece can take a lot of work., Assuming the tailstock is not locked in position, slide this until it pushes the cup center into the tail end of your work piece. Using the hand crank, tighten the tailstock spindle so that it pushes the stock into the spur center, mounted on the headstock spindle. Make sure the work piece is securely held, and all clamps are tightened, otherwise, the work piece may fly off the lathe while you are turning. Also make sure the lathe keys are out of the machine before you start, A good working distance is about 3/4 of an inch. Remember, the closer the tool rest is to the turning work piece, the more leverage and better control you will have with your knife (chisel).
, It is a good practice to always turn a work piece by hand before turning the lathe on, making sure it has sufficient clearance., A roughing gouge is a good choice for beginning to turn an irregular or square work piece down to a round shape. Practice holding the tool on the tool rest, using your left (again, for right handed persons) hand on the metal blade behind the tool rest, and your right near the end of the handle. Keeping your elbows in, and braced against your body will give you better control of the tool., Place the cutting edge of the tool on the rest, keeping clear of the rotating work piece, check your grip, and slowly begin easing it toward the work piece. You want to move in toward it perpendicular to the work piece, until the cutting edge just touches the wood. Forcing it or moving too quickly will cause the tool to jam into the wood, and it will either break off, or you will lose your grip on the tool if the lathe doesn't stall out. This is one of the most dangerous steps in beginning turning.
, When truing, you will want to cut small chips, less than 1/4 of an inch in length., When using a roughing gouge or similar tool, you can cant, or pitch the tool edge so chips are thrown at an angle from the work piece, so you do not become covered with them while you turn. Twist the tool slightly and observe the flight path of the chips to adjust it so they fly away from you to your right or left., This will eventually cut away the angular corners, leaving your work piece round, and with practice, cylindrical in shape., You may want to use a pair of calipers to check the diameter of your work piece along its length so you finish with the desired diameter., The slower your tool movement, and finer, or lighter the cut, the smoother the finished cut will be., You can sand the stock by hand while it is turning if you use caution. Turn the lathe off, and swing the tool rest out of the way, then select a suitable grit and type of sandpaper for this process. Turn the lathe back on, and hold the paper lightly against the wood, moving it back and forth to prevent removing too much wood from one area of the work piece."

Polish metal or plastics.",How to Use a Dremel Tool," Dremel was one of the first companies to manufacture rotary tools, and it is still best known for these tools. Dremel also produces a number of other types of tools, including powered screwdrivers and scroll saws. Research which tools they're currently selling to find one that fits your needs. The price range varies so it's especially important to find out if you're getting the right tool. Options on Dremels include:Fixed or cordless models
Lightweight and mobile, or sturdier and stronger
Longer battery life
Fixed speed (usually cheaper and easier to use) or variable speed (better for intricate grinding projects and more expensive);
, Your Dremel will come with a variety of drill bits and other attachments, the tool, and an owner's manual. Be sure to read the manual before using your Dremel for the first time. This will also help you become familiar with the controls. Find out where the speed controls, on/off switch, and button to change the bit are located.Since your model may be different than a previous year's model, it's important to read the manual that came with your tool.

, Always wear work or rubber gloves when you run the Dremel. Gloves will keep your hands safe from debris and sharp edges. You should also wear safety glasses, especially when cutting, polishing, or grinding with the Dremel.Keep your work space clean. You should also keep children and other people away while you're operating the tool.

, To insert a bit, place the bit into the hole at the end of the Dremel and back it out slightly. Tighten the collet nut so that the bit is secure and doesn't wiggle. To remove the bit, press down on the shaft lock button while turning the collet. This should loosen the bit so you can replace it.








Make sure to practice inserting and changing the bit when the Dremel is turned off and unplugged.
Some models are equipped with collets designed for quick and easy connection and release.
You can also get collets in different sizes for use with different sized accessory shanks.In some cases, you will need to use a mandrel, a type of shank with a threaded head. This is a type of permanent shank for use with polishing, cutting, or sanding bits.

, You should choose your bit attachment based on the type of material you'll be working with. Dremel makes many bits with a variety of materials for almost any material. For example, for:


Carving and engraving jobs: use high speed cutters, engraving cutters, structured tooth carbide cutters, tungsten carbide cutters and diamond wheel points
Routing jobs: use router bits (straight, keyhole, corner, or groove). When using a router, take care to only use router bits.
Small drilling jobs: use drill bits (purchased individually or as a set)

, Once you plug it in, turn it on to the lowest setting and practice switching to different speeds.


To get a feel for the Dremel, try using different grips to hold the tool. For intricate jobs, you might want to hold it like a pencil. Or, for a larger job firmly grip the tool so that your fingers wrap around it.
Use clamps or a vice to secure the material you are working on. Check your user’s manual to determine the correct speed for the job you have in mind.

, Remove the bit and place the bits back in the case. Take the time to wipe down the drill with a cloth after each use. Keeping your Dremel clean will significantly extend the life of the tool. Consult the owner’s manual before disassembling the tool for major cleanings.You will need to frequently use compressed air to clean out the Dremel's air vents. This will help prevent electrical failure.

, The Dremel is lightweight and easy to maneuver, making it deal for small detailing and little cuts. It can be difficult to give smooth, long curves, because you're mostly working free hand. But, you can make several straight cuts to get the kind of edge you're looking for and then even up the edge with the sanding bit.









Avoid using the Dremel for long or large cuts that would be better suited to a larger saw.

, Depending on the object or material you're cutting, secure the object with a vise or clamps. Do not hold the material you're cutting in your hand.

, A speed that is too high or too low can cause damage to your motor, the bit, or the material you're working on. If you're not sure, check your owner's manual to see what speed is recommended for your particular Dremel and material.









If you're cutting thicker or tougher material, make several passes to cut it. If the material is too hard and thick to cut without difficulty, you may need to use an oscillating saw rather than a Dremel.
If you see smoke and discoloration, your speed is too high. If you hear the sound of the motor dropping or slowing down, you may be pressing too hard. Lighten the pressure and readjust the speed.

, Fit a flat saw blade onto your Dremel. Remember to put on eye and ear protection before you begin cutting the plastic. Set the speed between 4 and 8 so you have enough power, but don't burn out the motor. Sand any rough edges once you've made the cuts.








Avoid pressing down too hard while cutting, which can damage your Dremel and your bits.
Depending on your project, it may be helpful to draw an outline of your cuts onto the plastic. This will make it easier to ensure your cuts are where you want them to go.

, Secure a metal cutting wheel onto your Dremel. Put on eye and ear protection before you start cutting. Turn on your Dremel and set the power between 8 and 10. Make sure the metal you're cutting is affixed firmly in place. Gently touch the Dremel to the metal for a few seconds at a time until you see the metal being cut. You'll also see sparks fly.








Fiber reinforced disks are more durable than ceramic disks, which can shatter when cutting metal.

, For grinding, attach grinding stones which can be fixed to the mandrel








You can use grinding stones, grinding wheels, chain saw sharpening stones, abrasive wheels and abrasive points to grind a material. Carbide bits tend to work best on metal, porcelain, or ceramic.
Use cylindrical or triangular tips for round grinds. To grind a notch into something or grind an inside corner, use a flat disc shape. Or, use cylindrical or triangular tips for round grinds.

, Select a sandpaper bit and secure it in your Dremel. Sandpaper bits are available in fine through course grits, and all grades should fit on the same mandrel. Tighten the screw at the end of the sandpaper bit. Turn on your Dremel and set it between 2 and 10. Choose lower settings if you're sanding or polishing plastics or woods. Select a higher setting if you're sanding metal. While holding the material secure, run the bit across the material so that the sandpaper bit completely comes into contact with your material and sharpens or sands it.








Make sure that the sanding bits are in good shape so they don't scuff or mark your material. They should fit in the drill snugly and shouldn't be worn. Have several sanding bits on hand so you can quickly replace them.
To sand, you can use sanding bands, sanding discs, flap wheels, shaping wheels and finishing and detail abrasive brushes.

, If you've got a big job, begin with coarser bits before moving to softer bits. This can help you sand out larger scratches quickly and then you can have more control over working through the material. If you skip the coarse bit and begin with a softer bit, it will take you longer and you'll wear out the softer bit.








Check the bit every minute or two to see if the bit is worn or torn. Remember to turn off and unplug the Dremel while you do this.

, The Dremel is an excellent tool for fine-detail polishing or polishing in tight spots. Rub a polishing compound over the surface of your object and fit your Dremel with a felt polishing tip or wheel. Start your drill at a low speed (2) and run it against the polishing compound. You should work the wheel in circles until the material is polished. Avoid using a much higher speed (don't go over 4).








You can polish without using a compound, but you'll get shinier results with it.
For cleaning and polishing jobs, use rubber polishing points, cloth or felt polishing wheels, and polishing brushes. Be sure to get the right kind of coarse polishing brush for the job. These bits are good for taking old paint off of metal furniture or cleaning up tools and grills.

",How to Make Pound Cake French Toast," To ready the pound cake for the French toast, use a knife to cut it into slices. Aim for slices that are approximately ½- to ¾-inch (13- to 19-mm) thick.When you cut the cake, you should wind up with approximately 8 to 12 slices.
If you’re in a hurry, you can find pre-made pound cake that’s already cut into slices so it’s ready for turning into French toast.;
, Crack 2 eggs into a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk or fork to lightly beat the eggs until the eggs and yolks are mostly combined.If you’re watching your cholesterol, you can use an egg substitute product in place of the eggs.

, Once the eggs are slightly beaten, add ¾ cup (177 ml) of milk, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of almond extract, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of vanilla, ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of ground cinnamon, and ⅛ teaspoon (.7 g) of salt. Whisk the mixture until the ingredients are fully combined.If you’d like to add other spices to the batter, such as ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of ginger, and/or ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of ground cloves, you can customize the recipe to suite your tastes.

, Heat a large pan or skillet on medium on your stove top. When the pan is hot, add 3 tablespoons of butter or margarine. Allow it to melt completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Watch the butter or margarine closely as it melts to ensure that it doesn’t burn.

, While the butter is melting, starting coating the pound cake with the batter. Dip the slices in the bowl with the egg mixture, making sure to coat both sides and the edges completely.Allow the excess batter to drip off the pound cake slices back into the bowl before placing them in the frying pan. You can shake them slightly to help the process.

, Once the pound cake slices are coated in the batter, place them in the frying pan. Fry the pieces for 1 to 3 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown.Depending on the size of your frying pan or skillet, you’ll likely have to fry your French toast in several batches.

, When the pound cake slices are finished frying, remove them from the pan with a spatula. Place them on a plate, and serve with your favorite toppings.For a simple topping, dust the pound cake French toast lightly with powdered sugar.
Maple syrup is another classic topping for French toast.
Make the pound cake French toast even more delicious by topping it with whipped cream and sliced fruit, such as strawberries or bananas.

, When you’re finished mixing up the batter for the French toast, place the pound cake slices side-by-side in a baking dish. When the slices are all flat in the dish, use a knife to lightly butter the top of each slice.You can substitute margarine if you prefer, but butter offers the best flavor.

, After you’ve buttered the pound cake slices, pour the egg mixture over them. Make sure to cover all of the slices, and then place the baking dish in the refrigerator to chill for 8 hours or overnight.Before placing the baking dish in the refrigerator, it’s a good idea to tilt it back and forth several times to ensure that the batter is spread throughout the dish to completely coat the pound cake.
You may want to cover the baking dish with plastic wrap before placing it in the refrigerator.

, To make sure that the oven is hot enough to bake for the French toast, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Next, coat a large cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray to grease it.If you prefer, you can grease the cookie sheet with butter.

, When the pound cake slices have chilled properly in the batter, remove them from the baking dish with a spatula. Transfer them to the cookie sheet, and bake them for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown., When the French toast is done baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Allow it to cool for several minutes before placing it on a plate for serving. You can top the pound cake French toast with maple syrup, powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar, or your favorite toppingsConsider warming up your favorite jam or preserves to pour over the French toast.

Melt ½ cup of butter (about one whole normal-sized stick), add 1 cup brown sugar and pour the mixture into the bottom of the dish to coat it.Depending on the size of your baking dish, you may have use multiple layers to make room for the bread.
Use a spatula to help spread the butter/sugar mixture, as it will likely be sticky.;
, Pick out a loaf of whatever kind of bread you prefer to use for French toast. Place the slices in the bottom of the baking pan whole so that they overlap slightly, or cut them into 2-3 inch cubes to make the most of your space. Once in the pan, the bread will begin to absorb the butter and sugar, lending it a rich flavor and helping it cook through more evenly.It’s better if the bread is of a thicker, heartier variety, like sourdough, brioche or Texas toast, as the moisture and sugar in the egg mixture will cause softer breads to disintegrate as they bake.Make sure the slices of bread overlap so that there’s no space between them.

, In a large mixing bowl, combine 6 eggs, 2 cups of milk, ¼ cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Whisk the mixture together until it forms a smooth liquid. This is the egg wash you will be soaking the French toast in.Unlike normal French toast, there’s no need to do all that dipping and grilling.
Use more or less of each spice to taste.

, Using a rubber spatula and a steady hand, slowly cover the bread slices with the egg mixture. If you’re using more than one layer of toast, pour half the mixture over the first layer, then add the second layer and cover it with the remaining half.Pour the liquid mixture as evenly as you can over the entire area of the baking dish.
Try not to leave any uncovered spots. Dry bread will lack flavor and may burn easier than the parts that have been soaked.

, Cover the French toast in aluminum foil and place it in the refrigerator to let it marinate. As it sits, it will continue to soak in the flavors of the egg mixture, incorporating the creaminess of the dairy ingredients and the sweet spice of the cinnamon and nutmeg. In the morning, just take the it out of the refrigerator and bake it. It’s that easy!Refrigerate the French toast for at least 12 hours to give it enough time to set up properly.
Getting this dish ready only takes about 30 minutes… the rest is done while you sleep!

, Turn the oven on to bake or convection and set it to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). While it warms up, retrieve your French toast from the refrigerator and take a peek under the foil. It will have soaked up the egg mixture nicely, and when baked will puff up to a crisp, pillowy finish.You don’t want the oven too hot. Because of the high sugar content, the French toast could scorch if it’s exposed to too much heat too quickly.

, Place the French toast in the oven on the center rack, leaving it covered for now. Set a timer for 30 minutes. This will give the toast a chance to start cooking through to the center. Afterwards, you’ll remove the aluminum foil and finish baking it under direct heat.The foil will trap heat, helping the French toast bake more evenly.A single layer of French toast may not need to bake for a full 20 minutes. Watch it closely and take it out when if it looks like it’s done, even if your timer hasn’t expired.

Layer the walnuts in with the bread before you bake it to add a little crunch to every bite.

, Give your French toast the crepe treatment by heaping on a combination of made-from-scratch whipped cream and fresh strawberries, blueberries, peaches or bananas. You could also use canned preserves if they’re available, or simmer a quick compote on the stovetop with butter, sugar, water and sweet spices.Choose from fruits that are in-season and make different versions of the dish all year long.
Try baking some cinnamon apples and crowning each serving of French toast with a slice or two., The creaminess of the chocolate and hazelnut spread is the perfect counterpart to the sponginess of the French toast.

Start with multi-grain bread.,
Use just the egg whites.,
Add a scoop of protein powder.,
Go with a lighter sweetener.,
Pass on the powdered sugar.",How to Make Healthier French Toast1," Ditch the overly processed bread products and find a more natural option complete with nutritious whole grains. These not only have more beneficial vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber, but they’ll also let you taste the bread more clearly underneath the heavy coating of sweeteners and other toppings.You could even start making your own bread from scratch, which will give you total control over what goes in it.
Low carb breads made without gluten are also a good way to avoid overloading on starches.;
, Separating the whites instead of using the whole egg significantly reduces the amount of cholesterol and overall calories going into the dish. Keep in mind that you may need to crack a few extra eggs to make up for volume you lose by not including the yolks.Isolating the whites may prevent your French toast from tasting so “eggy,” as well.
To simplify the cooking process, pick up a bottle of egg white beaters from the supermarket to keep on hand for hassle-free breakfasts., Shake in 20-30g of unflavored powder while you’re mixing up the batter. The added protein will help you feel satisfied faster, which means you’ll eat less and keep your muscles fueled and ready to burn energy all day long.Enriching your French toast with protein can keep you from having to serve fattening side dishes like bacon or sausage alongside it in order to fill up.
Avoid flavored protein powders, as these will interfere with the finished product.

, Opt for a low sugar variety of maple syrup, or, better yet, make the switch to raw honey. These items contain far lower concentrations of sugar without sacrificing the smooth, rich sweetness you need to make the dish taste right.A good serving size for syrup and other sweeteners is around 1-2 tablespoons, or about 30ml.There is evidence to suggest that maple syrup may have certain health benefits, so consider simply going easy on it rather than giving it up altogether.Lend depth to your French toast using sweeteners with complex flavors like orange blossom honey or date syrup infused with fruity or floral notes., Sprinkling on a healthy dose of confectioner’s sugar is usually the last step in preparing French toast, but it adds a lot of unnecessary calories. Stick to a low sugar syrup, honey or fruit to sweeten your breakfast rather than overpowering it with extra sugar. Chances are, you won’t even miss it when it’s not there.Instead of powdered sugar, try a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice. These spices are bold and help promote a healthy metabolism."
"
Top your French toast with fruit.,
Spoon on some Greek yogurt.,
Incorporate all-natural nut butters.,
Finish with dark chocolate.",How to Make Healthier French Toast2," Slice some fresh strawberries, peaches or bananas and layer them onto the cooked toast. With the boost of bright, tart flavor, you can get away with using half as much syrup. In fact, a fruit compote can even be used to replace other sweeteners altogether.Combine your favorite jam or preserves with a little bit of water to make a spreadable fruit topping, or simply reduce a few cups of juice in a saucepan until it thickens into a syrup.If you’re in a hurry, ordinary apple sauce can make a great readymade topping for French toast.

, Heap your hot-off-the-skillet toast with a generous dollop of yogurt and dig in. Greek yogurt is high in protein, along with other essential nutrients like calcium and vitamin D. It also provides a cool, creamy counterbalance to the soft and slightly crisp texture of the cooked bread.Cut the sharp flavor of Greek yogurt by stirring in a small amount of honey or simple syrup.
Ricotta, cottage or cream cheese are among a few other delicious dairy options, if you don’t care for the taste of Greek yogurt., Those who prefer a more savory style French toast will enjoy the slight saltiness of some fresh almond or cashew butter. Nuts are good sources of protein, minerals and healthy fatty acids like Omega-3s. For this reason, they’re a smarter pick than additives like Nutella, which tend to be loaded with sugar.Have your nut butters ground fresh in the store as opposed to buying the processed brands. These usually have sweeteners added.

, Add a small handful of chips or morsels directly to the toast as it cooks to get them nice and melted, or simply sprinkle them on when you’re ready to eat. A little bit of chocolate can make your breakfast feel more like dessert. Melt the chocolate in the microwave and drizzle it over the toast, followed by a glob of homemade whipped cream or infused butter.Dark chocolate pairs well with lots of other unique ingredients, from raspberry to coconut.

Finished.

",How to Make Healthier French Toast3," One easy way to cut down on the total number of carbs in the dish is to simply use less bread. Aim for a thickness of about ½ to ¾ inch per slice, about half as much as usual. Be sure to adjust your cooking time appropriately so that the thinner toast doesn’t burn.It may help to choose a sturdier bread, like focaccia or soda bread, that can hold up to being dipped and cooked without falling apart.To prevent the bread from getting too soggy, brush it with the egg dredge rather than completely submerging it.

However, most kinds of bread can be used to make cinnamon French toast. When choosing bread, avoid bread with large holes in it as it won’t hold the custard mixture very well. Instead:


Use slices of homemade cinnamon swirl bread to enhance the cinnamon flavors in this recipe.
Crumbly country-style breads make a sturdy, eggy French toast.
Use slices of French bread to make decadent, chewy cinnamon French toast.
For a firmer texture, use stale bread instead of fresh bread.;
, Whisk the eggs, milk, and cinnamon together in a large mixing bowl. If you don’t have a whisk, use a large fork instead. Stir the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated into the milk.







, Choose a large flat-bottomed metal or cast-iron skillet. Place the skillet on the stove over medium heat and add two tablespoons of butter. Once the butter has melted and is bubbling, the skillet is hot enough to use.









If the butter begins turning dark brown or smoking, turn down the heat to avoid burning the butter.

, Place a slice of bread into the custard mixture and press it down gently with a fork. Use the fork to flip the bread over and soak the other side. As soon as the bread is completely soaked, remove it from the custard mixture and place it on the skillet.








Fresh bread should be soaked quickly to avoid crumbling. Stale bread can be soaked slightly longer as it’s sturdier.

, Let the French toast brown in the hot butter until the bottom is golden brown. Check the color by using a fork to peek under the slice. Next, flip the toast and allow the other side to cook until it’s golden brown.








If your skillet is large enough, you can cook several slices at once. However, take care not to crowd the pan or the bread won’t get crispy.

, After the French toast is golden brown, remove it from the skillet and set it aside on a plate. Continue dipping and frying slices of toast until you’ve used up all of the bread. If you run out of the custard mixture, mix up another batch and continue cooking.


Keep large batches of French toast warm by placing them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius.), Find a deep metal sauce pan with thick sides. Next, add the white sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, water, and vanilla extract.

When the mixture is boiling, you will see large bubbles rising rapidly to the surface.

, Once the mixture is boiling, lower the heat and let it simmer. A mixture is simmering when small, active bubbles rise to the surface. Continue simmering the mixture until it thickens into a syrup. This process will take about ten minutes.Stir the mixture while it simmers.

, Remove the syrup from the heat and set it aside. Let the mixture cool for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the syrup is room temperature, serve it over cinnamon French toast, pancakes, sausages, or waffles. , Many people enjoy eating cinnamon French toast with standard French toast toppings.

Sweet syrups, such as cinnamon syrup, maple syrup, or fruit syrup
Butter
Whipped cream
Fresh berries
Crumbled bacon

Understand that an English wheel is used to bend and form sheet metal to make useable parts.,
Choose the die.,
Attach the die to the frame.,
Adjust the gap between the wheels.,
Begin the metal forming process.,
Move the sheet metal back and forth between the two dies to help form the sheet metal.,
Remove the sheet metal after forming is complete.",How to Use an English Wheel,"
It is, essentially, a rectangular frame bolted to a large stand.


The frame is shaped in the form of a closed letter ‘C’. At one end of the frame are two wheels that are used to form the sheet metal. The top wheel is called the rolling wheel, while the bottom wheel is known as the anvil wheel.
On an average, the size of the rolling wheel has a width of 8 centimeter (3.1 in) (3"") and the anvil wheel has a diameter of 25cm (10"").
The depth of the C frame is known as the throat. The depth determines the size of the sheet metal that can be formed using the English wheel.

Equipment manufacturers can produce English wheels with throat depths up to 120cm (48""). Some machines even have designs that allow the wheels to turn at a 90° angle so as to incorporate larger sheet metal.
Two common metals that are formed using the English wheel are steel and aluminum.
The lower jaw of the frame that holds the anvil wheel is adjustable to provide a range of forming capabilities as the metal thins.
The die holder for the anvil wheel is controlled by a screw with a handle which adjusts the gap between the anvil wheel and the rolling wheel.
There is usually a lever attached to the lower wheel which will open jaws so that the formed metal can be easily removed.;
, Usually, an English wheel comes equipped with five or six different anvil wheel dies. Choose the die according to the type of forming you wish to achieve.

, The lower jaw of the C frame has two carved grooves and the anvil wheel has an axle which extends on either side. Place the die onto the lower jaw by fitting the axle into the grooves.

, Turn the handle under the lower jaw to adjust the space between the wheels. A smaller the gap will apply more pressure to the sheet metal.

, Pass the sheet metal through the gap between the rolling wheel and the anvil wheel.

, Note that the sheet metal part can be manipulated in every direction.

, Many English wheels are equipped with a lever just under the anvil wheel. The lever increases the gap so you can remove the sheet metal easily without changing your settings.

Place the base material on the mill. Then, place the stock material on top of the base plate so that the entire bottom surface is in contact with the base plate.
This is to make sure that the end-mill doesn’t come in contact with the mill table.;
,

Place the material and the base plate near the center of the table in the X and Y directions.

,


Use the tools and materials listed in ""Things You'll Need.""

,

With your laptop, use your CAD to create the G-Code for your part.
Save this file as a number and load the G-Code for the program onto a floppy disk.
Insert this floppy disk into the floppy disk slot at the rear of the mill.

,

If your G-Code is accurate, you shouldn’t have problems viewing the part.
On the main menu, click ‘PROG IN/OUT’
Then, enter the number of the file that you saved onto your floppy disk.

Analyze the requirements of the air tools that you will be using.,
Choose between piston-type and portable compressors.,
Look at the horsepower (HP) of the air compressor.,
Try to look at Cubic Feet per Minute, or CFM.,
Consider space and portability.,
Consider your power source.,
If using a piston-type compressor, determine how large your tank should be.",How to Choose an Air Compressor," Are you going to be using the compressor for industrial use to power heavy-duty machinery, or will you use the compressor around the house for odd jobs like powering a caulking gun or inflating tires? You'll probably want a piston compressor with a tank if you plan on industrial use, while you may want a portable compressor without a tank if you plan on merely using it around the house.


In particular, consider pressure and volume requirements of any tools you may be using. Obviously, heavy-duty tools require much more pressure and, in turn, more volume. If you fail to choose a compressor that's large enough for your intended use, you will find yourself periodically waiting for the tank to fill up, thereby decreasing your work efficiency.
If the portable air compressor is for airbrushing, for example, a 5 liter (1.3 US gal) tank capacity and around 30 psi of sustained air pressure would be adequate.;
, Essentially, there are two different kinds of air compressors. Piston-type compressors rely on a motor which builds up air pressure when it gets depleted. These store compressed air in tanks. Portable compressors do not have tanks, and so much stay running continuously in order to deliver air.


Piston-type compressors come in two varieties. The single-stage compressors use only one piston to compress air and top out at about 150 psi.Two-stage compressors use two pistons to deliver near continuous air pressure, and top out at around 200 psi.Single-stage compressors are adequate for more heavy-duty applications at home. Two-stage compressors are more often used in industrial settings where owners expect near continuous usage.
Portable air compressors are more viable for light home use. Powering caulk guns, spray guns, glue guns, as well as for inflating small tires and rafts.

, A common range for horsepower on an air compressor is between 1.5 and 6.5 HP. Air compressors with larger HP capacity exist, but are usually reserved for industrial uses and offer far greater psi.Small-scale uses won't require as much horsepower as industrial uses.


While horsepower is a valuable marker in determining your air compressor, it shouldn't be the only one. More valuable will be a CFM rating, or Cubic Feet per Minute, if you can find one. Read more below for a detailed discussion of CFM.

, CFM is a measure of volumetric flow. Easy enough, right? The difficult part is that CFM changes depending on the psi of the compressor, meaning that two tools with different psi won't necessarily have CFMs that you can simply add together, which is what you want to be able to do. This is where things get tricky. Let's try to keep it simple:


Look for or ask about Standard CFM (SCFM) when evaluating compressors. Standard CFM is measured as 14.5 PSIA, at 68 °F (20 °C), with 0% relative humidity.(If you choose not to use SCFM, be sure to use CFM numbers that are all pegged at the same psi.)
When you've got the SCFM of all your air tools that you'll be using simultaneously, add up their SCFMs, then add 30% to that as a safety buffer. This should give you the maximum required CFM usage you'll need to complete the job. When choosing an air compressor, you want to get close to this number so that you don't waste time with a too-small unit or waste money on a too-large one.
Say, for example, that you're using a grease gun (~4 CFM @ 90 psi), framing nailer (~2 CFM @ 90 psi), and dual sander (~11 CFM @ 90 psi) at approximately the same time. Add all the CFMs to get 17 CFM @ 90 psi as your max required CFM.

, For example, will you be able to roll the compressor or lift it off the ground if you need to? Air compressors can be small, portable items or larger, more powerful fixtures. Portability is convenient, but if it will stay in one corner of the garage, you may be able to use a longer hose, instead, and have a higher capacity compressor. Essentially, does this compressor need to supply a nail gun on the roof, or just fill tires in the garage?

, Will you have the luxury of electricity at all times, or will you be in environments without electricity. If you'll be next to an outlet at all times, it's best to choose a drive system with an electric motor. If not, you'll be forced to drive the compressor via a gasoline engine.


Most electric air compressors will run on 110V (US), but some larger ones run on 240V. Find out before you make the purchase.

, If you'll only need your air compressor for short bursts of time — such as when using a nail gun — you can get away with having a small tank. If you'll be working for extended periods of time with your compressor, you'll want the tank to be bigger. Tank sizes are usually measured in gallons.

Calculate the Quantity: Based on your requirement and end use of the product, decide on the number of sheets you will need per part.,
Get A Quote.,
Calculate Shipping Costs.,
Determine any costs that might be charged other than the ones mentioned above.,
Calculate Total Cost.,
Determine Your Profit Percentage.",How to Estimate the Cost of the Fabrication of Metal Sheets," These two factors will help you decide the exact quantity needed for the entire project. Once you decide on the material to be used, you will be able to ascertain the budget of the raw materials. Let this total cost be ‘A’.;
, Contact your fabricator and get a quote according to the material, quality, and the job to be performed. The supplier will provide a quote based on the number of sheets to be fabricated, the equipment to be used, the skill set required for the job, and the time taken to fabricate the sheets. Let this total cost be ‘B’.

, The shipping costs either will have to be borne by you, or will be factored into your entire fabrication and raw material cost. It is important to determine the cost that the supplier and manufacturer are charging you. If you think this is excessive, you can choose to outsource the shipping to a different service provider. Let this total cost be ‘C’.

, For example, you might have to pay extra for quality certificates. Let this total cost be ‘D’.

, Calculate your overall cost by adding the estimations worked out in Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, and Step 4. Therefore, Total Cost = A + B + C + D.

, This step applies if you are acting as a supplier yourself and the final product will be sold to a third party.Decide on your profit percentage. Calculate the exact profit of your total cost. For example: If you decide that your profit percentage should be 20% of your overall cost and your overall cost is $1000.Then, profit is (20 ÷ 100) × 1000 = $200. Therefore, your total cost, after factoring in your profit will be = Overall Cost + Profit Which is: 1000 + 200 = 1200Therefore, your overall cost would be $1200.

Pre-clean the parent metal.,If the area to be repaired includes welds, all weld flux residue and weld spatter shall be removed by wire brush, chipping, grinding or power scaling.,
Use a soft flame, heat gun or soldering iron to heat the parent metal repair area to at least 600°F/315°C.,
Hold the torch tip 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) away from the parent metal.,
Drag the rod over the area to be soldered, until it begins to flow.,
Blend the repair into the undamaged galvanized coating.,
Observe the deposit.,
If you stopped applying and want to apply more rod or flow out the deposit more, let the area cool below the solid temperature and reheat.,Smooth the repair area and remove any excess material with a wire brush.,Repeat these steps to build up additional layers of protection.",How to Use Galvanizing Repair Rods," Use emery cloth, a wire brush, sandblasting, etc. Cleaning galvanized steel surfaces is often done with a stainless steel wire brush. To ensure a smooth surface result, surface preparation should extend into the surrounding undamaged galvanized coating. Breaking the oxide layer by agitation is an important key to successful galvanizing repair rod application.
,, Do not heat the surface over 750°F/400°C or allow the surrounding galvanized coating to burn. If you use a direct flame, please keep it moving. A direct flame held on the repair area is likely to overheat the solder. Wire brush the surface during heating. Pre-flux using flux if there is an adhesion problem. NOTE: Many applications do not require flux., If it is necessary to apply the flame directly to the rod to get it started, pull the torch tip back even farther from the work surface and keep it moving., ONCE THE ROD FLOWS, STOP APPLYING THE HEAT! Deposit the desired thickness of galvanizing repair rod. A stainless steel brush works well to spread the solder and ensure it is adhering. If additional layers are needed, continue to drag the rod over the area. Bring back the heat only to keep the surface, not the rod hot enough to push the solder around to where you want it. *Sometimes it is necessary to heat the tip of the rod with the flame to help the solder flow more easily onto the repair area. Do not heat the rod to the melting point., The most common oversight in repairing galvanized is failing to feather the galvanizing repair material layer into the undamaged galvanized coating. If they don’t join in sufficient thickness to form a seamless barrier (skin), corrosion will occur right where they meet., The material should bond smoothly. The repair rod will melt if overheated, but will not bond properly. Spread the solder deposit evenly over the repair area. A stainless steel brush works well for this step., The existing coating will help the bonding process, whether adding more solder or just flowing out the previous deposit. If substantial time has elapsed since the original repair layer was applied, pre-clean the repair area again to remove any oxide coating that will impair bonding. Again, a stainless steel brush works well for this step.,,"

, Depending on the base unit, there are three ways to mount the bowl feeder – top, center, or bottom mounting. Generally, center mounting is the most common method. Use between 3 and 8 fasteners provided for the bowl for installation., It is extremely important that the vibrations do not get transmitted through the components. Otherwise, the bowl feeder and the electrical controls will not function properly., Keep a small gap between the discharge and the mating tracks. This is to ensure that there is no restriction to the base unit and the movement of the bowl., For units without the cords, connect the bowl feeder to the base unit via a small hole in the base casting., However, it is always better check this before you begin operations. Ensure that there is a gap between the armature and the coil. Always ensure that the two components never touch each other, especially when the base unit is operating at maximum feed rate., Check that all of them are at an angle.

Check your machine tool.,

Diagnose the problem.,
The metrology software will compensate for variance.,
Your counterbore is ready to be machined.,
Archive the Benchmark report.",How to Guarantee the Perfect Counterbore Process," The first thing you need to do before you begin machining is to check your machine tool is actually capable of machining an accurate counterbore. To check this, you'll need to run the machine checking feature of your metrology software. If the machine benchmark report shows a pass, you can continue onto the next step. If your machine benchmark report shows a fail (see warnings) you must stop machining. If your machines not capable you must call an engineer to correct the geometry or you run the risk of creating a bad part.;
, To do this you'll need to run the part location action from the controller. This will send an action to the metrology software to check the part is positioned correctly. Your metrology software will use the existing probe to locate the part and compensate for the new position.


Part Misalignment - This is when the fixture has not been located correctly, or the part is not sitting in the fixture correctly.
Surface thickness variation - The part may have minor distortion, which is a common problem with composite parts. The material's thickness has changed after the layup. This is usually variable by about 0.7mm thickness and can differ if the resin was pre-impregnated or layered.

, Next the metrology software quickly measures your machine tool geometry and part alignment using your existing probe. It then compensates for any variance/distortion – in fact the parts position could have changed considerably and it could still be machined perfectly.

, Select proceed on the metrology software screen. This will machine the counterbores perfectly.

, Finally, you'll be presented with a benchmark report and a part location report. You can store these to guarantee your setup/counterbore is the same next time. The best system I've found is a system called NC-PerfectPart, but there may be other systems which have the same features. A good use of metrology software makes it easy to machine counterbore and other problems associated with composite parts. The auto-alignment and compensate features will also come in handy for part setup. Your metrology software product won't allow you to machine the counterbore until its accurate to your specifications. This stops you from producing bad counterbores and countersinks.

",How to Outfit a Basic Toolbox," A tape measure comes in handy when you need to know the dimensions of a room before buying a new piece of furniture or centering a picture on the wall.;
, A box knife, or utility knife, can be used to open packages, cut small pieces of wood or slice cardboard.

, Duct tape can fix nearly anything. It can temporarily stop a leaky pipe, seal packages, hold something while it's being glued and be used for many of other purposes.

, Finishing nails can be used to hang pictures, nail down a loose board or to serve as a hook on the inside of cabinets.

, The hammer doesn't need to be fancy or extra large. It just needs to enable you to hammer in a nail or remove one with the claw head.

, You will need at least one flat-head and one Phillips-head screwdriver. Also, put in an eyeglass screwdriver set, which usually includes a mini flat-head and Phillips-head screwdriver. These are great to use on toys that require a small screwdriver to open battery compartments.

, It can be used to tighten or loosen any size of nut or bolt. This type of wrench might be called a crescent wrench. Monkey wrenches can also work for this purpose.

, Standard, adjustable pliers will help you perform many household tasks. Additionally, include a set of needle nose pliers, which are able to reach into smaller spots.

, It doesn't need to be a large level. One that is 6- to 12-inches long will be adequate for basic household projects. Look for a level that can be used on both horizontal and vertical surfaces.

, Ratchets are good for assembling (or taking apart) bed frames or other furniture.

, A circular saw helps out when it's necessary to cut a 2x4 or small board. It doesn't need to be an expensive or industrial model. A simple electric drill also helps to fulfill simple tasks around the house. Many people buy cordless drills, but find the batteries and charges take up lots of space.

Put keys away.",How to Organize Keys," Search high and low in your house, car, and office for all of your keys that have found homes in different nooks and crannies. It is important to find all of your keys so you can organize them in one sitting. Once you have located all of your keys, set them out in front of you.;
, Make sure you can identify each key’s purpose. That key you don’t know the use for? Try it out in a few locks or ask friends or family members if they recall its purpose. If there are still keys that you cannot identify after testing them, dispose of them.You may find that a neighbor has given you an extra key to their home that you might have forgotten about. Therefore, exercise caution before disposing of an unknown key.
Most metal recycling centers accept keys or you can always reuse your old keys in an art project., Sort your keys into groups according to how often you use them: daily, weekly, or those that are used perhaps only once a month. This will allow you to more easily decide what keys you should carry with you regularly.Keys that are used on a daily basis include car, house, or mailbox keys.
Keys that are used only a few times a month might be keys for gym lockers or bike locks.
Infrequently used keys include safety deposit keys or keys to another person’s home.

, You don’t want to be lugging around a super heavy keychain so you should remove items cluttering your key rings, such as membership cards, miniature tools, and decorative items. Remove items that do not have a function or that you rarely use to reduce the bulk of your keychain. This will make finding specific keys easier.

, You should sort out duplicate keys, such as car keys. Then place these keys together on a keychain in a safe place., Haven’t used a key in many years? Dispose of keys like this that no longer have any value to you.You may find that you have keys from old homes or workplaces that are no longer necessary for you to own.

, Purchase key covers/caps in your favorite colors as a way to identify the general use of keys. Place the same colored key covers on all keys with that same function, and this will help you quickly find the key you need on your keychain.


For example, you might differentiate keys by color for your home, for other people’s homes, or for work.
You can also color code at home by painting the tops of keys with nail polish., If you were having trouble remembering the function of several keys, attach a label to those for easier identification in the future. You can purchase a key tag or ring from office supply stores on which you can write the key’s function.


Labeling keys will also ensure that you do not keep keys that are no longer needed. For example, if you throw out an old jewelry box with a lock, the corresponding key's label will remind you to throw the key out as well.

, Once you have determined how many groupings of keys you have, you’ll need keychains for them. There are a variety of keychains you might choose: a standard ring keychain, a carabiner, a pocket clip key system, or a speciality keyring, such as a box that stores keys out of sight. You can also make your own simple keychain with a zip tie.Don’t enjoy bulky, noisy keys? Look for a speciality key system that will store your keys compactly and without any noises.
If you’re feeling crafty, make a key storage system yourself by removing the tops of keys and storing them in a swiss army knife.Some keychains come with a part that detaches so you can easily add or remove another set of keys to it. This might be a good option if you want to be able to attach or remove keys that are used more infrequently to your daily keychain.

, Find a designated home for each of your groups of keys so you can quickly locate them. You can get creative with this by finding a unique key organizing rack that you purchase or make yourself. If you want your keys out of sight put them together in a cabinet with hooks or a drawer organized with dividers so the keys will not get lost. If you have sensitive keys, such as one for a personal or bank safe, place your keys out of sight in a drawer.
Label lovers can place labels on key hooks for different members of your household.

Measure the area on your wall where you want to install the pegboard.,
Buy a piece of pegboard.,
Purchase furring strips to use as a frame.,
Find a paint color that you want to use on your pegboard.,
Paint the pegboard a few days ahead of time in the garage or outdoors.,
Use a stud finder to mark off your wall studs.,
Ask a friend to help you install the furring strips.,
Raise the pegboard up to cover the framing strips.,
Screw the pegboard into the furring strips using 3/4 inch screws with washers.,
Buy a pegboard organizer kit.,
Lay the hangers out on a large table.,
Install from the table to the pegboard to ensure the proper layout.

,
Add additional screws and washers if your pegboard moves extensively when you install the hangers.

",How to Install Pegboard," You should know the length and width of the area before you go to the home improvement store.;
, Pegboard is usually sold in two by four, four by four and four by eight foot pieces. If you want an exact size, buy the larger size of pegboard and ask the large home improvement store to cut it to size.


Most box stores will do this free of charge or for a nominal fee.
You can also install several pegboard sections in tiles along your wall.

, Cut them to the width of your pegboard.A frame will allow you space between the wall and board to connect hangers. It will also support the pegboard and avoid damage to your wall.

, It is sold in white or brown and can be left unpainted if you choose. In order to make a camouflaged pegboard for a craft room or kitchen, paint your pegboard the same color as your walls.You can also use spray paint to create a contrasting pegboard installation.

, Painting in advance will reduce the smell of the paint. It will also mean the paint is cured before you hang anything.

, If you can’t find the studs and you are hanging the pegboard on drywall, install wall anchors every 16 inches so that the pegboard is adequately supported.Drilling into studs is preferable, since pegboards are often used to hang heavy tools or kitchen pots and pans.

, Hold them horizontally across the wall and place a level on top. Adjust until it is level, and then ask a friend to hold the strip while you drill long wood screws through the furring strips and into the studs or wall anchors.


For a small pegboard, two horizontal furring strips should be adequate. For larger installations, use three or four.
Drill pilot holes through the furring strips before you place them against the wall and after you level it, so that you can match the strip with the wall anchor.

, Ensure it is level and then get ready to mount it with help from a friend.

, Screw the pegboard in at regular intervals, such as six inches apart, in a horizontal line. Repeat with remaining furring strips to secure the pegboard to the wall.

, Make sure it matches up to the pegboard interval of the board you purchased. Pegboards are available in 1/4 and 1/8 inch (0.6 and 0.3cm) holes.

, Experiment with the configuration by placing the tools, craft supplies or kitchen supplies next to the hanger.

Place hooks on it so you can hang small hand tools, attach larger tools like rakes or shovels, and create places for gloves, twine or other items you use in your garden. A pegboard is a versatile organizing tool that can be adapted to your needs and the tools you need to store.;
, Store shovels, rakes, hand tillers and other large gardening tools together. Gather up smaller hand tools and put them in one central location. This may be on a shelf, in a bucket or hanging on a wall. Regardless where you put them, store them together.

, Providing several levels that you can use to hang items, a trellis is a nice, decorative organizing tool for your storage area.

, Nail a bucket firmly to a wall. Wrap the garden hose around it until it hangs on its own. Insert your sprinkler into the mouth of the bucket. You've just created a cheap way to get your hose organized and up off the ground.

, If you have a table to place near it, that's even better. The cabinet can be used to store extra pots, potting soil, tools, seeds and other gardening necessities. The cabinet should be made from a material that will withstand the outdoor elements.

, Wash them and remove all labels. Use these jars to store packaged or loose seeds, bulbs or other small items you use when you are gardening. The jars keep the small items from being exposed to the weather or from blowing away.

, With the spout pointing down, insert twine spools into the mouths of the funnels. Thread the twine downward through the tip of the spout. Not only does this keep your twine organized and untangled, but it also gets these items off your tabletop and creates more usable storage space.

If you're seriously disorganized, lay out everything in a pile and start to go through it slowly.


If you’ve got an especially cluttered or greasy toolbox, it’s usually a good idea to lay down some kind of barrier so you won’t make a mess. Some old cardboard works fine, or a tarp if you can spare it. It's usually best to do it outside in the yard or on the driveway, rather than on the kitchen table.;
, When you've removed everything from it, take the opportunity to give your toolbox a good scrubbing. It's common to use a little dab of paint thinner to cut through the serious grease, if you've been working on cars, or a lighter wipe-down is fine if it's not as dirty. It doesn't need to be spotless–you're not eating off it–but it'll be easier to stay organized if it's clean.If you're using acetone to clean up your tools, make sure you're in a well-ventilated area and take frequent breaks to make sure you're not getting lightheaded.

, Examine each one of your tools and clean them up as you work. Use the same rag and some paint thinner to scrub grease off of your tools. Make sure that your tools are still in good working order, free of rust and other imperfections. Make certain that your tools still work properly, that all socket wrenches still have well-greased action and good motion, that adjustable wrenches still adjust properly, and that any other tools work as they're supposed to.

, Start by throwing out loose screws, washers, and nails that are serving no purpose. If any of your tools are broken or rusted beyond easy repair, discard them. Get rid of anything that's just taking up space.


Hang onto things you can identify, if you want to. If you're struggling with a big hoard of little fasteners and other bits, though, it might be a good idea to start clearing things out. Good rule of thumb: if you can't identify it, put it in the garbage.

, What absolutely needs to be in your toolbox? Make sure you have the most basic tools on hand for quick repairs. Depending on your purposes and your projects, most people will need, at the very least, a screwdriver set with both flat-head and Phillips screwdrivers of a variety of sizes, a good quality hammer, a wrench set, a pair of pliers, a tape measure, flashlight, utility knife, gloves and safety glasses. A carpenter's level and an electric drill are also important basic tools, but might not fit in most portable toolboxes.

, Examine the toolbox you've been using and get honest with yourself. Are you trying to keep ten pounds of tools in a nine pound bag? If so, it might be time to upgrade. Once you've combed through your tool collection, decide what you need to work with. For most people, even people will fairly large tool collections, a single portable toolbox with the most popular tools plus one draw-style storage box should be plenty sufficient.


Use a small primary toolbox that’s easy to manage. It’s better to get a smaller unit to start with and then add as you acquire more tools. You don’t need a massive tool chest that you could live in that’s going to sit around half-empty.
Buy a larger drawer-style toolbox to store your bigger tools and inessential items securely. Choose one that comes with a tray on top for bits, screws, and other items. This is a handy place to put these small items when you are working on a project so they aren’t lost.

, There's no one way to organize a toolbox, but the best way to get started is to create piles, placing like tools with like tools. How you choose to do this will be up to you, and it will depend on the tools you've got in your collection, but there are a few good strategies to keep in mind as you're sorting. In general, though, you just want to keep tools that belong next to one another next to one another, so you don't have to dig through a complete mess to find what you're looking for.

, In one area, keep fasteners like screws, bolts, washers, and anything related to securing one thing to another in its own little tray. Keep your screwdrivers in one drawer and keep your wrenches in another. Pair the function of the tools with the location of the tools.

, If you specialize in a few common projects, then you might assign drawers, shelves, or individual boxes to their own project. If you always need your grease gun and your socket set at the same time, keep them in the same drawer. If you always need your plumber's wrench and your Philips set at the same time, keep them together.

, Put your most frequently used tools at the front and put less frequently used tools toward the back, where you won't have to worry about them. Alternatively, you could even assign separate drawers or boxes for ""most common"" and ""least common,"" to create miscellaneous categories that you'll know to look in.

, For sockets and basic wrench sets, if you've got multiple sizes and increments, it can be a real pain to dig through an unorganized drawer trying to look for the right one. Separate them into separate locations to make finding one a lot more quick.

, Wrench organizers called rails are commonly sold at hardware stores. These allow you to quickly scan and snap your tools into and out of place. You can even keep them arranged in their proper order, so you won't have to spend a bunch of time scanning for the right one. They're cheap and useful.


If you don't have a rail or don't want them, try to bundle loose wrenches in an old rag or a small sack for your portable box. At least they'll all be in the same place and won't be rattling around loudly.

, If your tools are grease-magnets, lining the bottom of the box with a piece of cardboard will help to soak it up and keep it from dirtying your tools and even dripping out of the box. It's a crude method, maybe, but it works.

, Get out a permanent marker and some masking tape and start labeling every drawer, every box, every little thing in which you've hidden something. The first couple of weeks after a big reorganization can be the most frustrating, and you'll make it a whole lot easier on yourself if you clearly mark everything in your workshop and make it easy to identify.

, It's easy to get locked into a serious tool collection. If you're the kind of person with three of the exact same screwdriver, just in case you lose one or someone needs an extra, it can make organization a challenge. Separating extras from your primary use tools, though, is a good way of clearing up the mess and making your workspace a lot more manageable.


Hang some pegboard in your workshop and hang either hooks, for easy-to-hang tools, or hang little baskets for things like screws and other smaller items. Keep them visible, but out of the way on the board.

, In general, it's a good idea to invest in a few little storage trays at the hardware store to keep things like screws, nails, and other tiny fasteners you might not want to part with. It's great to have that stuff on hand if and when you need it, but finding a place for it is a challenge.


Alternatively, save old milk jugs, coffee cans, and other little containers for keeping screws and other fasteners in. Make sure you mark them clearly. If you keep them small enough, you can even pop them into your portable box when you need them for a job., Imagine your grandfather's coming to visit tomorrow and will want to look through your toolbox. Avoid the lecture and always remember to put your tools away clean. If they work for you, work to take care of them.


Use a rag to wipe oil and grime off of tools, then place them in their assigned places. You don't have to scrub them, but cleaning them up a bit will keep your tools from rusting and losing life.

, When you're done using a wrench, don't just toss it on the ground to worry about later. Put it away if you're done using it. It's easier to clean up as you go along rather than trying to clean up a big mess at the end of the day. That's when it gets tempting to just throw a wrench wherever, toss a file in with the screwdrivers, and start making a mess. Don't let yourself recreate the mess you got rid of. Head it off at the pass.

Find the perfect container for your home toolkit.,
Have a sensible budget.,
Stock the toolkit.,
Add some miscellaneous options, as needed.",How to Stock Your Home Toolkit," You might purchase an actual toolbox, a plastic storage box, or you could buy a cute basket. Whatever you choose, if you are planning on giving the home tool kit as a gift, you can arrange the tools inside the toolbox or the basket to make a creative gift. Even if you are buying the tools to make your own tool kit, a basket would be a fun place to keep your tools and can be a part of your home decoration. An actual toolbox is the best choice for organizing your tools.;
, Preparing a toolkit shouldn't cost you a fortune but you do need to buy quality items. You may have to spend a little more money, but quality tools are less likely to need replacing for several years (or even generations if they're really good). Quality tools will usually perform the job better and may even be safer.


If you can't afford the tools you'd like, don't opt for the cheaper versions. Look for secondhand tools in garage sales, yard sales, pawn shops, and auctions. Provided they're good quality to begin with and have been well cared for, being used isn't usually an issue. Older style tools were built to last, so they might only need a bit of cleaning and sharpening to put them back into first rate condition.

, There are a number of tools that are recommended for your toolkit, and while every home is different, there are some tools that are basic must-haves and others that you can decide on adding for your own particular needs. The basics are as follows:

Every home needs a hammer. Be sure to purchase a good sturdy hammer. You will want to buy one that has a claw for removing nails.






A set of screwdrivers is a must. Try to purchase a set that has different sizes, including both a slotted (flat) screw head and a Phillips (cross-shaped) screw head.






Include a spanner. An adjustable spanner is useful for many DIY needs.






Find a set of pliers. These are as handy as the spanner. The needle-nose pliers are especially handy to have around the house.






Be sure to include a wrench. This is important when working with pipes and stuck nuts.







Drill with drill bits. Whether or not you select a hand drill or a power drill is up to you but basic electric or battery-powered drills are not that expensive.






If you have a garden, be sure to include a handsaw in the toolkit. This should have a quality spring steel blade and a solid handle; they come in toolkit sizes.






Your home toolkit should include a roll of duct tape and a roll of masking tape. There are many creative colors and sizes of duct tape these days. Choose your favorite. As for the masking tape, it's useful for writing on, for tidying cables, for protecting edge surfaces when painting, and many other uses besides.






Every home should have a flashlight (torch); no-one wants to be caught in the dark without a flashlight. A rechargeable flashlight is the best kind to purchase.






Include a tape measure in your home tool kit. This is one item you will use over and over again. Consider purchasing one with both standard (imperial) and metric units of measure as this will stop you hunting for conversions.







, The following items might also be handy additions to your toolkit: An electric screwdriver, a utility (Stanley) knife, a putty knife, a staple gun, a pack of nails and screws, and/or a plunger for plumbing jobs.


Lubricant spray and key lock graphite or spray are handy to keep in a toolkit, to fix squeaking hinges, stuck locks bolts, and for preventing rust of metallic items.
Consider keeping a stepladder or a folding stool in the vicinity of the toolkit. While it won't physically fit inside the toolkit, it's a standard DIY item that you really can't do without.






Get safety glasses that fit you well and make a habit of wearing them.

Buy the right toolbox for your needs.,
Decide on the type and size of toolbox you need by considering the tools you will store in them as well as how you will use those tools.,
Stand back and look at the assembled tools.",How to Buy a Toolbox," The wrong type or size can be a waste of money. The types available are varied in the materials they are made of and their size.


High impact plastic tool boxes come in a variety of sizes and setups. The most common found - and bought - are 18 x 8 x 9 inches (40.6 x 20 x 20 cm) with a plastic tote tray that sits inside. You can buy toolboxes in many sizes up to multiple-level and some are attached together with hinges with wheels for ease of moving about.
Toolboxes made from sheet metal are often made in first-year shop classes and highly valued by their makers. You can find metal toolboxes that start in the same size range as plastic toolboxes. These go up to tool cabinets with multiple-sized drawers mounted on casters.
Another type is not really a toolbox, but rather a tool bag. This heavy-duty cloth bag has its limits, but is popular for its light weight, multiple pockets and quick access to tools. This type makes a good toolkit to carry in the trunk of a car or behind the seat of a pickup.;
,


Assemble all of your tools, and then lay them out in the way you want to group them. As an example, put your SAE and metric sockets and wrenches in 2 different groups with special-purpose tools like flare nut wrenches, for high pressure lines, in another.
Some tools need to be stored separately for special purposes, such as woodworking or mechanical tools. A carpenter's toolbox, for example, is designed to carry the saws, squares and chisels that a carpenter or woodworker might use on a job site.

, Now, decide if there are any you transport frequently while others you use only occasionally. Divide these tools into separate groups.

Make sure that the medium you are coiling is clean and ready to be put away.,
Your dominant hand will be the coiling hand, your non-dominant hand will just hold the coil.,
If you are holding the line in your left hand (you are right-handed) and the end is facing towards your body, this means that you will be coiling counter-clockwise.,
Run your coiling hand (the dominant) along the line from your holding hand until you have both arms spread wide (an wingspan of rope).

,
Bring your dominant hand toward your holding hand and use your index finger and thumb to twist the line in the direction that you want the coil to go (usually a 180-360 degree twist does the trick).

,
Lay the rope into your holding hand and you should have the first of many neat, non-kinking coils.

,
Repeat 4-6 with the next arm lengths of rope until you reach the last arm length.

,
With this last length of line you can finish the coil in a variety of ways.,

",How to Coil Any Kind of Cord,";
, Take one end of the cord or rope into your non-dominant hand. Have the end fall about an inch out of your hand either towards you or away from you. This will determine whether the line will be coiled clockwise or counter-clockwise.

, If the end is facing away from you, the coiling will be clockwise. The opposite will be true for left-handed coilers.

,,,,, One simple way is to take the last length of rope and wrap it three or four times around the outside of the coils that you made, then thread the end through the upper of the area between the coils and pull it tight, the coil should now be secured and you can use the extra length to tie the coil to something in order to store the line.

",How to Sew a Tool Roll Up from Old Jeans," You want just the cylindrical or tube-shaped part, so cut just below where the two legs come together. Cut the leg open along one seam only. Cut off the open seam and cut off the bottom hem. You should now have a flat piece of material that is wider on one end than the other. There will be one side seam or inseam in the middle of it, which is fine.;
,, These hems will run roughly parallel to the old seam. You can do a double-fold hem or a single fold hem, but denim is tough fabric to sew on some machines, so make a single-fold hem if you are concerned about sewing through too many layers later on. It may fray a little along the edge, but it'll add character. The tools won't mind.

, You can see in this photo how the hems from the previous step should fall.

, Make the length generous. You can use ribbon, paracord, shoelaces, webbing, etc. Choose something sturdy.

, Make a sandwich with the material right sides together and the two ties between. Pin them at the long end only. Arrange the two ties on the wider end, as shown. Place them about one third and two thirds of the way up the long side. The ties will not be attached to the short side.

,,, When inside out, the ties should be inside.

,, Two ties should be sticking out the long end.

,, Pin.

, The bag portion is complete.


, This roll-up has five pockets, but you can sew as many or as few as you have space and tools for. You can measure and mark or just eyeball the spacing. Remember that tools have thickness as well, so allow extra width if a pocket is for a specific tool or tools.

Familiarize yourself with the parts of the extension ladder.,
Understand why extension ladders are considered dangerous.,
Know what your ladder is capable of handling.,
Inspect the ladder before use.,
Move the ladder.,
Begin to position the ladder.,
Raise the fly section.,
Lock in the fly in place with the rung locks.,
Lower the ladder carefully to the structure.,
Use the ladder.",How to Use an Extension Ladder," There are a few basic parts of the extension ladder that you should be familiar with before you attempt to use it.Here are the most important:


The safety shoe or foot of the ladder consists of the pads that are designed to be in contact with the ground when the ladder is in use. These typically will swivel or rotate slightly in order to be make better contact with the surface the ladder is on.
The fly section is the portion of the extension ladder that will be extended upward. This is the portion that you will climb as you get closer to the top. Additionally, it should be noted that some extension ladders have a two-part fly (and three primary ladder components in total).
The base section is the portion of the extension ladder that will remain in place. When you begin to climb the ladder, you will start out on the rungs of this section.
The rung lock is attached to the fly and is used to keep the fly in place by fitting over the top of a rung of the base or fly section underneath. It will essentially act as a bracket, and the fly will not be able to slide down after weight if put on it.
The rope and pulley are used to extend the largest of extension ladders. Smaller ladders do not have this component, but larger ones are essentially unusable if this is broken.;
, Serious injuries resulting from the use (or misuse) of extension ladders are so common that they have developed a bit of a reputation. Knowing how they earned that reputation--and how those accidents could have been prevented-- can help you stay safe.


Extension ladders typically only have two points of contact with the ground. Some varieties of smaller ladders fold out to create four separate points of contact with the ground. Extension ladders typically have nothing other than the ""feet"" or ""shoes"" on the two side rails. Consequently, they can be a bit unstable.
Extension ladders are among the tallest available in retail sales outlets. It is not merely that their height makes for longer falls (though that is true as well). Instead, the height only accentuates the preexisting instability issues. Think of the ladder as a lever. When you climb the ladder, the weight is actually moved closer to the end of the lever.
People commonly misuse extension ladders. Because of their instability issues, there are certain precautions that must be taken. First, two people must be involved in the use of the ladder. When one person climbs, another must be available to ""foot"" the ladder (hold it in place). Secondly, the ladder cannot be used a vertical or near-vertical angles. Instead, they must bed tilted or leaned on to another object for support as a person climbs to the top (more on this in a moment). This will minimize the ""leverage"" issue previously noted.

, Each ladder is capable of bearing a different quantity of weight, and you must know how much yours can handle before you you use it. There are a number of ladder classification systems in use--several of which use very similar terminology to mean rather different things--and so it is not practical to list them here. Regardless of type, your ladder should state directly on it (at least when it is new) how much weight it can bear. Do not ever exceed that limit.







, Damage to the rungs, the rung lock, or pulley could make it dangerous or impractical to use an extension ladder. Look the ladder over carefully before you begin use.

, It should be locked in place using the rung lock or other safety feature. If the fly slides as you are moving the ladder, fingers and hands could be pinched or broken as they get caught between the fly and the base or between the rungs of the two sections.

, Move the ladder into place (without yet extending it) and set it down on the shoe or foot that is attached to the base. For most extension ladders the fly should be on top of the base--that is, not only should it extend higher, but should on the outer/climbable side.Understand that in order to obtain the proper climbing angle, the base of the ladder should be 1/4 of the height of the extended ladder away from the building. For example, if the working height of the extended ladder is 12 feet (3.66 m), the base of the ladder should be 3 feet (.914 m) away from structure., If your ladder uses a pulley, simply pull on the rope to extend the ladder. If not, push the fly up manually.


Make sure that the base of the ladder is continuously footed (with at least one person holding both rails of the base continuously) during the raising process.
Observe extreme caution if extending the ladder in windy conditions.
If working on or examining a roof, extend the ladder to about 3 feet (.914 m) above the working height., This will ensure that the fly will not slide closed while climbing the ladder.








, making sure that you continue to foot the ladder so that the base of the ladder does not kick out. Make sure that both sides of the ladder have good contact with the structure. If one edge of the ladder is not touching the structure, it is not safe and no one should climb the ladder.

, Climb the ladder one rung at a time. Maintain a hold with both hands as you move your feet up each rung. Do not carry other items in your hands at this time. If you need small tools with you, place them in a tool belt that you can carry around your waist.









If you are fully extending the ladder, you should use a tie down or bungee cord to secure the ladder in place. Wrap it around the top part of the ladder, and secure it to the building.

Locate a level workspace.,
Consult your owner's manual.,
Find the ""curb weight"" for your vehicle and make sure that your jack stands are rated for that weight.,
Set the vehicle's parking brake.,
Use a floor jack to lift the car.,
Install the jack stand under a solid, structural piece of the vehicle frame.,
Take out the initial jack and repeat this process for the other side of the vehicle.,
Test your jack stands.,
Add backup safety objects.",How to Use Jack Stands," Jacking up a vehicle on an incline or other uneven surface is extremely unsafe. Make sure your work space is level and the area under the vehicle is correctly paved and firmly supported.;
, The owner's manual for a vehicle generally has information about safe practices for raising your vehicle off the ground.

, It's important to have stands with an adequate safety rating for the size of your car or truck.You can find this in your owners manual, online, or on the plaque in your door jamb








, This will prevent the vehicle from rolling while it is supported. In addition, use wheel chocks on both sides (front and rear) of the wheels opposite (front or rear) to where you are lifting to prevent the car from moving forward or backward. A car lurching forward or backward can fall off the jack and injure or even kill you. WARNING: Chocks are essential when the rear wheels are lifted since the parking brake usually sets on the rear wheels. Without a chock, the front wheels can roll even if your parking brake is on.








, Many cars come with a standard jack (like a scissor jack) and wrench that ship with the vehicle from the factory but these are not for standard use, only for only emergency tire changes. For regular jobs, use a floor jack, a generic jack that can lift all vehicles effectively, such as a hydraulic trolley jack. Only use the jack on a solid, level surface such as concrete. Never use jack stands on soil, wet ground, or hot asphalt since the weight of the car can cause the jack stands to sink into the ground and the car can fall off them when they slip. 








, Your owner's manual will likely have information about where to support the vehicle with jack stands. Generally, your vehicle will have a small divot in the chassis near the wheel where you can put the jack stand.









Make sure not to put the jack stand under elements like the floorboards of the vehicle. This may cause the jack to break through the floor. Also, do not put the jack stand under a moving part such as an element of the suspension of the vehicle.

, Experts recommend using at least two jack stands of the same heights so that the vehicle is supported equally on both sides.








, When the jack stands are in place, push the vehicle with your hand to see if it moves or shakes. Make sure you push from both sides and the rear. If it shakes, reorient the jack stands (after using the jack) until the vehicle is stable.

, Though jack stands and wheel chocks provide good stability, it is worth being extra cautious with your life on the line. For additional safety, raise the jack under a solid point under the car to the extent to where it is snug but not supporting the weight of the car (the jack stands should continue to do this). Also, you can put a spare tire (with rim) or blocks of wood under the car to catch the car if it falls. Never, ever, use concrete blocks or bricks since these can crumble under the weight of the car.

Round up the necessary supplies.,
Cut the wire hanger at the bottom, right in the middle.,
Thread the open ends of the wire through the spool.,
Close off the wire hanger so that the spool stays in place.,
Loop the string over the top of the pulley.,
Hang the pulley system up, making sure it can spin freely.,
Tie the weight to one end of the string, Pulley's make your work easier by distributing the weight and forces across the ""different"" sides of strings created by the pulley.,
Pull down on one end of the rope to bring the weight up with ease.,
Ask yourself some questions, adjusting the pulley to test your experiment.",How to Build a Pulley1," Pulleys are simple machines, and excellent ways to teach kids about forces, gravity, and efficiency. To make simply pulleys, you should round up the following supplies, though there are substitutes available if you're missing something. They will be discussed later.


Wire coat hanger
String, rope, or cord (at least 10 feet)
Wooden spool, like those found for thread (with a hole through the center)
A weight to test, like a half-filled milk jug, book, piece of pipe, etc.;
, Open it up so that you can thread the spool through the coat hanger. The spool, which will function as you pulley, in the center of the wire. The top of the hanger can be held or hung from the ceiling to make your pulley free-standing. If you don't have a coat hanger, you can use:


Long skewers, dowels, or rods that you hold on either side.
String threaded through the spool, then tied up above.

, Gently pry the cut in the wire open and put the spool on the coat hanger. The less you try and bend things, the easier it will be to get the spool on while keeping the wire in place.If you can't get a wooden spool, try out:


Pre-made pulley wheels, found at most hardware stores for $5 or less.
Pulley wheels found in toy sets, like K'Nex building blocks.
Old ribbon spool, like for ribbon used in gift wrapping.
Toilet paper or paper towel roll, in a pinch.

, You may have to bend the wire right around the spool, kinking it slightly to keep the spool in place if it is too heavy for the wires. A good way to do this is to push both sides of the hanger close together so it is about half as wide as it was originally, then turn the two ends up so nothing can slide past them., It isn't a complicated stringing. You just want the string draped over the top of the pulley. When you pull down on one end of the string, the other end will get shorter as it moves up.


If you plan on doing a lot of experiments with pulleys, you could tie a small metal hook to one end of the string, allowing you to hang and test different weights from it with ease., Hang the top of the clothes hanger up so that the spool and string hang and can spin with ease. You could have a friend hold the top of the clothes hanger as well. If you're using a rod or towel around the spool, you can place two chairs near each other and balance the dowel on the tops of the two backs., It also makes it easier to pick something up, because you get to pull the string down, using gravity to assist you. Feel how heavy your weight (half-full milk container, textbook, etc.) is before trying it on the pulley for comparison.


If you and your school have force meters, use them to test and record the weight before using a pulley.

, Even rough pulleys (the wheel doesn't turn well, the string catches, etc.) will make it easier to pull up the book. Why? Because you're moving with gravity by pulling down, making the motion more efficient. More complicated and fine tuned pulleys, called ""block and tackle"" can even make it possible for one person to lift a car by themselves, though they require many pulleys acting together. Test the weight with a force meter to see just how much easier your pulley makes lifting things.

, Do things happen if the string gets longer? What if you used a bigger or smaller pulley wheel? Pulleys teach a lot about forces, gravity, and machines -- what can you learn? Focus on finding ways to make the pulley more efficient to test how each part works.


What would happen if you added two more pulleys to the system, threading the string through them? Would it get easier to lift or harder? Easier.

Does the weight raise up the same amount as you pull the string back? Yes -- the length of the string stays the same, so the length on both sides of the pulley will always add up to the same number

Disassemble the entire clamp.,
Hold the bar vertically.,
With the bar still vertical (between your legs), slide the mechanism case so that the bar protrudes up through the hole on the end opposite the pad about 3 inches (8 cm).,Place the oblong hole in the leaf spring over the exposed end of the bar such that other end of the leaf spring points down.,
Slide the ""flat"" coil spring over the exposed end of the bar and down to the leaf spring.,
Slide the flat steel ratchet plate over the exposed end of the bar and slide it down to the flat coil spring.

,
Hook the hooked-end ratchet plate around the pin in the plastic ratchet handle.,
Note that this step may require several attempts to master, but it really is easy.,
Carefully slide the assembly down on the bar so that the bar just protrudes through the trigger opening.,
Test the mechanism a little to see that the ratchet works.,
Place the end pad on one or the other end of the bar, depending upon whether you want a clamp or a spreader, then insert the pins in holes at the bar ends.

",How to Reassemble an E Z Hold II Bar Clamp," Make certain to catch the three springs. Hold the mechanism together as it slides off the bar. Remove the trigger and the spring under it, too. You must have all of the following parts available to make the clamp work when it is reassembled:


The bar and two plastic retainer pins––save the pins for later. (See Tips below if these are missing.)
The end pad––save for later.
The plastic mechanism case.
The plastic ratchet handle.
The ""flat"" coil spring––this is about 2 inches long.
The leaf spring––this is about 4 inches long, flat, with and oblong hole and a bend.
A flat steel ratchet plate.
A steel ratchet plate with a hook on the end.
The steel release trigger.
The V-shaped trigger spring.;
, With the ratchet groves facing away from you, fit the plastic mechanism case over the end of the bar and slide it on, going through the hole in the end opposite the pad, through the U-shaped guide inside, and then through the trigger hole in the pad-end. If it does not slide easily, flip the bar upside down and try the other end., The ratchet groves must face the inside of the case. Let the case rock back to reveal the end of the bar.

,,  Either end can go down.,, With the pin end of the handle up, and the hook pointing up, slide the plate into the second hole in the handle such that the plate sits nearly flat against the handle end.  The hook must catch on the pin such that the hook folds over the pin and points to that end of the handle. If it points toward the open U-shaped end of the handle, it will not work.


Thread the hook-end ratchet plate and handle over the exposed end of the bar, placing your index finger on the hook to keep the plate flat to the handle end. 
Slide the handle down to the flat ratchet plate.

,

 

The first trick is to make sure the end of the bar is even with the handle opening. 
The second trick is to grab the handle with your hand, sliding your finger under the leaf spring with your thumb on top of the ratchet hook. 
Squeeze to compress the flat coil spring against the ratchet plates and handle end. 
Then slide into the space in the mechanism cover between the U-shaped guide and the trigger end. 
Push it in so that the end of the bar is visible through the trigger opening.

,


 

Place the two free legs of the trigger spring down into the cup around the trigger opening, then place the unhooked end of the trigger into the notch in the mechanism cover with the trigger hook pointing up. 
Depress the trigger slightly and slide it over the end of the bar and the entire assembly down on the bar 6 inches.

, Check that it moves the mechanism up on the bar and that the trigger must be squeezed to move the mechanism down on the bar.,"

Choose a weight-bearing installation spot in your ceiling.,
Purchase a simple fixed pulley system.,
Run the axle through the center of the wheel.,
Secure the axle to the ceiling using the screws included.,
Ensure that the wheel can spin freely.,
Thread the rope on the top of the pulley.,
Tie the weight to one end of the string or attach a hook to make a reusable pulley.,
Test the pulley.",How to Build a Pulley2," You'll need to screw the pulley into a ceiling joist or rafter, not just the drywall on the ceiling. Pulley's are made to handle heavy objects with ease, but this weight will all have to be carried by the screws in the ceiling. If you don't know how to find the right spot for installation, you may want to hire outside assistance building a pulley.

, You can, of course, try and craft your own pulley wheel, buy an axle, and then get a mounting bracket that fits your wheel and axle. However, when most simply pulley wheels and brackets are already less than $20, this isn't really worth the risk. A pre-purchased system has everything already measured and tested, ensuring it fits.

, If your wheel doesn’t include an axle that you can easily secure to an installation spot, you’ll need to insert an axle yourself. Simply run it through, placing a little WD40 along the length if it is sticking at all.

, Attach the axle securely to a wall or ceiling using appropriate hardware. You’ll usually want to use hammer and nails to hammer the axle in place, or use a power drill and long screws for higher-weight systems. Again, if this makes you uncomfortable, you should likely call a professional handyman or experienced friend.


Oftentimes your ""block,"" or the fixed pulley, will have a hook. In this case, simply bolt a ring to the ceiling and hook the block onto the ring., Make sure that you wheel can move without resistance. Tighten all the screws so that nothing is jiggling, and use a little mechanical grease in the moving parts if there are any sticky spots.

, You thread the rope along the “track” or sheave running between the grooves around the outside of the wheel. Make sure it is on the top half., Take the end of the string you won't be pulling and attach a weight. You could tie the string to the object or create a simple hook.

, Pull on the other end of the rope and let the pulley change the direction of the force. If the pulley works, you should be able to raise the object all the way up to the axle.

"

Diagram the pulley system before buying or installing anything.,
Ensure you have a secure platform to adhere the pulleys too.,
Install your pulleys to the plank or ceiling according to your schematic.,
Feed rope through the bottom of the movable pulley.,
Insert the rope into the other two pulleys.,
Secure the object you want to lift to the movable pulley.",How to Build a Pulley3," Pulley systems are a great way to lift heavy objects with minimal effort, but they need to be properly set up to have any chance of working. Look up specific diagrams online, as people have posted systems for every variety of pulley imaginable. Know, as you read the schematics, the differences in pulleys:



Fixed: The pulley wheel spins, but the whole thing stays in place. The rope is simply draped over the top. You pulling down on one half of the rope pulls the other half up. There is an axle in the middle of the wheel.

Movable Pulley: The pulley has a hook in the center, not an axle. As such, it is almost always used with other pulleys. As you pull the rope, the area around the pulley shortens, lifting/lowering the weight and pulley together. The weight is usually attached to pulley by the hook.

Double pulley: Best seen in an example: think of a hanging PowerPoint screen. You pull the cord on one side, but both sides go up identically -- this is because the same rope is looped on both sides. It goes through the left side, to the right, then back to the double pulley on the left, where you pull the string down.Look into a block and tackle system. The block and tackle just refers to the apparatus of pulleys and rope you’re using, where the rope is threaded 2-4 times on the same pulley. Block and tackles usually come with specific instructions for assembly., You want everything to be on a load-bearing post or stud. If you don't have secure areas close together for the screws, you can build a platform. Attach two blocks to a 2x4 plank. These are known as the “standing blocks” because they stand in a fixed position to form fixed pulleys. Then attach the plank securely to your ceiling or roof.Attach them about a foot apart on a standard 2x4.


The 2x4 should be high enough to be slightly above the position where you want to lift the object with the compound pulley.

, For this example, you can use the most common M-shaped compound system. To do so, you install your pulleys in a line, with the two fixed pulleys on the outside and the moving pulley in the middle. The movable pulley is not installed into the ceiling, however -- it will be held up by the rope. For now, line up the two fixed pulleys and install them.


Make sure you use a level, straightedge, and careful measurement to ensure that the two fixed pulleys are aligned.
There should be the same amount of space between each fixed pulley and the movable pulley in the center., Begin using the rope on the third pulley, the one that is not attached to the board. This is called the moving block. The rope goes on the bottom of the wheel, and most movable pulleys have a small metal tab to keep the rope from coming out., Feed each side of the rope through the other two pulleys. The movable pulley will now be hanging from the tops of the two fixed pulleys. The rope will be on top of each fixed pulley and at the bottom of the movable one.The rope should look a bit like an ""M."" It will drape down from either pulley on the end. and come down to a ""point"" around the movable pulley in the middle.

, Attach whatever you’re lifting to the bottom of the movable pulley, securing it to the hook. You may need to step on or hold the rope to keep it from yanking down if you don't have a lot of slack.


Consider attaching a bucket or toolbox to the movable pulley.That way, you can easily transport multiple objects or objects that don’t attach well to the pulley itself.

Measure the wall in your home or garage where you want to hang the pegboard.,
Go to the hardware store.,
Find sheets of crown molding or trim at the hardware store.,
Pick up white caulk, finishing nails, wood glue, two pieces of scrap wood and long wood screws.,
Clear a clean work table for this project.,
Lay your pegboard on top of the table, facing up.,
Mark the 45-degree angle where two ends intersect with a pencil.,
Remove the molding.,
Set up a miter saw.,
Place the molding on the worktable.,
Place the pegboard back on the table, facing up.,
Glue the mitered corners together with strong wood glue.,
Flip the board and frame over when they are dried.,
Touch up the corners of the frame if needed.,
Find your two pieces of scrap wood.,
Use a stud finder tool to find the stud position on your wall.,
Ask a friend to help you hold the scrap pieces of wood up on the wall about one-third the way from the bottom and one-third down from the top.,
Have your friend hold the scrap wood level.,
Repeat in two places on each scrap of wood.,
Get a few friends to help you hold up the framed pegboard.,
Screw the pegboard into each wood support two to three times, through a hole in the pegboard.,
Insert your wire pegboard hangers.",How to Frame Pegboard," Use a retractable measuring tape. Remember to measure height and width twice to ensure accuracy.;
, Purchase a piece of pegboard that is bigger or equal to the size of your wall space. Ask the hardware store to cut the pegboard to the exact size.


Most hardware stores cut small sheets of wood and pegboard for free. Pre-cutting it will allow you to transport it more easily, and it will save you time.
Keep the extra pieces if you want to make and frame smaller pegboard organizers.
If you have a sheet of pegboard at home, use a circular saw to measure and cut the sheet to size.

, Buy one sheet of for each side, to serve as your frame. Each side should be about eight inches longer than the side’s measurement so that you can miter the corners into an attractive frame.

, You will also need some paint and tools if you don’t have them at home.

, If you don’t have a beat up table, you will want to cover the top in cardboard and wrap it with a drop cloth to avoid marring the top.

, Place your crown molding across each side. The molding will intersect at the four corners.

, Imagine this is the corner of the frame where the two ends come together. The angle should extend from the far corner, diagonally into the point where it meets the pegboard.Repeat on all four corners.
Although you should measure and mark the corners carefully, it does not have to be perfect, since you can sand and use caulk to account for discrepancies later.

, Paint the front of your pegboard in the color of your choice. If you prefer not to have colored pegboard, you can keep it the original tan or white color and paint the molding to compliment it.

, Cut at all the corners across your 45-degree pencil lines. Sand the edges slightly to remove unsightly bumps or chips.


Test the corners to ensure they line up.

, Paint them the same color as your pegboard or a complementary color. You may need two coats and a primer if they are a darker color than the board.


Allow them to dry completely before continuing.

, Then, lay the mitered molding into position.

, Also, place a layer of wood glue across the sides of the pegboard to glue the frame on top of the board. It is easier to do both steps at once since it will need plenty of time to dry.


Use clamps to hold the framed board in place overnight.

, Hammer finish nails into the frame and board, where they won’t show through the front. Use as many as possible to secure the board and frame together.

, Apply a bead of caulk into the mitered corners and smooth it down to fill the holes. Allow it to dry, and then paint over it with the original paint color.

, They should be at least two thirds as wide as your frame. You will use them to hang the pegboard securely, since hanging it directly into the wall can damage it.

, Mark a vertical line along the center of the stud with a pencil.

, They will create two parallel lines on which you can hang your pegboard. Hold the wood up and use a level to place it in the right position.

, Grab your power drill. Screw the scrap wood into the wall with long wood screws where it intersects with your stud.

, You should have two level parallel supports securely installed into your wall.

, You should be able to find where the pegboard crossed the wood supports. Level the pegboard using your spirit level.

, You may want to use a washer as well as a screw, to ensure a good distribution of weight., Hang your tools.

Select a secure foundation on which to build and set your scaffold.,
Opt for casters.,
Assemble the scaffolding frame.,
Make sure the scaffold is stable.,
Place the planks.,
Secure access to the scaffold.,
Attach the guardrails.,
Inspect the scaffolding to ensure safety.,
Finished.








",How to Erect Scaffolding," Obtain mud sills or base plates to attach the scaffolding to make the footing more stable. One of the main concerns here is to have the scaffolding level and on secure ground. If you are on unlevel ground, you my need to dig down to make the dirt level in any high corner. Also, use the adjusting screws on the scaffolding to level the structure. If the surface is on a drastic slope, obtain leg extensions.






;
, If you plan on moving your scaffolding to work on various spots, include casters in your scaffolding setup. Remember to lock the casters when you get it into place.








, Lay out the ends of the scaffolding. Lift one end piece, and attach the upper cross brace. The far end of this brace should support the end piece while you lift the second end piece and attach its upper cross brace. Secure the ends of the cross braces to the bottom of the opposite end frame.








, Move the scaffold into your desired position, and make sure it is level and secure.








, Lift the planks through the scaffold bars and into place. Hardware should be included to fasten the planks into place.








, If ladders are used to access the scaffold, use ones that are designed for that specific scaffold. Stair-like ladders can be used to access the scaffold but must have handrails and treading. A concern with the access point is to make it safe to maneuver and to prevent the scaffold from tipping over.








, Guardrails are highly recommended for all scaffolding due to the height of the equipment and the risk of falls. Also consider using tie offs and other fall protection.








, Thoroughly examine the scaffolding setup to make sure all pieces are secure. Reinspect the scaffold system every time you leave the site and return to it to make sure it is still safe.

Plan the scaffold project so that sufficient materials will be available for the job.,
Rent or purchase the items you will need for your project.,
Prepare the area where the scaffolding will be erected.,

Lay out the jacks according to the manufacturer's spacing, using adjustable support legs to make sure the first lift of jacks are level and plumb.,
Install all braces and connectors prior to proceeding to the next tier of jacks.,

Use scaffold boards to deck each level of scaffold before installing the next level.,

Install safety features as soon as possible at each level of scaffold construction.,

Tie off tall scaffold structures to the adjacent structure to prevent the scaffold from falling.,

Have the person responsible for overseeing the erection and use of the scaffold (under OSHA guidelines, this is the competent person) inspect the scaffold prior to use.,

Install outriggers and other accessories necessary for the work to be performed when needed.,
Stock the materials to be used from the scaffold on the scaffold deck.,Perform the job the scaffold has been built for, whether laying brick or block, installing insulation, waterproofing, or stucco, painting and/or caulking.,
Dismantle the scaffolding when the job is finished.,
Clean up the area where the scaffolding was used and store the scaffold until it is needed again.",How to Use a Masonry Scaffold," Scaffold can be rented, or purchased if you will be able to use it for numerous projects. The basic parts of a scaffold system include these items:

Scaffold jacks
Stacking pins
Leveling legs or base plates
Braces
Access ladders
Scaffold boards
Outriggers
Various clamps and pins for assembly.;
, There are a number of specialty rental companies that engineer and even assemble and disassemble scaffolding for projects. Having skilled workers erect the scaffolding is critical for safety and productivity, not to mention avoiding a possible fine by safety authorities like the OSHA (USA) or similar safety regulators., The ground or surface it will be erected on should be as level as possible, and soils should be compacted and have sufficient drainage to support the scaffold, even in wet weather., Installing the first level of scaffolding correctly will make completing the scaffold easier, and ensure the finished scaffold system will provide a safe, stable work platform when it is finished., Ladders should be furnished for access to each scaffold level, and workers should be provided with personal safety equipment such as gloves, safety glasses, and fall protection during the erection process., You may find you are able to install scaffold jacks with a minimal number of boards at each level, but since in normal masonry work there will be work to be performed from each level, having a complete deck will make stocking materials and accessing the work area safer and easier. Some things to consider when installing scaffold boards are:

Use appropriate boards. Usually, scaffold boards are 2X10 (5x25cm) planks either grade-stamped number 1, laminated veneer lumber, or pinned scaffold boards.
Lap scaffold planks 6 inches (15.24 cm) on each side crossing the top rail of the jacks. Standard jacks are spaced 7 feet (2.1 meters) on center, so 8 foot (2.4 meters) or 16 foot (5.33 meters) boards are standard.
Cleat or nail boards together if necessary, to ensure they do not shift or slip during use.
Discard any split, rotted, or damaged scaffold boards.
Fit scaffold boards as tightly together as possible so that the materials will not fall through cracks to lower scaffold levels during use.

, Handrails, toe-boards, and access gates should be installed before workers are allowed to work without fall protection, and materials are stocked on the scaffold deck., Depending on your location and work situation, government regulations may require scaffolds to be braced or supported before use. In the United States, the OSHA requires such bracing when a scaffold's height to width ratio 4 to 1 or greater. For example, a scaffold that is 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide has to be secured if it is 20 feet (6.09 meters) tall, or higher., Tags should be affixed at access locations and should include a daily inspection log that is signed and dated each day. Here are a few of the items which should be checked daily:

Check the scaffold support sills for erosion, undermining, and other deterioration.
Look for braces and support members which are damaged or have been removed during the previous shift.
Check the condition of the scaffold planks, handrails, and toe boards.
Make sure the work areas are clean and clear of debris.
Look for any other obvious signs of damage or broken clamps, braces, or pins.

, This will allow the workers to adjust the working height between each level, and enable them to work more efficiently., Large projects, and projects where large amounts of materials will be loaded at intervals, should have an access tower attached to the main scaffold system so that the weight of these materials will not be a hazard, and access for workers can be maintained on the scaffold deck. Avoid overloading scaffold decks. As a rule of thumb, any time the scaffold boards sag more than an inch (2.5 cm) or so, it is likely that they are overloaded.,, This is generally done in the reverse order of the assembly, and care should be taken to manage all materials so that they can be lowered safely to the ground. Cleaning loose debris and using buckets or bags to contain the small parts will help prevent items from being dropped where they may be damaged or lost, or workers could be injured., Rented scaffold should be counted and returned to the company it was rented from, and any damaged or missing items should be reported."

Mark the spot.,
Wedge the nail into the comb.,
Put the nail tip up against the indentation mark, holding the comb.,
Hold onto the comb with one hand and drive the nail into the wall with a hammer (or an electric screwdriver).",How to Keep a Nail Steady Using a Comb," Try using the tip of the nail or screw to make a small indentation, easy enough to see and center the tip of the nail or screw.


Having a small hole or indentation to start with will guide the tip keeping it where your hole and nail should be.
If it is difficult to see the indentation and you don't mind marks or stains on the wall, you can use a pencil or a marker to mark where the nail or screw should go.;
, The comb should pinch and hold the nail well enough to hold the nail steady and straight while you drive it in with a hammer or with a drill if it is a screw., Unless you have a good grip on the nail or screw when you commence driving it in the tip can slide or fall right off.


Having a small indentation or hole to guide and center the tip can save you many nails screws and even avoid some injuries.
If there is not enough pressure holding the nail or the angle of your nail and hammer or if the drill are not leveled or straight, the nail could end up bending or flying off.

, If the nail and comb combo match up properly, the comb should hold the nail in place as you hammer away.

Raise the ladder.,
Set the ladder at a 75° angle with the ground.,
Make sure the feet are secure.,
Make sure the top of the ladder is secure.,
Climb the ladder maintaining three points of contact.,
Utilize accessories to help stabilize the top of the ladder.,
Avoid aluminium ladders when working with electricity.,
Inspect your ladder for damage often.,
Refer to your ladder’s safety label.",How to Climb a Ladder Safely," Lay the ladder on the ground with both of its feet against the wall. Lift the top of the ladder and walk towards the wall, raising it one rung at a time., The simplest way to achieve this is by standing with your toes touching the feet of the ladder and extending your arms forward. Your palms should be able to reach a rung of the ladder when your arms are fully extended. If the angle is too steep, the ladder could tip backward; too shallow and it could slide out or bend in the middle.








You can also achieve this angle by pulling the feet of the ladder away from the wall about ¼ of the total length of the ladder.

, Always place feet parallel to the wall and on firm, level ground. It is never safe to place your ladder on top of any objects to gain additional height.On soft ground, flip the ladder feet up to expose the spurs and stomp on the bottom rung to penetrate the ground.
On uneven ground, a ladder leveler is the only safe way to effectively extend one leg of the ladder.If possible, you can also bolt a cleat into the ground behind the feet to aid against slipping.

, Both side rails should be equally supported and placed on an even surface. The ladder should not slide or wobble when you put weight against it. Whenever practical, tie off the top of the ladder to further secure it to the wall., You should always climb one rung at a time, moving only one hand or one foot at a time. Always face the ladder as you climb, and only use the rungs to climb opposed to the side rails.







, There are a variety of tasks that call for a ladder, and a variety of accessories for the top of ladders that can help you more easily and safely complete those tasks.Soft ""mitts"" that slip over the top of the side rails can provide extra grip and protect the surface from damage done by the ladder.
Ladder stabilizers basically widen the points at which the top of the ladder rests. This can be useful to protect fragile siding or to clear the width of a window.
Single support attachments are necessary whenever the ladder is leaned against a surface narrower than the width of the ladder, like a telephone pole. They mount to the ladder above the top rung between the two side rails.

, Aluminium ladders tend to be the lightest weight, but they are also electrical conductors. So whenever you need to place your ladder near a live electrical line or fixture, or even when working with corded power tools, it is best to use a wooden or fiberglass ladder, as neither are electrical conductors., Checking all the moving parts, like feet and rung locks, as well as the overall integrity of the ladder, can prevent the worst of accidents. It’s also important that the ladder is clean of any foreign substances that could be slippery, sticky, corrosive, conductive, or otherwise an added hazard to using the ladder.







, All ladders are sold with a label on the outside of one of the side rails that details the ladders max length, duty (or max weight), and other helpful safety information. Remember that max weight includes the weight of your body, clothes, tools, and any accessories attached to the ladder.

Get the manufacturer's data for the aircraft.,
Calculate the weight of fuel carried.,
Determine the maximum payload.,
Divide the payload between people and cargo.,
Subtract the crew and passenger weights from the payload.,
Take maximum landing weight into account.",How to Calculate Aircraft Payload," This data will list the following important parameters of the aircraft:


Check the standard weight empty of the aircraft. The standard weight empty will indicate the weight of the aircraft with no fuel, passengers or payload on board.
Find the maximum gross weight of the aircraft. The maximum gross weight is the upper limit of weight that the aircraft may be loaded to without structural damage.
Look up the maximum takeoff weight. The maximum takeoff weight is the most that the aircraft can weigh during take off.
Determine the maximum landing weight. The maximum landing weight is the most that the aircraft can weigh during landing without risking damage to the landing gear.
Note the fuel capacity of the aircraft. The fuel capacity will be listed in either U.S gallons or Imperial gallons.;
, The fuel tanks may not be loaded to capacity, so use the weight of only the fuel known to be added. Calculate the weight as 6 lbs. per U.S. gallon (2.72 kg per 3.79 L) or 7.2 lbs per Imperial gallon (3.23 kg per 4.72L) if the fuel used is aviation gas. Calculate the weight as 6.6 lbs per U.S. gallon (3.0 kg per 3.79 L) or 8.0 lbs per Imperial gallon (3.6 kg per 4.72 L) if the fuel used is JP-4.

, The maximum payload is the difference between the standard weight empty plus the weight of fuel carried, and either the maximum gross weight or the maximum takeoff weight, whichever is less. In almost every case, the maximum takeoff weight will be less and should be used for the calculation.

,


Count the aircraft crew as people. If known, the actual weight should be used. If the actual weights of the crew are not known, estimate the weights as 174 lbs. (79.0 kg) per male and 127 lbs. (57.6 kg) per female. Add 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) to each crew member weight for summer clothing and 14 lbs. (6.4 kg) per crew member for winter clothing.
Add the passenger weights. Count each male passenger as 174 lbs. (79.0 kg), each female passenger as 127 lbs. (57.6 kg), and each child as 75 lbs. (34.0 kg). Add 8 lbs. (3.6 kg) to each adult for summer clothing and 14 lbs. (6.4 kg) for each adult for winter clothing. Use 75 lbs. (34.0 kg) per child without adding an additional factor for clothing weight.

, The resulting calculated weight is available for baggage and cargo. Do not consider the volume of the aircraft to carry luggage and cargo. The weight limits will be reached before the aircraft runs out of space to hold the cargo.

, The maximum landing weight will be less than the maximum takeoff weight. The aircraft must have consumed enough fuel at the manufacturer's fuel consumption per thrust rate to reduce the total aircraft weight below the maximum landing weight before a landing can be made. If emergency conditions require an early landing, fuel or cargo (but not passengers) must be jettisoned to reduce the weight of the aircraft to the maximum landing weight.

Make a list of everyone you’re going to buy a gift for.,
Set an amount you’re willing to spend.,
Research the items you want to buy.,
Consider the person’s tastes.,
Explore off the beaten path.,
Consider the gift’s durability.,
Consider the gift’s size.,
Haggle.,
Gauge the room in your carry-on bags.,
Store gifts in luggage.,
Ship by delivery service.,
Ship by sea.,
Get through customs.",How to Buy Gifts and Souvenirs for Others When Traveling Abroad," The reason for this is to have everyone in mind, which will prepare you to shop for gifts specific to each recipient as well as begin to plan out how much you’re going to spend. Write down each name, and if you have a specific gift in mind, include that as well.


Don’t forget yourself! Add yourself to the list and include everything you wish to get. Factor this into your budget.
A good idea is to ask others if there’s anything from the country you’re visiting that they want. This will give you ideas, help you research the item for authenticity and price range, and make shopping easier.;
, Set a limit for each person. When you’re out in another country browsing the shops, it’s very easy to go over budget. In addition, you have to factor in the costs of miscellany such as snacks and transportation, which also contribute to your overall budget and how much you can afford to spend on others.Currency exchange is another sneaky charge that affects your budget, as is your ability to ship all these gifts home.

, Before you go, figure out what a real, quality item looks like and what is an appropriate price for it. This way, when you’re in the midst of dazzling tourist shops and foreign prices, you’ll be much more likely to stay under budget without sacrificing quality.


If you want to buy a kimono in Japan, for instance, search online for what indicates a kimono as authentic as well as scams to watch out for.
You can also search online or through guidebooks for tips on where to purchase your items.

, The key to bringing home a good gift is to get at the heart of what a person wants. The best gifts show that you care about a person, and to show that you care, you must understand the person. Keep in mind the person’s likes and dislikes and match them appropriately with the amount of money you are willing to spend.For instance, if a person doesn’t like brandy, bringing a bottle of brandy home from France, no matter how expensive, won’t work.
A successful gift will be one that makes a person think of you when they see it. This can be something worn such as jewelry, but it can also mean any other type of gift.
If you don’t know the person well enough or can’t find an ideal gift, try getting them something that makes them want to travel. Even a stereotypical trinket such as a magnet or snow globe can mean a lot to the right person.

, It is easy to get dazzled by the flashy, tourist-attuned shops, but moving away from them has plenty of benefits. You’ll be able to delve into the true, local markets for goods that are often cheaper and better quality than the overpriced magnet you were considering. You’ll also gain a personal adventure to present when you give your gift.


Search for information as to where you can find trustworthy shops and the gift you want. Ask your hotel concierge, a visitor’s bureau, or search the Internet.
Be wary of tour guides. Many tours have predetermined stops, and the shops there may offer the guide a commission and inflate prices.

, It’s easy to fall in love with a local piece of artistry, but it’s a lot harder to get it home in one piece. Once you’ve found something you think makes for a good gift, stop and consider how you’re going to get it home.


Smaller gifts can be packed into a carry-on bag, but larger gifts are more at risk. Ask yourself if you have room in a suitcase, can risk it getting broken or stolen, or can ship by mail and how this impacts your budget.

, Travel magnets may seem like a generic gift, but they have an advantage in ease of transportation as well as cost. You’ll have to bring the gift home, and if it isn’t something that can easily fit inside your luggage, it may not be worth the hassle.


Before you take the plunge on a purchase, consult shipping rates for delicate gifts, large objects, or anything you want to send directly to either yourself or someone else. The costs add up and quickly dominate your budget.
In addition to cost, consider the person who will receive this gift. A fancy or large gift may seem like a big gesture, but they’re going to have to incorporate it into their life and environment. A decoration for someone in an apartment may clash with the furniture, be unable to fit, or otherwise be met with less enthusiasm than expected.

, Most North American and European travelers won’t be accustomed to this. Getting over the awkwardness, though, will enable you to get better deals and therefore better gifts. Many cultures throughout the world still include haggling in their business transactions, so don’t feel bad about challenging the asking price.Appropriate places include markets, bazaars, and small shops. You wouldn’t haggle in a department store in Japan or America.
Check in guidebooks or online for local haggling customs. Different cultures use different tones, for instance, and doing it the appropriate way helps your chances at success.
Once you have an approximate maximum price and amount you’re willing to spend, set aside your cash before you begin, as this establishes a budget limit for both you and the clerk.
Always maintain a positive and friendly tone. The goal isn’t to beat the seller, and getting angry won’t help.
Take your time, don’t show much interest, and don’t be afraid to walk out. Chances are that if you do this, a clerk who once resisted your price will suddenly chase you into the street to offer a more agreeable deal.

, You’ll bring these bags with you onto the transportation you chose. These are small enough to store under a seat or in an overhead compartment, but the fact that you have them with you means they’re best for storing valuable or breakable gifts.


Check with your transportation to see how much you can carry. In 2017, for instance, many airlines allow you to have a carry-on bag sized 22x14x9 inches or 56x36x23x centimeters along with a personal item such as a laptop bag or purse.For larger, sturdier gifts, bring a duffle bag. These can be stored under a seat or in a plane or bus compartment, but if they don’t fit they’ll be considered checked baggage by airlines and you will be charged accordingly., Most likely you already have a bag that, if you are flying, you checked in at the airline’s kiosk for storage in the cargo hold of the plane. It is an obvious place to store gifts, but one that is not without risks and potential costs. Read up on the policies of your transporter before you go.


Consider bringing extra packing material such as towels and bubble wrap in which to cushion breakable gifts.
Some airlines allow for one or even two fee-free checked bags, but others charge even for the first one. As of 2017, United Airlines, for instance, charges $25 for the first checked bag.You may also choose to bring a separate suitcase for gifts, but beware the costs. For example, As of 2017, United Airlines charges $35 for the second checked bag and possibly $200 for a third one on an international route.
The size and weight of the bag also affect costs. As of 2017, United Airlines charges start at $100 for a bag 51-70 pounds and another $100 if it is oversized. These charges also double on some international routes.

, This can be handled by the merchant, or you can choose to pack and ship the goods yourself. Big, heavy gifts often have to be shipped by such alternate means, but you may find shipping by mail to be a more direct and simpler method in general.


If the local merchant can take care of shipping, get shipping insurance, an itemized receipt, and pay with a credit card so you can track how and when the gift will be shipped.
For shipping by hand, seek out the office of a shipping service such as FedEx, UPS, or DSL, a local post office, or ask the hotel concierge for guidance.
Shipping services may have online calculators to help you get a glimpse into how expensive this route can be. A standard box shipped from Japan to Australia, for instance, costs about $50 AUD in airmail. Size, weight, and customs charges are all factors.

, Airline shipping for large items tends to be expensive, so shipping by sea freighter may be a better option. Sea freight is cheaper but slower and is best for spacious items such as furniture, as they take up more volume.An object shipped from America to Asia takes over a month to arrive.
Anything shipped by freight still ends up costing several hundred dollars in transportation fees. Fees from customs may also play a part.

, This step depends upon the rules of your government, but they’re bound to have regulations on what you can bring into the country, how much you can bring, and how much it will cost you. As much as possible, prepare for this ahead of time and be aware of how duty charges impact your budget.


In the U.S., for example, gifts carried back on the plane must be declared and, in general, a combined value of less than $800 is duty-free.In the U.S., mailed gifts have to be given clear labels such as “Personal Use Purchase,” “Unsolicited Gift” (gifts for others), and “Consolidated Gift Package.”
In the U.S., a gift shipped to others that costs more than $100 is charged duty. The exemption before duty charges rises to $200 on packages shipped to oneself.

Calculate the cost of transportation.,
Include all costs that are incurred while traveling.,
If you have to, consider time taken off work.",How to Calculate Cost of Travel," Transportation is likely to be 1 of the biggest travel costs you will incur. If you are taking a plane, train or bus, then your transportation cost equates to the price of your ticket. If you are driving, you will need to calculate the cost of the rental vehicle, if applicable, and the amount of gas your trip will require. This is mostly aimed at cost per US or CAN Dollar, for UK Pound / Euro Dollar you may have to adjust manually.


Start with the distance you will be driving, in miles or kilometers.
Divide the distance by your car's fuel economy (miles per gallon or kilometers per liter). The resulting amount is the number of gallons or liters it will take you to complete your trip.
Multiply the number of gallons or liters by the average cost of fuel.
Note: If you drive a rental vehicle, the rental company will charge you a fixed amount per mile and, additionally, a fixed amount for car insurance. Be sure to factor these amounts into your travel costs.;
,


Food and drink - If you travel for an extended period of time, you will need to stop for food and drink, or you may opt to pack food and drink. Either way, you must include this expense in your cost of travel calculation.
Lodging - For trips that require driving for more than 1 day, you will need to stop over somewhere to get some sleep. Unless you opt to pull to the side of the road and sleep in your vehicle, you will need to add the cost of lodging to your overall travel costs.
Tolls - Many road routes have a series of toll booths that you must stop at as you travel. The cost of tolls can add up, especially if you are on a long road trip.
Parking - If you opt to take a plane, train or bus, then you may need to add the cost of storing your automobile in a parking lot or garage to your travel costs.
Depreciation - Any time you drive your vehicle, the value of your vehicle depreciates, and that figure must be added to your cost of travel calculation. Depreciation can be figured by multiplying the average cost of depreciation, 27 cents per 1 mile (5 cents per 1.6 km), by the distance you will be traveling.
Indirect costs - Indirect travel costs should be considered if you are driving, and include things like road maintenance, pollution, government taxes, accidents and land use. To calculate indirect costs, multiply .05 cents by the number of miles or .01 cents by the number of kilometers you will be driving.
Time to travel - Also consider your time on the road vs. destination if you're going on vacation; to calculate this take the hours it will take to travel to your destination, add each stop point time (food, restroom, refuel) per 15min increments, and you will have a total time to get to your destination. If you want to figure out how much 'money' you have lost in your delays (an average time vs. pay for your job if you're traveling for such a reason) take the amount you're getting paid total to arrive on time and subtract 10 cents for every 5 min you are not traveling, this will give you an average cost of what you will lose or gain for being on time.

, When figuring the cost to travel, the time you miss from work must be added to the equation. Take the number of hours you will be missing and multiply that by the amount of money you make per hour.

Research fair trade organizations.,
Decide if you want to buy crafts from a specific country.,

Visit world craft museums, such as The Museum of Craft and Folk Art or the Museum of Craft and Design in San Francisco.,
Visit summer markets in your town.,
Visit a third world country and buy the crafts straight from the source.",How to Buy Crafts from Third World Countries," There are a number of non-profit companies that choose to keep consumers up to date about fair trade options. These include fairtraderesource.org, chfinternational.org, and fair trade organizations of specific countries, such as fta.org.au.;
, For example, you may admire the bamboo furniture from Malaysia or carvings from Africa. Search for a non-profit organization that tells you where to find shops that sell that country's goods.


For example, there is a Bangladesh cooperative that represents 60,000 artisans.

, Both of these websites have acquired companies that previously sought to promote fair trade crafts. Ebay acquired World of Good, and you can buy handcrafted gifts from third world countries at worldofgood.ebay.com.


Overstock.com provides a fair trade site, called overstock.com/Worldstock-Fair-Trade. You can find anything from jewelry to furniture and more.

, Most mid to large-sized cities have a few fair trade stores. You can often find the stories behind the manufacturers of the crafts.

Ask the store how they acquired the crafts. The best way to tell if you are buying from a certified fair trade, third world craft carrier is to ask how the crafts were acquired.

, These museums fill their gift shops with crafts that are well-crafted and distinctive. Check the museum websites for crafts that can be bought online.

, People who have emigrated from other countries often stock booths filled with their home country's crafts. Peruvian alpaca crafts are common at summer craft markets.

, While this is the most expensive option, it is the best way to ensure you are buying straight from a craftsman. Research craft workshops where you can visit and buy directly after viewing the creation of the crafts.


For example, in St. Kitts there is a batik factory where the batiks are made and then sold. In Peru, you can visit an alpaca farm where yarn is created, died, woven and sold.

File for bankruptcy.",How to Get Out of Debt," If you have good credit, contact the credit card companies and ask to have your rate lowered.That's an excellent way to lower your interest expenses and will save you money every month.

, If you can't get your interest rate lowered on some high interest credit cards, then pay those off first. That way, you'll reduce your interest expense over time by lowering the balance on those cards.

, If your credit is good, you can consolidate your credit card debt into one debt consolidation loan. You'll find that it's easier to manage one payment per month than many payments. Plus, it's often the case that debt consolidation loans have a lower interest rate than credit cards.

, To ensure that you get out of debt, you'll need to stop increasing your debt.Switch from a credit card to a debit card so that the money you spend goes out of your account immediately.

, Credit card payments are structured to keep the cash flowing to the credit card companies for as long as possible. Avoid falling into a trap that hurts your financial position and helps your creditors by paying off more than the minimum payments whenever you can.

, If you're serious about getting out of debt, you need to track your income and expenses, so that you can discipline yourself to spend only what's necessary for any given month.Make a list of all your sources of income. Include every way you earn money, whether it's from your job, investments, interest income, etc. Tally your various income streams by month.
Make another list of your monthly expenses. Be sure to include everything you pay for every month, including utilities, groceries, gas, eating out, tuition, etc. Tally these expenses by month as well.
Subtract your monthly expenses from your monthly income. If you have more income than expenses (and that should be the case), then the remainder is your discretionary income and can be used for debt relief or savings.
Every month, be sure to stay within your budget. If you go outside of your budget, you'll have less money for debt relief or savings.

, To tackle your debt effectively, you're going to need more income. You can do that by either getting a second job (if you're a salaried employee) or earning more commissions (if you're in sales). Yes, this will take time away from your personal life, but it's necessary to get out of debt.

, Look for ways to reduce your expenses every month so that you have more money to pay off your debt.Are you eating out too much? Save money by cooking your own food.
Can you reduce your utility bill with a more efficient use of energy? For example, does the downstairs area really need to be air conditioned while everybody is sleeping upstairs at night? Are there electrical devices left on all the time that shouldn't be?
Consider extreme couponing to save money on your groceries., Your counselor will work with you to develop a plan to eliminate all of your debt and will contact your creditors to get the interest rate on your loans reduced.You can find a non-profit credit counselor at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling website., If your debt is totally out of control, your creditors might realize that some money is better than none.

Take care of lower priority debts.,
Bring accounts up-to-date as soon as you can.",How to Prioritize Your Debts1," If you're just barely scraping by, you should prioritize to make sure you have the necessities now while trying to minimize potential problems down the road. However, if you're able to pay for necessities like your home and basic utilities, move on to the ""debt avalanche"" method.;
, If you own your home, the mortgage payment is your highest-priority debt. In the U.S. lenders will typically begin foreclosure proceedings after three missed payments, though this may vary.Even if you get just a month or two behind, you may have trouble getting your payments back up-to-date, which can cause you problems down the road. If you rent, you can usually be evicted after just one missed payment, and then you'll be faced with finding another place to live with a huge blemish on your record.

, Power, water, and other utility companies will usually give you some leeway in missing payments, but if you get too far in arrears, they'll shut off your service, which can make everyday living very difficult and can also make it more costly to get service in the future. If you can't pay your bills in full, call the company and see if you can work out a payment plan. They're usually very accommodating., If you need your car to get to work or to find work, it's important that you keep your payments up-to-date. Finance companies can repossess cars fairly easily, and in many cases they don't even have to give you notice. Make sure to pay your insurance, as well, because it's the law and because if you don't the lender will add their own insurance, which will cost you far more while only protecting the lender's interest.Keeping up with a car payment while doing your best to pay for your mortgage and utilities can be difficult. Consider these options to ease your financial burden:

Do your best to save money on gas.
Consider carpooling.
Have you considered living without a car?



, Failure to pay child support, taxes, or other legally-mandated payments can land you large fines or even jail time.

, The government backs student loans, and if you go into default they can take collection actions that other creditors can't. Luckily, there are numerous government programs to help you with this., Medical bills offer a bit more leniency than most other kinds of loans, and even if they go on your credit report they're generally looked at differently than other missed payments.

, Credit cards, loans secured by household objects, personal loans, and store charge cards are not high priorities. Pay the minimums on all these if you can, but if you have to choose between your credit card bill or your mortgage, choose your mortgage. Call your credit card companies and tell them you need either deferment or lenience. If you call and let them know you are in trouble, most are willing to work out a payment plan by temporarily lowering your minimums or deferring payment for a couple of months until you are working again, etc. If you blow them off, though, they will be less apt to work with you.

, Once you've gotten back on your feet, get all your accounts current if you've fallen behind on them. Focus on the ones on which you are the furthest behind. Once everything's caught up, start prioritizing to pay debts off quickly.

Keep the goal in mind.",How to Pay Off Credit Card Debt," Credit card companies love it when you pay just enough to get by every month. At that rate, you’re mostly paying off interest and barely scratching the surface of your actual debt. Look at your most recent credit card statements to get a ballpark figure on what your monthly interest is, then budget as much of a payment as you can over that amount to actually see a difference in your statement.If you want to know how much above the minimum you should pay, remember what interest is. Interest is the price you pay for money, and creditors always want you to pay interest before anything else. So making the minimum payment is usually only enough to keep your interest from compounding your debt into the stratosphere—to keep it where it is, in other words. You want to try to pay enough each month to get beyond the interest and into the principal.;
, It goes almost without saying, but it's something that a lot of people forget. If one credit line is charging you 11% Annual Percentage Rate, or APR (interest over the course of a year) while another credit line is charging you 9% APR, focus all your attention on the debt that falls under 11% interest rate. Pay it off before even touching the other debt. Sure, the other one will accumulate interest in the meantime, but since you’re paying interest either way, you might as well do it at the lower percentage.If this process seems too hard, try snowballing your debt. If your interest rates are all roughly the same or you’re simply overwhelmed by the sheer number of payments you have to make each month, make the minimum payments on all but the lowest balance––which you should attack aggressively so that it disappears quickly. Once it’s gone, add the payments you would have paid on the lowest debt to the minimum payment on your next-lowest debt until it, too, disappears. Repeat until all debts are cleared. The sense of satisfaction you will feel in making fewer and fewer payments each month will make the process more bearable and help you achieve your goal., Explain your financial situation and ask if there is anything they can do to help. Many will lower your interest rate for a period of time and/or waive current late fee balances to give you an opportunity to catch up.If you've been a customer of theirs for a long time, mention that. While some credit card companies don't care about customer loyalty, more than a few do. Those that do sometimes go to great lengths to keep their customer base happy and loyal, whatever the circumstances.
If at first you don't succeed, ask someone more important. If you can't make any headway with the first persons you speak with, ask to speak to a supervisor. If that doesn't work, ask to speak to the retention department. If that doesn't work, call back in a week or two.Come prepared. Be sure to compile a list of other offers you recieve. Know your interest rate terms. Check out the rates that competitors are offering.

, It might seem like an easy way to get a handle on your debt, but it'll do horrors to your credit score, and you'll still be on the hook for the debt.All this will do is send your credit utilization (your available limit v. your current debt) down, further driving down your credit score. Learn more here on how to increase your credit score.


If you feel like you must close an account, you need to pay it off extremely quickly, and you need to make sure that the company records that it was closed at your request and not theirs. Make this request in writing., Let's be clear, transferring money from a credit card with 12% interest to a card with 0% interest may damage your short-term credit. However, barely chipping away at your debt because your interest is too high will damage your finances in the long-term. Shop around for long-term, low- or no-percent interest rate transfer opportunities, or look into transferring some of your debt onto a low-interest card that you already have. Keep the following in mind:How long the low interest rate will last. Depending on your total debt and how quickly you think you can pay it off, 0% interest for six months may not be as good a deal as 2% for 18 months.
The amount of the transfer fee. When transferring, you usually have to pay a certain percentage of your debt up-front. Make sure that a) you can afford this transfer fee and b) the fee is less than you would have paid in interest during the introductory period. Usually, transferring to a low-interest card will involve less fees than transferring to a no-interest card. Weigh how much time you expect it will take to make a dent in your debt when choosing to transfer.What the interest rate will be after the introductory period ends. Will it jump up to 18% after 12 months? If it does, will you have paid off enough debt by that time to make that jump worth your while?
How long you will be required to keep your balance with the company. Since credit-card hopping has become a popular way to avoid paying interest, some companies have begun stipulating that if you transfer your debt to another card before a certain amount of time has passed, the normal interest rate will be applied to all your previous balances retroactively, leaving you with a huge new debt.Make sure to read all the fine print! Credit card companies are nothing if not resourceful in finding ways to take your money. Look for all the catches above and more, such as transfer fees and ballooning interest rates, before making any decisions., No one likes doing it, but sometimes it needs to be done. If you just bought a car, a memory foam mattress, or a new jacuzzi, think seriously about whether you really need these items, especially if you're paying for them on installment. Liquidating your big-ticket items now will mean less financial hardship for you later on.


Always try to find the sales venue that will get you the highest resale value. Think eBay and jewelers, not pawn shops.
Get creative and do the math. For example, if you have a car payment, if you can sell your car (even for less than the note is worth) for enough to pay off a card balance or three with higher interest rates and perhaps pay off the interest on the car note, then it makes financial sense to do that.

, It’s one thing to make mental notes of things you’ve bought over the month, but it’s another thing altogether to see them add up on paper. This is especially true if you use a credit or debit card (people tend to spend more freely if they pay with plastic) or pay for things using multiple accounts (and therefore never really see the net total). Manually tracking your expenses will not only help you make better decisions, but also identify areas in which you don’t even realize you’re overspending., It isn’t enough to just throw a random payment at your credit card(s) every month. Instead, create a strategy, put it in writing, and budget your other expenses around your credit card payments. Here are some popular ways to save money and reduce your debts:


Think seriously about starting to save pocket money. It sounds childish, but the savings are anything but.

See if you qualify for food assistance. It's not glamorous, but neither is being broke.Reduce your expenses by cutting costs in different areas of your life, such as spending less on entertainment or making sure your car is running efficiently so you spend less on gas.

, For a lot of people, a tax refund is a windfall at the beginning of the year. If you anticipate getting a tax refund this year, resolve to set a sizable chunk of it aside in order to pay off some of your debt.

, For example, don’t buy that coffee on the way to work every day; make one at home for a fraction of the cost. Don't buy your books, DVDs, or CDs; just borrow them from your local library. Don't buy lunches for work; just make them at your home. (Pressed for time? Even something as simple as a sandwich or a salad with a hard-boiled egg makes a great lunch. Prep it the night before if necessary.)


When you’re stressed, treating yourself to the little things can feel like a necessity, and to a certain extent, it is. However, there are much cheaper ways of going about this. Instead of waiting in line for an overpriced mocha, bring a thermos of tea to the park and watch the autumn leaves fall. Instead of going out to dinner with your friends next Friday night, invite them to a potluck at your place. There are plenty of creative ways to cut back without feeling like a Spartan.

, Credit cards are often our go-to resource for unplanned expenses (the alternator dies, you get sick and miss work, etc.), but this can undo months of payments and completely demoralize you. A better idea is to tuck some money aside strictly for emergencies.This doesn’t have to be a drain on your income. Remember those expenses you are cutting back on? Instead of simply not spending, try actually setting aside the money you would have paid on one or two of those expenses (for example, bar money every Friday night, manicure money every-other Sunday, etc.). Create a (free) savings account, put it in a CD, or even hide it in a cookie jar.
Remember that this fund is for emergencies only. Break your leg? Go ahead and dip in. Want to upgrade your phone? Find the money somewhere else.

, Once you start to see that credit card balance go down, you may be tempted to treat yourself to a series of restaurant outings or a shiny new smartphone. Don’t do it; a few casual purchases can put you right back where you started, especially if something unexpected happens. Keep the end goal at the forefront of your mind––rewards that cost little or nothing are much better, like seeing a movie at a friend's house or making your favorite rich chocolate dessert and eating it all!

, Remember what you're trying to do—get out of credit card debt. Just like smokers almost never quit by cutting back, you probably won't get out of debt if you keep adding to it by using your cards all the time. You want to try to minimize your use of cards or stop using your cards altogether.


Freeze them in a block of ice if you need to. Freezing a sealed bag of water with the cards inside is a fun and mess-free way of doing this. That way, your card will be there if you need it, but you'll have to wait for the ice to thaw, giving you hours to decide whether you really need it.
Get a lock box. Put your cards in a lock box and put the lock box somewhere out of the way. Either give the key to someone else or put the key at another location, like your desk drawer at work, so that when you need to use the credit card, you will have to think long and hard about doing it.
As a last resort, take your cards and cut them in to pieces with scissors to make sure you won't use them again.

Alternately, you should look at your online account and check. There may be a link for “balance transfer” or “consolidate debt.” If you don’t see anything, call and ask a customer service representative.
Pay attention to whether a current card is already carrying a balance. For example, you might have a $3,000 balance on card A, which you want to transfer to card B. However, card B already has a $2,000 balance. If you make the transfer, then the minimum payment amount will go to the amount with the lower APR.Meanwhile, the original $2,000 balance continues to accrue interest at 14.99%.
In the above situation, you might want to make a balance transfer to a new card.;
, There are many websites where you can compare credit cards. Remember that you can’t transfer a balance between cards with the same bank.Accordingly, look for cards offered by a different bank. Use the following comparison websites:Bankrate.com
CardHub.com
CreditCards.com

, You want to get a card that has the most favorable terms so that you can pay off your debt as fast as possible. Consider the following terms when comparing credit cards:



Transfer rate. Many cards offer a 0% APR for a certain amount of time (such as 12-18 months). The longer this promotional period, the better. You can save thousands of dollars in interest depending on your balance.Transfer fee. Most cards will charge a certain amount, such as 3-5% of the total balance amount.If you transfer $10,000, then a $300-500 fee will be added on top.

Transfer window. Some cards will give you only so much time to request the balance transfer.

Post-promotion APR. Find out what happens if you can’t pay the entire balance off during the promotional period. Generally, banks will charge you interest only on the remaining balance. However, you don’t want a card that retroactively applies interest against the entire initial transfer.

, It’s easiest to get a credit card for a balance transfer if you have a credit score of 680 or higher.If your score is lower, you might have fewer options or you might not be able to get a card at all.


You can find your credit score by using a credit card service. Look online. Some companies will provide your score for free.
You can also check with a credit counselor or HUD-approved housing counselor, who can typically get your credit score for free.Finally, you can also buy your score from one of the credit reporting agencies—Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. You might also buy your FICO score from myfico.com.

, You can apply for your card over the phone, online, or using a paper application. In any event, you’ll be asked for some personal information, such as the following:legal name
birth date
home address
contact information (such as phone number and email address)
current and previous employers
annual income
information on other credit cards
Social Security Number

, You might not be able to transfer all of your debts to a new card. For example, the new card might have a debt limit of $5,000. If you have $25,000 in total debt, you’ll need to identify which debts to transfer. List the debts and include the following information:total balance
interest rate
any penalties or fees that are assessed

, Generally, you should transfer your highest-interest debts to the new card. If you have multiple credit card debts, try to move as much of the balance with the highest interest rate.


For example, your new card might have a $5,000 limit. You have two debts: $3,000 and $6,000. The card with the $3,000 balance has an APR of 29.99% and the other card has an APR of 13.99%. You can use a balance transfer to cover all of the $3,000 balance and then some of the $6,000.
Remember that balance transfer fees count toward the maximum you can transfer.

, With some cards, you can enter in the account number and the amount you want to transfer when you open the card. This can make transferring the balance very easy., Alternately, you might need to go online and sign into your online banking account. Look for a link for “balance transfer” or “promotions.”


Enter the account number of the credit card with the balance. Then enter the amount you want to transfer. You may also need to provide the payment address for the credit card you are paying off., Access checks look like personal checks. However, they are tied to your credit card. You can write out a check to the credit card company for the amount you want to transfer.Be careful and read the fine print. Not all access checks are the same. Some banks will let you use them for balance transfers, but others might consider any use of the access check to be a cash advance. Cash advances have huge interest rates, so make sure the access check will count as a balance transfer.
Call up and ask questions, if necessary.

, Some cards allow you to deposit money directly into your bank account from the credit card. Read the card’s terms to see if you can deposit money at the promotional interest rate. Some banks might classify the deposit as a “cash advance.”A direct deposit frees up money to pay off all kinds of debts, not necessarily only other credit card debt. For example, you might owe your mother $1,000. You can deposit this amount of money into your checking account and then cut a personal check to pay back your mother.

, It generally can take a few days for the transfer to go through. If you haven’t seen it go through within 10 days, then call the credit card company. In the meantime, don’t miss payments.


For example, your balance transfer might not go through by the time your next payment is due on a card. If not, remember to make payment so you aren’t delinquent.

, If you’re 60 days late on your payment, then the bank might end the promotional period early.For this reason, you need to remember to pay your bills on time.

, Your introductory interest rate won’t last forever. Accordingly, try to pay off the balance before you reach the end of the promotional rate period. If you aren’t being charged interest, it should be easy to calculate how much you need to pay each month.


For example, say your card has a 12-month promotional period at 0%. You transfer $3,000 to the card. Over 12 months, you’ll need to pay about $250 a month (plus the balance transfer fee).
If you can’t pay the entire balance in time, you should typically be charged only interest on the remaining balance. However, read your card’s terms.

, You will only go deeper into debt if you continue to spend.After seeing their monthly payments decrease, some people use the extra money for luxuries. Instead, you need to direct this extra money toward paying down your debt more quickly.


To control spending, cut up your credit cards or freeze them in ice. Doing so will prevent you from using the cards.
In particular, you shouldn’t use the card with the balance. Instead, store the card away.Don’t close your old accounts after you move the balances off them. Doing so will hurt your credit score.

Determine if this method is right for you.,
Put your debts in order by interest rate.,
Keep up with minimum payments.,
Pay as much as you can on the first debt.,
Move on the debt with the next-highest interest rate.",How to Prioritize Your Debts2," If you're living comfortably and securely, your goal should be to prioritize your debts so as to pay them off as quickly as possible. One method of doing this involves paying off debt win order from the highest interest rate to the lowest. This is the fastest and most efficient way to pay off debt, and is referred to as a the ""debt avalanche"" technique., Organize your bills and paperwork and examine the terms and conditions of your loans to determine the interest rates you are being charged on each form of debt you owe. Use this information to create a written schedule that lays out when you will pay off each debt.


Be sure to consider fees that may affect your priorities. For example, some credit cards have annual fees that you can avoid if you pay off and cancel the card — though you should be aware that canceling the card comes with its own disadvantages, as it may adversely affect your credit score. Some loans have prepayment penalties, which may make quickly paying those loans off less cost-effective than it would be if you had only to consider the interest rates.
If the interest rate on a particular account is subject to change, as is the case with credit cards that have introductory rates, be sure to consider this. Your priorities may need to change when the rates change.
When prioritizing by interest rates, use the effective interest rate, the rate that takes into account any tax deduction. This is usually applicable to mortgages or student loans. Since interest payments on these loans are tax-deductible, the cost of such loans is actually a bit less than the stated interest rate.Calculate the effective rate by multiplying the stated interest rate by 1 minus your income tax bracket. For example, if you're in the 30% tax bracket and you have a mortgage with a stated rate of 10%, the effective interest rate is 7.0% (10*(1-0.30)).

, Even though you are focusing on paying off one source of debt at a time, be sure to keep from incurring more by paying the minimum monthly payments on other debts. Take these amounts into consideration before putting the rest of your money towards paying off your target debt. It may be a good idea to create an excel document to keep track of these payments and when they are due.

, This will generally be a credit card or a personal loan. If you really want to get out of debt, you will eliminate unnecessary expenses and put as much of your income as possible towards paying off this debt. This will allow you to pay it off quickly and move on to the next debt.

, Once you've paid off the first debt, proceed to the next-highest, and so on until you're debt-free.

Continue paying off debts until you are debt-free.",How to Prioritize Your Debts3," If you are comfortable and secure in your basic payments and necessities, but find it difficult to budget or save money to pay off your debts with the ""debt avalanche"" method, the ""debt snowball"" method may be right for you. This method focuses on you paying off your smallest debts first to simply reduce the number of different debts you owe.It should be noted that this is not the fastest or most efficient way to reduce your debt load.

, Organize your paperwork and determine how much you owe on each debt. Create a schedule of which debts you will pay off first by placing the debt with the smallest amount owed first and going up in amount owed from there. Be sure to note minimum payments for each debt and pay those each month before directing any money towards paying off your first debt. You don't want to incur more debt by not paying these minimums.

, Use any additional money you have each month to begin paying off the first debt. You may consider creating a budget for yourself to save money or perhaps taking on a part-time job. However you come up with the money, save as much as you can and put it all towards that first debt. When you've paid it off, celebrate! You've earned it.

, After you've paid off the first debt, move on to the next debt on your list. This one will take longer to pay off than the first, but keep yourself motivated to continue paying off debts by remembering the load that paying the first debt took off your shoulders.

, Your number of debts, and total debt overall, will decrease faster and faster as you continue to pay them off. Eventually, you will be completely debt-free!

Account statements contain the basic information about your debt, interest rate, and minimum payments due for each account.


There are many free online tools and apps that can help you collect and organize your account information.

, Make a list that identifies the details of your debt. For each account list:


The name of the card.
The balance on the card.
The interest rate for the account.
The monthly minimum payment amount.
Any additional fees for late payment or account overages.

, Add up the balances you owe on each card to get the total amount of credit card debt that you currently have.

, Once you are fully aware of your debt situation, get a clear picture of your finances by creating a budget. This will inform you exactly what your revenues and expenses are and will help you create more savings to reduce debt. List all your sources of income and add them up.
Move on to list your necessities. These include essential needs that are due regularly like rent, utilities, car payments, food, communication, and debt repayments. Keep in mind that just because these are essential or fixed expenses does not mean that they cannot be greatly reduced to find savings.
List your discretionary expenses. Discretionary expenses are costs that you can change or avoid altogether such as buying new clothing or eating dinner out. The best way to get an idea of these expenses is to look at your bank or credit card statements for a month, and add up all the expenses that are not in your fixed expenses category. If you want better accuracy, take an average over several months and use this figure.
Subtract your total expenses from your revenue. This is how much you have left over, or alternatively, how much extra you can afford to pay down to your credit cards.

, Try to figure out how to decrease your expenses each month so that you can use more funds to pay down your credit cards. Target primarily variable expenses listed in your budget to find ways to save money.


Make meals at home instead of eating out.
Make coffee at home instead of buying expensive coffee drinks.
Delay expenses that can wait for later, like new clothes.
Borrow books, music, and movies from the public library instead of buying them.
Do not forget to look into your fixed expenses category as well. Can you move into more affordable housing? Find a roommate? Walk more to spend less on gas? Use a less extravagant plan for your cell phone (perhaps only 1GB of data a month instead of 3GB)?

, Once you have lowered spending using the above tips, you should be able to free additional money each month. Apply some of that additional income to your credit cards and save some for an emergency.


For example, upon creation of your budget you may observe you make $1500 per month, and have $1400 a month in expenses. After implementing the savings tips (for example, you drop down to a cheaper phone plan, stop eating out, and start walking to do basic errands), you manage to find $300 in savings. You now have $400 in additional cash. Perhaps $300 can go to your credit card debt and $100 can go into emergency savings.
Don't forget to look at your income too. Are there ways to boost your income? Perhaps you can work more hours, look for a better job, or get a part-time job for ten extra hours a week.

, Make a list of your balances, interest, and fees every month. Check for unanticipated fees and to make sure your payments have been received and credited to your account.

, Pay your cards off one at a time, starting with the account charging you the most interest. This will reduce your debt faster because you'll be paying a lower interest rate on the remaining cards.To do this, take your extra money each month, and make the minimum payment on all your cards except the highest interest rate card, then apply all the remaining money to paying down your highest interest rate credit card.

, Call each creditor and ask if they will lower the interest rate on your account. Even a slightly lower rate can add up to a lot of savings over time. If one company agrees to lower your rate, ask other creditors to match their competitor.It is possible to lower credit card interest rate just by asking. In fact, a recent survey found that when 50 credit card customers (of all credit backgrounds) called and asked to have their rates lowered, 56% successfully received lower rates, often by substantial amounts.The following script was used to reduce rates, ""Hi, my name is . I am a good customer, but I have received several offers in the mail from other credit card companies with lower APRs. I want a lower rate on my card, or I will cancel my card and switch companies.""Even if you have a poor credit score, do not hesitate to ask for a rate reduction. Persistence is key, and if the additional representative is not receptive, ask to speak to a supervisor. Credit card companies are eager to keep customers and are willing to negotiate rates to do so. State that you have been having difficulty making monthly payments, that a lower rate would help, and you currently have better offers from other credit card companies. At this point, ask for a rate you would consider more reasonable.

, Balance transfer credit cards charge low rates (sometimes 0%), on balances you transfer from other credit cards. These can be a great way to quickly reduce your interest rate, and therefore your overall payment. Transfer balances only if you are able to pay off the debt during the low interest introductory period. This introductory period can last from 12-24 months, and during this point you would pay no interest. Afterwards, a higher interest rate may apply.
Creditors may charge fees for balance transfers. Check to see if the fee plus the new interest rate is still lower than your current rate.
Typically good credit is required to explore this option. It is always worth applying -- call all available banks to ask what kinds of balance transfer cards they have, and how to apply.

, This involves taking out an additional loan, such as a line of credit with a lower interest rate, and transferring your credit card balances to that loan. This has the added benefit of rolling all your credit card payments into one simple payment. Simply call your bank and ask for options in this regard, but be very aware of the risks.Most people who consolidate their debt end up with more debt later on. Why? Because freeing up credit card space often results in more credit card usage. If you do get a debt consolidation loan, make a special point to not use your credit cards any more than absolutely necessary.
Be aware that although interest rates are lower, the loan terms are often longer, which means you may actually spend more in interest over time.

, One effective way to reduce total interest payments (although not necessarily rates), would be to apply any savings you have to your credit card debt to reduce the overall balance.


This can effectively save money, since the large interest being charged on credit card balances greatly exceeds the minimal interest typically obtained from a savings account.
Ensure that you never use emergency savings for this. Always use additional savings beyond what you would require to meet your cost-of-living expenses for several months.

, Paying at least the minimum balance on each card every month, on time, is a requirement for maintaining a good credit rating and avoiding additional late fees that will add to your debt.


If you can't make the minimum payments, use the tips in Parts 2 and 3, but remember that paying the minimums will not reduce debt. Instead, it helps to avoid late fees, which can add to overall debt.

, Don't make any new charges on your credit cards, especially on any higher interest accounts or accounts that are near or over your credit limit. If you have to, cut up cards so that you will not use them impulsively.Not adding to debt is just as important as paying debt off. A good tip is to practice just living on cash if possible. Attempt this for one full week to start. Assume that if you cannot afford something with cash, you cannot afford it at all. If you require records and receipts, it is okay to use one credit card and pay completely each billing period.

, Once you have created a budget that identifies savings to use for credit card payments, make sure you stick with it.


Sticking to cash is one of the best ways to avoid impulse purchases that could deter you from sticking to your budget. Your budget takes what cash you earn, and subtracts cash expenses. If you can commit to using cash only, every expense you have for the month should be covered by your incoming cash, which means there is no use for credit. If you find yourself out of cash, it means you were not sticking to your budget.
Cutting up credit cards, as mentioned earlier, is an excellent solution to make sure you do not use them for impulse purchases.

, While closing credit cards can be a tempting option to prevent further usage, it can cause more harm then good.


One large aspect of your credit score is what is known as your ""credit utilization"", which refers to how much of your available credit that you use. By closing cards, you reduce your available credit, and thereby increase your overall credit utilization. This can harm your credit score, and make getting future loans more challenging. A better option is simply to cut up credit cards.
In addition, having multiple types of credit (like mortgages, auto-loans, credit cards) improves your credit score. Therefore, by maintaining your credit cards, you are holding an additional type of credit. If you feel you cannot keep the card and not use it, cut it up.
You may also want to look into how to improve your credit score.

, If you feel overwhelmed, reputable debt counselors can help negotiate with credit card companies and help you to create a debt repayment plan that will work for your circumstances.

, A not-for-profit service is more likely to be legitimate. Many for-profit debt services charge high fees and can lead to even greater debt. Ask friends or family for referrals to find a good service. Reputable non-profit debt counselors can also be found through local institutions, such as:


Universities
Military bases
Credit unions
Public housing authorities

, Debt counselors may suggest a debt management plan or a debt settlement plan. These services can help with debt repayment but they have complicated benefits and costs. Discuss any plans in detail with a counselor to make sure you understand any fees and risks involved.Be aware that these costs could potentially include a worsening of your credit score, as debt settlement typically has a negative impact on your credit score. The degree to which your score is affected depends on how many account are being settled, as well as the amounts. Make sure to discuss this with any debt counselor before proceeding, to ensure the benefits of less debt outweigh a worsened credit score."

Save your money.,
Create a budget.,
Identify areas where you can reduce spending.,
Create an emergency savings fund.,
Take advantage of a workplace 401(k) if you have one.",How to Become Rich Someday1," Saving money is one of the most important skills on the path to wealth. While the saying ""a penny saved is a penny earned"" is true to an extent, in reality, a penny saved may equal a dollar earned over time if you properly invest your saved money.


Saving money requires one thing — to spend less than you take in. This is easier to do if you have a solid income (which is why investing in education is important), but it is important to remember that it is possible to save money regardless of your income, even if the amounts are small.
Try to start by saving 10% of your paycheck each month. While this is a recommended goal, if this is not possible, simply save what you can, with the goal being to add something to your savings each month.;
, A solid budget is the first step on the path to wealth. It helps you to identify all your expenses, and therefore control and reduce them. This, in turn, allows you to save your money which gives you capital to invest with.


On a sheet of paper or in a word processing document, list all your income for the course of a month in one column. At the bottom, add up the sources to determine a total.
In another column, do the same for expenses. Make sure to include everything. One helpful way to do this is to examine your bank statement and credit card statement. Add all the expenses in the column together to determine the total monthly expenses.

, Look closely at the expense column to find areas to reduce spending. Your goal should be to create more ""space"" between the total number in the income column, and the total number in the expense column.


One way to do this is to examine the difference between ""wants"", and ""needs"". A need is essential, whereas as a want is option. Look to your ""wants"" each month to find reductions. For example, you may want a brand new phone with a 3GB data plan, while you only need a basic phone with a simple 1GB plan.
Consider looking at your needs as well, and examining how to reduce them. For example, rent is a need, but you may be able to find a more affordable apartment in a cheaper area of town, or downgrade from a two-bedroom to a one-bedroom, for example.

, Before you invest at all, always have an emergency savings fund prepared. Experts recommend having at least three months of living expenses set aside in case of a job loss, medical emergency, or unexpected expense.


After an emergency fund is prepared, you can then focus on using your savings to build your investment portfolio.

, About half of American workplaces have access to something called a 401(k), which is a special plan whereby some money is deducted every month from your check and invested. Often, your employer will match all or a portion of your contribution.


The benefit of a 401(k) is that your money can grow tax-free (normally taxes are charged and collected annually on invested money which makes it grow slower). In addition, money you contribute is tax-deductible. This means if you contribute $5,000, you won't pay income tax on that money.
Inquire at your workplace if a 401(k) plan is available, and make sure to take advantage of it, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is an excellent way to get started on a path to wealth.

, Carry only what you need, and keep the rest in a bank account or at home. If you do want to carry cash on hand, keep at just enough to buy small quantities of food, and cab fare.

, Otherwise, keep all credit cards at home, at all times. Not only will this help if you ever have to pull out your wallet, but protect yourself from impulse buys.

Keep a log of all of your spending for at least a month so you'll have a good idea of how much you're spending.The easiest way to do this is to download a financial app that you can connect to your bank accounts and credit cards. It will automatically populate your transactions, and may even categorize most of them automatically as well.
You'll still need to go through and check those categories to make sure they're accurate.
With an app, you'll have the benefit of charts and graphs that you can use to evaluate where your money is going.;
, You may have a number of regular subscriptions that you aren't really using. While you're trying to save as much money as possible, cancel anything that isn't giving you any benefit anymore.For example, if you have a subscription to magazines that you no longer read, you might want to go ahead and cancel them.

, If you want to create generational wealth, you need to spend as little as possible. This can be difficult and requires some sacrifice. Try to eliminate any spending on frivolous or unnecessary items.For example, suppose you get a cappuccino from the café down the street from your office every afternoon. After tracking your spending, you've discovered that you spend $150 a month on cappuccinos. By drinking the coffee at work and eliminating that expense, you've found an extra $150 you can save each month.

, You're not going to create generational wealth if you're living paycheck to paycheck. You can live a frugal, minimal lifestyle but if you're not bringing in a lot of income, your savings will remain minimal.Depending on your current job, education, and experience, this might take longer. Think about your skills and the areas in which you have expertise, as well as the things you are passionate about.
Consider starting your own business, even if it starts out as a side gig and you're still working a regular day job for awhile.

, Once you've got your spending down to the absolute necessities, you should be able to come up with a portion of your income that you can save each month.You might want to set several goals, especially if you've just started saving. Be patient with yourself, and remember that habits don't change over night.
For example, you might ultimately want to get to the point that you're saving 50 percent of your monthly income. Start by setting a goal of 25 percent of your income the first month, then increase that goal to 30 percent the next month. Increase the percentage each month until you're saving 50 percent of your income.

, To create generational wealth, you must change your attitude towards saving. Typically, people will spend money over the course of a month and then save whatever's left. You need to save as much as possible, and live on what's left.By putting savings first, you signify that savings and investment are more important than your daily expenses. Ideally, you want to get to the point where you're saving more of your income than you're spending each month.

, Your budget will determine how much it costs you to live each month, and how much money you're allocating for various needs, such as food and clothing. Set these numbers as low as possible, and aim to come in under budget each month.Search for ways to save money and stay within your budget. For example, maybe you can get an old car repaired instead of buying a new car. You can buy used clothing at a thrift store instead of buying something new.
Review your budget every month and compare it to your actual spending to see how you're doing. You may need to adjust it as your needs change, but make sure you're continuing to distinguish needs from wants.

, If you live in the United States, you are entitled to one free credit report per year. However, if you are trying to get out of debt, you want a copy of your credit report from all three major reporting bureaus, so you can compare them.To get your free credit report, visit https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action. This is the only website authorized by the federal government, and is sponsored by all three bureaus. Once you've gotten one for free, you'll have to pay a small fee for the other two.
Review your credit reports and contact the credit bureau that issued the report if you find any errors, so they can be corrected.

, Going off of your credit reports, you can create a spreadsheet or list of all the debts you have. Include the name of the lender, the type of debt it is, the minimum monthly payment, and the interest rate.As you're going through your debts, if you see anything small that you know you can take care of immediately, go ahead and do so. What you should be left with on your list are any debts that will take several months to pay off.
Creating generational wealth is impossible if you are carrying a lot of debt. While you still should be saving, if you have a lot of debt you want to focus on paying that off before turning your attention to savings and investment.

, Take your list of debts and organize it so that the highest interest rate is first. The higher the interest rate you're paying, the more money you're losing on that debt.This may seem counter-intuitive at first, especially if you have a larger debt at a lower interest rate. However, it's important to get the higher-interest debts out of the way so that you aren't continuing to pay that interest.
If you have a lot of debts, see what you can do to chip away at all of them, while still focusing on paying off those with the highest interest rates.
Once you've paid off your high-interest debt, start consolidating your debt and getting rid of some of the credit cards you no longer need. Don't close the accounts, as this can negatively impact your credit rating. Instead, use only one credit card on a regular basis and try to pay the balance in full every month.

, If you're in good standing with your lenders, you may be able to get them to lower your interest rate. It also may be possible to refinance some loans with another lender so you can get a lower interest rate.Keep in mind most consumer credit card companies are reluctant to lower your interest rate. For this reason, it's generally best to pay the balance on any consumer credit cards in full every month, rather than carrying a balance from month to month.

, Often, credit card debt is accumulated because of an unexpected emergency. If you build a savings account with three to six months' worth of living expenses, you will protect yourself against future credit card debt., If you want to create generational wealth, you need to work with a professional who has the expertise to manage your investments appropriately. Look for someone with lower fees who has experience managing large portfolios and is focused on long-term growth.Determine your investment objectives, including the return you want and the amount of risk you're willing to take to realize that return.
Discuss your entire financial picture with your advisor, including your household budget, tax considerations, and the length of time you have to build your portfolio.

, The real estate market goes up and down, but real estate tends to appreciate over time. Typically, investing in real estate will produce greater returns than if you invested a similar amount of money in the stock market.Buying real estate and renting it out can be a way to earn passive income that you can turn around and invest.
With real estate you also build equity, which is essential if you want to create generational wealth.

, With some retirement accounts, the government does not tax the money that you contribute over the course of the year, up to a certain maximum amount. Find out the maximum you can contribute to these accounts and hit that maximum every year.For example, in the US you can contribute up to $5,500 a year to a Roth IRA if you're under 50 years old. Roth IRA contributions are after-tax dollars, but they are never taxed again. This can be a valuable savings vehicle, particularly if you are a younger investor who isn't making over $100,000 yet.
Set your retirement funds to automatically withdraw from your paychecks, if possible, so the money is invested before it even comes into your hands. If you're contributing after-tax dollars to a retirement account, set up automatic withdrawals from your checking account the same day as your check is deposited.

, If you want to create a sizable portfolio of investments that will provide income for several generations, you can't limit yourself to conservative investments.The greater the risk, the greater the potential for large returns. However, there also is the possibility that you will end up with significant losses.
The amount of risk you should take on depends on your age and your general investment style. If you're a younger investor and plan to invest for several decades before retiring, you can afford to take on more risk. However, if you're older and nearing retirement, you'll want to take on less risk.

, If you want your portfolio to grow, you need to take on several different classes and styles of investment. That way, if one part of the market is underperforming, your other investments may make up for that loss.Good diversification will remove the timing element from your investment strategy, so that your assets are not subject to the whims of the market.
Work with your financial advisor to build a strong diversification strategy, then review your portfolio once a year and adjust your assets as necessary to maintain that diversification. For example, if an investment that was 10 percent of your portfolio outperformed, and now makes up 15 percent of your portfolio, you would want to take that 5 percent and move it to an underperforming investment to maintain your balance.

, If you want your portfolio to last forever (or at least for several generations), you can't withdraw too much. Generally, you should withdraw at least 1 percent less than your rate of return minus the annual rate of inflation.For example, you wouldn't want to withdraw more than 3.5 percent of your portfolio each year if your rate of return was 6 percent and annual inflation was 2.5 percent.
Even a sizable portfolio won't last if you're taking out more money each year than it is earning. To create generational wealth, you need to keep your withdrawals as low as possible in the years after you retire.

Understand the basics of investing.,
Learn about mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).,
Choose a broker.,
Add to your investments regularly.,
Start investing as soon as possible.",How to Become Rich Someday2," Investing can be very complex, but fortunately, it does not have to be. In fact, by sticking to some very basic principles, you can invest your savings and see them grow over a long time period.


Generally speaking, there are a few types of options for investing. The main ones are stocks, and bonds. Stocks represent ownership in a business, and bonds represent money you lend to a business or government in exchange for regular interest payments.
Most investors have a combination of debt and equity in their portfolios.

, Mutual funds and ETFs are similar in that each is a collection of many stocks or bonds. They provide a way to diversify your portfolio to an extent that would be impossible if you were only investing in stocks one at a time. There are some significant differences between Mutual funds and ETFs, so research both before deciding where to invest your money.


ETFs offer greater flexibility and lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds.ETFs are more tax efficient, but they see fewer capital gains than mutual funds.ETFs trade like regular stocks and their value fluctuates throughout the day. The value of a mutual fund is calculated only once a day, using the closing market prices of the securities in the fund's portfolio.Mutual funds are managed while most ETFs are not. The holdings of a mutual fund are selected by a fund manager who seeks to make the fund as profitable as possible. The manager actively monitors the market and revises the fund's assets accordingly.

, Decide if you want to use an online broker or a full service broker. A full service broker has the time and knowledge to make your investment work for you; however, they can also charge a substantial fee. If you feel you understand the market fairly well and want to manage your own portfolio, then you may wish to sign up with an online broker, such as TD Ameritrade, Capital One, Scottrade, E*Trade and Charles Schwab.


Always be mindful of fees before opening accounts, as well as account minimums. Brokers all charge fees per trade (ranging from $4.95 to $10 generally), and many also require a minimum initial investment (ranging from $500 to much higher).
Currently, online brokers that have no minimum initial investment include Capital One Investing, TD Ameritrade, First Trade, TradeKing, and OptionsHouse.If you want more help with your investing, there are a variety of ways to find financial advice: if you want someone who helps you in a non-sales environment, you can find an advisor in your area at one of the following sites: letsmakeaplan.org, www.napfa.org, garrettplanningnetwork.com. You can also go to your local bank or financial institution; however, many of these charge higher fees and require a large minimum to invest ($500,000 to $1,000,000 is common).
Some advisors, (like a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™) have the ability to give advice in a number of areas, like investments, taxes and retirement planning, while others can only take direction but not give advice, Also important to know is that not all people who work at financial institutions are bound to a fiduciary duty of putting their client's interest first. Before starting to work with someone, ask about their training and expertise, to make sure they are the right fit for you.

, Instead of investing a large amount of money and hoping the timing works out, you can invest over time, lessening the risk of investing. This is known as dollar cost averaging (DCA).To do this, make a schedule (like once a month) to spend a fixed amount buying shares. When the price of the shares is low, you will purchase more shares; when the price is high, you will purchase fewer shares, all for the same amount of money each month.Let's say you commit to investing $100 in company X once a month. This month, the shares cost $10 each, so you will buy ten shares (for $100). Next month, the shares cost $20, so you buy five shares (for $100), an so on.
Always stay invested regardless of what happens to the market. There have been 11 market crashes since 1956, but every time the market has recovered to earn far more than it lost. Simply continue adding each and every month, and be comfortable with the fact that your wealth will grow over time.

, The real secret to wealth is to start investing early. Doing this will allow your wealth to ""compound"" over time. Compounding means that your initial amount will earn interest, then the next year, interest will be earned on your original amount plus the added interest.For example, if you invest $100 and it earns 5% in a year, you would have $105. The next year, you would earn 5% on $105. This means you would would have $110.25. The next year, you would earn 5% on 110.25, and so on.
The results over time are incredible. If you invested $1,000 a month starting 30 years ago, you would have $1.8 million today. This is the surest way to create wealth.

Understand the value of an education.,
Consider upgrading your education.,
Examine your skills, abilities, interests, and talents.,
Choose an educational path with good earning potential.,
Fund your education.,
Never stop developing yourself.",How to Become Rich Someday3," Secondary and post-secondary education is the most certain way to set yourself on a path to wealth. A recent study found that young-adults with a bachelor's degree earned $17,500 more annually than young-adults with a high-school diploma, and those with some college training earned $3,000 more than those with just a high school diploma.The study also found that salaries for individuals with just a high school diploma is dropping over time.
Research has also shown that the unemployment rate for people with high school diplomas is much higher than for people with post secondary diplomas., As education increases, so does salary, and therefore one of the best ways to increase your income is to increase your education. A journey to wealth can begin by choosing to increase your education level.


For example, the average salary for an associates degree is $50,000, bachelor's degree is $64,000, master's degree is $81,000, and professional degree is $115,000., Whether you have little education and want to upgrade, or already have education and want to choose a more lucrative career path, it always begins with examining yourself.


Linking your natural abilities and interests with an in-demand education is a very certain way to increase your income substantially and get yourself on a path to wealth. Ask yourself what your talents are. Consider the things you do better than other people, or that you are frequently complimented on.
Ask yourself what you are passionate about, or interested in. For example, maybe a particular subject interests you, like mathematics, or a particular activity, like cooking.
Look for areas of overlap between your talents, and your interests. For example, maybe you are interested in the human body, and also are good at math or science. These interests can complement each other.

, For better or worse, some fields simply pay more than others, and are in higher demand. The best situation is to have one of these higher-paying fields or occupations match your skills and interests. If not, consider exploring these fields anyways to see if you can develop an interest.Currently some of the best paying university undergraduate majors are engineering, computer science and business/economics. These majors all lead to average salaries above $75,000 per year.
If you already have a university degree and want to pursue further education, careers like law, medicine or dentistry can produce salaries well over $100,000 per year.
Make sure to consider skilled trades as well for a career. If you are a more ""hands-on"" person, there is considerable money that can be made in learning a skilled trade. Plumbers and HVAC technicians can earn over $50,000 per year, and the earning potential is unlimited if you start your own business.Before you choose an educational path, research what the job prospects are currently and when you will enter the field, and what the average salary is. Remember, a popular field today may be saturated in 5 to 10 years.This will help you make sure you can get a return on your investment.

, Unfortunately, educating yourself costs money, but if you choose a wise major, you are very likely to earn your investment back, plus much more.


Consider spending a year or two before you start school to save some money. This will reduce the amount you need to borrow, which means you will have smaller loan repayments when you are done.
Choose your base of operations wisely. Unless you very much enjoy living in a big city or have family/other obligations, choose a less expensive area in which to live and go to school. Choosing a smaller city can lead to thousands in saved living expenses.
Apply for federal student loans to fund your education. These loans often have lower interest rates than bank loans, the interest rates are often fixed, and you do not need to repay until you are done with school., Increase your professional skills, leadership skills, financial skills, social skills and general life skills. Making––and keeping–– yourself valuable will increase your chances on whatever path you take. Continuous self-development will enable you to make better use of your financial assets.


Adding to your education constantly means adding to your earning potential. Every new thing you learn increases your ability to earn.

Don't play victim.,

Maintain the millionaire mindset.,
Keep informed and keep at it.",How to Think Like a Millionaire," The dollar is weak. The housing market is in the tank. But to the millionaire mind, such meltdowns present classic opportunities. As scary as it may seem, you have to make the commitment to write a check to the mutual fund company, start up your 401K, or commit to buying a house, or another piece of real estate. Fear is the number one factor that keeps people from making money. Yet most millionaires invest 20% of their income annually. Overcome your fear and start making your money work for you.;
, Millionaires are always researching and studying trends. There are lots of investment opportunities out there so keep your eyes and ears open, looking for the next long-term growth opportunity. The millionaire mind is looking for long-term returns, investments that will make money over time. Stocks, bonds, real estate and private investments can generate huge opportunities. Millionaires know where to put their money.

, There is nothing worse than claiming you can never have money because your parents weren't rich, or that your family has never been rich. So what? Eighty percent of millionaires did not inherit their fortunes. They were determined people with great ideas who acted on them. That could be you too.

, You may want that house in the hills or that million dollar island, but most millionaires live below their means. Sixty six percent of them work 45- 55 hour weeks. Continuing to be thrifty and continuing to work leaves plenty of money to invest. There's a lot of temptation to spend money when you have money. Chances are that guy living in the million dollar home, driving the million dollar car is deeper in debt than you.

, It is surprisingly straightforward and yet so difficult to do for some. The following list gives a good outline for thinking like a millionaire.


Save your money
Seek new opportunities
Invest wisely
Be consistent
Be positive
Be humble; and
Be grateful.

, It is important to be aware of what is happening around you and what is impacting people other than just yourself. Understanding what worries and what motivates other people is a key to knowing what to invest in next. And be persistent; your belief that you will get to where you want to go is vital to hold on to. Good luck!

Be kind to others.",How to Protect Your Wealth," By driving expensive cars, wearing flashy jewelry, talking about how much money you have, you are asking to be a target. Always be aware of your surroundings, and who might be listening.;
, Just because you can afford the most expensive ""everything"" doesn't mean you always have to pay top dollar. Wealthy people can still seek and appreciate bargains. And you don't have to be wasteful. If you no longer want something that is still useful, give it away to someone who will be delighted with it.

, Diversify your investments so if one goes sour, you still have a cushion. Invest in good security for your home and property. Practice good safety habits and teach them to your children.

, Most auto and homeowners insurance policies allow you to add a rider--sometimes up to several million dollars--that can protect your assets if you get sued as the result of an accident caused by your alleged negligence.

, It may be tempting to turn tedious money management over to a professional, but insist on keeping informed. Review your accounts, and if you don't understand a transaction, don't be afraid to ask for an explanation.

, Don't forget to acknowledge those who have helped you along the way. Avoid being a jerk without being a pushover.

Reach an agreement.",How to Make a Successful Negotiation," What do you want? Why is that important to you? Some negotiators say that to get to the root of the issue, you must ask yourself five different ""why"" questions. You don't have to know everything, but you do have to understand what everybody wants and why.;
, Negotiating provoked strong emotions and emotion causes people to be subjective and can cloud a person's judgement. You have to stay calm at all times and remember to use a positive tone. Cultivating curiosity allows you to relax the situation, focus on the important issues and keep your emotions stable.

, In some negotiations, a gain for one party means an equal loss for the other. For example, when you go to buy a car, you want the lowest price and the salesman wants the highest. Another example is a negotiation regarding one's salary, an employer wants to pay as little as possible and you want the opposite. However, some benefits exist for balancing the salary: add in flextime, telecommuting, vacation, etc. These benefits are more than zero in a negotiation and both sides can reach an agreement.

, Define success before you come to the table. What do you really want? Generally, people lack confidence when entering a negotiation and they set their aspirations too low. Think about what you want to achieve before entering negotiations.

, Determine your aspiration and work to create a better one (your alternative). It's important to think about alternatives because the negotiation will not always go as well as you hope. This point is illustrated with an example: when you go a car shopping you consider two cars, one much nicer than the other. The nicer car cost much more and you can only afford it if you can negotiate a good price. Otherwise, you buy the cheaper car. The expensive car is your aspiration; the cheaper one is your alternative.

, Your aspiration and best alternative define the range of possible agreements for you. If the other person offers something below your best alternative, don't take it.

, What does the other person want? What's their best alternative? Let people know that you understand what they want, understand why they want it, and that you think it's a legitimate interest.

, Compare their range to yours. Where do the two overlap? That's where you will find agreement.

Take time to sit down and evaluate your current financial situation.,
Understand your spending habits, and if you are living above your means, then you need to cut back by reducing your wants and sticking to your needs.,
Determine which of your credit cards has the lowest payment, and start paying it off with additional amounts toward the principal.,
Learn to pay for everything with cash.,
Start to save money as you pay off your debt.",How to Transform Debt Into Wealth," Determine what you have in credit card debt, what loans you have to pay off, and what you have in savings. You also want to get a good idea of what you pay every month in regular bills. With all this information, you need to decipher what you need every month to pay off your bills. You can do this by adding up your monthly bills, multiplying that by 12 to get your annual amount, and then divide that by 52 to get your weekly obligation. If you get paid weekly, this is what you need to take out of your income every week. If you get paid biweekly, multiply the amount by 2, and you have what you need to put aside for bills from every paycheck. If you find that your expenses far outweigh your income, you are living above your means, and you need to make some serious changes.;
, Your needs are those things that you need to survive, such as utilities and necessary foods. Be realistic about what you need because if you honestly think you are spending your bare minimum, and the cost of your needs is still more than your income, you may need to get a second job. Therefore, look at your phone bill, your cable and your electricity, and ask yourself if you can cut back. If you find that you have money left over after deducting your expenses, then this true monthly cash flow is what you will use to turn liability into capital.

, You should be paying more than the minimum amounts on all of your credit cards, as principal, but pay larger amounts towards the smaller balances. You may want to think about applying for 0% credit cards if you are eligible. This way you can consolidate your current cards, or at least higher balances so that they don't accumulate interest while you pay off the lower balances. Just make a note of when the interest on 0% credit cards kicks in because often times they have really high interest rates; you may need to move the balance again. The focus is to pay off these balances, and in doing so, you cannot use your credit cards.

, If you don't know how to use a credit card to benefit you, you should not use one at all. Your objective in turning your debt into wealth is to get rid of all debt so that the payments used to pay off debt are now building your savings.

, You may not have much to start off with. But as you pay off each credit card and loan, take that amount that went toward the now-paid-off debt and divide it. Use part of it to go toward paying off your next debt, and put the other half in savings. Once you have paid off all your debts, you should be putting everything into savings. You should have at least 6 months worth of bills in your savings as an emergency fund. Ideally, you should have a year's worth in this economy. As you start to build your emergency fund, take a portion of your true money cash flow and start investing it in a retirement fund. If you follow these steps religiously, then you will pay off all your debt. Your money will be better invested in resources that will build it, thus transforming debt into wealth.

Work effectively.,
Make sure that everyone knows the ground rules for discussion.,
Make sure each participant gets the chance to present their perspective.,
Summarize and reflect.,
Create an agenda.,
Speak through the chairperson.",How to Start a Mediation Meeting," Make sure that the people involved feel comfortable. Be sure that you remain neutral and listen. In order to remain neutral it is important to pay close attention to your reactions. Try to keep facial expressions to a minimum and try to keep an equal amount of eye contact with the two of them. It will help you if you keep your responses short and be confident. Using words like create, explore, clarify, and share will help encourage positive responses while words like must, require, impose, and expect may do the opposite. Jot down questions in shorthand when they come into your head so that you do not interrupt one the participants and save your questions until the end.
, Some ground rules you may want to consider would be courteous treatment and openness to new ideas. Direct the flow of discussion and stress uninterrupted time., Decide who speaks first and listen to both equally. None of the parties are allowed to interrupt the opposite party when there is their turn to talk. They might like to take notes to remember the ideas that they need to refer to but they can't interrupt no matter how important it is what they need to say., Re-frame their statements into more neutralizing statements. Reflect their emotions and neutralize their perspectives.

Ex 1. Statement: ""I can't believe she fluffed another presentation."" Reflected: ""You're concerned about the quality of the presentation.""
Ex 2. Statement: ""The presentation was a total wreck."" Neutralized: ""The presentation didn't go as well as you had hoped.""

, In this agenda your ultimate goal is to transition from the past situations to future situations. You want to separate their topics and label and define the issues. Consider common agenda topics and use the agenda for negotiations. Have the participants choose one topic at a time to discuss and be thorough on the topic before you move on. If the participants get stuck, its okay to come back to that topic later and move to the next one. Be sure to talk about every concern and idea on the list., In order to avoid conflict between the parties, as part of the ground rules the best idea is to request that all the conversations will take place through the chair. The parties are not allowed to address each other at any moment of the mediation. In this way there is a less chance that the negative feelings will come to the surface during the discussion."

If you are interested in mediation, then check with the court clerk to see if your court offers a mediation program.


Your courthouse also might keep a list of approved mediators.You should ask if the clerk has a list you could look at.;
, You can do a general search for “mediator” and your city or county. There are also different online directories you can use to find a potential mediator.


The website mediation.org has a directory you can search. Type in your location and the nature of your dispute.You can then review the list of potential mediators in your area. Click on a name to review a mediator’s education, mediation experience, and hourly fee.

, There are many private mediation organizations which you can contact to find a mediator. Generally, you would only get mediators from these organizations if you have a complicated business dispute worth a lot of money. You could contact the following:JAMS
American Arbitration Association
Judicate

, Some local or state bar associations also offer referrals to mediators. A bar association is an organization made up of lawyers. Since many lawyers are also mediators, you can get a referral through these organizations.


You can find contact information for your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association website., You and the other side should pick the mediator jointly, so that no one thinks the mediator will be biased. You can both review the mediator’s credentials by asking for a resume, and each of you can talk to the mediator before agreeing to hire him or her.


You will also split the cost of mediation. Generally, mediators charge $70-400 an hour, depending on the complexity of the dispute.Mediators will determine when they get paid. However, many require payment after each mediation session., The mediator might call you before the mediation in order to get some background information on the dispute. The mediator will also call the other side. The purpose of the call is to figure out areas of disagreement as well as areas of agreement.The mediator might also give you paperwork to fill out.You don’t gain anything by shading the truth, since the mediator is not a judge and will not be on anyone’s “side” during mediation.
Be as honest and as objective as you can. Don’t speculate about what the other side wants unless the mediator asks you to.

, Before you can negotiate effectively, you should think about what you hope to get out of the mediation. Ideally, you will resolve the dispute in some way. You should think about your priorities.


For example, in a divorce mediation, you will likely discuss the division of property and debts, child custody, child support, and possible alimony. You should have some understanding of what you would like to get. You should also establish priorities. For example, getting full custody of your children may be more important than alimony.
If you’ve already filed a lawsuit, then review your complaint or petition and see what you have asked for.

, You should give some thought about what other options you have besides reaching a settlement agreement. For example, if you are involved in a personal injury lawsuit, then your next best alternative might be to go to trial and defend yourself. This is your BATNA, “Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement.”Your alternative may or may not be appealing. For example, in a divorce, your BATNA could be to go to court and have the judge decide custody. However, this can be emotionally draining on your children, so you might want to avoid it.
Alternately, your BATNA might be fairly attractive. For example, if you are the defendant in a lawsuit, then you might be confident that your evidence is strong. If so, your BATNA could be to go to trial and win the lawsuit.

, Mediation is a voluntary process, and you can walk away at any point if you think that the mediation has stalled. You should identify the absolute minimum that you are willing to settle for. This is called your “walkaway” point.If the other side can’t meet this minimum, you leave mediation.


The attractiveness of your BATNA will in large part determine your walkaway point. If your BATNA is strong, then you could come up with a favorable walkaway point. For example, if you have a good defense to your lawsuit, then your walkaway point might only be 25% of what the plaintiff is asked for.
Take a fresh look at your dispute and any evidence that you have available. Try to analyze the strength of your case. If going to trial is your BATNA, but your evidence is weak, then you might be willing to give up a lot during mediation. For example, you might settle for an amount close to what the person suing you has asked for.

, Each mediation might be a little different, but often the mediator will begin by introducing everyone and explaining the rules and goals of mediation.The mediator will also encourage each side to work with each other so that the mediation can be successful.
The mediator might also have you sign a confidentiality agreement and probably will also explain that they will not divulge any statement either side made in mediation., Each party in the mediation gets to deliver an opening statement. The purpose is to explain in your own words the substance of the dispute and how it has affected you. You must listen quietly to the other side’s opening statement. Don’t interrupt.If you were injured in a car accident, you could say: “As I see it, this dispute involves who is responsible for the crash. I was driving through a green light when Mr. Jones sideswiped me. Immediately, I couldn’t feel my legs, and emergency services had to pry me out of the car. At the hospital, I had two surgeries to try and set the bones in my legs, which were broken into dozens of pieces. Since then, I’ve had three months of rehab and still can’t put full pressure on my legs. I need compensation to pay for my medical bills and lost work, and to compensate by pain and suffering. If we could agree on a realistic amount of compensation, I would feel comfortable dropping the lawsuit.”

, The mediator will also try to prompt each side to begin to talk with each other. At this point, you can begin to identify what issues need to be addressed by the mediation.Try to practice an active listening style. Sit comfortably so that you face the other person. Don’t cross your arms or angle your body away. Make eye contact as they speak to you and nod your head occasionally to show that you hear them.
Remember to use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.The other side is less likely to get defensive when you speak about how you feel.

, One benefit of mediation is that you can actually have a conversation. If you are in a lawsuit, you probably assume that you already know what the other side wants: to win the lawsuit. However, the other side could be open to compromise. You should try to figure out what issue is most important to the other side.For example, someone might be willing to pay money compensation but wants to avoid admitting that they were at fault. You can agree to a monetary settlement without requiring the other person to admit that what they did was wrong.
By contrast, someone else might really want an apology, with monetary compensation a secondary consideration. You might be pleasantly surprised that the other side isn’t too focused on money.

, As the mediation continues, the mediator might feel that it would help to meet with each side individually. This is called “caucusing.” The mediator will meet with each side in their own room and then shuttle back and forth between rooms.


During the caucus, you can speak more openly with the mediator and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your position.You don’t have to worry about the other side finding out what you think or fear; the mediator will keep your confidences.
The mediator might also float creative solutions for you to consider privately. You can discuss the strengths and negatives. If you reject a solution, then the mediator won’t mention it to the other side.

, If you do reach agreement, then the mediator may write down the main terms of your agreement on paper and ask each side to sign. You should then take the agreement to a lawyer and ask them to review it.You might not reach agreement after one mediation session. In this situation, the mediator will review what progress has been made to that point and possibly recommend additional mediation sessions.

, Often, you are in a legal dispute because the other side is being unreasonable or underhanded. However, you should avoid using insulting language.Don’t call someone an “idiot” or “scumbag.” If you are involved in a dispute with a landlord, don’t say, “You are a slumlord.”


Insulting the other side is never productive in mediation. Remember that you agreed to mediate because you honestly want to reach a resolution. Putting someone on the defensive will impede reaching any resolution.

, Mediation can become emotional. You might hear the other side say something that upsets you. Your instinct might be to lash out and say something snarky or rude in return. You should try, as best as possible, to avoid doing so.If someone has just said something incredibly hurtful, it is better to ask the mediator for a “time out” so that you can cool down. When the anger has passed, you can return to mediation.

, You don’t know what has motivated someone’s actions. Accordingly, you shouldn’t state that you do. Often, you will be tempted to assign a motivation that makes the person look bad.Saying “You tried to fire me because you don’t like female supervisors” is a statement where you pretend to know what is motivating someone. It also allows you to claim the other person is sexist, which may not be true.

, You should not use these words. They are unproductive because the other side will come up with counterexamples to show that something isn’t always or never true.In this situation, the mediation becomes an argument about side issues, which is not helpful.


If you do accidentally make an “always” or “never” statement, then apologize and try to move on. Don’t get hung up in an argument.

Enforce your judgment.",How to Take Action Against Breaches of Exclusive Arbitration Provisions," You will know that you are being sued in a court when you receive a copy of the complaint and a summons.The person suing you is the “plaintiff” and you are the “defendant.” You should read the complaint closely to identify why you are being sued. Also note the court where you are being sued.


The complaint should also explain why the court has power over you. This power is called “jurisdiction.” Generally, a court has power over you if it is located in the same state as where you are domiciled.
A court might also have jurisdiction for other reasons. For example, if you manufacture airplanes, then you could be sued in a foreign country where a plane accident occurred.You can also be sued in a state or country where you have business contacts.;
, You are probably surprised that the plaintiff is suing you when there is an arbitration agreement. Often, a court will refuse jurisdiction. Over 150 countries have signed onto the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, and courts in these countries should not assert jurisdiction over a case. However, a plaintiff might still file a lawsuit for the following reasons:The court is in a country which did not sign onto the New York Convention. In this situation, the Convention has no effect.
There exists some dispute as to whether the arbitration clause is valid. In this situation, the plaintiff might try to get the court to find the clause invalid, thus allowing the lawsuit to proceed.
The dispute falls outside the arbitration provision. For example, the contract might state you will arbitrate employment issues but not issues involving intellectual property.
A parent company or an affiliate is sued, and they were not a party to the arbitration agreement.

, You might be a large corporation. If so, you probably already have a general counsel, as well as a law firm you work with regularly. They can help you respond to the lawsuit. However, if you don’t have a lawyer, then you need to get one quickly. This is a complicated area of law and you will need professional help.


You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Tell the referral service that you need a lawyer with experience handling arbitration disputes.
Once you have the name of a lawyer, call them up and schedule a consultation. At the consultation, explain your issue and also ask how much it will cost to hire the attorney.

, You should challenge the court’s jurisdiction to hear the case on the grounds that there is a valid arbitration provision.Have your lawyer or general counsel draft a motion to stay the proceedings.


If the plaintiff filed suit in the United States, then you can also include a motion to compel arbitration. The U.S. has a strong policy of enforcing arbitration agreements.
You have to serve the plaintiff with a copy of your motion. You can expect the plaintiff to respond by filing their own motion in response.

, Your lawyer should prepare to argue the motion in front of the judge. Your lawyer will need to explain why the arbitration provision is valid and why the court should stay its proceedings while you arbitrate the dispute.

, The judge can decide to stay the proceedings. Alternately, the judge might decide to go ahead with the lawsuit. You should receive a written opinion from the court explaining its decision.


If you win, then the lawsuit should be stayed until the arbitration is concluded.
If you lose, then you might be able to appeal immediately. However, in some states, you can’t appeal until the lawsuit is over. In those states, you will need to defend yourself in the lawsuit and then appeal if you lose.If you can’t appeal, then you should also discuss with your lawyer whether you should try to pursue arbitration at the same time. If you are able to get a favorable arbitration decision, then you might be able to enforce that award before the parallel court lawsuit is resolved.

, An anti-suit injunction is an option where a court asserts jurisdiction although there is a valid arbitration agreement. This type of injunction is a court order directed at the plaintiff to stop pursuing the parallel lawsuit. Unfortunately, anti-suit injunctions are not available in every country. For example, courts in many civil law countries will not issue one. Most European countries are civil law countries.


However, common law countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom will issue anti-suit injunctions.Courts in Hong Kong will also issue them.If both you and the plaintiff are domiciled in the U.S., then you can seek an anti-suit injunction.

, You can’t ask just any court to give you an anti-suit injunction. Instead, the court must have jurisdiction over the other party in order to issue one. You can sue for the injunction in the country where you had agreed to arbitrate.


For example, you might be a French company. You have an agreement to arbitrate disputes in New York City. In this situation, you can seek an anti-suit injunction in New York. Read your arbitration agreement to see if you had identified a location to arbitrate.
You can also seek an anti-suit injunction wherever the plaintiff is domiciled., You may be able to get an anti-suit injunction from an arbitration panel instead of from a court. For example, an arbitration panel might already have been created for your dispute. In this situation, the panel probably has the power to grant interim relief, such as the injunction.However, arbitration panels don’t have inherent authority to enforce any anti-suit injunction. For this reason, you might want to seek an anti-suit injunction from a court, unless you can’t find a court with jurisdiction over the other party that is willing to issue one.

, Some courts will refuse to grant an anti-suit injunction if you don’t request one promptly enough.In fact, some courts might want you to file for an anti-suit injunction before you even challenge the court’s jurisdiction to hear the parallel action.Talk about the proper sequence with your attorney. You may benefit by racing to the courthouse to file for the anti-suit injunction before you challenge the court’s jurisdiction in the parallel suit.

, Anti-suit injunctions are not something you can handle on your own. Even if you have a general counsel or a law firm that represents you, you might need to obtain local counsel in the country or state where you are seeking the anti-suit injunction.


For example, you might be located in Florida. If you want to seek the injunction in New York, then it is necessary to have someone who is familiar with New York law. This person knows the law and can also physically file papers for you.

, You have to request that the court enjoin the plaintiff from continuing with their lawsuit.Your lawyer should draft a complaint requesting an anti-suit injunction and file it with the court.


Provide your lawyer with all necessary information, such as a copy of the arbitral agreement. Your lawyer will need to refer to the agreement in the complaint.

, You need to make sure that the plaintiff gets a copy of your complaint, along with a summons. You should have them served according to the rules of the country or state where the court sits.


The other party might not even be in the same country. For example, you might sue for an anti-suit injunction in New York, because that is where you were going to arbitrate. The other party, however, might be in Australia. This type of service of process can be quite complicated and is another reason why you need local counsel.

, After being served with a copy of your complaint, the plaintiff will respond. They will explain why the anti-suit injunction is not appropriate. For example, they might claim that you took too long or that the parallel lawsuit is too far advanced to stop.Your local counsel should receive the copy.


Always ask local counsel for copies of any documents served. Read them with your own lawyer.

, The judge will probably want to hear argument before deciding whether to grant the anti-suit injunction. At the end of argument, the judge may issue an order. Alternately, the judge could take the issue under advisement and issue a written opinion at a later date.

, Hopefully, the plaintiff will move to stay or dismiss the parallel lawsuit if you win your injunction. However, on the off chance that they don’t, then you will need to ask the court for an “order to show cause” why the other party should not be held in contempt of court.Your lawyer can draft another motion and file it with the court. The judge can then try to compel compliance by fining the other party or possibly ordering jail time.

, You can get compensated for any amount spent defending yourself in the parallel lawsuit. This amount of money is called “damages,” which you will receive because the plaintiff breached the arbitration provisions. Hold onto the following types of expenses:


attorney’s fees
filing fees
mailing, printing, and copying
other costs, such as the cost of expert witnesses, court reporters, etc.
the amount of money you are ordered to pay if you lose the parallel proceeding, You can generally sue for damages because of the breach in two different places: arbitration or in a court. You and your lawyer need to analyze which is the better choice for you. Analyze the following:


What courts have jurisdiction over the other party. You can only bring your suit for damages if the court has jurisdiction because the other party is domiciled there or has business contacts.
Whether courts in the country where you can sue award damages for breaches of an arbitration agreement. Not all courts do. For example, courts in the United States do not generally award damages for breach of an arbitration agreement.However, courts in other countries might.
Whether courts will recognize an arbitration panel’s award. Once you win an award, you need to register it with a court. Only then can you enforce the arbitration award. Some countries might not allow you to register an award for breach of an arbitration provision.

, You might have to file a new arbitration seeking a declaratory judgment that the other party breached the arbitration agreement.Alternately, you could file for a declaratory judgment in a court that has jurisdiction over the other party.


When you file for the declaratory judgment, include you claim for damages.

, You will have to convince the arbitration panel or the court that the other party breached the exclusive arbitration provision. As evidence, you will need the arbitration agreement itself, as well as evidence of the parallel lawsuit, such as court documents. You also will need to prove your damages.

, If you obtain an award of damages from an arbitration panel, then you can enforce the judgment by entering the judgment in a court that has jurisdiction over the other party. The other party may try to claim that the arbitration award is invalid.If the other party won’t pay up, then you can typically put liens on property, garnish wages or bank accounts, or use other mechanisms.

Gather information about the transaction.,
File a complaint with the auction host.,
Contact your bank or credit card company.,
File a complaint with the FBI.",How to Report Internet Fraud1," To make a full report, you'll need details about the seller and the items sold, including the seller's user name and address, and the date and time of the close of the auction.Internet auction fraud includes misrepresenting an item listed on an internet auction site, or not delivering the item purchased after you've won the auction and paid for it.Learn as much as you can about the seller, and take note of all feedback, both positive and negative. If the seller is listed as a business, you also might check the Better Business Bureau in the seller's state and see if any complaints have been filed there.;
, Most online auction hosts such as eBay have their own methods for resolving a dispute.Once you file your dispute, the auction host will contact the seller and attempt to resolve the situation.You also can use mediation services such as SquareTrade, or file a complaint in small claims court if necessary to get your money back., If you've been charged for an item you did not receive, you usually can contact your bank or credit card company and have the amount charged back to the seller.

, Even if the incident is resolved to your satisfaction through the private companies involved, you still have the option of filing a criminal complaint.


Complaints filed with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) are evaluated by federal law enforcement authorities and may be referred to a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, or to a civil regulatory agency, for investigation.Your credit card company will not be notified of your complaint. Simply filing a federal complaint or report isn't sufficient to get the fraudulent charges removed from your credit card.When you file your complaint, you must include your own contact information, as well as all information you have about the individual or company that defrauded you.After your complaint is received, you will receive an ID and password via email. If you need to add information to your complaint, you can use that information to log on and update your complaint."

Receive the judge's ruling.",How to Legally Dispute Internet Transactions," Before you do anything, get all the documentation you have regarding the transaction – including receipts, confirmation emails, and shipping notifications – and make copies to share with the merchant.You want to be able to explain to the merchant exactly what the problem is and how you'd like it resolved.
If you want a refund because the product you received was faulty or defective in some way, or arrived broken, you might want to take pictures of it. This could be helpful to your case assuming the damage is something visible.
You also might want to take a screen capture of the listing on the merchant's website, if the image or description is related to your dissatisfaction.
For example, if you bought pink curtains for your daughter's bedroom, and the curtains you received were black, the item description proves the item you received was different from the item you purchased.
You'll also need to find out where to send a dispute letter and, ideally, the name of a person to whom you can address it. Typically you can find at least a contact address on the merchant's website.
The website of the secretary of state in the state where the business is physically located may have an address and the name of the merchant's legal agent, if the business is incorporated.;
, Assuming you've been unable to resolve the dispute with the merchant either over the phone or online, compose a written letter describing your problems with the transaction.Government and consumer protection agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have sample dispute letters on their websites that you can use as guides. Follow the sample letters as a basic template, but be sure to adapt them to your situation – don't just copy something verbatim that doesn't apply to your dispute.
Provide as much factual detail about the transaction and your dispute as possible, and attach copies of all emails and other documents for proof.
Include information such as transaction or customer account numbers so the merchant can quickly find the transaction you're disputing.
Tell the merchant exactly what you want to happen to resolve the dispute. Include specific contact information so the merchant can respond, and give him or her a deadline.
Although you probably want the issue resolved as quickly as possible, be sure to set the deadline out far enough that the merchant has time to investigate your transaction – a couple of weeks after receipt of your letter is plenty.

, Once you've finalized your letter, make a copy of it for your records and then mail it to the merchant along with any evidence you've collected. Use certified mail with returned receipt requested so you know when the merchant gets your letter.When you get the receipt back letting you know that the merchant has received your letter, mark the date of the deadline you gave the merchant on your calendar. If you don't receive a response by that date, you're clear to go forward.

, How the merchant responds to your formal letter may dictate the next steps you take. If the merchant agrees to your demands, you may not have to file a lawsuit at all. However, if the merchant is unwilling to work with you, you may have to file a lawsuit if you want your money back.Keep in mind your letter may go to someone higher up the chain of command than anyone you talked to at the business's customer service number, so you may get an entirely different response than you were expecting.
The merchant may call you, but typically they'll respond to a written letter in writing. If they reject your argument, their response should outline their reasons.
If the merchant agrees to work with you to resolve the matter, make sure you get any agreement in writing. If the merchant doesn't follow through on what they agreed to do, you can use the written letter to enforce the agreement.

, Regardless of the outcome of the situation after you send your dispute letter, you can file a complaint with consumer protection agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or the Better Business Bureau (BBB).If your dispute letter doesn't resolve the issue, a complaint to the CFPB can bring the government to bat on your behalf.
Other complaint agencies such as the BBB not only rate the business, but make consumer complaints public to provide notice of past disputes to potential customers checking out the company's reputation.
When filing complaints, stick to the facts and avoid insulting the business or any of the individuals with whom you spoke. Simply relate what happened in an objective manner.
If the complaint will be public, you may include a statement to the effect that you would not recommend doing business with the company, but refrain from hyperbole or personal insults.

, Before you file a lawsuit in small claims court, you must make sure that the amount of money involved in the dispute is below the limit established by your state for small claims, and that the court will have jurisdiction over the merchant.Generally you can only sue in small claims court for money, which means you can't get a court order for the merchant to replace faulty merchandise or the like – you can only get your money back.
Each state has a maximum limit of money you can ask for in small claims, which varies from $2,500 to $10,000.
Keep in mind that if your claim is worth more than your state's maximum for small claims, you typically can't keep your case in small claims by only asking for that maximum limit. The judge will throw the case out or move it to county civil court if the claim is actually worth more.
In addition to the claim limit, you must establish that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant – the merchant you're suing. This can be tricky with disputes over internet transactions.
You must be able to demonstrate that the merchant regularly does business in your state. Generally you can prove this by showing that the merchant sells products or services directly, knew the state in which you lived when the transaction took place, and does a lot of business in your state.
Check your secretary of state's website and search the online directory of regular businesses for the merchant you want to sue. If the merchant is registered to do business in your state and has an agent for service of process, you should be okay on the personal jurisdiction issue.
Even if the business isn't licensed in your state, the court still may have personal jurisdiction, but this is likely something the judge will have to decide based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding your transaction.

, The small claims court in your county will have specific forms that you must fill out and file with the clerk of court to initiate a lawsuit. These forms require information about you and the merchant you want to sue, as well as details about the dispute.You typically can get copies of these forms from the small claims court clerk – you just have to make a trip to the courthouse. While you're there, you can find out how much the filing fees are to start a small claims case.
You also may be able to download small claims forms online at the court's website. If there is no date on the forms, call the clerk's office and make sure the forms you find online are up to date.
You must have the correct name and address of the merchant's registered agent for service of process, as well as the correct legal name of the merchant. Typically you can find this information online. If the merchant isn't registered to do business in your state, check the secretary of state's website of the state where you sent your dispute letter.
Describe the dispute in detail and provide an exact dollar amount of damages you're asking the court to award you.
You may be able to attach documents you intend to introduce as evidence.
Once you've completed your forms and signed them, make at least two copies. One will be for your records and the other will be to send to the merchant.

, Take your completed original forms and your copies to the clerk of the small claims court that you want to hear your case. You must pay a filing fee to the clerk, typically $100 or less for a small claims case.If you can't afford the filing fees, ask the clerk for a waiver application. You must provide details about your income and assets. If these fall below the court's threshold, you typically will be granted a waiver.
Most courts grant fee waivers automatically for people on public assistance.
The clerk will stamp your originals and copies ""filed"" with the date, and give the copies back to you. After asking you a few questions about your claim, the clerk likely will schedule the date of your hearing.

, The judge won't hear your case unless the merchant has received proper legal notice of the lawsuit and has the opportunity to respond and defend themselves in court. You must follow the proper procedure – called ""service"" – to have the documents delivered to the merchant.Technically anyone over the age of 18 who is uninvolved with the case can complete service. However, you might want to use a professional to ensure the process is completed correctly.
Typically you get a sheriff's deputy to hand-deliver the court documents to the merchant's registered agent in your state.
If the merchant doesn't have a registered agent in your state and is located far away, your simplest method may be to mail the papers using certified mail with returned receipt requested. The notice you get that the documents were received will serve as proof, and you'll have to fill out a proof of service document to submit to the court.

, When the merchant is served, they have a limited period of time to respond to your lawsuit or you may be eligible to win by default. In a small claims case, this may mean filing a written response, or showing up for an initial hearing.If a written response is required, the papers delivered to the merchant typically will include an answer form for the merchant to fill out and return to the court. You will receive a copy of the answer as well.
The merchant's response may include various defenses, or a counterclaim against you. These issues will be discussed at your court hearing, so you'll need to look over them and plan your arguments against them.
Keep in mind the merchant likely will have an attorney, so you may want to consult with an attorney at some point before your hearing.
Typically attorneys can't represent people in small claims court, but your state may require corporations to have attorneys, or may allow you to be represented by an attorney if there's one on the other side.
Even if you aren't allowed to have an attorney represent you, there's nothing wrong with talking to someone and getting their opinion on how to proceed with your case.

, Outline your argument before the hearing and make sure you have at least three copies of any documents you plan to introduce as evidence at your hearing. You'll make a better impression on the judge if you are prepared and organized.Go over the outline of your presentation several times. You can practice in front of a mirror or even in front of a friend or family member.
If your dispute centers around the fact that the product you purchased was damaged or defective, you may want to consider bringing it to court with you – as long as it's small enough to carry easily and is not something that would be prohibited in the courthouse.
With an internet transaction, it's unlikely you'll have witnesses, but if you do, you typically are allowed to bring them with you to testify on your behalf.
For example, if you purchased the product as a gift for someone else and it malfunctioned or never arrived, that person may be a witness for you. Similarly, if your spouse was present during the transaction and witness to the problem, he or she might be willing to testify on your behalf.

, Get to the courthouse at least a half hour before your hearing is scheduled so you have time to get through security and find the right courtroom. You also want to leave yourself plenty of time so you aren't rushed.You don't necessarily have to wear a suit to go to court, but you do want to wear clean and neat attire. If you're unsure about your ensemble, select something you would wear on a job interview.
The court likely has a document that lists the items that are not allowed in the courthouse. Check this list and make sure you're not bringing anything with you, such as a pocket knife or a mobile phone, that may be confiscated by security.
When you get to your courtroom, take a seat in the gallery. The judge likely will be hearing several cases that day, so wait until your name and case are called before you move to the tables at the front of the courtroom.

, Since it's your lawsuit, you typically will have the opportunity to speak to the judge first. You must tell him about the dispute, why you think the judge should order the merchant to pay you money, and how much money that should be.Use the outline you've prepared, and speak in a loud, clear voice so the judge can hear and understand you.
Speak directly to the judge – don't address the merchant. If the judge asks you any questions, stop speaking immediately and answer the judge's question. When the judge indicates that he or she is satisfied with your answer, you may pick up where you left off in your outline.
If you have any witnesses, introduce them by their legal name and call them to the stand. They will be sworn in and then you can begin asking them questions. The judge also may have questions for your witnesses, and they will be subject to cross-examination from the merchant.
If the merchant has not appeared at the hearing, you may be eligible to win your case by default. However, you typically still must prove that you're entitled to the amount of damages for which you've asked.

, After you've finished telling the judge about the dispute, the merchant will have the opportunity to explain his or her side of the story, including the discussion of any defenses or counterclaims against you.Keep in mind that the merchant likely will say things you don't agree with – they might even say things you know are not true – but it's important not to interrupt or shout out. Trust that the judge will get to the truth of the matter.
You also should be aware of your body language and facial expressions. These can reveal your attitude and make a bad impression. Focus on maintaining a ""poker face.""
Typically you'll have the opportunity to speak again after the merchant is done, so if they say anything that you want to talk about, write it down so you don't forget.

, After the judge has listened to both you and the merchant, he or she will make a decision as to whether you are entitled to any money as a result of the dispute, and how much your award will be.Typically, a judge makes his ruling from the bench in a small claims case. However, you may have to wait a few days for the written order.
If you win your case, take the written order to the clerk's office when you receive it to find out the process for enforcing the order.
Just because you win doesn't mean you automatically get your money – you're only entitled to collect it. You usually have to wait a period of time – from two weeks to 30 days – after the order is issued before you can enforce it, since the merchant may opt to appeal.
If the judge rules against you, ask the judge or the court clerk what you have to do to appeal the decision.

Argue for punitive damages.",How to Prove Assault," The immediate events that constituted the assault may themselves provide clues to your assailant's intent.


Not only must you prove the assailant intended to harm you, but you also must prove he was capable of doing so.
Contrary to popular belief, a person does not have to physically hurt you or even touch you to be liable for assault. However, if you were not physically harmed, you must demonstrate that the person intended to harm you.An accident won't make a person liable for assault, even if he actually did hurt you – you must be able to prove that he meant to hurt you, regardless of whether he actually did.
Generally threatening words won't necessarily put someone on the hook for assault. Rather, those words must be accompanied by some sort of action that makes it clear he intends to follow through with those words by using physical force against you.Conditional statements or vague threats of retribution at some point in the future typically won't rise to the level of assault either.For example, if someone says to you ""If you come back here again, I'll smash you against the wall!"" that probably wouldn't constitute assault, even if you believe he has every intention of smashing you against the wall. By his own words, the assault would only happen if you returned to the location.
You also must be able to demonstrate that the person had the ability to cause whatever harm he intended.For example, a small child flailing madly while held at arm's length by his older brother may intend to hurt his brother, but as he can't reach him he can't be said to have the ability to cause the harm.;
, Witnesses may be able to expose different angles of the events that further expose your assailant's intent.


Witnesses also may know things that happened either before or after the assault itself that you didn't know about. Statements or actions made by the assailant either in the build-up or the aftermath of the assault may serve to further explain his intent.

, If your assailant has a history of assaulting others, this might be helpful in proving he intended to assault you.


For example, if you knew that Tommy tended to punch first and ask questions later, if Tommy took a swing at you, it stands to reason that he intended to assault you – either he meant to punch you and missed, or he knew his reputation and wanted you to be afraid he would punch you.

, People who know the assailant well can offer additional insights into his behavior both before and during the altercation.


Statements made before the event could offer clues to your assailant's intent, even if you didn't know of them at the time. For example, suppose a mutual friend brought your name up to your assailant a few hours before you crossed paths. Your assailant shook his head and said ""Man, next time I see him, I'm going to rearrange his face!"" Even if he never hurt you, such statements might indicate he intended to do you harm.

, If your assailant is significantly larger than you, that fact can help demonstrate that your fears or expectations of harm were reasonable.

, Show that what your assailant said or how he acted towards you was intimidating or caused you to fear he would harm you.


Keep in mind that you don't have to prove your assailant intended to cause you fear – he only needed to intend to commit the act. Your assailant's motive is irrelevant for the purposes of civil assault, as long as your fear or apprehension was reasonable., If your assailant was in a position of authority over you or otherwise had power over you, that relationship may cause a higher level of intimidation or fear.


For example, if the person you've sued for assault was your coach, he was in a position of authority over you. That position of authority may cause him to be more intimidating to you generally than he would be if you encountered him randomly as a stranger on the street.
Actions from someone with a level of power and authority over other others, such as a coach or a manager, generally will be viewed as more intimidating than if the same action was taken by someone with no relation to the victim.

, If anyone witnessed the altercation and they also worried you would be harmed, their testimony can help prove your fears were reasonable.

, If you actually were harmed and had a doctor treat your injuries, your assailant is responsible for paying those expenses.


Medical bills represent a form of compensatory damages, financial losses you incurred as a result of the assault and for which your assailant is liable.Typically, a civil assault claim would be made separately from a civil battery claim, which involves physical contact and injury.However, in some states the two claims may be heard together, or civil battery may be included in civil assault.

, If you missed work as a result of the assault, you also can include those lost wages as damages you incurred.


Lost wages are another type of compensatory damages., Even if you don't have any actual damages such as medical bills or lost wages, you still can get money for your pain and suffering as a result of the assault.


Even if you can prove no actual damages as a result of the assault, the court may still award nominal damages to acknowledge that your assailant violated your rights.Nominal damages typically are awarded in cases where the judge or jury intends to award punitive damages.Special damages, such as the need for ongoing psychiatric care as a result of the assault, often require an expert witness such as a psychiatrist to testify to your need for that ongoing treatment., Since assault is an intentional tort, you have the right to seek punitive damages against your assailant.Intentional torts arise from an intentional act of the defendant rather than the defendant's negligence. The law treats intentional acts differently than negligence, and allows victims to get punitive damages.
Punitive damages are meant not only to punish your assailant by making him pay for harming you, but also deter others from engaging in similar behavior.
Depending on the severity of the case, the court may award punitive damages in amounts as much as three times what you could be awarded for regular damages.An award of either nominal or compensatory damages is required before you can be awarded punitive damages, since punitive damages are awarded as a multiple of the regular damages awarded."

Locate several personal injury attorneys.,
Make appointments with at least three attorneys.,
Talk with each attorney.",How to Negotiate Personal Injury Lawyer Fees1," If you do not know anybody who can refer you to an attorney they know and trust, you can find attorneys in your area by searching online or checking with your state bar association. Most state bar associations maintain a referral service. If your state allows specialization or certification, you may want to limit your search to those who are certified in personal injury law., You should speak with enough attorneys to make a solid comparison. This would be at least three, potentially more. When making the appointment, make sure the firm offers free consultations., Tell the attorney you are interviewing multiple candidates and give them the facts of your case. Answer any questions they have, and get feedback as to whether they feel you have a strong case. Some questions you will want to ask include:Ask the attorney if s/he will be the attorney you will deal with or if you will be dealing primarily with other office staff, such as paralegals or associates.
Ask whether the firm prefers settlement or court.
Ask what the average settlement or judgment is for the firm.
Ask what the attorney believes you could reasonably expect your case to settle for.
Ask about the fee arrangement.
Ask for references of prior clients.

"
Find out the attorney’s record.,
Check attorney rating sites.,
Talk to references.",How to Negotiate Personal Injury Lawyer Fees2," Go to the courthouse and ask the clerk of the court to show you the dockets for the attorneys you are considering. This will show you how each attorney tends to handle cases and will confirm if the attorney gave you accurate information., Avvo is a site on which people rate attorneys, either as clients or peers. Check the rating for your attorney on Avvo. The attorney should be able to tell you their rating with Martindale-Hubbell. AV is the highest rating with that agency. Unlike Avvo, Martindale-Hubbell ratings are made by other attorneys instead of clients. Also, contact your state bar association to see if the attorney has been subject to discipline., Ask the references if they were happy with the service the attorney provided. Ask if they had any difficulty communicating with the attorney. Ask if there were any surprises in the attorney’s fees at the end of the case.

Rank the attorneys.,
Negotiate the contingent percentage.,
Negotiate costs.",How to Negotiate Personal Injury Lawyer Fees3," Put the attorneys in the order you feel are best to worst. This will be based on your comfort level with each, their track record, and the responses of their references.

, Most private injury cases are taken on a contingent basis. This is a fee arrangement in which the attorney gets paid a percentage of the amount they get you either at settlement or at trial. If you do not get a settlement or win your case, the attorney does not get paid. Contingent fees can vary from 25% to up to 45%. Some states have limits beyond which an attorney cannot ethically charge a higher percentage. Be sure to find out if this percentage is applied to the gross or net amount won. Then net amount is the amount won minus any external costs, such as expert fees and copying charges., Be sure you know who is responsible for costs. In some cases, you can negotiate a lower contingent percentage by agreeing to pay for the costs of the case, such as expert fees and copying charges, or you can negotiate the firm to be responsible for costs by offering a higher contingency percentage. Whatever option you choose, be sure your fee agreement is in writing and that it covers both fees and costs."

If you keep this list on your computer, make sure people can easily access the list if they need to. In most cases, you should periodically print out a copy and keep it in a safe place.;
, Separated from your account inventory, write down all of your login names (a.k.a., usernames) and passwords.These should be separate so you do not have all of your important information in one place.


To be extra secure, keep one list with usernames, a separate list with passwords, and a third list with the website information. This ensures that if anyone gets gets one of the lists, it will be useless without getting access to the other two.

, Once you have your lists created and inventoried, take the information somewhere secure. If you have a safe deposit box, keep your updated information there. If you have an attorney, you may be able to leave your lists with them.

, Before planning for death and drafting a will, contact an attorney to discuss your options. You should hire a trusts and estates lawyer who has handled digital estate questions. Start your search by asking friends and family for recommendations. Most everyone has either thought about getting a will or has already done so, so those close to you should be able to help. If that doesn't work, use your state bar's lawyer referral services. For example, in California, an individual will ask you questions and determine your needs. That person will then refer you to a qualified attorney in your area.Before you hire an attorney, be sure you ask them questions about handling digital property. In addition, be sure you know about the lawyer's fee structure.

, Each online account you have is likely governed by a different policy.In order to use their services, you must agree to their terms-of-service. These agreements dictate how online accounts will be handled at death. For example, some online services will deactivate your account, others will turn your page into a memorial, and others allow you to choose., In addition to every company's terms-of-service, some states have laws dictating how digital property will be handled at death. Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Indiana, Oklahoma, Idaho, and Nevada all have laws about this. Most of these states require ""custodians"" (i.e., online service providers like Facebook or Twitter) to provide access when they receive a written request by the executor of the deceased.


Some states have a broad definition of ""custodian,"" which may include anyone who stores online data of another person, while other states may define it to only include email providers.
No state has decided what should happen when the deceased does not name someone to manage online assets. This is one reason it is so important to do so.
Complications arise when minors create an online presence without understanding what they are agreeing to or if they are old enough to create the account., Within the will you draft, name an executor of your estate. In addition to a general executor, you should also name a digital executor, whose role you can define within the will. Your digital executor should have the technical understanding needed to take care of your digital things., Within your larger will, which will dispose of personal and real property, you need to include a section pertaining to your digital belongings.


Give clear instructions on how you want each account handled.Do you want your Facebook account deleted or memorialized? Do you want your family members to access your emails or do you want the account deleted? Do you want to pass certain music or e-books to people?These questions need to be answered succinctly and clearly in your will.
Your attorney will help you draft your will if you have hired one. If you haven't, you can always draft a will on your own. If you are on your own, make sure you are following all the laws of your state. If you don't, your will may not be valid and your property may pass through intestacy (i.e., passed down according to statutory standards).

, After you draft your will but before you execute and sign it, make sure you do not have any personal and private information included in the will. This includes your online usernames and passwords. Wills become public documents when they go through probate, which is the legal process of executing a valid will.If you put usernames and passwords in your will, that information will be available for public viewing when you pass away. This type of action could jeopardize your final wishes and put your valuable assets at risk.

, Your financial data, including online bank accounts, online payment services, and online investment banking, is some of your most crucial data and also some of the hardest to access. If you can, specify your beneficiaries directly with the website or service.


You should also print out and keep all of your statements for each account. This will create a hard copy that can be accessed without getting into your online account. This will help eliminate the need for an executor to gain access in order to see how much money is in the account or who the beneficiary is., Read each of your email account's terms-of-service. Some email providers consider your account terminated as soon as you die while others will allow some access in certain situations.


Some email providers only allow access after your death if you consented to it before you died. If you think you may find yourself in this scenario, you need to draft a statement consenting to others accessing you accounts. The statement should be attached to your will., Websites like Facebook and Twitter also govern their relationships with you through a terms-of-service agreement. Be sure you read and understand what you are agreeing to. For example:


Twitter will deactivate your account upon the request of your executor or an immediate family member. Twitter requires that your executor or family member send a copy of your death certificate.
Facebook gives you two options. First, you can turn your Facebook page into a memorial. The account will be locked but others can post on it. Second, you can have the account removed upon special request by your family or an executor.
Google allows you to choose how your account is handled at death. If you do not choose how to handle your account, survivors will only be able to access your account in very rare cases., When you download a song or book using an online account (e.g., Amazon or iTunes), you usually do not own that item. Instead you are considered to have purchased a license to use the download during your lifetime. Before you pass down digital property, make sure you own the property by reading through each service's terms-of-service.


If you are part of a photo-sharing website, download the images from the site and save a copy to your hard drive. This will ensure your loved ones can access the photos without having to login to your account."

Wait for the verdict.",How to Win Your Personal Injury Claim," To successfully bring a personal injury lawsuit, you will need to establish that the defendant injured you. Accordingly, you need evidence of what the defendant did and what injury you suffered as a result.


Make sure that you write down exactly what happened before, during, and after the accident.Writing everything down when it is fresh in your mind will ensure that you don’t forget crucial details.
Take all circumstances into account. Write down the time of day that you were injured, the weather at the time you were injured, and who was present when you were injured.
Also note how the person who caused your injury acted afterward. Did he apologize or admit fault? Did that person offer to pay your medical expenses? While not all of these statements may be admitted at trial, they could be used for a settlement negotiation.;
, If you are able to move around after the injury, look for people nearby who may have seen what happened. Additionally, if you were with a friend or family member at the time of your injury, ask them to look for any people who saw the injury. You shouldn’t wait; memories fade quickly.After locating witnesses, ask them if they would be willing to make a brief statement about what they saw.
Write down the statements and contact information for each witness. Get full names, address, and telephone numbers.
If your case does go to trial, witness testimony will be critical to establishing your case. Third party witnesses are often trusted by jurors because they are not invested in the outcome of the case.

, Try to get photos of the area where you were injured as soon as possible. Photos are especially important if the area where you fell is dangerous on its own, for example, a missing railing on a stairway.


You also want to photograph the dangerous condition before the property owner has an opportunity to fix it. If you can’t get out to the scene of the accident, ask a friend or family member to go.
Take photos from a variety of angles. It may be useful to photograph the area as it was when you were injured. For example, if you were injured at night, then take photographs of the scene at night.

, Also take photographs of your body to document the injuries you have suffered. Lawsuits can take months, if not years, to get to trial. By that point, your injury could look much different, or not be physically visible.Your injuries will also appear more dramatic soon after the accident. Photographs of this type can make a strong impression on the jury.

, Even if your injuries aren't severe, you should still see a doctor. Some injuries will not be immediately visible, but your doctor will know what to look for. Your doctor's visit will also create useful medical documentation. In particular, your doctor will help establish “causation”—that the defendant’s actions caused your injury.


When choosing a doctor, you should choose a traditional M.D. and stay away from alternative medical practitioners and chiropractors.
Ask for copies of records, diagnoses, and any reports., One defense to personal injury claims is that the plaintiff aggravated her injury through her own conduct after the accident. Accordingly, you should always follow your doctor’s prescribed treatment. If the doctor orders bedrest, stay in bed.


You can rest assured that the defendant will find out what treatment you were prescribed and will try to find evidence that you have not been following.
A failure to mitigate your damages will not completely bar recovery if the defendant is at fault.However, it can lower the amount of compensatory damages you recover.

, In a notebook, jot down how you are feeling every day. Note your mood, energy level, and ability to sleep. Doctors often will ignore this information, so you will want to create your own record to use as evidence at trial.Also note any changes to your relationship with your spouse, including changes in your sex life. You can be compensated for this “loss of consortium.”, You can find personal injury lawyers near you by looking in your local yellow pages or by running a search of an online phone directory.


You may be able to find personal injury lawyers in your area by using your favorite search engine to search for “personal injury attorneys in ”. If you live in Alabama, for example, you would want to search “personal injury attorneys in Alabama”.
You can also find a local personal injury attorney by visiting your state bar association’s website or calling and asking for a referral.Visit the website for the American Bar Association to find your local or county bar association.

, You should talk to family, friends, and co-workers who have brought their own personal injury lawsuits and question them about their attorney.Ask how easy it was to communicate with the attorney, her courtroom style, and how prepared the attorney was.


Also check online reviews. Many websites offer free reviews of businesses. Some places to look for lawyer reviews include: Find Law, Avvo, and Yahoo Local.
Look at disciplinary records. State bar associations keep public records about complaints and disciplinary actions taken against attorneys licensed to practice in the state.

, If you do not have a website address for any of the attorneys, run a search for their name, phone number, or address in your favorite search engine and see if you can locate one. Then review each attorney’s website. Some things that you want to look for include:


Grammar and spelling. If you see a lot of grammar and spelling errors, maybe that attorney is not for you. An attorney should be able to use proper grammar and a spell check, or ensure that those writing content for his or her website can.
Background information on the attorney. Attorneys who have been working in personal injury law for many years are probably better at it than those who have just started in immigration law. Typically, you should look for a personal injury attorney who has at least three to five years of experience handling personal injury cases.
Identify personal injury specialists. Some states allow attorneys to state an area of specialization and to list any certificates they may have earned in the specialty. This information should be included on an attorney’s webpage.

, Most attorneys offer free consultations. You should bring your medical records and be prepared to talk about both the incident and your injury. The attorney will clarify whether you have a strong case by analyzing the following factors:


Permanence of injury. An injury that is permanent is more impressive to a jury than a temporary one.Your medical history. A pre-existing injury can often reduce the value of a claim, particularly when the injury occurred to the same body part.Your criminal record. A plaintiff with a felony conviction is less sympathetic to juries.The defendant’s assets. If the person who injured you has no money or insurance, then bringing a lawsuit could be fruitless since you can’t recover any money.Whether the injury was intentional. If the defendant intentionally harmed you, then you can seek “punitive damages.” Ordinarily, damages are meant to compensate you for the injury you suffered; but punitive damages are meant to punish the defendant for willful and wanton conduct.

, The vast majority of personal injury attorneys will work on a contingency fee basis. Under this arrangement, the attorney doesn’t get paid unless you win. If you win, the attorney will typically get 30-40% of the jury award.You will still be responsible for costs associated with the litigation. Costs include filing fees, photocopying and mailing, transcription services, and fees for expert witnesses. They can run to several thousand dollars. You should talk with the attorney about how these fees will be billed.

, If for some reason the attorney cannot take your case, then ask if he knows any experienced personal injury attorneys you could meet with.


Some attorneys only represent defendants, or the attorney may have a conflict that prevents her from representing you. Unless the attorney says otherwise, do not assume that you have a weak case simply because the first attorney you meet with declines to represent you.

, You can be compensated for lost work wages as well as for medical care.You should gather evidence that shows how much you were being paid on a job, as well as the total amount of money spent on health care.


If your injury is irreversible, then you can recover for future lost wages as well as for continuing medical care.
You may also recover damages for pain and suffering, as well as loss of consortium and loss of enjoyment.You can also recover for any property damage.If someone struck your car, then you can recover for damage to the car.

, To begin your lawsuit, your attorney will draft a complaint and file it with the court. The complaint lays out the facts as alleged and the legal theories that support the lawsuit.It also states the relief that you are requesting.


In a personal injury suit, your complaint will typically allege that the defendant’s “negligence” caused your injury, meaning that the defendant did not exercise the required reasonable care.
After filing the complaint, your attorney will also serve a copy on the defendant. Be sure to get a copy for you records as well.

, Once a lawsuit has begun, both parties are able to request evidence from each other in a process called “discovery.”Parties request documents in each other’s possession or control. They can also request that the other party answer questions, either orally or in writing.


Your lawyer will probably contact you when she gets the defendant’s discovery requests. If your attorney does not already have copies of medical records and pay stubs, then you may have to turn copies over to the defendant.
Whenever your attorney requests information, always be prompt in reply. Delay only prolongs the lawsuit.

, Each party can request that witnesses answer questions orally during a deposition. Depositions are typically held in a lawyer’s office. The witness is sworn before the questioning and a court reporter is often present to record the testimony. As the plaintiff in the suit, you should expect to be deposed.


You can prepare for your deposition with your lawyer by undergoing a mock deposition. During the deposition prep, your attorney will question you about the incident and your injury. Ideally, she should practice being alternately aggressive in her questioning as well as laid back.During the real deposition, be sure to speak carefully and slowly. If you do not know an answer, then say so. Because statements can be used against you in court, it is important not to guess when answering a question.
Do not engage in unnecessary chit chat with opposing counsel before, during, or after the deposition. Normal pleasantries (“How are you?”) are sufficient., When you claim that you have been injured, the defendant’s insurer can often request that you attend an independent medical exam (IME).


Understand the purpose: the defendant does not want to pay you money for your injury if he can avoid it. By challenging the severity of your injuries, he can reduce the amount of damages or avoid liability altogether. Try to stay positive and don’t take a doctor’s skeptical attitude personally.
Expect questions about your medical history and lifestyle (do you smoke, drink, or do drugs? do you engage in dangerous activities?). Answer all questions truthfully, but don’t volunteer information.Avoid allowing the doctor to take x-rays or administer psychological tests.If the doctor insists, refuse and immediately call your lawyer.
Be sure to ask for a copy of the report., Depending on the facts of your particular case, the defendant may file a “motion for summary judgment” after the close of discovery. In this motion, the defendant will argue that there are no genuine issues of material fact for the jury to decide and that the case can then be decided by the judge on the law only.


As plaintiff, you can also file a motion for summary judgment, but it is rarely granted. If you are suing because the defendant was negligent, then it is almost always a question for the jury whether the defendant exercised reasonable care.
Discuss the possibility of a summary judgment motion with your attorney. Also ask how she plans to defend against one.

, If the defendant loses a summary judgment motion, then he faces more pressure to settle before letting the case go to a trial. The defendant will probably reach out to engage in settlement talks. Even if the defendant doesn’t initiate settlement negotiations, you can always suggest them yourself.


In settlement negotiations, both parties meet with their lawyers present. Your lawyer should have a solid idea of how much your injuries are worth. If he hasn’t already told you, ask him.
Discuss beforehand what your lawyer’s strategy is. As the plaintiff, you will want to aim high and then expect the defendant to counter with a lower amount.The attorneys will talk with each other about the relative strengths or weaknesses of the case as they negotiate.
There are many benefits to settlement. First, you are likely to receive money faster in a settlement than you would by going through a trial. Early settlement also reduces the costs of the litigation. Furthermore, you reduce the risk of losing at trial, in which case you would get nothing.Your attorney cannot accept a settlement offer without your consent. Only you can decide when and if to accept a settlement offer. Also, your attorney must let you know of any settlement offer, whether he agrees with the offer or not.

, Mediation is a dispute resolution technique where the two parties meet with a neutral third party (the mediator) who works to find areas of agreement between the parties. If the process is successful, the two parties will mutually agree to a fair settlement.


In mediation, each party can speak directly to the mediator in the presence of the other party; directly to each other; and directly with the mediator in private. After gathering all of the information, the mediator helps nudge the parties to a settlement they can both agree on.Sometimes having an outsider look at the case allows the parties to see the issues more clearly.
To find a mediator, call your local courthouse or bar association and ask if they have any mediation programs. Mediators usually charge for their services, but any costs are likely to be cheaper than long and drawn-out litigation. The cost of mediation is often split between the two parties., The first thing you will do is select a jury. From a pool of jurors, the judge will call up a panel of about 12. The attorneys will then ask questions of the jurors in a process called “voir dire.” The purpose of voir dire is to uncover which jurors can be impartial and which are biased.


The judge may excuse some jurors on her own initiative, but attorneys can challenge jurors for cause, such as admitted bias.
Attorneys are also given a set of “peremptory” challenges, which allows them to strike jurors without giving a reason.
You may also seek a bench trial. Here, the judge will listen to the evidence and render a verdict. Overwhelmingly, attorneys select a jury trial.However, you should discuss this option with your attorney.

, During the opening statement, each side outlines the proof to be presented to the jury during the trial. Opening statements are not evidence. Instead, they alert the jury to what each side expects the evidence to prove.


Your attorney’s opening statement should briefly and clearly lay a roadmap for what evidence she will present during trial.

, As the plaintiff, you will present witnesses first. As each witness testifies, the side that called the witness asks questions in direct examination. Then the side that did not call the witness has an opportunity to ask questions in cross examination.


Physical evidence, such as documents, weapons, or photographs are admitted into evidence and numbered for identification.
During the trial, if one attorney objects to a question, he presents his objection to the judge. These are questions of legal technicality and may be argued out of the jury’s presence.

, You will likely be called to testify. As with the deposition, your attorney should have helped you prepare by doing a mock examination and cross-examination.


Remember to remain calm on the stand and not be rattled.
Answer questions clearly and look at the jurors. Do not answer with a nod or sounds that aren’t words (like “uh huh.”)Look the part. Dress professionally: wear conservative colors (black or blue) and opt for dress slacks and a freshly-pressed dress shirt or blouse over jeans and a T-shirt. Avoid flashy jewelry., During closing argument, the attorneys summarize the evidence and try to persuade the jury to find in favor of their client. The plaintiff has the burden of proof and therefore has the opportunity to open and close the arguments.


You should expect your attorney to refer often to your injury, so don’t be surprised if jurors suddenly spend a lot of time looking at you during the closing argument. An effective closing argument often appeals to the jurors’ emotions.They may be brought to tears if your attorney does his job right.
Your attorney may want to run his closing argument by you. Feel free to give your honest input.

, After closing arguments, the judge will read the instructions of law to the jury, which define the issues and informs the jurors of the law that governs the case. The jury then retires to deliberate.


Juries typically do not have to reach unanimous verdicts in civil lawsuits like personal injury cases, at least in state court.Many states now allow a plaintiff to recover if a super-majority of jurors decide for her, typically between two-thirds and five-sixths of jurors.For a civil jury with 12 jurors, you may only need between 8-10 jurors to agree with you.

The ULS allows you to manage your licenses and monitor your application's status.Some types of applications must be filed electronically, while for others you may mail in a paper application if you wish. If the FCC requires the application for the type of license you need to be filed electronically, you have no choice but to register with ULS.
Businesses also must register with the FCC's Commission Registration System (CORES). This registration generates an FCC Registration Number (FRN) for you to use on any applications you file with the FCC.
Your FRN also gives you access to the FCC's online license manager, which allows you to easily monitor expiration dates and file renewals or additional applications from one place.;
, The FCC has a different application for each type of license issued by the agency. Each type of license also may have a separate application depending on whether you are seeking commercial or noncommercial use.The FCC website can be a bit difficult to navigate, so it may take some time and patience to find the exact application you need. Try skimming the list of FCC databases and click on one that relates to your desired use to browse the documents available.
For example, if you're interested in getting a license for broadcast radio and television, you can click ""Broadcast Radio and Television Electronic Filing System (CDBS)"" to access that database and gain more information about the application process.
If you want an amateur radio application, such as to operate a ham radio, you need FCC Form 605, which is an application for authorization of all ship, aircraft, and amateur radio operators, as well as general mobile radio services.

, All application forms are available for download in PDF format on the FCC's website. Some of these forms are fillable, which allows you to type your answers directly into the application form and save your progress as you go.The FCC has a number of guides available if you're unsure from the document descriptions which applications you need to file. The FCC also recommends that you read the federal regulations that correspond to your application. The specific sections of the regulations for which you will be responsible are listed in the instructions for your application.
You also can get help by calling 1-888-CALL-FCC.
Some forms may be printed out, while others must be filed electronically. Even if you're completing and filing your forms electronically, you may want to print off a copy to reference while you read the regulations.

, Once you have the application you need, look it over so you can gather the information required before you start filling it out.Each form includes instructions on completing and filing the form. Make sure you read them thoroughly and understand the information you'll have to enter before you start filling out the form.
For forms that aren't fillable on the computer, you must print out the document and complete it by hand. Print using blue or black ink.
Some forms require documents to be filed as exhibits along with your application. Identify these documents with page and exhibit numbers, and indicate the number of pages and letter or number of the corresponding exhibit on your application.
The instructions include various codes and abbreviations that must be used for specific sections. Make sure you read and understand these so you can use the appropriate code.
Take care when entering your name, address, and telephone numbers. Once your license is granted, the FCC will use this information for all correspondence with you concerning your license, so it's important to make sure they're accurate.

, To apply for any type of license from the FCC, you must pay licensing, processing, and regulatory fees unless you are exempt. Some nonprofit entities are eligible for a fee exemption, as well as government entities.If you think you might be eligible for an exemption, you should call the FCC at 877-480-3201 or consult the most recent Fee Filing Guide, available on the FCC's website.
Form 159 must accompany any payment to the FCC, and ensures your payment will be appropriately credited to your account.
Fees for many licenses are $65 per call sign, although some licenses may be several hundred dollars. There is no application fee for an amateur radio license, including a request for an amateur station vanity call sign.
If you're registered with the ULS, your fees will be calculated for you automatically.

, To be granted most FCC licenses, particularly operator licenses, you must take a number of written tests that evaluate your knowledge and understanding of the operation of the technology you want a license to use as well as applicable FCC regulations.Tests typically are divided into a number of elements. Which elements you take and pass determines which class of license you will hold.
The exam page on the FCC website provides the required score to pass each element, as well as which elements correspond to each license class.
Most new operators start at the lowest class, and then move up as they gain greater knowledge and information through hands-on learning.

, Volunteer examiners administer tests from common question pools maintained for each exam element. These questions are available through several non-government publications and companies.Some companies also have audio and video lessons available, as well as live or online courses you can take to learn the material covered in the exam.
Keep in mind prep companies will charge fees for their courses, ranging from just under $100 to several hundred dollars. Balance that cost against the potential cost of having to take the exams more than once.
The FCC doesn't license or recommend any specific prep courses, so you'll have to research on your own to find one that works for you. Start by conducting an online search for ""FCC exam prep"" and see where it takes you.
You also might want to ask for recommendations from friends or colleagues you know who recently have obtained the same license for which you are applying.
If cost is an issue, consider looking for companies that give refunds for the money you spent on prep courses if your exam results are failing or below a certain percentile.

, When you're ready to take your exam, contact the Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC) in the region that corresponds to your state or geographic area of residence. They will help you file your application and schedule your exam.The FCC has 14 regions that cover one or more states or geographic areas. Some VECs coordinate sessions in more than one region.
For example, if you live in South Carolina, you are in FCC Region 4, which covers Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Although there is not a VEC in South Carolina, there are two in North Carolina from which you can choose.
You also may have the option of using a nationwide examiner group, such as the International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians, which provides testing of certain types of licenses and license classes online.

, To request a written examination, you must submit your completed application form to your team of volunteer examiners. When you've completed your exam, your application will be submitted to the FCC electronically along with your examination scores.Typically you also must include any fees for the exam and a copy of your government-issued photo identification.
Expect the fees charged by your examiners to be anywhere from $35 to $70 or more in some cases.
The examiners with whom you register to take the test will let you know exactly what documents and information are required before you are scheduled to take the test.
If you plan to take the test in person, make sure you note the date, time, and location when the exam will be held and make arrangements to be there.

, You must score the minimum score required by the FCC to pass your exam. Until you pass the required exams, you are ineligible for a license. Although the FCC won't issue a refund of any fees you've paid for your exam since these are intended to reimburse the volunteer examiners for their out-of-pocket expenses, you can retake it as many times as necessary.Some exams must be completed on paper in person, while others allow you to take an online test. An online test can save you time and money.
However, if you use an online test, make sure the exam provider is authorized by the FCC and will submit your completed application.
You should receive your exam results within a few days after you take the test. In some cases, if you complete your test online you can get your results immediately.
If you passed some, but not all, of the necessary written elements to qualify for a particular class, you may be able to operate under a lower class until you pass the required elements for the higher class.
Before you schedule another examination, study the elements you failed the first time around until you're confident you know them as well as the elements you did pass.
If you didn't take a study course initially, you may want to consider one to help you brush up on the areas where you didn't do as well.

, Provided you've paid all necessary fees and passed the required exams, the FCC will mail your license to you using the name and mailing address you provided on your application form.Assuming you registered with the FCC's online licensing system, you can check your application status online.
If you filed paper forms manually, you can call 1-877-480-3201 to check your application's status. Make sure you have the appropriate identification information ready.
Once your application is received, expect to wait at least two or three weeks before you find out whether it has been approved.
FCC licenses are good for a number of years before they must be renewed. The number of years varies based on the type of license. For example, ham radio or amateur radio licenses are good for 10 years.
If the FCC dismisses your application, you can have your application fees refunded by sending a request in writing to Federal Communications Commission, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, PA 17325-7245. Include your FRN, application file number, and all other information related to the payment.

, You cannot renew your license after the expiration date, or more than 90 days before the expiration date, so make sure you have this date correct.Since your license is good for 10 years, don't trust yourself to remember the date.
Keep in mind that if you miss your license's expiration date and have to file a new application, you will not be able to continue operations under the old license while you're waiting for the new application to be approved.
If you used a particular entity or association to take your exams and file your initial license, you may get a reminder from them when it's time to renew. However, you're not obligated to use that service to renew your license.

, The renewal application typically is the same form you filled out to apply for the initial license, except that you'll code it ""RO"" for ""Renewal Only"" if you're applying to renew the same license under the same conditions.Renewals through which you are requesting changes to your existing authorization must be categorized under the renewal/modification purpose.
If you need to modify your existing application, or want to be licensed at a different operator class, the procedure is similar to how you initially applied in that you may need to take additional exams and have your application filed by your volunteer examiners.
If you are filing online, your form will include all the information you entered on your initial application. Review it for accuracy and update it as necessary before you file your application.

, If you're filing for a renewal under the same conditions, you may be able to submit your renewal application online through the FCC's license management system. However, if you're taking an exam to modify your license or operate under a higher class, your examiner will have to file it for you after you've taken your exam.You also may mail paper renewal forms to FCC, 1270 Fairfield Road, Gettysburg, PA 17325-7245. Make sure you've included the applicable fees.
There is no fee for renewing an amateur radio license grant.

, Once you've filed your renewal application, you can check its status online at the FCC website just as you did for your original application. Keep in mind that if you mailed your application it may be a week to 10 days before it's received.Expect to receive your renewal license within two to three weeks of the date it's received. To be safe, you want to try to file it within 30 to 60 days before your original license is set to expire.
Keep in mind that you cannot continue operating if your old license expires while your renewal application is still pending.

Check if your state law allows this claim.,
Identify the private fact disclosed.,
Make sure that the fact is “offensive.” To bring a successful legal claim, the private fact also must be sufficiently sensitive that a “reasonable person” would be offended at having the information publicly disclosed.For example, sexually charged facts are often deemed offensive.There is no easy way to find out if a private fact is sufficiently offensive under your state law.,

In New York, for example, you cannot bring this claim.You should research your state law. You can visit your local law library, which is probably at your courthouse. Tell the librarian that you want to read the law on public disclosure of private facts. There should be a statute on the books.
You could also meet with a lawyer for a consultation. Many lawyers now offer free consultations. To find an experienced attorney, you can visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.
Summaries of some laws are also available at the Digital Media Law Project website.;
, Your privacy has not been invaded if the fact disclosed was generally made available.In other words, if you publish something to a Facebook or Instagram page, then it is not private.


Common examples of private facts include medical information, sexual orientation, and financial difficulties., Instead, you should meet with a lawyer to discuss the law in your state. Your lawyer will research the case law to see if courts have allowed people to recover for publication of facts similar to yours.

, You will need to prove that the private fact was disclosed publicly. This means that the defendant released the information to the general public or told enough people that he or she reasonably could anticipate that it would be made public.Private facts can be publicly disclosed in a variety of ways:


On a blog. Print off pages of the blog and keep them as evidence.
Spoken publicly to people. Get names and witness statements of people who heard the disclosure.
Published on a website. Print off pages from the website and note the dates on which it appears.
Sent by email to several people. There is no magic number the email must be sent to, but make sure it is more than one person. Save the email or otherwise print off a hard copy for your records.

, You also need to calculate how much you have been injured by the disclosure of private facts. You are entitled to compensatory damages for the harm caused you. Plaintiffs who bring lawsuits for public disclosure of private facts can recover for the following:Emotion and mental stress. You can recover for the stress and humiliation of having private facts divulged. There is no standard way of deciding how to value your mental health. Nevertheless, many states have now capped non-economic damages.These caps can range from $350,000 to $750,000.Economic compensation for any harm you suffered as a result. For example, if you lost contracts with clients because of the disclosure, then you can sue for the value of the lost contract.
Profits unlawfully earned by the defendant. If the defendant made money by publishing your private facts, then you can seek to disgorge him or her of the profits. For example, if someone published a magazine article about you, then you could recover the amount the writer was paid.
Punitive damages. Some states allow you to punish a defendant. Punitive damages go above and beyond what is needed to make you whole. For example, a California court awarded a plaintiff $525,000 in punitive damages because a newspaper revealed that she was a transsexual. This punitive damages award was double the amount of compensatory damages she was awarded., Depending on the amount of your claim, you can file in small claims court or in regular civil court. Small claims courts have limits on the amount you can sue for. These amounts vary by court, but typically run between $5,000 and $15,000. You should check with the court clerk.


There are many advantages to bringing your lawsuit in small claims court. Generally, you can represent yourself and do not need a lawyer. Indeed, in some states, you can’t even have a lawyer represent you in small claims court.As a result, suing is more affordable.
Also, small claims cases can be resolved faster. There is not a long, drawn-out fact-finding phase called “discovery.”

, Regardless of which court you bring your claim in, you need to start the lawsuit by filing a complaint. A complaint alleges the factual circumstances of the dispute and the legal theories supporting your case.


Your court will probably have a form complaint that you can fill out.You should ask the court clerk.

, Once you have completed your complaint, you need to file it with the court clerk. Make several copies. One will be for the defendant and one will be for your records. Have the court clerk stamp all copies with the date.


You will probably need to pay a filing fee, which will vary by court. Be sure to ask the court clerk when you pick up your form complaint.
If you cannot afford the fee, then ask the court clerk for a fee waiver form and fill it out.

, After you file your lawsuit, you need to serve notice on the defendant. You will send him or her a copy of the complaint and a summons, which you can get from the court clerk. The summons will command the defendant to respond to your lawsuit. It will also provide the deadline.


Generally, you can make service in a variety of ways. For example, you can have someone 18 or older who is not a party to the lawsuit serve notice on the defendant.
You can also hire a professional process server or pay the sheriff to make service. This option usually costs between $45 and $75 per service. You can find private process servers in the phone book or on the Internet.
You also might be able to have the clerk mail notice to the defendant.Ask the court clerk for specific methods that are acceptable.

, The defendant should respond to your complaint by filing an answer with the court. In the answer, the defendant responds to each allegation. He or she can admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny. You should be served a copy of the defendant’s answer. Once you receive it, read it thoroughly.


The answer should also contain the defendant’s affirmative defenses. In a lawsuit for public disclosure of private facts, the defendant can argue that the information is of legitimate concern to the public, i.e., it is “newsworthy.”

In some states, newsworthiness is a defense that the defendant can raise affirmatively in his answer. In other states, you will actually have to allege that the private fact was not of legitimate concern to the public in your complaint. Check your state law to see if you must allege it in your complaint.


Realize that truth is not a defense to this legal claim.Public disclosure of private facts differs from defamation. With defamation, truth is a complete defense.

, This area of law is very vague. Many parts of the law turn on what a “reasonable” person would think. Accordingly, you might need a lawyer’s expert opinion on whether you have a legitimate legal claim. You can set up a consultation with an attorney to discuss the facts of your case. Even if you don't retain the lawyer, a short consultation could be beneficial. You can ask the lawyer for advice on how to proceed with the case.


You might be worried about costs. However, you should realize that in many states you can hire a lawyer to coach you or to look over your complaint to make sure that it is sufficient. This is called “limited scope representation.”To see if a lawyer offers this service, you should call and ask when you set up your consultation.

, Some courts have self-help service centers. The staff at these centers can answer your questions and look over your paperwork to make sure that you have filled it out correctly.


To check whether your court has a self-help center, you should call the courthouse and ask.

, If you are low-income, then you might qualify for legal aid. Legal aid organizations provide free legal help to people who are economically disadvantaged. To find a legal aid organization near you, you can call your state’s bar association. They should have referral information for legal aid organizations.


You can also check the Legal Services Corporation's website at www.lsc.gov. Click on ""Find Legal Aid"" in the upper right-hand corner and then enter your address.
You can call any legal aid organizations in your area and ask if you can meet for a consultation.

However, you can set up a Google Alert using Gmail. After you set up an alert, Google will send to your email inbox any statement referring to you that has been published on the web. You will need a Gmail account to set up alerts.


Visit the Google Alerts website at https://www.google.com/alerts.
In the box labeled “Create an alert about…” you should type in the name of your business. Then click on the “Create Alert” button.;
, Not all negative information is defamation. Before you do anything else, you should analyze the statements. To qualify as defamation, the statement must meet the following requirements:The statement explicitly identified you, or a reasonable person would understand the statement is about your business.
The statement must be false. Defamation doesn’t exist if the statement is true. Remember that an opinion is not false because it is negative.
The statement isn’t an opinion. Opinions are protected, even if very negative, provided they are based on facts that were true at the time the opinion was made.Statements like “They serve the worst clam sauce I’ve ever eaten!” are protected, provided the person did eat clam sauce.
The statement must be published to at least one other person. Given that it is on the Internet, this element is satisfied.
The statement can’t be privileged. Each state has many privileges for communicating statements that may be defamatory. For example, in many states any statement about a public proceeding is privileged. If your business is dragged in front of a state legislative committee and someone makes defamatory statements about you, you can’t sue for them.
If you are considered a public figure, you might have to prove malice, which is a higher burden than just proving negligence., You can help yourself by showing how the statement is false. For example, if someone is claiming they received poor service from you on June 1, 2016, you should check to see if the person visited your business that day.


If someone claims they were overcharged, then find their bill. Check to make sure all charges are accurate.
One way you can differentiate opinion from fact is by seeing whether you can disprove the statement. It’s virtually impossible to disprove an opinion.

, Generally, you must show that a defamatory statement injured you in some way.As a business, the most obvious injury would be financial—reduced sales or lost future business opportunities. You should compile financial records to show a drop-off in income.

, A claim for defamation will not be successful if the defendant has a legal defense. If the defendant has a defense to your claim, they will bring it up in their answer to your lawsuit. If successfully argued, a defense will defeat your claim and the litigation will end. Common defenses to defamation include:Truth (i.e., the statement made was not false at all), which is an absolute defense to defamation.
Statements of opinion. However, the definition of opinion is always up for debate and different courts may look at the issue different ways.
Retraction of the defamatory statement. If the defendant retracts the statement that led to the dispute, the dispute will usually end.

, As soon as you find defamatory statements, you should schedule a consultation with a lawyer to discuss your next steps.Defamation law is complicated, and each state’s laws may be a little different. Only a qualified lawyer can properly advise you.


You can get a referral to a business lawyer by asking another business or by contacting your local or state bar association.Also think about hiring a lawyer “on retainer.” This means that you pay the lawyer a small fee every month and they are available to answer your questions as they arise.As a business owner, you must constantly be on guard against attacks to your reputation, so this is probably not the last time you will need legal advice.
If you want to sue for defamation, then you can discuss how much it would cost with the lawyer.

, One option is to respond to the comment. If someone complains on Yelp about poor service, for example, you can respond to the comment by providing more context. For example, someone might complain about the food at your restaurant. If you fired the chef, then you could provide that information.


Make sure you don’t have a stock response. Instead, make each response original and specific to the complaint.Be careful about responding if you are a lawyer, medical provider, or other professional. Ethical rules and many laws prohibit you from releasing confidential information. You don’t want to accidentally reveal confidential information.
You can also respond by asking the complainer to contact you directly offline.When they call, you can work out your problem by, for example, offering a refund.

, You might also ask the website owner to remove the defamatory material. Send a formal business letter identifying the statement and include a polite request to remove it.


Realize, however, that the website owner doesn’t have to remove it in the United States. Furthermore, they are protected by federal U.S. law from being sued by you for defamation if they choose not to remove it., In some situations, you might want to send a letter directly to the commentator. You can have your lawyer draft the letter and mail it to the offender, or you can send it as an email. A solid letter or email would contain the following information:Identify the defamatory statements. Also provide the URLs where the statements appear.
Request that the commentator retract the defamatory statements or unpublish them.
Explain why the statements are false.
Tell them that the false statements will hurt you financially if they remain online.

, Over 90% of bloggers will remove information if asked.However, the commentator might ignore you and leave the defamatory statements online. In this case, you might want to write a full blown “cease and desist” letter.


This letter will be like the original email or letter that you sent. However, you will include a deadline for removing the information and an explicit threat that you will sue for defamation if they don’t remove it.

, A reputation management service will try to minimize any defamation that your business faces. For a fee, they will do the following:Threaten the publishers of defamation with legal action. If successful, the publisher will remove the information.
Publish good information about you using Search Engine Optimization. Essentially, they will try to overwhelm the defamation with positive stories about you and your business. Accordingly, negative information won’t show up on the early pages of search results. Because more than 90% of users only look at the first page of search results, using SEO can help you bury negative information., You can search for reputation management services online. However, there are so many different companies you will need to follow some sort of process to find a good service. Try the following:


Ask other businesses or individuals who have used a reputation management service if they could recommend someone. A personal referral from someone you trust is often the best approach.
Check different websites. You can get a feel for the business only by visiting the website.
Look at online reviews for the product.
Compare prices. These businesses provide a mix of services at different price points. You should get quotes from several.

, You can also try to fill up the first page of your search results with positive content. For example, you might want to create the following on your own instead of hiring a reputation management company:an affiliated blog
articles which you publish online
personal profiles using Facebook and LinkedIn

, You can try to get positive online reviews by sending out an email 24 hours after seeing the client. Ask them to provide feedback about their experience. You can provide a link to a neutral review platform, such as Yelp or Google+.Your email message can be simple: “Thank you for your visit. Please help us continue our high quality service by clicking here to provide feedback.” Include a link to a review platform.
If a client had a negative experience at your business, you can train staff not to send them this email.

, You can often prevent disgruntled customers from posting negative online content by creating customer-friendly policies. You should train your staff on how to handle angry customers. You should also consider the following:Give front-line staff the power to immediately resolve customer complaints. Obviously, they can’t resolve everything. But you might want to give them the power to refund 10% of the price, for example.
Implement social media policies which prohibit staff from responding to online posts about the company. You don’t want to escalate the tension into a flame war online.

, Before filing a defamation lawsuit, you need to talk to your lawyer about the risks. Generally speaking, defamation lawsuits are incredibly difficult to win. First, damages can be hard to prove (e.g., it is difficult to monetize what happened to you as a result of the defamation). Second, if you file a suit seen as attempting to chill free speech, you might be susceptible to an anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation) motion and SLAPP-back suit. These suits allow defendants to get your initial lawsuit dismissed while at the same time recovering damages from you.


Even if you have a valid case, online cases can make it difficult to identify who the author if the defamatory statements were.
Finally, if you win your case, you still might damage your reputation with clients and customers.

, Suing someone for online defamation is particularly challenging because people can often remain anonymous when they post. However, you can still bring a lawsuit. If you can’t identify the poster by name, then you can originally sue “John Does” as defendants and then try to find out the commentator’s real identity.


In the U.S., Internet Service Providers and website owners are generally shielded from liability for the defamatory comments posted by their users.However, outside the United States, you might be able to sue the ISP or the website operator that published the defamatory comment., You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” in court. In this document, you provide the judge with enough information to show that you have a valid legal claim. Your lawyer can draft the complaint for you, which should contain the following:


your identity as the “plaintiff”
who you are suing (if you only have online pseudonyms, then you can sue “John Doe”)
the court’s power to hear the case
the surrounding factual allegations
the defamatory statements, reprinted word for word
your cause of action (e.g., defamation)
what you want the judge to give you (usually money damages)

, Once your complaint has been drafted, you will need to file it with the correct court. Your lawyer will make this determination and it will depend, among other things, whether you decided to file in state or federal court. When you file your lawsuit, you will also have to pay a filing fee. The fees will vary depending on the court you are filing in. The fees usually range from $200 to $400.


Once you file your complaint with the clerk of court, you will receive stamped copies of the complaint along with a signed summons. The summons is a piece of paper meant to inform the defendant of the lawsuit and how they need to respond., The defendant will need to be notified that they are being sued. If you do not currently know the identity of the defendant, you will usually complete service by publishing a legal notice in various places. Serving unknown defendants is a complex procedure, so make sure your lawyer is comfortable with them.


If you know the identity of the defendant, you can serve them by having someone over 18 who is unrelated to the case give them a copy of your complaint and summons. You can also pay the sheriff’s office (in state court) or the U.S. Marshals (in federal court)., After filing your lawsuit, you can serve the webmaster or Internet Service Provider with a subpoena, which is a court order to turn over the identity of the poster.In order to uphold a subpoena, a court will generally require that you show the following:You have a valid defamation claim. This shouldn’t be difficult to prove, since you shouldn’t sue unless you have a valid claim.
You have tried to contact the poster. For example, you have posted requests for identification on the website where the defamatory comments appear.

, If you use a subpoena to identify the real name of the poster, then you can amend your complaint and substitute in the new defendant once you find out their real identity.After amending the complaint, you can serve the defendant with a copy. They then have a limited amount of time to respond to your complaint.

, As part of the defendant's initial response to your lawsuit, or soon after, they will usually file a motion to dismiss, which attempts to throw out your lawsuit. The reasons for filing this motion will vary but it is usually because of some procedural defect (e.g., failure to state a claim or lack of jurisdiction). You can respond to these motions by filing a motion of your own. To win, you will have to persuade the judge that the defendant's reasoning is flawed and that your lawsuit should continue.


Unique to lawsuits touching on free speech, including defamation suits, you may also have to fight an anti-SLAPP motion. An anti-SLAPP motion asks the court to strike a complaint that chills valid free speech. You will have to defend against the motion by filing a response that proves you are filing your suit for valid reasons. If you lose, you will have to pay for the defendant's legal fees to cover the filing of the anti-SLAPP motion.
If you lose the anti-SLAPP motion and your defamation case is dismissed, the defendant may also choose to file a SLAPPback action, which is a new lawsuit filed to recover damages against you. You might also have to defend against this., One of the first pretrial stages of litigation is discovery, which is when you and the defendant will exchange information in order to prepare for trial. During discovery you will collect facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other side is going to say at trial, and see how good your case is. In order to achieve these things, you will use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal, in person interviews with parties and witnesses. The interviews are conducted under oath and the answers given can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are written questions sent to witnesses and parties. The recipient must answer the questions under oath and the answers can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are formal requests for documents relevant to the case. Examples of documents might include internal memos, phone records, emails, and text messages.
Requests for admissions, which are written statements posed to the defendant. The defendant must admit or deny each one. These requests help narrow the focus of the litigation.

, As soon as discovery concludes, most defendants will try to end the litigation immediately and have the judge rule in their favor. To do this, the defendant will file a motion for summary judgment, which tries to convince the judge that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant needs to persuade the judge that, even if every factual assumption were made in your favor, you would still lose the case.


You can defend against this motion by filing a responsive motion of your own. Within the response you will provide evidence and affidavits showing the judge that factual disputes do exist, and that they need to be resolved at trial., Lawsuits are typically long and expensive. You can shorten the length of the lawsuit by reaching a settlement with the defendant. Settlement can happen at any time—before you sue or even after a jury verdict has been reached. Talk about the value of settlement with your lawyer. Consider the following:


What you want from the defendant. If the defendant did not cause you serious financial damage, then you might be happy with a retraction or removal of the negative information online. But if someone has caused serious monetary loss, then you will probably want some form of compensation.
The minimum you are willing to accept. Settlement negotiations are voluntary, and at some point you might need to walk away if the defendant cannot meet your demands. Come up with the absolute minimum you are willing to settle for. This is your “walkaway” point.Identify what you can offer the defendant in return. You can sweeten the deal if you are willing to give something up. For example, the person defaming you might be a former employee. You could agree not to give a negative reference if contacted by a future employer. If the defamer is a customer, you could offer store credit.

, Not all lawsuits can be settled. If not, then you will need to continue on with your defamation case. Stay in close contact with your lawyer and discuss upcoming events, such as hearings. If your lawyer needs information from you, then provide it as soon as possible.


See Prove Libel for more information.

, If your case makes it all the way to trial, you and your lawyer will be responsible for presenting evidence in front of a judge and possibly a jury. Your job will be to convince the court that the facts support a finding that every element of medical malpractice is met. Your lawyer will do this by presenting witness testimony and physical evidence. Once you have presented your case, the defendant will have a chance to present theirs.


At the end of the trial, the judge or jury will deliberate until a decision regarding your case has been made. If you win, you will be awarded damages. If you lose, you might be able to appeal the decision by the trial court. This is usually only possible when some legal error has been made that affected the outcome of the case. If you think an appeal might be appropriate, talk to your lawyer as soon as possible. Notices of appeal must usually be filed soon after a decision at the trial level has been made.

File your lawsuit before the statute of limitations has passed.",How to Win a Defamation Lawsuit," Opinions or jokes, no matter how rude or insulting, do not qualify as defamatory.For example, if someone says that they think you're unprofessional and have a bad attitude, that statement can't serve as the basis of a defamation claim, because it's just their opinion – not a statement of demonstrable fact.
On the other hand, if someone said you were absent from work three days out of every five, when in fact you had perfect attendance, that statement might support a defamation claim. A statement about your attendance rate is a statement of fact, even if in this case it also happened to be a false statement.;
, Not only must the statement have been factual rather than a matter of opinion, it must have been false. Relating a true story cannot be defamatory, no matter how embarrassing it may be for you.


You must be able to prove that the statement of fact is false. To use the previous example, suppose the person made a negative statement about your attendance record at work. If you in fact had perfect attendance, you would likely be able to prove the statement of fact was false. You would simply collect your personnel file from your employer's human resources department.

, This means that at least one person other than yourself must have heard or seen the statement. In other words, if someone posts something on a social media account that includes a false statement of fact about you, that post qualifies as being published if that person's account is publicly accessible or has even one follower (other than yourself).
Particularly if the statement was published online, you need a record of it in case the person who published it deletes it later or moves it to a different location.
Identify your own account, and describe how you first learned of the statement or when you first saw it or read it. If someone else informed you of the statement, include their name, their contact information, and what they said to you about the statement. A defamatory statement can be spoken, written, or even gestured. However, since statements in print tend to last longer, judges and juries may consider them more harmful than something merely spoken. Having the statement recorded in print means it can harm you repeatedly, while something spoken only once would lose its power over time.
Statements that exist in print may be easier to document than something that was spoken. If only a few people heard the verbal statement, it may be very difficult to prove it occurred, especially if the person denies having said it.

, If the statement was spoken rather than printed, witnesses may be your best proof that the statement was made.


Try to interview witnesses as soon as possible after they hear or read the statement while it's still fresh in their minds. If they later hear or see any additional information related to the statement and its effect on you, they can update their own statements to include that new information. If the defamatory statement took place in a private conversation, it can be more difficult to prove it took place and that harm to you occurred as a result. , If the statement was made online, document any further comments or replies to the post after it initially appeared.


If the defendant replies to a published comment, s/he may exacerbate the initial defamation.

, The more people who had access to the statement, the greater the possible damage to you, depending on your reputation with those people.


For example, if you are a teacher, and the defamatory statement was made on your school's Facebook page, you would want to enumerate the people who follow that page and classify them as parents, teachers, alumni, students, or other community members.
Generally, if a statement was made publicly, and a large number of people saw it or heard it, it will be easier for you to prove that you suffered harm as a result of the statement. On the other hand, if the person made the statement to just one or two people, proving you suffered harm may turn on who those people are and the power they hold over you. The person may have made the defamatory statement to just one individual. In this case defamation is harder to prove. If, however, the individual happened to be your boss, and your boss fired you as a result of the statement, you might have a case for defamation.

, In some jurisdictions a statement is presumed to have caused harm if it was made knowingly or recklessly. This means that the person was aware that his/her statement could cause you harm.


In other jurisdictions, you must show that the person knew the statement was false – or at least neglected to evaluate the truth of the statement. In this situation, if the person had a good-faith belief that the statement was true, s/he would not be held liable for defamation. Whether good faith negates a speaker's liability also depends on the context of the statement and the role of the speaker. If you have any questions about whether the person who defamed you is protected by their good-faith belief in the statement's truth, consider speaking with an attorney. A personal injury attorney experienced in defamation cases will be able to explain any viable defenses the person might have against your claim. , Friends, neighbors, or co-workers can provide a good description of the harm you suffered as a result of the defamation.


Witnesses to your harm need not have seen or heard the statement itself. For example, a co-worker might testify that you left work early after learning about the statement and subsequently missed several days of work. , If you are alleging that you suffered psychological damages as a result of the defamatory statement, a psychiatrist or other psychological professional can provide the best evidence of your harm.

, Witnesses as well as events can demonstrate such harm.


In the U.S., some states consider certain statements to be defamatory ""per se,"" in that they are so awful, they are automatically presumed to have caused harm. For example, if someone stated falsely that you had been convicted of rape, that statement would be considered per se defamation in many states. If the statement is per se defamation, you won't necessarily have to prove any particular damages.
In most defamation cases, the primary harm will be to your reputation. For example, if you are a salesman, and someone makes the statement that you cheated your customers, that would potentially damage your reputation as a salesman and cause you to lose customers.

, If you lost business or suffered other monetary damages as a result of the defamatory statement, calculate the amount of the losses from copies of bills or other financial statements. For example, if you have a letter from a client indicating that they were going to renew their contract with you until they heard the defamatory statement, that letter might serve as evidence of monetary losses you suffered as a result of the defamation.

, Defamation is a tort, a part of personal-injury law, and a personal injury attorney with experience in defamation claims can help you understand the law and navigate the court system. You may be able to search the website of your state or county bar association to find an attorney experienced in defamation law. You can also refer to directories published by the American Bar Association or other attorney groups.
When considering an attorney, find out how many defamation lawsuits s/he has filed and the outcomes of those suits. Be aware that most civil lawsuits (including defamation cases) reach settlement before trial. Learn what other kinds of cases the attorney typically takes and how many cases s/he works on at any given time. You want to have a good idea of how much time s/he intends to spend on your case, and whether s/he will be handling it personally or delegating the work to assistants or other staff.
Before you hire an attorney, get a payment plan or fee schedule in writing, especially if the attorney is asking for an initial deposit. S/he should be able to give you a detailed accounting of all fees and costs associated with your case.
Clearly understand the attorney's goals and strategies for your case. Don't hire an attorney if your goals don't match his/hers, or if you're not comfortable with the way s/he intends to handle your case.
For example, if you want to maintain an amicable relationship with the person who defamed you, perhaps because you still have to work with him or her, don't hire an attorney who will be contentious, confrontational, or overly aggressive.

, Each state recognizes certain contexts in which statements are privileged, thus protecting the speaker/writer from liability for defamation.


If the statement was privileged, you might not be able to sue for defamation, even if the statement meets all other requirements. In certain circumstances, the law grants privilege to a wide range of statements. In such situations honesty and openness are deemed more important than the possibility of defamation.
A common example of a privileged statement would be one made while under oath as a witness in court or in a deposition. Although a witness may be guilty of perjury for making a false statement under oath, s/he would not be liable for defamation in that case, because such a statement is considered privileged. Privileged circumstances vary among states. For example, many states recognize a qualified form of privilege for individuals acting as employment references while giving information to prospective employers. , To win a defamation case you must bring suit in the court that has power over the subject matter of your suit and the person you are suing.


This usually means that you must sue in a court located in the city or county resided in by the person you're suing. If s/he does not live in your state, you may choose to file in a federal court. The court must have the power to hear your suit, an authority referred to as ""subject matter jurisdiction."" Jurisdiction also depends on the amount of money in contention. For example, small-claims courts deal only with cases where a small amount of money is at stake, typically less than $5,000. , Each state defamation law recognizes a statute of limitations, providing a time deadline for filing suit.


If the deadline has passed, you no longer have the legal right to sue.
In most states the statute of limitations for defamation actions is either one or two years from the date of defamation. "

Additionally, cases can be very different. Even if you know someone else who also was the victim of violence at a bar, their case still may have had different issues than yours does.
Recommendations do, however, provide a good place to start. This is especially true of recommendations you get from other attorneys. They will understand your case a little better, and probably know attorneys who practice in other areas of law than they do.;
, Without recommendations, you may want to start your search on the website of your state or local bar association. Most have searchable directories, and some have referral services that can provide you with more directed results.To use a referral service, you typically must first answer a few short questions about your case. There may be a form on the website, or you may have to call a local or toll-free number.
Based on your answers, you'll get a list of attorneys licensed in your area who take cases similar to yours.
The benefit of using the state or local bar association's website is that you don't have to worry about whether the attorney is licensed and in good standing to practice law in your area.
Another benefit to a referral service is that attorneys sign up for these services because they need additional clients. You have less of a concern that the attorney will be too busy to take your case.

, You can evaluate an attorney's background, experience, and reputation by doing general online searches as well as digging through the attorney's website. Ideally, you want to come up with a list of three or four attorneys you're interested in meeting.You typically can look up an attorney's disciplinary record by searching their name on the bar association or state court system website. You want to make sure you hire an attorney who does not have a significant record of complaints, especially recent ones.
Pay close attention to client reviews as well. Reviews an attorney posts on their own website probably will be biased toward positive reviews. However, by doing a general internet search using the attorney's name, you may be able to find client reviews from neutral sites.
Take these reviews with a grain of salt, especially if they're anonymous. However, they can let you know areas of concern that you should address with the attorney when you meet in person.

, Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation. Take advantage of this to talk to several attorneys without breaking the bank. By meeting with an attorney one-on-one, you can find out more information and see if you click.Try to schedule your initial consultations within a week, instead of spreading them out. Your ability to do this, however, may depend on your own schedule.
If you call an attorney to schedule an initial consultation and they cannot meet with you within a week or two, you may want to scratch their name off your list and move on to someone else. They may be too busy to give your case the attention it deserves.
Some attorneys will have an information form for you to complete before your initial consultation. If you get one of these, fill it out with as many details as you can and get it back to them as soon as possible.

, Think of the initial consultation as an interview or an information-gathering session. The more prepared you are, the more you can find out from the attorneys with whom you speak. Prepare a list of questions and a summary of what happened.Bring along with you any information you have about the incident at the bar, so the attorney can fully assess your options.
Ask the attorney questions about their work and communication style. You want to make sure that you'll be able to talk to the attorney when you need advice, and that any emails or phone calls will be returned promptly.
Before your initial consultations, think about your goals for the litigation. If you're not particularly aggressive and only interested in making sure your medical bills and any lost wages are covered, let the attorneys know that.
Ask the attorneys you interview how many clients they've represented who had cases similar to yours, and find out the outcomes of those cases. Consider whether those outcomes are similar to the one you want in your case.
If the attorney works for a larger firm and there will be paralegals or associate attorneys doing significant work on your case, ask if you can meet those people as well. It's important that you feel comfortable with everyone who will be working on your case.

, After your initial consultations are over, sit down and go over the information you have about each attorney with whom you spoke. You can create a chart to compare the attorneys objectively.The items on your chart will depend on what's important to you and what differentiates the attorneys you interviewed.
For example, if all the attorneys you interviewed would work on contingency, fees may not be an issue – unless one has a significantly higher fee percentage than the others.
Objective criteria are important in comparing attorneys, but don't be afraid to go with your gut. Your personal feelings and comfort with your attorney may matter just as much as their experience.
For example, suppose you talked to one attorney who had less experience but who made you feel comfortable, expressed interest in your case, and seemed passionate about their work. They may be a better representative for you than another attorney with significant experience who was cold and intimidating.

, Once you've decided which attorney you want to hire, schedule a meeting to discuss the terms of the representation. Make sure the attorney provides you with a written retainer agreement before you pay them any money or allow them to begin work on your case.People often believe that a retainer agreement isn't necessary if you're hiring an attorney on a contingency fee arrangement.
However, even if the attorney isn't going to charge you any fees unless you win or settle your case, it's important to have that fee percentage in writing.
You also need to understand what will be included in the costs of your case (which typically are separate from the attorney's fees).
If there's something you don't understand or don't agree with, bring it up to the attorney before you sign the agreement.

Identify the perpetrator.,
Choose your court.,
Draft your complaint.,
File your complaint.,
Have the defendant served.,
Wait for a response.",How to Take Legal Action As a Victim of Violence at a Bar2," If the person who injured you was a stranger, you may have to do a little detective work to figure out who they are. You won't be able to sue them for your injuries unless you have a legal name and address.It's possible the person also is facing criminal charges. If that's the case, it should be fairly easy to determine their identity.
If you've hired an attorney, they can get the needed information about the person from the court.
If you're representing yourself, however, you may have to do a little more work. The person's information can be discovered easily if you've been contacted by the prosecutor – just call the prosecutor's office and ask them about it.
Criminal court records are public records, so you also should be able to track down the identity of the perpetrator by searching arrest or appearance records from around the same time as the altercation.

, If you've decided to go it alone rather than hiring an attorney, you'll need to decide which court you want to hear your lawsuit. The court must have jurisdiction over the subject matter of your case (civil assault or assault and battery) as well as the person responsible for your injuries.You'll need to choose the court that you want to hear your case. If your damages are below a certain amount, you may be able to use small claims court.
Limits for small claims courts vary among states, but typically you cannot sue for more than a few thousand dollars.
If you want to sue in state or county court, you're typically going to choose the court located in the county where the incident took place. This ensures the court has jurisdiction over the person who assaulted you.

, To initiate your lawsuit, you must create a complaint that lists your allegations against the person and provides a total amount of damages to which you believe you are entitled.If you're representing yourself, check with the court to find out if they have forms available. All small claims courts and most state courts do.
On the other hand, if you're working with an attorney, they'll draft the complaint for you. They may need more information about the altercation from you to properly formulate the allegations in the complaint.
The allegations you list in your complaint should closely follow the elements of civil assault or assault and battery in your state. Typically you must state that the person made contact with you without your consent, and that contact resulted in physical or emotional harm to you.
You must include a specific amount of damages you believe you're owed as a result of your injuries. This includes actual damages such as medical bills or lost wages as well as money for pain and suffering.

, Once you've completed your complaint and any other documents required by the court, take your originals and at least two copies to the clerk's office for the court where you want your lawsuit to be heard.You must pay a filing fee to initiate your lawsuit – typically several hundred dollars, although it may be much less if you're filing in small claims.
If your attorney is filing the complaint, they'll pay the filing fee and add that amount to your costs. Those costs will be deducted from any settlement or award you receive.
If you're representing yourself and can't afford the filing fees, ask the clerk for a fee waiver application. You must include information about your income and assets. If those fall below your state's threshold, you won't have to pay court costs for your case.
Once your complaint is filed, the clerk will stamp all your documents and assign your case a unique case number. The copies will be returned to you – one for your own records, and one for the defendant.

, The person you're suing must have legal notice of the lawsuit, and you must be able to prove to the court that they knew about it. This is done through ""service of process,"" in which the court documents are delivered to the defendant in a verifiable way.Typically service is completed by paying a small fee to the county sheriff's department. A deputy hand-delivers the documents to the defendant.
You also may be able to complete service by mailing the documents using certified mail with return receipt requested. This may not be your best option, however, if you don't know the defendant and are unsure about their address.
Once service is complete, you typically must fill out a proof of service document and file it with the clerk of court.

, After being served with your lawsuit, the defendant has a brief period of time to file a written response. This document will be served on you (or your attorney) using a similar method to the one you used to have the defendant served.If the defendant fails to respond to your lawsuit by the court's deadline, you may be eligible to win your lawsuit by default.
However, even if you do win a default judgement, you still must take steps to enforce it. The court does not do this for you.
If you do receive a written answer, read through it carefully. The defendant likely will deny the bulk of your allegations, and may assert various defenses.
Check to see if the answer was submitted by the defendant alone or by an attorney. If you were representing yourself but the defendant has an attorney, you may want to hire an attorney of your own.

Gather information about the incident.,
Draft your complaint.,
File your complaint.,
Have the bar served.,
Evaluate the response.,
Consider any settlement offer.",How to Take Legal Action As a Victim of Violence at a Bar3," In many situations, if you were a victim of violence at a bar you also can sue the bar itself and recover damages for your injuries. You have the right to remain safe while on the premises, and if you're hurt at the bar, the bar owners may be liable for your injuries.Suing the bar turns on whether you can demonstrate that the bar owners, through their management and staff, were negligent.
Generally this means that you must show that they failed to prevent the violent altercation from happening, or failed to adequately protect other bar patrons who weren't involved in the altercation.
You'll also need information about the bar owners, so you can figure out where to send the lawsuit documents once you have them completed.

, Your complaint lists factual allegations that, if proven, will demonstrate that you were the victim of violence at the bar and the bar owner must pay for the damages you incurred as a result.Generally, you'll want to file your lawsuit in the county where the bar is located. That county may have forms available that you can use to draft your complaint if you've decided to represent yourself.
However, keep in mind that if you've decided to sue the bar owners, they likely will have attorneys representing them. In addition, they probably have a liability insurance company that also will have attorneys involved in the litigation.
For this reason, you want to hire an attorney of your own if you haven't already. Keep in mind that most attorneys take cases like this on contingency, so you won't have to pay anything out-of-pocket for legal representation.
When your attorney completes your complaint, they'll go over it with you to make sure you understand it. If you see anything that seems inaccurate, let your attorney know.

, To initiate your lawsuit, you must take your complaint along with two copies to the clerk of the court that you want to hear your case. The clerk will stamp your documents and give the copies back to you.If you've hired an attorney, they'll take care of filing the complaint for you. It's not necessary for you to go along unless you want to observe the process.
Your documents must be accompanied by a filing fee, typically several hundred dollars. Your attorney will add this to the costs of your case, which will be taken out of any settlement or award you receive.
If you're representing yourself and can't afford the filing fees, ask the clerk for a fee waiver application. You'll provide the court with information about your income and assets. If these fall below a threshold amount set by your state, you won't have to pay court costs for your lawsuit.
The clerk will stamp your documents ""filed"" with the date and assign your case a unique case number. The copies will then be returned: one for your own records and one for the bar owners.

, Once your lawsuit has been filed, you must get a copy of the documents to the bar owners so they have legal notice that a lawsuit has been filed against them. Legal service of process allows the court to verify that the defendant had notice of the lawsuit.Businesses typically have a specified agent for service of process. This may be one of the owners of the bar or a business attorney.
The usual method of service is to pay the county sheriff's department a small fee. A sheriff's deputy then hand-delivers the documents to the bar's agent for service of process.
You also may be able to use mail service, which involves sending the documents to the bar's registered agent using certified mail with return receipt requested.
After service is complete, you must fill out a proof of service document to file with the court.

, The bar owners have a limited period of time after being served with your lawsuit to file a written response. If no response is filed, you may be entitled to win your lawsuit by default.However, you shouldn't expect the bar owners to fail to respond to your lawsuit. On the contrary, expect to receive an aggressive response that may include a denial of your allegations and a motion to dismiss.
If the bar owners move to dismiss your case, you must attend a court hearing and argue that your case includes a factual dispute that can only be resolved with a trial.
Typically you will be unable to continue any other work on your case until the judge rules on the motion to dismiss.
On the other hand, you also may receive a settlement offer even before the bar owners file a written answer to your complaint.

, Once the pleadings (your complaint and the bar owners' answer) have been filed, the bar owners may send a settlement offer over to you or your attorney. It's your decision whether to accept or reject this offer.Particularly if the bar has liability insurance, you may be contacted by an insurance adjustor regarding your complaint.
Don't be offended if the initial settlement offer is far lower than you expected. You can reject it outright, or make a counteroffer.
Your attorney will advise you on what to do with the settlement offer, but remember the ultimate decision is yours alone.
If your attorney is pressuring you to take the settlement, you may want to talk to somebody else about it before you make your final decision.

Know the basics.,
Look for the card that suits you best.,
Keep tabs on your available funds.,
Consider when not to use your debit card.,
Remember your PIN number.,
Swipe your card and enter your PIN (as one option).,
Swipe your card and sign your name (as another option).,
Prepare for chip technology.",How to Use a Debit Card," Debit cards look just like credit cards and can usually conduct transactions in exactly the same manner, but they provide funds in very different ways. You should not think of them as interchangeable options when reaching into your wallet.Basically, every time you use a credit card, you are borrowing money that you need to pay back in full when your statement period ends, if you want to avoid paying interest on outstanding balances.
Debit cards are linked to your bank account, on the other hand, so you are drawing money directly from that account when you use one. Unlike credit cards, you can’t spend money you don’t have in your account (barring overdraft protection features, which will be discussed later).
You can use a debit card anywhere that you can use a credit card. It is up to you to decide whether you should, though.;
, Banks and credit unions want every customer/member to have a debit card, because it is more convenient and lucrative (through fees) for them. The perks, protections, and costs associated with debit cards can vary based on the issuing bank, so it is always best to shop around and read the fine print.Look carefully at any fees associated with your card, which could include annual fees and transaction fees, among others. Some comparison shopping can lead you to a card with substantially lower fees, so it pays to look around.
Some banks also offer rewards for debit purchases — though usually only on “swipe-and-signature” purchases, for reasons discussed later in this article — that can include things like airline miles and cash-back bonuses. Shop around for the rewards program that suits you best.

, With a credit card, you can spend up to your credit limit and worry about how to pay for it all when your statement comes due. With a debit card, you need to know how much money you have available in your linked account at all times, unless you want to risk having your transaction declined or incurring hefty overdraft charges.Debit transactions, especially those using a PIN number, are settled quickly, so you will have little time after the fact to determine if you need to add funds to your account to cover pending charges. Normally, your card will be declined if you have insufficient funds available.
Many banks tout the convenience of overdraft protection coverage with your card, which you may have to sign up for (or even opt-out of if you don’t want it). Overdraft protection can save you the trouble and possible embarrassment of a declined card, by allowing you to make purchases with insufficient funds available to cover them.
However, this comes at the cost of substantial fees per overdraft transaction. For instance, your morning routine of buying a coffee, a newspaper, and some chewing gum at different stops could cost you an extra $75, if you have insufficient funds and your bank charges a $25 overdraft charge per transaction.
Look carefully into the fine print of any overdraft protection program before agreeing to it. Your best option is to always keep a close eye on your balance and not try to spend what you don’t have.

, As mentioned earlier, you can use a debit card anywhere you can use a credit card. That does not mean you should use them interchangeably, however. The main concern is fraud and your potential liability.In the U.S., federal code dictates that your maximum liability for fraudulent credit card transactions (such as if your card or number is stolen) is $50, with no time limit for initiating a claim. However, with debit cards you must claim fraudulent transactions within 48 hours to have the $50 limit. Between two and sixty days, your liability limit goes to $500, and after that time you are on the hook for all fraudulent transactions.
Banks can offer better than minimum fraud protection on debit cards, so shop around and ask questions when choosing a card.
Even with protection, dealing with debit card fraud is more of a hassle and potentially damaging to your finances. Someone who steals your card or information can drain your entire account balance, and then you have to work to get it all back in a time-consuming process. Thus, you may want to use a credit card instead of a debit card in the following situations:Shopping online, unless you are absolutely confident in the site’s security level.
Outdoor publicly-accessible kiosks such as gas station terminals and even ATMs, where criminals can install “skimmers” that steal your card information when you swipe. Particularly avoid card reading equipment that looks damaged, mismatched, or ill-fitting.
Payments where your card leaves your sight, such as handing a waitress your card at a restaurant.
Situations where a pre-payment deposit is required, such as at a hotel. A “hold” charge may be placed on your account to cover any potential overages — such as pay-per-view movies, room service, damages, etc. — and may not be removed for several days. This leaves your own money inaccessible to you and may throw off your available funds awareness.



, All debit cards require you to select a four-digit PIN number as a security measure when using the card. As with your passwords for your online accounts, you need to create a PIN number that is easy for you to remember but hard for a criminal to figure out. Never use “1234” or your four-digit birth year, for instance.You always need to enter your PIN number in order to make ATM cash withdrawals with your debit card. Keep a lookout for prying eyes or evidence of “skimmers” (such as damage or mismatched equipment on the machine) when entering your card and code.
You have the option of using your PIN number or signing your name (as with a credit card) when making purchases with your debit card. Move on to the following two steps to consider the pros and cons of each option.

, If you use your debit card at the supermarket checkout, for instance, the card reader will usually ask whether you want to pay by “debit” or “credit” after you swipe your card. If you select “debit,” you will have to enter your PIN number to complete the transaction.Regardless of whether you “swipe-and-PIN” or “swipe-and-sign,” debit card transactions draw from the available funds in your linked bank account. However, PIN transactions tend to go through faster, usually by the end of the day.
Banks, however, collect more in “interchange fees” from retailers when you “swipe-and-sign,” so they may charge you fees for “swipe-and-PIN” transactions or offer you rewards (such as airline miles) only for “swipe-and-sign” transactions. Read your account’s fine print.
If you are concerned about saving the retailer a bit of money, entering your PIN costs them less in interchange fees.
Some consider PIN transactions slightly more secure, but that is up for debate.

, You can choose to use your debit card as if it were a credit card at the supermarket checkout, which requires you to sign to complete the transaction instead of entering your PIN number. Remember, however, that these so-called “credit” transactions are still just debit transactions taking funds out of your linked account. If you want to pay with credit, you have to use a credit card.


Banks earn more per transaction in “interchange fees” when you process your debit card like a credit card transaction (by signing), so they tend to reward you for signing with bonuses or perks, penalize you with fees for “sign-and-PIN” transactions, or both. The bank gets its share either way; it depends upon whether you want yourself or the retailer to foot slightly more of the bill.Look for debit cards that offer rewards that are valuable to you (like cash back or airline miles), because this is a good reason to choose the “swipe-and-sign” option. The bank may offer you the same, more extensive fraud protections as a credit card when you use your debit card like one, so check on their policies in that area as well. If you can get a reduced fraud liability ($50 at most) and easier fraud-resolution process simply by signing instead of entering a PIN, take it.Just as some people see “swipe-and-PIN” as more secure, others see “swipe-and-sign” as the safer option. The unfortunate reality is that fraud can happen to consumers who use either method.

, In Europe, much of Asia, and many other parts of the world outside the United States, credit cards have already switched over to using embedded chip technology (instead of magnetic strip swiping) for added security. This change is slowly coming to America as well, and will eventually make its way to debit cards.Chip cards actually come in two varieties: “chip-and-sign,” which is a half-measure that provides slightly improved security; and “chip-and-PIN,” which is considered more fraud-resistant. “Chip-and-PIN” is the standard in Europe, for example.
Instead of swiping a chip card, you slide it into the card reader, wait for notification, then remove it. Otherwise, the process is basically the same. During the long transition period, chip cards also have magnetic strips so that they will still work with older card readers.
Once chip technology becomes commonplace for U.S. debit cards, new considerations on the smartest and safest ways to use them will have to be determined.

Once the salesperson has rung your items or services through, they will ask you how you would like to pay. You should then present your debit card to the merchant for payment., Some merchants will need to take the card from you and swipe it through their machine for the transaction to process. Most merchants will have a separate point of sale (POS) machine that you will need to use to swipe your debit card.If your debit card has a chip on one side, you will need to insert your chip into the bottom gap in the POS machine for the transaction to process.
Leave your debit card in the machine for the duration of the transaction. The machine will prompt you when to remove your card at the end of the transaction.

, Once you have swiped or inserted your debit card, you will be prompted by the machine to choose the “Credit” or “Debit” option. You will need to select the “Debit” option to use your debit card for payment.


Some merchants are able to select the “Debit” option through their system so you may not see this option in the POS machine. You may instead be prompted to move on to accepting the transaction.

, The POS machine may ask you to approve the transaction to ensure the total amount you are being charged is correct. Take a moment to confirm that the amount on the POS machine is the amount you should be charged.


For example, if you were purchasing items for $35.52, the POS machine may ask, “Do you accept the amount of $35.52?” If the amount looks correct, you would then choose the approve button on the POS machine.

, Some POS machines will ask you to select the bank account you would like to use for the transaction. You will have two options: “Checkings” or “Savings” account. You should choose the bank account that has the money you would like to use to pay for the transaction.


If you do not have a “Savings” account set up through your banking institution for your debit card, you may not be shown this option.

, The POS machine will then ask you to enter your four digit Personal Identification Number (PIN). You should have a PIN set up for your debit card through your bank.Make sure you enter your PIN correctly into the keypad, as the transaction may be cancelled if you enter it incorrectly. You should use your hand to cover the screen and keypad as you input your PIN so it cannot be seen by others.
Keep in mind some banking institutions will charge a fee of 0.50 cents to $1 for using your PIN at the register. You can avoid this fee by selecting the “credit” option, if you have a debit/credit card. You will then use the debit card like a credit card and sign for the transaction instead of putting in your PIN., At some retailers, you may be taken to a cashback screen on the POS machine. The cashback option will allow you to take cash out of your bank account as part of the debit transaction. This can be handy if you need cash on hand. You may be asked if you would like to take cash out in even denominations of $20, $40, $60, $80, and $100.Keep in mind some retailers may charge a small fee for giving you cashback. Always ask the retailer if there are any fees before you use the cashback option.

, Once you have entered your PIN, the POS machine will process the transaction. Your bank will be triggered to take out money from your account to pay for the transaction. If you have enough money in your chosen bank account for the transaction, you will see an “Approval” notice.


If the transaction is approved, the POS machine will produce a receipt for the vendor or seller. You can also get a copy of your receipt for your records.
If the transaction does not go through due to insufficient funds in your account or you end up cancelling the transaction for some reason, you will get a “Not Approved” or “Incomplete” notice. You will then need to pay for the transaction with another form of payment or not make the purchase.

, You should check your account balance before you use your debit card. This will ensure your transactions go through, leading to less embarrassment at checkout. Making sure you have enough money in your account for your purchases will also ensure your bank does not charge you an overdraft fee if you try to take out more money than you have in your account.Depending on your bank, you may have the option of overdrawing your account within a certain amount for a fee. Or, your bank may not allow you to overdraw your account at all and will simply decline the transaction if you try to spend more money than you have.
Your bank may give you the option to set up alerts through online banking to let you know when your balance is low. This way, you can check your account more frequently and be aware of how much money you have to spend in your account.

, You should be well aware of the fees you may be charged when you use your debit card. This will prevent you from getting a small shock when you open your monthly bank statement to find a series of debit card usage fees. You should get a full list of the fees associated with your debit card from your bank so you can use your debit card wisely.Your bank may charge you a fee for entering your PIN to complete a transaction rather than signing your name.
You may also be charged if you overdraw your account using your debit card. This is similar to what happens when you write a check that “bounces” or does not go through.
You may be charged a small fee if you use an ATM machine that is not operated by your financial institution. These fees are usually around $2-$4 per a transaction.

, In some cases, a merchant may put a “hold” on your transaction, where they will get approval from your bank for an estimated purchase amount. Once they get approval for the estimated purchase amount, you will be charged. This “hold” may take 24-48 hours, so you may not have access to held money in your bank account during this time. You should try to keep track of your held transactions throughout the day so you do not try to use money that is being held in your account.Many merchants use “holds” to make sure you have enough funds to pay for a purchase. Often, your debit account may be held when you reserve a hotel room using your debit card, or when you use your debit card to pay for gas at the gas station.
For example, once you make a gas payment at the pump, the gas station will create two transactions. The first transaction will be to get approval from your bank for an estimated purchase amount. The second will be for the actual amount of the purchase. The first transaction must go through and be cancelled by your bank within 48 hours for the hold on that amount to be lifted from your account. Then, the second transaction will be processed.

, You should always be wary when using ATMs to take out cash with your debit card, as the ATM may be “skimmed” by a thief. Skimming is used to capture your bank card information by putting a reader on the POS machine or the ATM card slot. You should go for ATMs that located in well lit, high traffic areas, such as a shopping center or a busy plaza. You should avoid ATMs that look damaged or where the card slot looks askew and tampered with.It may also be safer, and more cost efficient, to use ATMs provided by your banking institution. You should be able to use ATMs at your banking institution free of charge to take out cash. Often ATMs at your bank are well maintained and secured from theft or fraud.

, You should always protect your personal banking information so it is not at risk of theft or fraud. Do not write down your PIN on your debit card or on a piece of paper. Try to memorize it in your head.

Shop around to find the best one., Some prepaid credit cards charge a setup fee. However, the fee isn't the same for every card. Try to find one that is low or nothing., Another place that prepaid credit cards hit you is with reload fees. Essentially, when you add more money to the card, some companies charge you again. However, some do not charge you a reload fee, which can make it more economical. Pick one with a low reload fee or no reload fee, if possible., Other companies tack the fees on in other places, such as if you try to take cash off the card at an ATM. Still others may charge you to check your balance or if you try to make a purchase without enough money on the card. Try to find all the hidden fees before agreeing to a card., These types of cards also usually attach a monthly fee to the card. Of course, you want to find the lowest one you can to avoid paying too much just to keep a credit card on hand., Some companies may not charge you fees if you put enough money on the card at the beginning. Others require a certain balance to waive fees over time.Also, check how often you're required to use your card, as some companies will charge you if you don't use yours enough. In addition, they may charge you if you decide to close your account., Once you've picked out a card, you essentially purchase it by loading it with money and paying any purchase fee. Because you always preload the card, you will not need credit approval.However, you will need to have a way to add money. You can use cash to load these cards, as long as you do it in a store that sells them. Many of the big box stores sell prepaid credit cards. Be aware that most of them have a minimum load amount along with the purchase price.You can also add money from PayPal accounts or have your paycheck deposited on to a card. You can also put money on it from a bank account., Generally, you go online to register your card, and input information such as your address, your card number, and your phone number. It's important to register your card because if you lose it, your company may be able to recover or refund your money., Different cards have different limits. If you need to make big purchases, you may need one with a bigger limit. Cards can range from as little as $500 to unlimited., Essentially, you pay with your card anywhere that accepts credit cards.

You'll likely need the expiration date, your name as it appears on the card, and the security code on the back of the card., As your card gets low, you'll need to add more money to be able to use it. You reload your card the same way you added funds the first time, through a bank account or PayPal, with cash, or by depositing your paycheck on to it., Some credit cards have a limit on the amount of money you can take out for a cash advance. You should be able to find this information on your account online or by calling customer service for your credit card. In other cases, you may need to turn on the option for cash advances by calling customer service., If you don't know your pin already, you'll need to get your ATM pin for your credit card.

Come up with an organized way to store bills in folders and larger containers or filing cabinets for the best results.;

Ask for one from the bank.,
Activate your card.,
Consider a prepaid card.",How to Get a Debit Card2," If you already have a bank account, you can get a debit card from your bank. It is a relatively easy process. You just need to complete an application with the bank to get a debit card. Since you have already established your identity with the bank, the only paperwork is the application. The bank will review your application and, depending on your history with the bank, approve your account for a debit card.


The bank typically mails you a card once you have been approved., Once you have received your new card, you need to activate it. Activating the card is usually done with the help of a banking representative at your local branch. You will pick a PIN (Personal Identification Number) and make a simple transaction. Make sure you chose a unique number that isn't easy to guess but that is something you can remember. Once the PIN is chosen, the same one will be used for any debit transaction.


If the bank gives you the choice of using or not using a PIN in your debit transactions, always choose to have one. It is an important safeguard for the security of your account.
Your PIN should not be obvious, such as your birthday, social security number, address, or phone number. Don't write your PIN and keep it in your purse or wallet. Don’t share it with anyone. If they use it, you will likely be responsible, even if they didn’t have permission for that particular purchase., You can buy a prepaid, reloadable debit card at some major retailers, convenience stores, discount stores, pharmacies, or online. These locations sell Visa or MasterCard debit cards. These cards work much like the debit cards attached to other accounts. The difference is that you load them with a balance that is only accessible with the card.


One problem with prepaid cards is that they typically require an activation fee when you put money on the card for the first time. However, the activation charge is a one-time fee and does not occur again while you are using the card.
You can load money on them online, in person at a participating retailer, and through direct deposit from another account."
"
Buy items at the store.,
Keep track of your balance.,
Monitor your account.",How to Get a Debit Card3," The debit cards use the same networks as the credit cards. Therefore, anywhere you could use a credit card you should be able to use a debit card, which is most places in the United States. You may have to give your card to the cashier to swipe. You may also be able to swipe it yourself. Then enter your PIN number into a keypad and press OK. Verify the amount once it appears on the screen and hit OK again.


You can also use your debit card to purchase things online as well. You will just have to have the card number, the expiration date, your PIN, and the verification code on the back of the card handy.Some vendors treat the debit card as a credit card, swiping the card without requiring a PIN number. Nevertheless, the card provider will deduct the payment from the bank account balance immediately.

, In general, it's smart to check your balance online on a regular basis. That way, you'll always know how much money you have available.


It may help to track of your purchases, either by writing them down or by recording them in a budget document or spreadsheet. Doing so will keep you from forgetting what you bought and help you avoid overdraft fees or insufficient funds., Once you start making purchases and putting money into your bank account, you need to make sure you review your account activity in your statement. This might come to you in the mail or you can do it online. This will help you be sure that there is no activity that is not yours. If you detect anything unusual or that you do not recognize, contact the bank.


While fraud with a debit card is unlikely since you have to use a PIN, it is not impossible. Try to keep your card with you at all times. Do not let others see your PIN or write it down.If you find that you have lost your card or it gets stolen, report it immediately to your bank. If you get an automated menu, choose the ""report a lost or stolen card"" option from the menu.

Use coupons effectively.,
Target marked down items.,
Purchase store brands.,
Calculate unit prices.,
Think of ways to use old or bruised produce.",How to Find Hidden Bargains at the Grocery Store," When used correctly, coupons can save you more than just purchasing the item as is, and even move than that if the item is on sale or when the coupon can be doubled in savings. Even if it's a few cents off, it's a few cents that can be used towards something else.


A great substitution for coupons is to use a weekly grocery circular or ad. When you are a regular shopper at a specific supermarket, you can easily identify what's really on sale or a typical price in an ad, although there might be holiday slashes on certain items throughout the year that could be a great hidden bargain.;
, Meats, such as ground beef or chicken are usually marked down by the butcher around the use by/sell by date. If you're needing a last minute dinner, it's recommended to go with that. Bread that are days old can easily be turned into French toast or croutons.

, Popular brands are known for their quality taste, however, store brands have the same characteristics and cost a lot less. You could probably find a store brand cereal for half the price as a brand that your child loves and they wouldn't even notice the difference.

, Store unit prices are essentially how much a measurement (such as each ounce or liter) costs. For example, if a 12 ounce cereal box costs $3.00 and a 16 ounce cereal box costs $3.00, you would get the 16 ounce box because each ounce costs $0.18, rather than paying $0.25 for the 12 ounce box.

, Produce are excellent choices in desserts and other baked items, such as banana bread, smoothies, and ingredient substitutions. Bananas and applesauce are great replacements for eggs when baking cookies or a cake.

Many provide in-store, member's only pricing or reward you for your purchases in the form of coupons or reduced fuel costs. The best ones for you depend on your particular purchasing behavior, so first determine the types of things you purchase most often.


For instance, if you drive frequently, consider joining a supermarket loyalty program that offers cheaper gas prices if you do your grocery shopping at their stores.
Similarly, do you buy a lot of a few particular products? If you buy a lot of dog food or diapers, consider joining a loyalty program at a store that offers lower prices on these items for members.;
, Many supermarkets simply offer the lowest possible prices without the marketing strategy of a loyalty program. In fact, much of the standard pricing of items at stores with loyalty programs is higher than it is at stores without loyalty program.

Often, even the “members only” pricing is comparable to the prices at other stores, and your overall grocery bill is likely not going to differ too much.

, You can always shop at supermarkets that do offer loyalty programs without joining the program. Further, many programs offer opportunities to join, but also opt out of things like ""partnership services"" or ""special offers.”Before turning in your application to a loyalty program, ask a customer services representative at the store about whether and how you can opt out of any features of the program.

If your wife is pregnant, be sure to keep this in mind., In Texas, you can file for divorce with or without assigning fault to one party or the other. The only grounds for a no-fault divorce in Texas are ""insupportability,"" which means that for whatever reason, the marriage is no longer viable. If you wish to file for some other reason, such as adultery, criminality, or abandonment (among others), you need to speak with an attorney. Furthermore, if you and your spouse cannot come to an agreement with respect to the division of property and child custody and support, you need to speak with an attorney.Texas is a community property state, which means that it views the property of either spouse acquired during the marriage as the property of both spouses, and the default division of that property is an even split. However, if the court finds that one spouse is at fault for the dissolution of the marriage, then it can and will assign more property to the innocent spouse. For this reason, if you plan to sue for divorce on specific grounds, you need to speak with an attorney. If you cannot afford one, go to texaslawhelp.org for help finding a Legal Aid attorney.

That means that they have jurisdiction over all legal matters unless specifically designated otherwise.In very small counties, or judicial districts that preside over multiple small counties, there may only be one District Court. If you live in a county like this, you would file there.
In districts of larger size, the District Courts are divided into subdivisions that give preference to certain areas, like family law. These are called Family District Courts. If you live in one of these Districts, then you should file with the Family District Court.
To find out whether you should file with a District Court or a Family District Court, simply go look in the directory in the Texas Pro Se Divorce Handbook.Alternatively, go to courts.texaslawhelp.org and fill in the required information.

, The forms you use will depend on whether you and your spouse have children together and if you own real property (land, houses, or other structures). The Supreme Court of Texas has approved a set of forms for filers with children, without children, and without children or property.Once you find the right category for you and your spouse, simply click on the link provided. Almost all of the forms you will need are in the packet.

, Everyone in Texas who files a civil case must submit a Civil Case Information Sheet. In order to fill the form out properly, you will need to know your name, address, telephone number, and email, along with the full names of both spouses. After you have entered in that information, simply check the box in the ""Family Law"" section that says ""divorce."", The contents of the Petition are going to differ drastically depending on whether or not you and your spouse have children. The Petition for couples without children is four pages. The petition for couples with children is more than twice as long.You may leave the cause or cause number blank, the Court Clerk will fill this in when you file the documents with the Court.
The addendum for custodial arrangements is extremely detailed, going so far as to specify when the weekend begins, what happens on three day weekends, and who shall have custody of the child on any and all major and minor holidays. It might be best for you each to come up with some idea of how you would like to make arrangements separately, and then come to a compromise agreement afterwards. If you have trouble coming to an agreement, consider a mediator.You can browse a national directory of mediators by going to www.mediate.com and looking at the listing for your state.

, You can find the form on the texaslawhelp.org website under their section on filing for divorce.

, File the form with the Clerk's Office in the District Court that has jurisdiction. Your divorce does not actually begin until you file this form.


Expect to pay filing fees with the county where you file. The exact amount of the fees will vary by locality, but you should expect to pay at least $200 in fees.If you qualify as indigent (poor), the filing fees will be greatly reduced or waived altogether. You can make an affirmation of indigency by filling out a form and filing it with the clerk of court., Your spouse must receive a copy of the petition. If your spouse agrees to waive service of process, you can just send the Petition by mail or drop it off in person. If you are unsure, then pay a process server to perform an in-person service.

, Your spouse needs to complete a Waiver of Service or an Answer. For most people pursuing an uncontested divorce, a Waiver of Service will do. If you expect them to waive service, then just send the form along with the Petition.


If your spouse signs a Waiver of Service, you are not required to provide him or her with a copy of the divorce petition, or any other filings, and he or she will not be required to attend any hearings. This is generally used only when divorcing parties are in complete agreement on all issues and will not ask for any hearings. You may file the Waiver yourself.
If your spouse wishes to receive copies of your filings and attend any hearings, he or she may file an answer to your divorce petition instead of a Waiver of Service. This is generally not used in an uncontested divorce, but your situation may differ. Your spouse must file the Answer.

, Once the Answer or the Waiver have been completed, you and your spouse should complete the final decree of divorce. In it you will confirm the division of property, child support, and custody arrangements.


Calculate Child Support correctly. To determine what child support should be, use the child support calculator provided by the Travis County Court., Anyone considering a divorce should get an attorney to at least look over the final versions of the forms. A mistake on one of these forms could lead to years of problems.


Provide clear and complete information. Type or print all information in blue or black ink. Be sure to answer each questions completely and fill in every blank that applies to your situation.

, Call the Clerk’s Office at the proper court and ask how many copies of each form you will need and what the filing fee will be. Make the appropriate number of copies and take to the Clerk’s office along with the filing fee, which should be in cash, as the Courts do not accept personal checks or debit cards.

, If your spouse did not waive service of process but is still not contesting any points of the divorce, hire a process serves or another disinterested third party to serve your spouse with any remaining paperwork. However, if your divorce is uncontested because your spouse is missing, try service by publication.


If you are not able to find your spouse, you may wish to serve him or her by publication. This means publishing notice of the divorce filing in a newspaper of general circulation in the last city or town where he or she was known to reside.To serve a party by publication in Texas, you must obtain the permission of the Court. In order to do this, you will need to file an affidavit with the Court stating that you are unable to find your spouse, after making an honest effort to do so.

, Whether the divorce is contested or uncontested, the filing party must appear at a hearing.


If you and your spouse are in agreement on all issues, you may appear without your spouse at an uncontested docket hearing, which will take approximately ten minutes. You should bring all of your Court filings to the hearing., Texas has a mandatory 60 day waiting period for divorces. The waiting period begins when you file the Petition., During the 60 day waiting period and before you attend the court hearing to get your divorce decree signed, you must complete any parenting classes that are required if you have a child with your spouse. Make sure you do not blow these off as it may delay your divorce and cause the judge to impose other requirements.


During these parenting classes, you will learn about the responsibilities and hardships of co-parenting after a divorce.For example, part of the course may teach you about how to handle problems that arise while parenting without your spouse around (i.e., how to be a good single parent)., The Court will not prepare your Divorce Decree for you. It is up to you to prepare this document, according to the orders of the Court, and file it for the Judge to sign. The Judge will not sign the Decree until it has been 61 days from the date of filing of the Petition for Divorce.If you have children, you will need to file the Information on Suit Affecting the Family Relationship form.
If support is ordered, you will also need to file the Income Withholding for Support Order, which can be found with the packet of forms for uncontested divorces with children.You will most likely need to fill this out with your employer, as there are certain pieces of information on the form not usually known to employees.

Wait for a response.",How to Write a Demand Letter Instead of Hiring an Attorney," Determine the identity of the other party and pinpoint your relationship with them. You want to send your letter to the person that has authority to make decisions. In most cases, this will be the person that owes you money or their attorney. Do not send your letter to an assistant or secretary.


In addition to addressing the letter to the correct person, consider the relationship you have with that person. Is it a friend or relative? Is it someone you need to maintain a professional relationship with? Do you have to deal with this person in the future? Answering these questions will help you determine the tone of your letter.;
, Your demand letter is going to start with a statement of facts. Sit down and recreate the story that led to your dispute with the other party. Do this so your statement of facts is true, complete, and persuasive. To help, collect documents that help tell the story.


For example, if you are writing a letter to someone that owes you money, find the initial purchase agreement, receipts, monthly statements, and other letters stating the person owes the money. Use these documents to get an idea of when and how the dispute arose.

, Some documents will be included with your demand letter. These documents should be gathered before you start writing. For example, if you are in a contract dispute, find the contract and have it available while you are writing your letter. If your dispute concerns an outstanding bill, find that bill before you write.

, When you demand payment of a certain amount, you need to be able to back up your request. If your demand is for a service, as opposed to money, be able to substantiate your claim. Do not make your request arbitrary. Before you start writing, calculate the amount of your request.


For example, if one person owes you on three outstanding bills, each equaling $500, you will request $1,500. You may also request interest if that was a part of your initial agreement. Do not ask for $5,000 or some other arbitrary number.
Any request you make will likely be scrutinized for its accuracy. The opposing party will not usually pay you until they have done their own research into the matter. This is why it is important to accurately calculate the amount of your request.

, Before you start writing, try to find demand letter templates online. A lot of legal services websites offer free templates. Also, some state sponsored websites will have examples available for you as well.


Use your favorite search engine to try to find these templates. Try typing in ""demand letter templates"" or something similar.

, Some states, for example California, offer a free service that will create a letter for you. All you have to do is answer a number of directed questions. Once you complete the questionnaire, a computer program will create a PDF version of your letter., If you are writing your own letter, start by placing the date at the top left corner.The date is important as it will act as evidence of when you sent the demand letter. If you provide a deadline in your letter, it will be measured against the date written here as well.

, A couple lines down, let the other party know how you are sending the letter.This will set your expectation for a return letter or payment. For example, if you send your letter via priority mail with delivery confirmation, the other party could be expected to send a return letter using the same method.


If possible, use a method that allows you to track your letter to ensure it gets to its recipient. In addition, request a return receipt when possible. When the letter is delivered, you will be sent a receipt showing that it was delivered.If you go to court, you can use this receipt to rebut any argument that the opposing party did not receive the notice., Next, draft an address block that includes the recipient's name and address.If your dispute goes to court, this letter may be used as evidence. If the letter doesn't include the recipient's name, it will be impossible to determine who the letter was meant for.

, Your description line will briefly title the letter. For example, if you are demanding money from someone else, the description may state, ""RE: Demand for Payment."", Your salutation should confirm the identity of the recipient. In addition, you should address the other party as ""Mr."", ""Ms."", or ""Mrs.""., Your opening paragraph will start with a sentence about how much you are owed and why you believe you are owed it. Make this the focal point of your letter. The paragraph will also lay out the factual situation that led to the dispute you are now in.Be as in depth as possible but do not include irrelevant facts. Be concise but complete.


If you end up in court, your letter will be read by the judge. Now is a great time to lay out the facts of the case as you see them.For example, your opening paragraph may say: ""Please be advised that you owe me the sum of $5,000 because there is an outstanding bill for the purchase of a bike. On , you bought a bike from me for $5,000 and you executed a contract saying you would pay me by .""

, The second paragraph will tell the other party how you expect the payment to be delivered (or how the services will be provided); you will provide a deadline; you will explain who the payment can be made out to; and you will tell the other party where the payment can be sent. This paragraph should be written with a firm but polite tone.You do not want to attack the other party personally, but you want them to know you are serious.


For example, you could say: ""I expect payment in the amount of $5,000.00 made payable to me, 888 8th Street, Los Angeles CA, 90000 no later than February 12, 2016. (I can be reached at: (Telephone: (555) 555-5555).)"", Your last body paragraph will ensure the other party has an understanding of the letter they are receiving. You should tell them that they will not receive another notice; that you will pursue any legal remedy you can; and you should let them know the possible consequences of going to court.


For example, you may write: ""This will be your only chance to settle this matter before I file suit against you in Small Claims Court. I am agreeable to a lump sum payment, or to a payment plan. Please contact me on or before February 12, 2016 for purposes of settling this matter. If I do not hear from you on or before February 12, 2016, I will file a lawsuit against you without further notice. It is in your best interest to settle this matter before a lawsuit is filed. If a judgment is obtained against you, it will negatively affect your ability to get credit, you will be ordered to pay court costs, and you will incur interest at a rate of 10% per annum. If you decide to ignore this demand for payment, I will further pursue all of its legal remedies without further notice to you. This letter serves as evidence that I have attempted to resolve this matter informally."", In a final closing sentence or two, you should again explain the situation. This conclusion should let the other party know that you expect payment and that if they ignore the notice a lawsuit may be filed. It is important not to skip this conclusion. You want to give the other party as many opportunities as possible to read and understand the consequences of their actions.

, At the end of the letter, use ""Sincerely"" or ""Thank You"". Leave a couple of spaces after this for your signature. Below this space, include your name and contact information., If your letter made reference to any contracts, statements, receipts, or any other document, include that document with your demand letter as an exhibit. If you go to court, these attachments may be useful if the other party argues they did not enter into an agreement with you, or that they were not sent statements or receipts.

, After the letter and all exhibits have been completed print the letter out. Use white paper and black ink.

, Using a black or blue pen, sign the demand letter in the space provided.

, Once you have placed your signature on the letter, make a couple of copies for yourself. In addition, keep all mailing receipts and correspondence from the other party. All of this may become important if your case goes to court., Using the method you specified in the letter, send the demand to the other party.

, If the other party responds, negotiate with them or accept the payment if you receive it. If this happens, your dispute is resolved and the demand letter worked. If you get paid, send a letter thanking them for their response and payment. Let them know the dispute is resolved. If you do not get an answer, take any legal action you believe is appropriate.

Remember to be a smart shopper and shop at different stores as well.,
Large but cheap meals is a money saver.,
Consider spreading out your large portions into small single portion containers.,
Always buy in bulk.,
NEVER buy the food you are most likely not going to eat or throw away.,
Waste NOTHING and spend 4 to 5 days in the week to clear out whatever is in the kitchen and fridge.,
Consider eating small meals throughout the day.,
Freeze any leftover poultry and unused vegetables.,
Take advantages of Coupons and in store specials.,
Use Generic.,
Have a potluck party on special occasions.,
Consider the vegetarian lifestyle.","How to Spend Less Than $1,000 a Year on Food"," Junk food is not only unhealthy, it costs more than it is really worth. It's fine to eat it on rare occasions but it has very little or no nutrients at all and it's pretty expensive in the long run.;
, Because chances are, you'll end up finding another store selling the same thing for a cheaper price.

, Consider looking on the internet for meals that can be made in large portions but could be made pretty cheaply. Granted, large meals costs slightly a bit more to make but it costs more to just make individual portions all the time because you have to keep using more energy, thus paying more money to cook them. Also if you make a large portion you could stretch them out by putting most of it in the fridge after you are done with it.

, Doing so will help making sure you're not using more than you really have to.

, Whenever you buy bulk items you are usually buying a large amounts of something and can be used in many ways and a lot of the times when you buy in bulk it is usually a bit more cheaper then buying them individually.

, This is common sense. If you knew you are not gonna eat something, then try not to buy it in the first place as it will be a waste of money.

, One of the main reason why we spend so much is because we always never use whatever we already have, letting it rot and go to waste. So use whatever you have in your disposal. You have no idea just how much money you could save just by being creative with your meals and make a meal out of just a bunch of random ingredients in your home.

, Doing so will help make sure that you are not hungry and it will usually speed up your metabolism. If you do this instead with combining exercise, you'll lose weight while never really hungry at all.

, If you happen to have any raw meat of any sort, put them inside the fridge or consider freezing them to make sure they don't go bad.

, Sometimes your store will have specials or have coupons. Take advantage of them as they will save you those small amounts of money that adds up.

, Sometimes generic items are not as bad as people claim. Despite how generic items are not usually as popular but their quality isn't as bad and can be a bit more cheaper than name brand items.

, Potlucks is a great idea to socialize with your friends and family and gives you a chance to have a night without spending or using much of your food and still ending the night while having a full stomach.

, Meat is expensive. So consider only buying a portion of meat every once a week and try to make it last. There's also many cheap dishes that can usually be made and have much leftovers that even meat eaters might enjoy. Such as:


Tomato soup with basil or other other condiments and with Garlic bread
Vegetarian Lasagna
Veggie chili
Sandwiches and juice

Understand the law:It is absolutely crucial that you understand the law relevant to your offence.,
Entering the court: You will be shown by a member of court staff where to stand.,
Being heard: Don’t worry too much about the formality of being in court.,
Written submissions v. Oral submissions: It is perfectly acceptable to hand up a written statement or letter to the Bench.,
Adjournments: An adjournment is a pause in the proceedings.,
The legal clerk & sentencing guidelines: The legal clerk is a very important person in the Magistrates’ Court.,
Getting sentenced: Means form and the plea in mitigation.,
Plea in mitigation.",How to Represent Yourself at Court (UK)," In order to defend yourself or mitigate on your own behalf you have to understand what it is that you are being charged with. Do your research: find out the relevant ingredients, defences and sentences. If you are already at court and unclear speak to the duty solicitor or legal clerk (see below.);
, Some courts use the dock; others will make you stand at the back of court. Only if you give evidence will you be asked to take the witness stand. You will be asked to confirm your name, DOB and address. If you have not already entered a plea you will be asked to do so. If you understand the charge enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. Stand until you are told that you can be seated.

, You won’t be expected to be an expert in court etiquette. Follow these rules you won’t go too far wrong:


Address the Bench (the judge or magistrate) as “Sir” or “Madam”. If there are 3, focus on the one in the centre.
If you have something to say politely ask “Sir, may I address you on __________”. Don’t just start talking. Never interrupt. You will get your chance to speak.
When you talk to the bench, or when they talk to you, stand up and talk as clearly as possible. It might be that they say you can remain seated but it is important to show respect.

, If you are worried about public speaking or forgetting things that you want to say it might be a good idea. Be as concise as possible. Typed is preferable. You can hand up a written document and still make oral submissions. Often the Legal Clerk will agree to read it if you would prefer.Written submissions can be memorable and effective but nothing can replace speaking to someone and looking them in the eye.

, If you think that there is a genuine reason that the proceedings should be adjourned don’t be afraid to ask for one. Tell the bench why it would be unfair to continue. How long do you need? Unless there is good reason an adjournment will be refused.

, They tell the magistrates what the law is. They should be neutral, almost a referee, between the prosecution and defence. If there is a legal argument their advice to the Bench will be vital. They should also help to explain the law to you. If their advice is wrong then you can appeal. Many of the decisions in the Magistrates’ Court are come to in a formulaic way. There is limited discretion. There are guidelines relating to sentences and penalties.

, Before your case has even been decided you will often have to complete a means form. Fines are based on your income. Regard is given to how much available income you have. The magistrates will see the form before they sentence you. Think of how much you can afford to pay per week/month. Most fines will have to be paid in less than a year.

, If pleading guilty, this is your chance to tell the Bench why they should be lenient when they sentence you. See below for a sample structure.

However, it is not always possible to discuss a divorce in a civil matter or reach an agreement on all issues, particularly if you have children together. If you cannot agree, you are likely to need the assistance of an attorney to protect your interests., While some situations are easily handled on a pro se basis, others are far too complex to be handled pro se. Generally, you are a good candidate for a pro se divorce if the following facts are true:You have been married for a relatively short period of time.
You have no children together, or you and your spouse agree on all matters relating to the child(ren), including custody, visitation, and child support.
You and your spouse don't have a lot of money, marital property, or shared debt to divide.

, While it is possible to file for divorce on your own, it is often useful to get some help during the process, even if you choose not to hire an attorney to represent you in the divorce. Here are some ways that you can ensure that you are completing the divorce process properly.It is possible in some states to get a lawyer to look over your paperwork and give you a limited amount of advice at a much cheaper price. This is a good way to double-check your work and get any questions that you have answered.
You and your spouse can meet with a mediator, or a neutral third party who is trained to resolve disputes, in order to ensure that you are in agreement on all issues regarding the divorce. Many states require this as part of their divorce proceedings.
Some states have legal document preparers (LDPs), which are businesses that will submit completed legal documents for you. While they cannot give you legal advice, they can ensure that there aren't any problems with your paperwork. , The clerk’s office may be able to confirm that you have all of the right forms or documents and answer many questions that you may have about the process. However, the clerk’s office cannot give you legal information., Some states or counties have websites with links to the forms you need to file for divorce. Some clerk’s offices have forms that you can pick up in person, or that they will provide to you by mail. These form already have the legal language in place with spaces where you can fill in details for yourself and your spouse. Every state requires specific forms, and some states may require forms that other states do not. The most commonly required forms include:Petition for Divorce – This document requests that the court grant you a divorce.
Summons - This form directs a police officer or sheriff’s deputy to contact your spouse and let him or her know that you are filing for divorce and that he or she has the right to respond.Financial Affidavit - You and your spouse are each required to fully disclose your respective financial situations on this form.
Notice of Hearing - This form is filed to allow the court sets a date for your court hearing.
Settlement Agreement – This form can be filed with the court if you and your spouse agree on all issues related to the divorce.
Divorce Decree – This form is the document that the judge will sign to formally grant your divorce.

, This is the first step to formally placing your divorce petition on file with the court. The clerk’s office will require you to file a certain number of copies of the documents, along with the original documents. Check with your clerk’s office beforehand in order to determine how many copies are necessary.Many states require that you be a resident of the state and/or county for a certain period of time before being eligible to file for divorce. Check with your clerk’s office about your state’s eligibility requirements, or look them up online.

, All courts charge a filing fee to file for divorce, which varies widely from one state and even from one court to the next. In most jurisdictions, the filing fee ranges from $100.00 to $300.00.


If you cannot afford to pay the court’s filing fee, you may be able to ask the court to waive the normal filing fee. In many states, if you qualify for public assistance or your income is below the federal poverty guidelines, you can file in forma pauperis (IFP) or fee waiver request forms with the clerk’s office. These forms request the court to waive the normal filing fee. The court may or may not grant your request, depending on your local court practices and your individual circumstances.

, Whenever you turn in a completed form, always keep a copy that has been file-stamped by the clerk’s office for your own records. That way you have proof that you submitted the document, and a back-up copy in case the original gets lost somehow., In addition to keeping copies of everything, make sure you file and store your paperwork in a safe place. You'll want to include things like receipts for fees paid, all signed documents, and explanatory information given to you by the clerk’s office., You will be notified of the date and time of your court hearing by mail. Your case will be put on a docket for some time in the coming months. However, not all states require a hearing. To determine which states require a hearing, click here


There are different types of court hearings that may be scheduled in your case, depending on your state’s laws and your local court’s practices. For instance, you may have a provisional or preliminary hearing, which deals with temporary orders, usually dealing with children and possession of the marital residence and vehicles, while your divorce is going on. You may also have a final divorce hearing, at which the court is likely to grant your divorce. Other states and courts may require additional hearings as needed.

, If you must attend a court hearing, bring all of the necessary materials with you to your court date. This includes required signed paperwork and any other required documents. Even uncontested divorces can take months, so you don't want to slow down the process even more by having to reschedule your court date because you don't have all of the right information.

, Remember that the courtroom is a professional place and the decision of the judge will be final. Therefore, you'll want to dress in a respectable fashion since you are representing yourself.

, If you and your spouse have amicably settled your divorce and you appear in court, it is likely that the judge will simply give you what you have asked for, especially if there are no children involved. If, however, there seems to be disagreement or hostility between you and your spouse, the judge may order that you attend mediation before ruling on your case., Remember that whatever is decided in the hearing is final. You will not be able to go back later and change the settlement agreement.

, The whole process can take months until the divorce is finalized. It is important that you always know where your case stands and what you need to be doing to help the process along. It is possible that the court might be waiting on you to act, so you need to know what's happening so you can finalize the divorce in a reasonable amount of time.Many states have waiting periods before your divorce can be granted. This waiting period may be as little as 60 days or as long as six months.
If you and your spouse have minor children together, your state laws or local court rules may require you both to attend a parenting class for divorced or separated parents. Taking the class may involve the payment of a small fee, usually ranging from $20.00 to $30.00. Some courts will not allow you to get divorced if you have not attended the class as ordered.
Some courts will not allow you to get divorced if the wife is currently pregnant. Depending on your state’s laws, the wife may have to first give birth and prove that the child does not belong to the husband before the divorce will be granted.

, Get a certified copy of your divorce decree from the clerk’s office or the court administrator’s office. You'll need a copy of your divorce decree for many things in the future, such as buying a house or getting remarried, so make sure you get a certified copy and put it in a safe place. You also will need it in order to officially change your name if your divorce granted you the right to return to your maiden name or a previous married name.

, Whatever the judge decides, you have to follow. Make sure you abide by the judge's ruling to avoid possible financial or legal consequences.

Ask about what information will be tracked and collected.,
Recognize what companies do with this information.,
Decide whether it bothers you that companies have this information.,
Ask what information the company will share.",How to Evaluate Supermarket Loyalty Programs2," Information on your purchasing behaviors can prove valuable to your supermarket. For this reason, enrolling in a loyalty program almost always means that your purchasing behavior is tracked by the store, and potentially shared with other companies. Further, they track much more than what you buy. Ask a customer service representative at the store exactly what they track.Other things that may be tracked include items you’ve stopped buying, what time you tend to shop, how much you are willing to spend on certain types of items, and how much you spend on certain types of items in a given time period.
For example, they not only know how much alcohol you buy, they also know what type of beer you favor.
Based on your habits, companies are also often able to determine whether you live in an apartment or house, what the average income is in the area where you live, whether you have children, and what type of financial transactions you use.

, The base reasoning for the collection of your data, again, is profit. Companies want to know as much as possible about you and the people in your area to determine what to put in their store and what to charge for it.For instance, if you and others start or stop buying certain products, a supermarket will know whether to carry more or less of it.
Further, some supermarket companies will raise or lower the price of certain goods based on what people in your area are willing to pay.

, Maybe it doesn’t bother you at all that a corporation can build an extensive individual demographic profile about you. In fact, you may even want them too - as they’ll be able to target you with ads and coupons that are more likely to be relevant to you. However, not everyone is comfortable with this lack of privacy.Believe it or not, there is some evidence that supermarkets cater to people’s poor eating habits, weight issues, and even substance use.
At the end of the day, it’s vital that you are both aware of the terms of any program membership you are considering and comfortable with the company’s access to your otherwise quite private information.

, Many supermarket companies will share some of your personal information and purchasing behavior. They may even profit off this data by selling it to other companies. Fortunately, you have the right to find out what information is being collected, how it’s used, and how you can get access to it. Contact the supermarket’s customer service department and ask to see your personal profile.You can also ask that the information be removed from their database, though the company may charge a fee for doing so.
Consider refusing to shop at supermarkets that are unwilling to provide you with the information they are collecting about you through your loyalty program membership.

Recognize why loyalty programs exist.,
Note how much a loyalty program can benefit you.,
Maintain a pragmatic perspective on your loyalty program.",How to Evaluate Supermarket Loyalty Programs3," In order to understand and effectively evaluate a loyalty program, it’s important to acknowledge what it is you’re evaluating. Ultimately, these programs are marketing initiatives undertaken by companies in the interest of increasing their business.Loyalty program marketing initiatives are designed to accomplish two main goals. First, supermarkets want to retain existing customers. Second, they also want to gain new customers.
By offering rewards and other incentives to people that enroll in the loyalty program, businesses increase the likelihood that people will shop at their stores.

, One of the reasons that loyalty programs are so popular is that they do offer their members considerable benefits. Indeed, member-only benefits can help you save money, particularly on certain items. That said, the savings may not be as significant as they seem - and you may wind up with a lower overall grocery bill elsewhere.On the other hand, some may enjoy receiving marketing material according to their buying habits. For instance, you may receive coupons for particular items, such as dog food, on account of your membership in a loyalty program and your purchasing history.

, Aside from increasing customer loyalty, these programs are also designed to foster feelings of goodwill towards the store. In the same way that your dog falls in love with you the more you train them and give them treats, you develop an affinity for a store that gets to keep telling your how much you’re “saving” with them.Further, many reward programs try to increase your spending by offering points or other incentives to spend more.
While you absolutely can wind up saving on something like gas through your loyalty program, spending more to save more doesn’t always add up to actual savings.

Domestic violence shelters also have legal assistance and resources available to help you choose the right restraining order to meet your needs and make sure you've filled out the forms correctly.;
, The Los Angeles Police Department can issue an EPO, which lasts for five court days and provides some relief against the person who's threatening or harassing you.State law requires a judge or court commissioner to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to issue these orders.To qualify for an EPO, there must be reasonable facts that show the person you want to restrain poses an immediate threat of domestic violence to you or your children., You can request one of four types of restraining orders in California, each of which has specific qualifications.Civil harassment restraining orders are the most common. They can be issued by proving any type of violence against you, or a credible threat of violence. You also may be eligible for a civil harassment restraining order if the person is repeatedly annoying, harassing, or stalking you.Domestic violence restraining orders are issued when you are being abused or threatened by someone who is closely related to you, such as a brother or a grandparent, or by someone with whom you have (or used to have) a romantic relationship.If an elderly person is being threatened or physically abused, she may qualify for an elder abuse restraining order. This order also may be issued in cases of financial abuse, abandonment, deprivation, or neglect of an elderly person by someone who was supposed to be taking care of them.The fourth type of restraining order, a workplace violence restraining order, can only be requested by your employer on your behalf. This order protects you if you're being stalked or harassed at your workplace., The type of forms you'll need depends on which type of restraining order you'll be requesting.You might consider consulting an attorney if you're unsure what type of restraining order you need.If you're concerned about the cost of attorney's fees, you may be able to find free or reduced-fee services by contacting a family law self-help center at any nearby courthouse or by speaking with someone at a domestic violence or other women's shelter.
In some situations, for example, you can bypass the temporary restraining order process and simply request a permanent restraining order. An attorney may be best suited to tell you if this applies to you., Each set of forms has a document with instructions for filling them out correctly.


In addition to directing the person to stay a certain distance away from you or not contact you, a restraining order also may require the person to pay child support or participate in counseling.If you're seeking a restraining order against the parent of your child, you also can have custody temporarily established through a restraining order.Basic forms include the request for a restraining order, the notice of court hearing, and the temporary restraining order. You also can fill out additional pages as necessary to describe the person's actions.Depending on the issues in your case, you may need other forms. For example, if you have children and want child support payments included in the order, you also must fill out an income and expense declaration and a simplified financial statement.Keep in mind that you'll be sending a copy of your request to the person you want restrained, so he will be able to read everything you write in your forms. If you don't want that person to know where you live, you can use a state program called Safe at Home, which provides you with a secure address to use on court documents., The court's self-help center and many domestic violence shelters have attorneys who will review your forms free of charge to make sure you've filled them out correctly.You also may be able to get help from the court's family law facilitator. Even if they cannot assist you with your restraining order forms, they should be able to assist you with any child custody and visitation or child support forms you need.You can find courthouses that provide assistance completing forms by visiting http://www.lacourt.org/selfhelp/abuseandharassment/pdf/DomesticViolenceRestrainingOrderLocations.pdf.

, Once you've had your forms reviewed and are satisfied that all the information you've provided is complete and correct, you must sign your forms.


The California courts recommend making five copies. The court will keep your original forms. In addition, you'll need at least one copy for your own records and one for the person you want restrained. The other three copies are for any people other than yourself for whom you're requesting protection., Take your original forms and the copies to the clerk's office to file your request with the judge.In most cases, you won't have to pay a fee to file your request for a restraining order. For example, there is never a fee for a domestic violence restraining order.However, you may have to pay a fee if you're requesting a civil harassment restraining order and stalking, violence, or threats of violence are not part of your claims.If you do have to pay a filing fee and can't afford it, you can ask the clerk for a fee waiver application. You will have to provide information about your income and assets so the court can determine if you qualify for a waiver.Sometimes the judge will want to speak to you when you file your forms, so make sure you're dressed in clean, conservative clothing as though you were appearing in court. Address the judge and all other court staff with courtesy and respect.
Temporary restraining orders are available through the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles.If someone violates a restraining order, those charges are dealt with by the criminal courts. However, restraining orders in Los Angeles are issued by civil family law courts.There are 14 courthouses in Los Angeles County that hear civil cases including requests for restraining orders. You can find the courthouse nearest you by visiting http://www.lacourt.org/courthouse.

, Within 24 hours of the date you filed your request, the judge will review your request and decide whether to issue a temporary restraining order.Your temporary restraining order typically lasts less than one month, or until the date of your hearing for a permanent restraining order.Temporary orders cannot be renewed. If you want the temporary order extended, you must appear at your hearing and get a permanent restraining order., If the judge grants a temporary restraining order, you should take copies to places you frequent such as work or school.


You should keep one copy on your person at all times, and another copy in a safe place. In addition, give copies to security officers or administrators at your school, your workplace, or anywhere else the person has been ordered not to go.Restraining orders also are entered into a state database so the information is available to law enforcement officers throughout the state., The restrained person must have legal notice that you have requested a restraining order against him.


You can have the person served by having the temporary restraining order delivered to him along with a copy of your request and the notice of hearing.The judge will write a deadline on your papers, which will depend on when your hearing is scheduled. You must have the restrained person served by that date.Any person other than yourself can deliver these papers to the person. You also may have a sheriff's deputy serve the papers. In some cases, you can get a law enforcement officer to serve your papers for you for free. Otherwise you'll have to pay a fee. The clerk will be able to tell you if a fee is required in your situation., Once the restrained person is served, the person who completed the service must fill out and file the proof of service with the court so the judge knows the person has sufficient notice of the hearing.


Make five copies of the proof of service, then file the original and copies with the clerk of court before your hearing. You must bring at least one file-stamped copy with you to your permanent order hearing.The court cannot make your temporary order permanent until there is proof that the restrained person was legally served and had adequate notice of the permanent order hearing.If you are unable to have the restrained person served by the deadline, you can ask the judge to set a new court date and extend your temporary restraining order so you have more time to complete service., Get ready for your hearing by gathering any documents, witnesses, or other information you have to support your request.


If other people have seen the restrained person's abuse or harassment, you can bring those people with you to testify on your behalf about the person's conduct.You also may have witnesses to testify as to how the restrained person made you feel, or about the fact that you are threatened and frightened.If you have any documents you intend to use as evidence, such as threatening voice mail messages or emails, make copies of those that you can bring with you to the courthouse. Since you typically won't be allowed to bring your cell phone into the courtroom, if you have anything saved on your phone you should make physical copies.
Other documents that might help prove the abusive or threatening conduct include photos, damaged property, and medical or police reports.You also need to bring at least one copy of every document you've filed in your case along with you. Organize and label your documents so you can find what you need quickly without disrupting the court., You must attend your hearing to make your temporary restraining order permanent.


Most restraining order hearings take place in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, located at 111 North Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles.At your permanent order hearing, you have the opportunity to present your case to the judge. The person you want the court to restrain will be able to present his case as well. Both you and the other person can call witnesses or submit evidence.
If the other person has witnesses, you will be allowed to cross-examine them. Any witnesses you bring with you will be subject to cross-examination as well., If the judge grants your permanent restraining order, you should keep a copy for your own records and make additional copies for any other protected people or to distribute at places such as work or school were the restrained person is not permitted.


The judge may make her decision immediately after hearing both sides present, or may decide to review the evidence submitted again before issuing her final decision in writing.Typically the restraining order will prohibit the restrained person from having any contact with you or coming within a certain distances of your home, school, or workplace.Your permanent order may last between one and five years, and can be renewed."

Make a plan to pay off your card.",How to Apply for a Credit Card Balance Transfer," A balance transfer credit card is one that will take a transfer from an old credit card, which is the only way you can use one credit card to pay off another. However, you want to get the best deal you can on your new credit card.Look for 0 percent or low APR rates. These types of credit cards have an introductory rate that is very good, which can allow you to pay off your debt without interest.
Pay attention to how long the introductory rate lasts. By law, it must last 6 months, but many companies will push it to a year or a year and a half. You want the longest period you can find.
Check whether the introductory rate is applied to just the transfer or new purchases as well.One way to compare cards is to use a credit card comparing site, such as Credit Karma.;
, The interest rate isn't the only thing you need to look at. You may also be slapped with a transfer fee or an annual fee. In addition, you may have to make a minimum monthly payment or be charged a fee. All of these aspects contribute to how good the card is.Also, consider the rates after the introductory period is up. While it's best to pay it off if you can, you don't want to be paying exorbitant rates if you aren't able to pay it off in time., Often, the best deals are offered to those with the best credit. If you have a credit score of 750 or above, you'll get the best deals. Below that, you may still get a good deal, but not as good as someone with better credit.In other words, you need to make sure that you adjust your expectations. You may not get the first offer you see, or you may be offered something less.
On the other hand, paying off some of your debt may help to improve your rating.

, When looking at credit cards, most will have a specific limit, though often that is based on your credit rating as well. Nonetheless, you need to make sure that your new card will be able to accept all the debt from your old card and still fall under the limit, along with any transfer fees., Once you pick a credit card, find the application on that company's website. If you're using a credit card comparison site, it will often have a ""Apply Now"" button that will take you to the application on the credit card company's site., You will need to fill in some basic biographical information, such as your name, your address, date of birth, and your Social Security number. You'll also need other contact information, such as your phone number and email.The credit card company needs to make sure you are you, so no one else is able to take out a card in your name. It's also to stop one person from taking out multiple cards under different names.
In addition, this information gives them what they need to check your credit score.

, You also need to fill in your financial information. For instance, you will need to offer your annual income. You will also need to fill in where that income comes from, such as employment or student income., Most applications will have a place to check if you want to transfer balances. When you transfer balances, you'll need to put in the information for your old credit card so the new company knows who to contact to transfer balances., Once you have all your information on the form, it's time to submit the application. Check it over one more time to make sure you have everything correct, as you don't want to have to correct any mistakes later, then hit the button., Often, you will get an instant offer from the company, meaning you will be approved or not approved within 5 minutes of hitting the button. However, keep in mind that even if you are approved, you may not get the rate you hoped for.If you don't like the rate, you can choose not to activate the card or call and cancel the application. Then, you can apply to a different card.
However, if you apply to too many credit cards in a short period, it can affect your credit rating., Once the transfer is complete, contact your old credit card company to make sure the card is closed down. You want to avoid unwanted charges, service fees, and member fees. Of course, you'll need to pay off any remaining balances first, such as any interest fees that happened in the time you were transferring.


Another option is to keep the old account open, but to only make small charges on it. Each month, pay it off completely. This process can help improve your credit rating., There's no point in transferring your card if you can't pay at least part of it off during the period you have a good rate. Look at how much you owe, and divide it between the months you have on the good rate. Try to make that payment each month to pay off the card.In addition, your new card will likely require you to make monthly payments, so make sure you are at least paying the minimum.

Obviously, granting another person access to your finances is a major decision so you should know the pros and cons before beginning the process.


Adding someone to your credit card account has many advantages. If someone cannot apply for a credit card on their own due to poor financial history, it may enable them to build a credit score depending on the credit card issuer or help them learn how to manage money if they are paying you back each month. You can make sure someone has money available in the event of an emergency. Having one credit card account is often more convenient than creating multiple ones.Adding someone to your credit card has its drawbacks as well. There is added liability, as you're legally responsible for all actions an authorized user takes. Any missed payments or credit score damages affect the both of you. Shared accounts have also lead to strained relationships between users, as blame comes into play if there are issues with payments.;
, When you add someone to your credit card, they're either a joint account holder or an authorized user. The responsibilities and rights of this person change greatly depending on their status.


An authorized user is entitled to use the credit card issued to the card's holder but have no financial responsibility when it comes to paying back any accrued loans.Joint account holders share ownership of the account and have as much liability when it comes to repaying the debt as the original card holder.You must make a decision, depending on the financial situation of both parties involved, whether the person you're adding will be a joint account holder or an authorized user.

, Many people wonder, when adding someone to their credit card, how and if this action will affect your credit score. This is information you should understand before making any decisions.


Credit reports generally don't supply information on authorized users. Adding a user in and of itself should not affect your credit score. However, you are responsible for any charges this person makes. If the new authorized user abuses their privileges, you could end up with large debts you are not able to pay. This will affect your score.The new user's credit score will actually be affected more directly. If the credit card issuer reports authorized users, the account will appear on their credit report and their credit score can change for better or for worse depending on your financial history.When you add a joint account holder, both parties will appear on each individual's credit report. Much like adding an authorized user, this will not affect your credit score in and of itself. However, a joint account holder cannot be easily removed from the account if there are outstanding charges. Your credit report might be affected more severely due to the potential longevity of any damage done., Many people are surprised to know that, with the necessary information, anyone can be added as an authorized user on a bank account. However, adding someone to your account gives them access to your finances and that puts you in an incredibly vulnerable position. It is not recommended you add anyone if you have not firmly established a personal or professional relationship with that person.


You should select someone you can fully trust or someone who is as invested on keeping the account's integrity intact as you are.The majority of authorized user relationships are couples, parent/child, and employer/employee.Remember, the more established your relationship with the person the better., Most of the time, you can add authorized users over the phone or online. Bank policies do vary and your specific bank might have special requirements depending on your circumstances.


Call your bank and ask them how to add a user. Some banks can do this over the phone or online, but you may have to go in to discuss the issue in person or fill out a paper application.Any questions you have should be addressed with the bank. Ask them how to remove an authorized user or joint account holder and what your exact financial responsibilities are in regards to the card's use. Remember, you're taking a risk by giving someone access to your finances. You should go in with as much information as possible., Make sure you have all the information necessary before attempting to add the user. Most banks require the following information to add a user to your account:


The user's name
Their date of birth
Their social security numberYour bank might want other information depending on their policies. Check their requirements beforehand to make sure you have everything you need before setting things up.

, Once you've added someone to your account, you need to lay out concrete rules for the card's use to avoid misunderstandings that lead to tensions between users. It's a good idea to put agreements in writing and have both parties sign and date to avoid misunderstandings later.


Explain your requirements in terms of charges and payment. Do you expect this person to adhere to certain spending limits? How much money, if any, are they expected to pay when the bill comes? These are issues you should work through early on.When can they use the card? Some people expect their credit card to be for emergencies only while others are okay with charging rent and groceries to the card. Decide when the card can be used and for what purposes.
If a a rule is broken, how will you proceed? Is there anything the new user might do that would lead you to remove them from the account? Be clear about your comfort zone in terms of the card's use and when and why you might cut them off.

, What if someone overspends or refuses to pay up? You should have a game plan in place ahead of time if any issues arise.


It's possible to set up account alerts through your bank so you will be informed of any worrisome situations. If you have any concerns with the new user, this might be a good idea.If someone refuses payment, what will you do? Will you pursue legal action or simply remove them from the account and move forward? Depending on a variety of factors, such as your relationship with the new user, you need to have a plan in effect if anything goes awry.

, Do not simply let communication drop off once the account is set up. Make sure dialogue about the card's use is an ongoing matter.


It's helpful for some people to schedule occasional sit-downs to talk about how and when the card is being used. If there are any disagreements, they can be talked out roughly once a month to avoid tensions from building.Any potential changes, such as the card's spending limit, should also be discussed. Open communication is key to avoiding animosity between you and the card's new user., If problems keep occurring, you might decide it's best to remove a user from your account.


The procedure for removing an authorized user vary from bank to bank, but most places require a phone call or a written request. While most banks are either/or, some banks do require a phone call and a follow up request in writing.Removing a joint account holder can take more time, especially if you're not the primary account holder. While this can occasionally be done in writing or with a phone call, a sit down meeting with the bank is often needed. Ask your bank about removing a joint account holder to find out their specific requirements."

You can get the order if your abuser is one of the following:your spouse or ex-spouse
someone who lived together with you in the same household (including a roommate)
someone you dated or were engaged to
someone related by blood or marriage to you (for example, siblings, parents, and in-laws)
someone you have a child with;
, This is another type of order that is available if you don’t qualify for an “abuse prevention” order. To get a harassment prevention order, you must meet at least one of the following requirements:the abuser has committed three or more willful and malicious acts against you which were intended to cause you fear, abuse, intimidation, or property damage
the abuser at least one time caused you to involuntarily have sex through the use of force, threats, or duress

, You can get either type of protective order by stopping into the nearest court and asking for the forms. The clerk should give you everything that you need. You can also download instructions which walk you step-by-step through completing your forms.If you are in immediate danger and court is closed, then go to your local police station. They can help you get an “emergency protective order” by contacting a judge over the telephone. This emergency order is good only until the close of the next business day.For example, if you are in immediate danger on Saturday, then your emergency order is good until the close of business on Monday.

, Once you get all of the forms, you should go through each one and provide all requested information. Print neatly using black ink so that the information is legible.


You should provide specific details about the abuse on the Affidavit.Don’t use general language like “He scares me.” Instead, explain exactly what the abuser has done.
You also need to describe the defendant so that the sheriff can identify him or her and serve notice of the restraining order.

, At the same time that you apply for the restraining order, you can also request child support. There is a form for you to fill out, which the clerk should give to you along with the other forms.

, When you apply for a restraining order, you are really applying for two: a temporary order, which lasts only 10 days, and then a final restraining order. The judge can grant the first without hearing from the abuser, but you need to schedule a hearing on your request for a final restraining order. Ask the court clerk how to schedule the hearing.


Your abuser will have a chance to come into court and argue that a final restraining order is not necessary. You have to give him or her notice of the hearing so that they can come and fight the restraining order, if they wish., After you complete all of the forms, make several copies.

Review it to make sure all of the information is correct.Even if the judge does not grant you a temporary restraining order, you can still schedule a hearing for a final restraining order.

, You need to give the abuser notice that he or she has been restrained. At the same time, you need to notify them of the “10 day hearing” which will be held to determine if you can get a final restraining order. Generally, you can have the local sheriff hand deliver notice on the abuser.


Depending on the court, the judge will send the information to the sheriff or you will have to take it to the sheriff. Ask the clerk.Service on the abuser should be free.

, Before the judge can make your temporary restraining order final, there needs to be a hearing. At the hearing, you need to convince the judge that the restraining order is necessary. You should try to bring as much evidence of the abuse as possible:Color photographs of injuries or property damage. If you have recently been attacked, then take color photographs as soon as possible. Also find photographs of any attacks in the past or of property damage.
Medical records. If you went to the hospital for medical treatment, then get copies of your medical records which show your injuries.
Police reports. If you called the police about an abusive incident, then you can get copies of your police report.
Witnesses. Ask anyone who witnessed the abuse if they would go to the hearing with you. If they can’t, then ask them to swear to an affidavit in which they describe the abuse.
Examples of threats. Bring copies of emails or voice mail messages which contain threats from the abuser.

, You have the right to a lawyer’s assistance during your hearing. If you think that the abuser will challenge child custody, then you should certainly consult with a lawyer.


You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.If money is tight, then you might qualify for legal aid. There are many legal aid organizations in the state which provide free legal services to low-income people. A list is available at the Womenslaw.org website., You don’t want to be late for your hearing, so make sure to give yourself plenty of time to find parking and to go through courthouse security. Make sure to turn off your cell phones and any other electronic devices before entering court.

, You can go first at the hearing. Tell the judge in your own words why you need the restraining order. Also tell the judge what evidence you have brought with you to support your allegations.


For example, you might say, “Darren most recently attacked me two weeks ago, on June 14. My neighbor, Mrs. Caswell, saw him strike me and called the police. I have Mrs. Caswell here as a witness and also a copy of the police report.”

, The person you want restrained will be able to present his or her side of the story.As they talk, you need to stand quietly and listen. This can be difficult. They may lie or say mean things about you.


You will have a chance to respond. Don’t interrupt or raise your hand and ask to speak.
Instead, wait until the abuser finishes and then ask, “May I respond, Your Honor?”

, If the judge grants the restraining order, then he or she should sign it there in court. You can get a copy from the court clerk. Make sure to try and get two or more copies.


Check whether or not you are responsible for arranging service of the restraining order on the abuser. The court might handle that or you may have to arrange service with the sheriff.

, If the abuser tries to get in touch with you, then you can show the police your copy of the restraining order. This will help them understand the situation much faster. Tuck a copy of the order in your purse or in your wallet.You should immediately contact the court clerk if you lose your copy of the order. Request another.

, You should also distribute copies of the restraining order to the following people, all of whom need to know that the abuser is prohibited from contacting you and your children:security guards at the front desk of your apartment or job
your children’s school or daycare
a neighbor or close friend who looks out for you
anyone else who is named in the order (such as a parent)

, Restraining orders are mandatory. They tell the abuser exactly what he or she can’t do. If the abuser violates the restraining order, then you should call the police or visit the police station.If you have an abuse prevention order, then the police will arrest the defendant.

, Violation of a court order is “contempt,” and a judge can punish the abuser for failing to follow the restraining order. You will need to get a form from the court clerk and file it in order to bring a contempt proceeding. The punishments for contempt can be severe:The judge can fine the abuser up to $5,000.
The judge could put the abuser in prison for up to two and a half years.
The court may also order that the abuser attend substance abuse treatment programs or other programs.

, Generally, a long-term restraining order lasts only up to one year, unless the judge stated otherwise. You can get an extension by contacting the court. You will probably have to appear before the judge for another hearing.By contrast, if you want to get back into contact with the abuser, then you need to ask the court to dissolve the restraining order, otherwise the person could be punished for having contact with you.

A finance charge is what allows credit card companies and lenders to make a profit off of you. It's more or less a fee charged for the use of your credit card. Finance charges on credit cards are usually flat rates, as opposed to finance charges on mortgages and cars, which have ranges that depend on a person's credit score.A finance charges is the total cost of borrowing, including interest, fees, and any other charges the borrower pays.Knowing the finance charge of your credit card can help you budget better and determine how much money you're really saving with a particular credit card.;

The methods require a different means of calculation. The name of the methods your creditors use should be listed somewhere on your monthly statement. You need to identify the method before you proceed to calculate your score., A variety of numbers go into each equation for calculating a finance charge. Before you sit down and being punching numbers into your calculator, make sure you know the following information:


The outstanding balance on your credit card. That is, the total amount you owe.The number of days in each billing cycle.
Please note, that depending on the method your bank uses you may need to calculate new purchases into your outstanding balance and not just go off of whatever's written on your bill.

Before you hire a particular company, make sure you do your research. Start by contacting your state attorney general and local consumer protection agency to ask about the company's reputation. These entities will help you determine whether the company you are looking at is reputable and trustworthy. In addition, perform a simple internet search by typing in the company's name plus the word ""complaints."" Read what other people are saying about the company.


If you decide to hire a debt settlement company, they will charge you a fee for their services, which includes maintaining an account for the settlement money. The other portion of the fee will be calculated as a percentage of the amount you save because of the settlement.;
, While hiring a debt settlement company might seem like an easy choice, there are risks. For example, these companies often require you to put money aside each month, for up to 36 months, in a dedicated account, which is managed by a third party. For a lot of people, it can be difficult to set this type of money aside for this long. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the debt settlement company will be able to negotiate a settlement successfully. To try and get some money for their work, they might settle for much less than you would like. Furthermore, these companies often ask you to stop making regular credit card payments, which will negatively affect your credit report.


Before you hire a debt settlement company, make sure you can minimize the risks by budgeting well and requiring a reasonable settlement., Some debt settlement companies run illegal practices to try and get money from you. Avoid doing business with companies that:Charge fees before they settle your case
Guarantee success
Promise that debt collectors and lawyers will stop contacting you
Guarantee the type of deal they can get (e.g., they will settle for five cents on the dollar)

, If you are wary of hiring a debt settlement company, consider talking with a reputable credit counselor. These individuals will discuss your entire financial situation in an attempt to help you budget and manage debt. Credit counselors will also be able to give you educational materials and workshop offerings. Most initial consultations will last about an hour and you will usually have the opportunity to follow up when necessary.To find a reputable credit counselor, visit the U.S. Trustee Program website and pick from their list of government-approved organizations., If you are facing large debts and possible illegal collection practices, you might consider hiring a lawyer to help you negotiate. As trained professionals, lawyers specializing in credit card debt and collections will know who to talk to and how to talk to them. They will help you prepare, negotiate, and finalize a settlement. To hire a lawyer, ask your friends and family for recommendations.


If you cannot get a quality recommendation, contact your local bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few questions about your legal problem, you will be put in contact with various qualified lawyers in your area.

, While it may seem backwards, credit card companies are more likely to settle when the debts are large. This is the case because they recognize the chance that they will recoup nothing if you file for bankruptcy or ignore the debt. When credit card debts are smaller, bankruptcy does not hover over the case and it is easier for you to pay back the full amount you owe., Credit card companies settle debts regularly using generally accepted arrangements. While it is not impossible to negotiate a more unique settlement it may prove difficult.Most credit card companies settle in the following manners:Moving payment dates
Reducing interest rates
Payment reductions
Forbearance (not making any payments for a period of time)
Lump sum payments, which is a one time payment in exchange for the credit card company's debt forgiveness
Repayment plans, which are usually based on your income and expenses

, Negotiations take many forms and each form will affect the way you negotiate. If you only have one credit card with this particular company you want to negotiate with, it will likely be a one time negotiation where you will not have to interact with the company ever again once the settlement has been reached and fulfilled. However, if you have more than one credit card with this company, or if the settlement you reach is going to create a long-term relationship with the company, you might have to negotiate differently. Recognizing the type of negotiation likely to take place will help you determine how to approach the negotiation.For example, if the negotiation is likely a one time thing, you might be able to negotiate more aggressively, which might in turn harm relationships. However, if you will need to work with the credit card company again, you might not want to be aggressive and harm those relationships. Think about these things as you assess your negotiation tactics.

, During most negotiations, conflicts arise in two different ways. First, agreement conflicts arise when your position is in direct conflict with the credit card company's beliefs and opinions. Second, allocation of resources conflicts arise when two parties cannot agree on how something will be split up. During some negotiations you may only see one type of conflict, while in others you might have a combination of both. Understanding how conflicts arise and the form they take will help you prepare and focus your negotiation tactics.In the credit card debt context, these types of conflict can arise in the following ways:


Agreement conflicts might arise when you believe your payment date should be pushed back but the credit card company has a policy of not doing so.
Allocation of resources conflicts might arise when you believe the debt should be settled for a certain dollar amount with no interest included, while the credit card company believes you should pay more to have your debt relieved, which should include interest.

, Ask yourself whether you are negotiated because you have to or because you see an opportunity. If you are negotiating because you have to, you will likely have less power throughout the negotiation process. On the other hand, if you are negotiating because you see an opportunity, you might have more power at the table and you might be willing to walk away without an agreement.For example, if you are negotiating a reduced interest rate because you heard about a friend's rate on the same credit card, you are negotiating because you see an opportunity. In this scenario, you can be more aggressive and concede less, because you do not feel the pressure of having to come to an agreement.
However, if you are negotiating a lump sum settlement because you can no longer make credit card payments, you will most likely be negotiating out of necessity. Here, you may have to concede more to the credit card company because you feel obligated to come to an agreement.

, You need to evaluate possible settlements against the alternatives of not reaching an agreement with the credit card company. Ask yourself what your best option is if you do not reach a settlement. The best alternative you can think of is called your BATNA. For example, if you do not reach a settlement regarding your credit card debt, you might file for bankruptcy or take out a loan to pay off the debt. These alternatives are possible BATNAs.


The value of your BATNA will help you determine your reservation price, which is the most you would pay, or the least you would take, to make a deal during negotiations. For example, if your BATNA is filing for bankruptcy, the cost of bankruptcy should be determined. Assume that cost is $10,000 plus the loss of certain assets (e.g., cars and homes).
Once you know the cost of your BATNA, you will be able to evaluate any settlement offer against it. You should reach a settlement so long as it is better than your BATNA. However, if a settlement offer puts you in a worse position than you would be in if you accepted your BATNA, you should not agree to it. For example, if the credit card company offers to relieve your debt but in exchange you will have to pay $15,000 and give up your home, you might walk away and implement your BATNA., The more options you put together while you are preparing, the more options you will have during the negotiation process. While most credit card companies stick to traditional settlement methods (e.g., lump sum payments and repayment plans) you should not constrain yourself to those methods. The goal in any negotiation is to find a deal that benefits both parties. Here, you want to relieve your debt for as little as possible and the credit card company wants to recoup as much money as possible.


Write down as many ideas as you can think of. Do not worry about whether the credit card company is likely to accept it, or whether you think the idea is crazy. When considering ideas, think about your interests as well as the credit card company's interests.For example, if your interest is to relieve credit card debt, consider unique ways you can do that. Obviously you can pay in cash, but maybe you can pay with property or services as well (e.g., extra cars or homes you have, or maybe you can work for the credit card company to repay your debt if you have a skill they need).

, Make sure you know the names of credit card company employees who are authorized to negotiate and make binding decisions about your debt. Avoid negotiating with low-level employees who will need to get approval from managers. Often, these employees will not know what is and is not appropriate, and you may waste your time.Before starting formal negotiations, contact the credit card company and ask who you need to speak to to negotiate a settlement. Talk with them briefly and make sure they are authorized to make decisions. If they are, get their contact information so you can set up a time to negotiate after you prepare.

, Also, if you have hired a lawyer to help you, their legal fees may increase as more time is spent negotiating. Incorporate these thoughts into your preparation. For example, if you think negotiations will take a long time, ask the credit card company up front to freeze your account so you are not incurring extra debt during the negotiation period. In addition, make sure your lawyer is working diligently so you avoid unnecessary legal fees.

, Most credit card companies will want to negotiate over the phone unless you are conveniently located where their offices are. Remote negotiations are often favored when two parties do not like each other, while face-to-face negotiations are helpful when parties don't know each other.


If you and the credit card company have decided to negotiate face-to-face, you will have to work out where the negotiation will be held. If you have hired a lawyer, they might want to conduct negotiations at their office. This might be a power play meant to influence and rattle the credit card company.
However, especially if you are negotiating on your own behalf, you might have to meet the credit card company at their own office. This might not be a bad thing, however, as it allows you to get an idea of where they work and the culture in which they work. This information can then be used to help you negotiate., Silence can often be used to your advantage. Most people will try to fill dead air by speaking and rambling on. This will often lead to the credit card company divulging information advantageous to you. Instead of speaking aimlessly, ask pointed questions in order to gather information that can help you find a solution., When the credit card company says something you disagree with, look disgusted and offended. These actions will impress upon the company that you are not willing to play around and that you need a reasonable solution. In addition, if you make a big deal out of issues that you do not necessarily care about, you may confuse the credit card company and concede them later without giving much up., While you might think its advantageous to let the credit card company make the first offer, this is not always the case. In fact, the first offer is usually the focal point (a.k.a., anchor) of the rest of negotiations, so when you make the first offer, you are actually controlling how the negotiation proceeds. However, if the first offer you make is not well informed, you may alienate the credit card company and risk not coming to a settlement at all.


If you plan on making the first offer, make an offer that can be backed up with ample supporting evidence. Doing so will allow you to control what happens next., Offer the credit card company choices. By doing so, you will learn about what the other side values. Based on the reaction you get to each offer, you can shuffle them and throw out new options. Your flexibility will also be seen as a sign of goodwill.For example, offer a lump sum payment as well as a forbearance option. If the credit card company doesn't like the forbearance option, throw it out and offer a repayment plan. In this simple sequence of events, you will have shown that you are flexible while learning that the credit card company really wants to get some money quickly (because forbearance would require them to freeze the account for a period of time before they ever receive any money).

, As negotiations proceed, continue to make quality counteroffers without giving up too much. In fact, if the credit card company makes the first offer, consider countering with what would have been your first offer anyway. This will help you avoid the anchor of the first offer., If you are having trouble finding a solution, consider telling the credit card company what your BATNA is.However, do not simply say ""this is my best alternative."" Instead, tell the credit card company that you are looking at other options but that you would really like to come to an agreement. In the credit card company context, this can be incredibly persuasive when your BATNA is bankruptcy.


This is the case because, if you file for bankruptcy and the credit card debt is unsecured, the credit card company might not recoup any of their losses if the bankruptcy court forgives that particular debt. If you tell the credit card company you are looking at bankruptcy, they will usually work diligently to get a little money back from you.

, Even if the credit card company's initial offer is good, do not simply accept it. See what concessions can be made and come back to their first offer if you have to., If you and the credit card company reach an agreement, figure out who will formalize it in a writing. In general, especially if you have the help of a lawyer, you will want to be responsible for drafting. When you draft, you control the terms and the language of the agreement.


However, bigger credit card companies will have forms and templates that they use. They may request that you agree to the language that they have used for years. If you are not represented by a lawyer, this might be your only option.

, If you are able to draft the agreement, make sure you include everything that was discussed during negotiations. Do not leave out any details, no matter how small. In general, your agreement should cover at least the following:


The amount of your agreement (e.g., how much you will have to pay and how much debt is being forgiven in return for your payment).
Any deadlines for lump sum payments and repayment plans.
A description of the debt that is being forgiven and an unambiguous statement that the agreement, if executed, will forgive that debt fully and completely.
A description of how the credit card company will report the debt to credit reporting agencies. This language can affect your credit report and you should hopefully get the credit card company to agree to state it was ""paid"" as opposed to ""paid late"" or ""settled.""

, At the end of the agreement, make sure you leave space for each party to sign the agreement and date it. There should be room for each party to print their name, sign their name, and write in the date it was signed.

, As one final step, you need to get the credit card company to sign the agreement. Make sure that whoever signs it has the authority to do so and bind the company. You will also need to sign the agreement in order for it to be executed.

Talk to your creditors.",How to Manage Your Credit Cards," Credit cards and charge cards both allow you to charge purchases to the card and pay for it later. However, this is where their similarities end. Where credit cards allow you a certain credit limit, charge cards have no set limit. Credit cards allow you to carry a balance between months and pay interest on that balance, but charge cards require that the month's charges be repaid in full at the end of each month., Credit cards charge interest on balance not paid in full at the end of the month. So, for example, if you charged $1000 to your card during a month and then only paid $500 by the payment date, you would owe interest on the remaining $500 balance. Interest rates charged vary from 0 percent to upwards of 30 percent, depending on your specific card agreement.

Interest charges continue to accrue on your balance for each month that it goes unpaid, so it is always advisable to pay off your card as quickly as possible., Your credit card use will be governed by your card agreement, which spells out what you will need to pay and when. It will also specify any additional fees. Look out for your minimum required payment each period, which is the lowest amount you can pay each month without the issuer recognizing a late payment.

You should also look at your cash withdrawal options. This allows you to get cash using your credit card if you need it, but can come with additional fees and interest charges.
There will also likely be a fee assessed for a late payment., You credit card terms may also include provisions for earning rewards based on your use of the card. These are often a small percentage of the amount that you charge to the card and subsequently pay off. Rewards can be used for airline miles, free items, or cash, depending on your specific card agreement. However, there will be specific rules governing the accumulation and use of these rewards that you need to make note of., A credit card can have a major impact on your credit score. On the positive side, a properly-used and paid-off credit card can increase a person's credit score. This benefit increases as you continue to use the card properly over time. However, if used incorrectly, it can wreak havoc on a good credit score. Credit reporting agencies penalize credit card users for late payments, high balances relative to credit limits (usually starting at over 30 percent), and defaulted accounts., Many institutions issue credit cards. This includes banks, finance companies, and retailers. Your choice of issuer will largely depend on the nature of the card itself, but the choice of issuer can be important in some cases. For example, it may be easier to organize your payments or online banking if you get a credit card at a bank where you are an existing customers.

In addition, if you spend a lot of money each month at the same store, and that store has a credit card that rewards you for shopping there, it may make sense to get that card.

, Your credit score will affect what types of card you are able to qualify for, your credit limit, your interest rate, and other terms. Check your credit score before applying for cards so you know what to expect. Understand that you may not qualify for a credit card at all if your credit is very low (under 600). You may also be denied for credit cards if you are carrying too much debt or do not earn enough income., Most credit cards are unsecured, meaning that you don't make a deposit to use the account. However, those with poor credit may only qualify for a secured card, which requires a deposit. This deposit is typically about $200. You can then charge up to that limit on the card each month. This can help those with poor credit build it back up.

The money is returned to you when you upgrade to a regular card or close the account (assuming you don't have an outstanding balance)., Use a site like NerdWallet or CreditCards.com to compare different cards from the various issuers. Make sure you enter your credit score so you'll know which cards you have a chance of qualifying for. Look for the lowest interest rates possible if you plan to carry a balance between months. If you plan to pay off the card each month, look for a card with good benefits and rewards., As you look through credit card terms, remember to also look for any associated fees. For example, many credit cards have annual fees. Some may also have initial fees that must be paid when you get the card. In addition, note any other fees that are mentioned. Your goal should be to get the card that is going to cost you the least amount of money to use., Finding the right kind of rewards perks on a credit card makes for a better deal, but there’s no one-size-fits-all reward card for everyone. It depends on your spending habits and lifestyle choices.If you travel a lot, an airline rewards card might be best for you. Some cards give cash back and others give points you can swap out for various goods and services. There are a lot of sites where you can go to view and compare the rewards rates for different cards, but Nerdwallet has a lot of great articles on the subject.
Make sure you pay off your balance at the end of each month to get the full value from your rewards. Otherwise, they end up going toward making interest payments.

, A lot of cards have benefits most people are unaware of, especially in the context of traveling. Many credit cards offer rental car insurance (so you don’t have to buy the extra from the rental company), trip cancellation insurance, among other benefits such as fraud and identity theft protection., When you've found a great credit card, follow the links to apply for it. You'll have to enter a large amount of personal information and then the issuer will check your credit score and other details. These will be used to accept or reject your application. If you are accepted, you will receive your credit limit and account information, along with instructions on how to receive and activate your card., Although most people call them “chip cards,” they’re technically called EMVs, (which stands for Europay, Mastercard, and Visa). These cards contain computer chips within the card itself. That makes it much harder to counterfeit, making it more secure.Your bank or card issuer will probably send you an EMV card without you even having to ask. But you might be able to speed up the process by making a specific request.

, When you were accepted for your card, you should have gotten an estimated arrival time for your credit card. Be sure to watch out for it in the mail and take it inside as soon as you get it. This will help prevent any would-be credit card thieves., You'll receive a written card agreement when you get your card. Be sure to read over the agreement carefully. Then, store your card agreement in a safe place in case you need to refer to it later., Just because you have a new chip card doesn’t mean you’re in the clear with respect to fraud. You still need to cover the PIN pad up when you complete a debit or ATM transaction, investigate any online merchants you deal with, and only conduct e-commerce transactions on secured sites (sites with the ""https"" prefix).Your PIN number should be as secure as possible. Don't use your birthday or something else that a thief might easily guess.
While EMV cards are more resistant to skimmers (devices that steal your card information) than magnetic strip cards, nothing is ever foolproof. Right now, using your card as debit is a little more dangerous than using a card as credit, because of PIN overlay devices that can capture PIN numbers. , This will help prevent overspending. While no one wants to overspend, it's very easy to do where credit cards are concerned. In order to avoid getting in over your head, try not to charge more in one month than you can easily go without.


For example, if you spend $300 a month on restaurant meals, it should be fairly easy for you to charge $300 on your credit card for the month and then make up the shortfall by cutting back on eating out.
However, you can and should use a credit card for business expenses that are reimbursed each month, emergencies, and assets that will last longer than the time required to pay them off.

, Look over your credit score each month to check that your charges match your own records. Note any charges you don't remember and try to locate receipts or an explanation of that charge. If you find that there are charges you did not authorize, contact your issuer to dispute the charge. Most credit card issuers are happy to help resolve these issues., Late payments are the easiest way to hurt your credit score. They make up about 35% of your credit score—the largest single factor. So do whatever you can to stay on top of them.Set up an automatic payment scheme with your bank so your credit card bill is automatically drafted out of your checking account each month.

, Try to pay more than the minimum if you are able. This will keep your balance and interest charges low. Making the minimum payment on a credit card is the easiest way there is to never pay off the debt. While it is an easier short-term financial burden, you can end up paying many times more than you would have over the long run. Even if you just pay a little bit more than the minimum, it makes a lot of difference.

, If you use and pay your card responsibly, you will start to build up the trust of your credit card issuer. In time, perhaps after a few years, you can try contacting the issuer to negotiate a more favorable card agreement. For example, you might ask for a lower interest rate, a reduced annual fee, or a higher credit limit. If you've been a good customer, the issuer might grant your request., If your debt becomes unmanageable, it may help to transfer your balances to one card. By choosing the card with the lowest interest rate, you save yourself money when you're paying off your balance. Even though a lot of balance transfers can come with fees (but some don’t), it’s still usually worth it to switch to a card with a lower interest rate, because most people who are looking to transfer a balance won’t pay the balance off quickly enough to lose money from the transfer fee. Again, Nerdwallet is a pretty good source to find a lot of balance transfer offers all in one place.
Be sure to avoid using your card until the debt is paid down or off.

, The best way to stop your debt from accumulating is to stop using your credit card. An old trick to stop yourself from doing so is to freeze your credit card in a block of ice. This will literally prevent you from using it until the ice melts, giving you time to rethink your purchase before making it. This is also useful if you intend to only use your credit card for rare circumstances, as it makes access much more difficult., Before you get too far behind, it’s important to talk with your creditors to let them know your situation. They may be able to work out a payment plan, a refinance, or just give you a little extra time to get current. If you’re a long-time customer who makes payments on time, you can often negotiate with your card issuer for better deals. Ask them to waive annual fees, raise your credit limit, or lower your interest rate. Even if you have missed payments before, it never hurts to ask. They’d often rather keep an imperfect customer than lose the same customer to a competitor.

Understand the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA).,
Meet the FCBA guidelines.,
Contact the merchant.,
Call your credit card company.,
Get information about the credit card company's investigation.",How to Cancel a Credit Card Payment1," The FCBA provides legal protections when you make credit card purchases. This act protects the cardholder if the goods or services purchased are of poor quality. Under certain conditions, you can withhold payment for the purchase. Your credit card company will investigate the matter while the payment is withheld., The FCBA has several criteria that must be met before a credit card payment can be withheld. The purchase must be for $50 or more. The merchant must operate in your state or within 100 miles of your home. You must also make a good faith effort to correct the problem with the merchant.

, There are several sources you can check to find out about the merchant's returns and refund process. Start by calling the location or the accessing website where you made the purchase. Have your receipt and credit card information when you call.


Explain that you want to return items and obtain a refund. Ask the merchant how that process works. Note that some merchants may have restocking charges that might apply. Be sure to understand circumstances in which this charge applies.
If you purchased physical merchandise, you will probably have to return it before the merchant will give you a refund. Make sure that you're clear about how to return the items.
When you return the purchased goods, keep some type of documentation. If you visit the store, ask for a returned merchandise form. Keep the shipping receipt, if you ship items back. In some cases, the merchant may pay the shipping costs.
A merchant should promptly refund your money once they receive the items you purchased. Ask for documentation of the credit card refund. In many cases, the refund information can be emailed to you.
Use the merchant's refund information to verify that the dollars were credited back to your credit card account. Check your card account online, or review the next statement to confirm the credit.

, If the merchant is not willing to refund your purchase, contact your credit card company. Since this issue is more complex, call the company rather than trying to work through the website. Locate the card company's customer service number. You'll find it on the back of your credit card, or on your card statement.The company's automated phone line will take you through a series of prompts. Have your credit card and information about the purchase with you when you call.
Your account may have a password and user ID associated with your card. Enter that information when you're prompted.
You may be asked several security questions, so that the associate on the line can identify you. Answer those questions, based on the answers you provided when you set up your account.
Provide the vendor name, date, dollar amount, and the item purchased. Explain that you asked the merchant for a refund, but they declined. Ask your card company if they can withhold payment and investigate the matter.
If the credit card company withholds the payment, ask them to email you documentation.

, Whether the payment can be withheld or not, make sure that you understand the card company's process for investigating the issue. Ask your card company if you need to file a formal written complaint regarding the merchant.Confirm how long it will take for the card company to investigate your complaint.
Ask the card company if your account includes any extended warranty coverage for damaged or defective merchandise. If the merchant does not refund your money, you may be able to recover your funds through a warranty.
Keep all related documentation.

Calculate the average daily balance including new purchases.,
Calculate the average daily balance excluding new purchases.,
Understand the implications of each method.",How to Calculate the Finance Charge on a Credit Card Balance2," This is generally the most common method credit card companies use to calculate a finance charge. It is also the most expensive, as new purchases and balances are accounted for immediately with no grace period to avoid accruing interest. Some credit card companies allow a grace period between the purchase date and the date the bill is due, so that if you pay your bill completely on time, there is no interest charged.Add up the outstanding balance for each day in your billing period. Include any new purchases made to this balance. For example, if your balance was $180 for 10 days, you get $1,800. Then, say your balance was $110 for 5 days. You get $550. Then, for 15 days, your balance was $90. You get $1,350. Once you have a range of numbers spanning the complete billing cycle, add all these numbers together. For example, $1,800 plus $550 plus $1,350 comes to $3,700.
Divide this number by the total number of days in your billing cycle. Most billing cycles are 30 to 31 days. The number you get is the average daily balance that is then used to calculate the interest owed. For the above example, the average daily balance would be 3,700 divided by 30, coming to approximately $124. The finance charge is the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) adjusted for the number of billing cycles in a year times the average daily balance. For example, if the APR is 18% with 12 billing cycles, the monthly rate would be 1.5%. The finance charge would be the 1.5% of the average daily balance.

, Sometimes, new purchases are not accounted for when adding up your outstanding balance.


Add up the outstanding balance for each day in your billing period. The calculation is basically the same as before, only you do not account for new purchases.
Once again, divide this number by the number of days in the billing cycle. This is your finance average daily balance.The finance charge is the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) adjusted for the number of billing cycles in a year times the average daily balance.
Note that a different APR can be applied for different items such as transfers or cash advances. Also, APR rates may expire after a certain period.

, These two methods, while similar, are vastly different in how they affect you as a credit card user.


If you're using your credit card to make purchases, such as gas and groceries, you should look for a card that excludes new purchases from the daily balance. This way, you have a small grace period between billing cycles each month.
In general, it's best to avoid cards that include new purchases in your daily balance. Depending on the credit card company, there may not be a grace period, and finance charges can increase quickly. If you're using your card just to transfer balances and do not make purchases on it, however, you won't be as affected. Note that the balance on which interest is calculated can vary from issuer to issuer including ending balance, previous balance, and so on."

Locate the recurring credit card payment you want to cancel.,
Sign into your account on the vendor's website.,
Call the vendor, if the company does not offer an automated option to cancel your recurring payment.",How to Cancel a Credit Card Payment2," Say, for example, that you want to cancel a monthly subscription to a premium online music service. Verify the company name and how often you are charged (monthly, in this case). Confirm the date that the charge is posted to your account each month

, In this example, you would access the online music service website. Enter your username and password. See if the site offers an automated option to cancel a recurring payment.


Select the recurring payment that you want to cancel, if an automated system is available. Cancel the payment.
Note that date of the last payment charge to your credit card. You'll need to use that date to verify that no charges are posted after that point in time.
Keep documentation on the cancellation.
Check your future credit card statements to confirm that no charges are posted after the final charge date provided by the vendor.

, Have your account number, charge amount, and the date of the charge with you when you call. Ask the customer service person to email you confirmation that the recurring charge will be cancelled.

Confirm the date of the final charge to your account. Keep the documentation on file.
Use these records to check your credit card statements to ensure that the charges have stopped.
If the vendor refuses to cancel the recurring payment, consider contacting your state Attorney General or the Better Business Bureau.

Understand your debit card transactions.,
Contact your financial institution first, if your need to cancel a debit card purchase.,
Tell the merchant that you want a refund.",How to Cancel a Credit Card Payment3," Debit cards are designed to automatically deduct funds from your checking or savings account when you make a purchase. Improvements in technology now allow banks to process debit card transactions quickly. Once you purchase an item using your debit card, there is not much time to cancel a payment. Debit card transactions do not have the same legal protections for damaged goods or faulty service., Ask them if they can stop the payment. If they can't, contact the merchant. For large purchases, consider using a credit card. Credit cards offer better legal protections, in case you have a problem with a purchase., If you purchased physical goods, ask the merchant how you can return them. Keep the shipping documentation for the return.


After you ship the goods, confirm with the merchant that they have received the items.
Provide the receipt and your debit card information to the merchant. When the merchant processes the refund, ask them to email you the refund details. Keep the details for your files.
Log into your bank account and confirm that the refund amount posted to your account.
If the merchant refuses to refund your purchase, contact an attorney. Ask for some legal advice on recovering the funds.

That doesn't mean you have to carry large sums of cash around; you could use a debit card. However, withdrawing cash and spending only that amount can help with budgeting and avoiding over-spending.;
, Many people rely on credit or credit cards for large purchases. They also consider them an emergency fund. While credit cards are helpful for these types of purchases, it's possible to replace them with saved cash instead. Use savings first to build an emergency fund, and then use your savings to put towards large purchases like appliances and even cars or homes.

, It's hard to live without credit when you are not making enough to survive and save. Find a second job or passive income source. There are many work from home jobs or small businesses that allow you to earn money without investing a lot of time or money. Use your skills to make extra cash. Sell things you don't need or use anymore.

, Stick to a budget. Save money by cutting back on unnecessary purchases. This will not only break the habit of credit card use, but will give you more cash to save toward emergencies and large purchases.

, Make sure the card you keep, or get, works for your needs. If it's to be used for convenience in purchasing only, make sure you pay it off every month. A card for emergencies or large purchases should have a low interest rate. The same is true for a card you are using to consolidate debt. Some cards offer rewards like points for gift cards or travel. This could be a good choice, but you'll need to plan purchases carefully and not keep a balance since they usually charge higher interest rates.

, It's usually best to eliminate credit card debt but keep credit accounts open, since closing accounts can negatively affect your credit. However, an accountant or adviser can look over your finances and credit history and come up with the best solution.

, Pay off the ones with smaller balances first, and then use the savings to pay off the next card. When possible, move balances to cards with lower interest rates. Hold off on new credit purchases until balances are manageable.

, PayPal links right to your bank account and can be used to make purchases online. It eliminates the need for having a credit card just to buy from the Internet.

, Credit cards come in handy when you want to travel or make large purchases. These things can still be done with cash--it's just more of a hassle. Plan in advance, and allow time for sending cash deposits or wiring money as an alternative to reserving or paying with a credit card.

Set up automated transfers.,

Pay according to payment rules.,
Always pay more than the minimum amount.,
Move your payment date.,
Immediately pay off cash advances.",How to Stop Interest and Late Fees on Credit Cards1," If you are having trouble remembering when your payments are due, scheduling automatic payments can help. Online payments can be scheduled to automatically withdraw funds from your checking or savings account. Just make sure that you always have enough money in your account to make the payments.


To set up these payments, you'll have to register for online banking and follow through the provided instructions to set up automatic payment. Call your bank's customer service number if you run into any difficulties.;
, Another option is to establish a payment reminder system so that you receive reminders whenever your credit card payments are due. These alerts can be set up on a virtual calendar or with your bank. You can also try setting an alarm or reminder on your phone if it has that functionality. This can be helpful if you feel uncomfortable with automatic payments., Credit card issuers all have very specific rules regarding the timing and methods of payment. These details are outlined on the back of your credit card bill, in your original card agreement, and online if you're enrolled in online banking. Read through them thoroughly to make sure you are paying your bills on time and correctly. If you fail to follow the guidelines, your payment might be credited late, resulting in late fees. Adhere to the following rules to avoid this situation:


If you are paying by mail, use the payment envelope provided by the credit card company.
Make sure your payment check is filled out correctly, with your card number, signature, and the correct payment amount.
Send your payment to the address requested with the required postage.
Try to send payment at least a week before it is due.When mailing in your payment, there may be delays in the mail. In addition, the credit card company's processing time between receipt of your payment and credit to your account might vary.
It's always better to allow for a few extra days than to expect your payment to arrive on the day it's due.

, Pay as much as you can if you cannot pay the full amount off. Paying only the minimum on your credit card does not help you to pay off the full amount. If you continue to only pay the minimum, it could take you many years to pay off your full balance. You need to pay more than what is requested and, if possible, pay off the credit card before adding more debt to it.


Any balance remaining after you pay off your bill each month is subject to interest. Interest will be charged based on the remaining balance, so any amount you can pay off reduces your interest fee.Some credit card purchases provide a set payment period, such as one year, without interest provided the debt is paid within the period.
However, if you can only afford the minimum, pay it immediately to avoid late fees., In some cases, your credit card bill might be due at a bad time of the month, when you are low on cash. To remedy this, you can call your credit card company and ask them to change your due date to a more convenient time. For example, try setting your credit card bill due date right after you receive a paycheck so that you'll have plenty of cash to pay it off each month.If you have more than one card, consider setting the due dates on the same day. This will make payment easier to remember each month., Most credit cards allow a grace period for purchases. You should pay your current balance in full every month before the grace period ends. This way, you can avoid paying interest. But a cash advance usually has no grace period, and interest begins accruing immediately. Paying the ""current balance"" will not save your from paying interest if you've taken out a cash advance. The only way to stop it is to pay the account off to a zero balance. Do this online, over the phone, or in person. If you mail a check, more interest will have accrued before your payment is posted, and you will still owe a small balance that continues to accrue interest.


In addition, cash advance interest rates may be even higher than your standard credit card rate.
Cash advances are expensive and should only be used when absolutely necessary."
"
Pay your credit card balances off in full every month.,
Scan every credit card statement, either online or in print.,
Guard your credit card information carefully.,
Pay every credit card bill on time.,
Keep close track of your credit card balances, and never exceed your maximum balance.,
Read the fine print on any balance transfer or introductory offers before accepting them.",How to Stay Out of Credit Card Trouble,"


It's far too easy to spend more than you thought when using credit cards instead of cash. Combat this by tracking your credit card purchases in a checkbook ledger as if they were debit card purchases instead.
Take credit card reward offers with a grain of salt. If you have enough self-control to keep track of purchases and pay your balance off in full every month while piling up rewards, great. Otherwise, they're not worth the extra interest and fees that carrying a credit card balance can cost you.;
, This helps you spot any unauthorized transactions in time to dispute them.

, Be especially wary of phishing e-mails purporting to be from your bank, credit card issuer or other entity and asking to confirm your credit card information.


If you're in doubt as to whether a request for personal information is legitimate, contact your credit card issuer directly using the customer service number listed on the bank of your card.
Never send your credit card information by e-mail, instant message or through an unencrypted website; this sort of online communication is easily intercepted.
Look for ""at the beginning of a website address to signal that the connection is encrypted. Note that some parts of the website might be securely encrypted and others might not; some browsers will warn you of these inconsistencies. Some browsers also use the image of a closed padlock to denote a secure Internet connection.

, Late payments can reduce your credit score and result in extra fees or an increased interest rate.

,


If you absolutely cannot avoid carrying a credit card balance, limit the balance to no more than 25 percent of the available credit on that card. Some experts place the ""don't cross"" limit as high as 50 percent of available credit. Regardless of exactly where you put it, crossing that invisible line can damage your credit score.
Always make more than the minimum payment necessary. Your credit card statement will list how long it takes to pay off your balance while making only the minimum payments, and how much you'd have to pay to pay the balance off in a shorter time period.

, If you default on a single payment or don't pay in full before the introductory offer expires, your entire balance may be subject to a higher interest rate. You might also have to pay mandatory fees for balance transfers and cash advances.

There are also numerous sites that lay out different offers with their rates and terms in an easily-readable format. When you apply for the cards, just make sure you are doing so on the card issuer's website, rather than through an intermediary.

, One important thing to know when searching for balance transfer cards is that you generally cannot transfer balances between cards from the same issuer. This means that you cannot transfer balances between two Bank of America cards. However, this does not apply to payment processing networks, so you can transfer your balance between two Visa cards (provided they are from different issuers)., Each website will list features of their card including transfer processing fee, introductory interest rate, permanent rate, APR (the interest rate after the introductory period), late-payment fee, and annual fee, if any. Your primary goals should be to look for a low introductory interest rate (preferably zero percent) and low balance transfer fees (as close to $0 as possible). In most cases, though, balance transfer fees will be around 4 percent, but some card issuers waive them entirely., Read the fine print on every credit card offer to ensure you pick the card best suited for your needs. You should also read into the balance transfer process to see how exactly it works for the card. For example, the transfer might take two weeks or more to process. During this time, you will still be responsible for keeping up with payments on your old card(s). Check into this delay so that you can make a note to stay on top of your old card until the balance is transferred., Call the credit card company if you have any questions regarding balance transfers. Even if the card you are applying for is not a no-transfer fee offer, you may be able to talk the company down on their offer. Try asking for the minimum transfer fee or no transfer fee. In many cases, you will be able to get the transfer fee reduced by calling., Zero percent interest offers are usually available only for people with good or excellent credit. If your score is low, you may not find a credit card that offers you an attractive transfer option. However, if your credit is low, you may still be able to get a card with an introductory rate of around 7 percent, which can be beneficial if your current card rates are up in the 20 to 30 percent range.Learn how to check your credit score by reading how to check your credit score.


, Each person's needs are different. Try to figure out the amount of time it will take you to pay down your transfer balance. Make sure that the introductory rate on any card you are applying for lasts at least that long, so that you can avoid paying high interest rates. In many cases, introductory periods might last 12 to 16 months. Those with great credit might get 18 to 24 months.

However, be warned that longer periods of introductory interest rates often come with higher balance transfer fees and higher regular interest rates., The best way to make sure that you are getting a good deal by transferring you balance is to calculate out all of the potential savings from doing so for each card. This calculation will involve transfer fees, introductory interest rates, regular interest rates, and associated repayment periods. Luckily, there are calculators online that can be used to calculate savings for you. Try searching ""credit card balance transfer calculator"" into an online search engine to find one. Then, input all of your information as requested.For example, imagine you have been approved for a card with a zero percent introductory interest rate for 18 months. Your current balance is $2,000 on a card that charges 20 percent interest annually. You pay $100 per month towards the card balance.

Even if the card you are transferring to charges a 10 percent transfer fee, a $100 annual fee, and 15 percent interest after the introductory period, you would still save $245.49 in interest by switching cards, assuming you continued your $100 monthly payments.


, Before applying for a balance transfer card, assess your financial situation to make sure that you can actually pay down the balance before the introductory period is over. This calculation is simple, as interest will not accrue on your balance (assuming you have a zero percent interest introductory rate). However, if you fail to pay down the card balance during this time, it is possible that you will be hit with a bill for the accrued interest over the introductory period.For example, imagine you have a zero percent interest rate on your new card and an 18 month introductory period. If the balance transferred were $2,700, you would need to make sure you can pay down your balance within those 18 months. 

The monthly payment amount required to pay down your balance would be $2700÷18{\displaystyle \$2700\div 18}, which is $150. 

In this case, you would need to make sure that you could afford to pay $150 per month to pay down your balance. 


, Compare each side by side by lining up their terms in a list or spreadsheet. This will give you better insight as to which card provides you with the most benefits and saves you more money in the long run. For example, you might identify cards with the following terms:

A zero percent interest introductory period of 24 months, 20 percent regular interest rate, 10 percent transfer fee, and $100 annual fee. 

A zero percent interest introductory period of 12 months, a 15 percent regular interest rate, 5 percent transfer fee limited to $50, and a $50 annual fee.

No introductory interest rate, regular interest rate of 12 percent, a flat $10 transfer fee, and no annual fee.


, The best card will be the combination that provides you with the lowest fees and interest rates while you pay down your outstanding balance. In most cases, there will be a trade-off between interest rates, introductory period length, and balance transfer fees. Calculate the cost of each card's fees and interest rates over the expected repayment period. Then, choose the card that is the cheapest for you.The three cards mentioned in the previous example all have very different terms. The one that you choose to go with will depend on your specific financial situation and repayment capabilities.

For example, the second card would be best if you could pay off your balance within twelve months. However, the other cards may be useful for transfers that would take longer to pay off. 


, Some people look for a special introductory rate, which may be enticing; however, use one of these cards only if you are able to pay off the entire, transferred balance within the time frame they give you for interest-free payments. If there is any doubt that you'll be able to pay it off, choose a different card., Failing to research balance-transfer offers thoroughly beforehand can mean that you end up paying additional fees and spending too much money making the transfer. Be clear about balance-transfer fees. Depending on your account balance, that fee can be considerable, which adds to your accumulating debt. Failing to check for these fees can end up costing you more money than you were being charged before transferring your balance., Get pre-approved to make sure that the credit limit on the balance transfer card is high enough to cover all of your transferred debt. If you can't get a high enough limit, you can always apply for more than one balance transfer card. Just keep in mind that the two balance transfer cards you choose must be from different issuers., If you're still between cards, choose the one that comes with additional benefits beyond low fees. Cards may offer travel insurance, payment protection, and points earned on purchases, for example. Benefits should not be the most important criteria when choosing a balance transfer card, but good benefits can mean that the card will be worth using even after you've paid off your balance."

Keep your balance low.,
Don't carry your credit card with you unless you plan on using it specifically.,
Consider closing credit cards that you don't use.,
Avoid applying for new credit cards.",How to Stop Interest and Late Fees on Credit Cards2," Discipline yourself by only making charges on your credit card that you are able to pay in cash. This will help stop late and interest fees. You don't want to use a credit card for large emergency payments. Instead, build an emergency savings fund that you can pull from when unexpected expenses surface. Having a high balance relative to your credit limit can also negatively affect your credit score.Your credit begins to be negatively affected once your credit utilization ratio (the percentage of your credit limit on the card you are using) goes over 30 percent.
So, for example, you would not want to build up a balance of more than $3,000 on a card with a $10,000 credit limit.
When you reach this limit, pay down your balance or switch cards to avoid negative effects., Carrying your credit card without reason may be tempting if you are in the habit of making spontaneous purchases. Place yourself in control of your spending and make sure that all credit card purchases are preplanned, necessary, and within your budget.


You should also avoid spending just to earn rewards. This may seem like a good way to earn rewards for ""free,"" but you may end up spending more than you should., You can simplify your financial life, and reduce your chances of missing payments, by reducing your number of credit cards. Many people hold card that they use only sparingly or never at all, and these can lead to a variety of fees if not properly attended to. To close a card, make sure that your balance on the card is zero and to cancel any recurring payments on the card. Then, call the credit card company to start the process.


Closing a credit card that you have held for a long time may have a negative impact on your credit score. Keep this in mind if you need to qualify for a loan in the near future., Many people apply for unnecessary store or rewards cards just to earn $50 here and there. While this may seem like a great deal, applying for too many cards can complicate your financial life. In addition, these cards may have hidden fees that you will suddenly be responsible for. Be sure to consider how much you really need a card before applying for it, and always read the fine print of the card agreement."

Opt for a 0-percent interest credit card if possible.,
Ask to have late fees waived.,
Negotiate with your credit card company.,
Use a line of credit instead.",How to Stop Interest and Late Fees on Credit Cards3," These cards allow you to make purchases for a year or so before interest kicks in. If you are able to apply for a 0-percent credit card, you may be able to transfer a balance from your existing credit card that you are having a difficult time paying off. This will give you a year to pay off the amount without incurring interest. Just make sure you can pay the amount off during the 0-percent interest period.


Check for unexpected costs like balance transfer fees or annual fees before getting a 0-percent interest credit card., Surprisingly, credit card companies are generally willing to drop late fees if you call and ask. If you miss one payment on accident or due to an unexpected life event, try calling and asking the company to waive the late fee. However, don't expect this tactic to work every month.Try saying,""I can easily make the payment today if you'll waive the late fee.""
In many cases, the representative may offer to waive the fee even before you ask.

, You may be able to negotiate a lower payment amount or a full payoff at a reduced rate with your credit card company. In a recent study, two-thirds of people who asked for a reduced interest rate received it. So pick up the phone and call if you want a reduced rate. You may have better chances of getting your wish if you have been a reliable customer in the past.For example, try saying, ""My strong payment history indicates that I will easily be able to pay off my balance in full in a few months. However, this would be easier if you could please lower my interest rate.""

, Consider applying for a line of credit instead of a credit card if you have an emergency expense or need to borrow credit. You can apply for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) if you are a homeowner with substantial equity in your home. A line of credit offers a lower interest rate. This can be a great option if you have a large amount of debt to pay off and want to consolidate it. However, this only works if you are capable of paying it off in a reasonable amount of time.


Take out a HELOC by visiting your bank or another lender in your area.The interest paid on a HELOC is deductible from taxes like mortgage interest.


There are also personal lines of credit available through banks that are not taken out against the value of your home.

Every twelve months, you can get one free report from each of the three major credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian) from AnnualCreditReport.com. Your credit report will tell you your FICO score, which most lenders use to determine whether you are too much of a “risk” or not. These scores are based on your past credit history.It’s a good idea to space out your credit report requests since your credit score can change quickly. Stagger the reports that you ask for. Request one every four months.Check it for errors. Be sure that there are no incorrect late payments listed. You can dispute them with the credit bureau if you find errors.;
, The most desirable cards require good or excellent credit, so if your score is low, you need to apply for a card designed for people with fair or bad credit. The perks may not be as great, but these are a good place to start improving your credit.Do your research carefully. Applying for lots of credit cards in a short period of time will decrease your credit score, so don’t apply for one that you probably won’t get. There are dozens of lists of “best credit cards for low credit” online, so utilize those to find the one that’s best for you.

, If you already have credit cards open, use these instead of applying for new cards while you’re trying to improve your credit score. FICO scores also take into account how many credit cards you have a balance on. Instead of using lots of different cards, pick one or two (preferably the ones with the best rewards and best interest rates), and use them for everything., One of the key factors in having good credit is having a record of on-time payments. (This makes up 35% of your FICO score.) If you’ve never had a loan or a credit card, then you probably don’t have any credit at all. Paying for your regular expenses with a credit card can improve your credit if you pay on time every single month., Credit card interest adds up fast! You only pay interest if you don’t pay your full balance every month. Pay in full every month to not only improve your credit score but also avoid paying interest on the unpaid balance., Never spend more than what you have in the bank. Don’t think of it as a loan- think of it as a draft from your bank account. Because the money doesn’t come out of your account immediately, it can be easy to lose track and overspend.To keep track of what you’re spending, set up an account with a free online budgeting tool such as Mint.com.Check the balance you owe on your card frequently - at least once a week (or more if you tend to overspend). Some credit card companies will send you the owed balance every day in a text, so check out that option as well.

, Some banks will send you a payment reminder via email or text when it’s time to make a payment. Alternatively, most credit card companies allow you to set up an auto-draft of your payments, so that the money to pay your credit card comes straight out of your checking account.Again, be careful not to spend more on your credit card than you actually have in your bank account. You don’t want to be saddled with overdraft fees from your bank.

, Think of a credit score kind of like a driving record. If you got three speeding tickets when you were 17 years old, your record isn’t going to look so hot in your late teens and early twenties. However, as you get a bit older, if you don’t earn any more tickets, your record will begin to look cleaner, because you’ll have many more ticket-less years on it. Credit scores work the same way. There’s no quick way to fix them, but they can improve dramatically over time.Delinquencies stay on the report for 7 years.
Inquiries stay on the report for 2 years.

, The amount you owe on all of your loans and credit cards accounts for 30% of your FICO score. Part of this score is your “credit utilization.” This number is the percent of your available credit that you’re using. If you use a high percentage of your available credit, it’s more likely that you will miss payments. Keeping your credit utilization number low can boost your credit score significantly.Remember that your credit utilization number can be high even if you pay your credit card bill in full every month. To keep this number low, you can also make payments throughout the month instead of waiting for your statement to come (because credit card companies report the amount listed on your monthly statement).If possible, try to use 30% or less of your available credit each month., If you have cards that you’re about to max out, pay those before you pay any of the others. This will help keep your utilization rate low., Closing your credit cards can hurt your score. Doing so reduces the amount of overall available credit that you have. Unless you’re planning to dramatically cut back your spending, you will be using a higher percentage of the credit available to you, which will affect your credit utilization rate.On the other hand, if you have a card that’s costing you a lot of money in fees, you might want to close the card, even though it doesn’t look good on your credit report. Consider the pros and cons of wasting money on the fees versus improving your credit score.
The average length of all of your open credit accounts makes up 15% of your FICO score.
Avoid opening cards just to get the sign-up bonus and then closing them. Every time you open a new credit account, the average length of your credit history goes down., If you have several cards open, you need to use them all, or the company may stop reporting them to the credit report companies, which can negatively impact your score.If possible, put one or two small recurring payments on each card, and be sure to pay them off each month so that they remain active.

, Remember that part of your score is based on the age of your accounts. Closing your oldest cards can significantly lower your score, especially if you have a positive history of on-time payments for that card."

Report a lost card immediately.",How to Use a Prepaid Credit Card," A prepaid credit card has to be funded with money you load onto it. Before purchasing anything, you should be sure you know your balance because you can get hit with big fees for making a purchase without enough money on your card.This is particularly important if you have not used your card for a long time, as many cards have monthly maintenance fees ranging from $1 to $9.95 that will slowly eat away at your balance.Many cards charge a fee for checking your balance at out of network ATMs, so be sure to use the correct ATM.
Others charge a fee at all ATMs, so you will want to check your balance by phone (with an automated system, not a live representative, as that also comes with a fee), by text, by app, or online.;
, When shopping, a prepaid card works just like a credit card. You can buy things at stores, shop online, or pay bills, so long as you don’t exceed the amount you have loaded onto your card.Prepaid cards have one major advantage in that they are not linked to your private data like your Social Security Number, so unlike with a normal credit card, hackers cannot use them to steal your identity., If you pay at the pump, most cards will apply a hold to your card of up to $100. This hold might not clear for several days, temporarily reducing the amount you have available to spend on your card. To pay the exact amount instead, you will need to go inside to pay the attendant., Prepaid cards work just like debit cards for withdrawing money. You will be sent a Personal Identification Number (PIN) by the card issuer for this purpose. If you don’t have a PIN, you can call the number on the card to request one.


Be aware that many cards will charge a fee of up to $2.50, on top of the one charged by the bank where you withdraw the money. , Some cards will allow you to pay your creditors by issuing a paper or electronic check for you., A prepaid credit card has to be funded with money you load onto it. Before purchasing anything, you should be sure you know your balance because you can get hit with big fees for making a purchase without enough money on your card., While it is easier to rent with a regular credit card or debit card, there are companies such as Enterprise that accept prepaid credit cards when renting cars. Be aware though that you will usually have a more limited choice in cars unless you purchase insurance, as agencies are reluctant to rent more expensive models to people without credit cards. Most companies will allow you to pay for your car upon return with a prepaid card, after initially checking it out with a regular credit card. There are a few additional steps you may have to take to rent with a prepaid card:Rent Early – Companies that allow prepaid cars often require you to reserve 4-6 weeks in advance. In most instances, you cannot rent at the counter with a prepaid card.

Contact the Local Office – Even companies that often accept prepaid cards, like Enterprise, require you to contact the local office to discuss the details of payment without a standard credit card.Security Deposit – You can expect to pay a deposit of $100-$500, in addition to the cost of rental, in order to cover any incidentals or additional costs you may incur.

Credit Check – Some companies will require a credit check before allowing you to pay with a prepaid card. The credit check is to help them to evaluate the level of risk in renting to you – i.e. if you regularly fail to pay bills, they will be less likely to rent you a car.

Additional Information – The rental agency may require additional documents for renters using prepaid cards, including paycheck stubs, proof of insurance, current utility bills, and personal references.No One Way Rental – One-way rentals are usually not allowed if renting with a prepaid card. If renting at an airport, most companies will only accept a prepaid card if you can show evidence of a return flight from that same airport.

, With most hotels, you can pre-book a hotel room online with your pre-paid card. Most hotels will also require a deposit to cover the cost of your room and any possible extra charges. This deposit is typically done as a pre-authorization on your credit card. Some hotels allow prepaid cards for checkin. For others, you will need to leave a deposit equivalent to several nights’ stay at the hotel. This deposit can be charged on your prepaid card., You can use your prepaid credit card to purchase airline tickets, just as you would a normal credit card. Unlike hotels or rental cars, there are no incidental charges associated with airline tickets, so a line of credit is not needed when purchasing them.Many airlines will require you to purchase your ticket at least 6 days before departure if using a prepaid card.

, Most major cruise lines accept prepaid cards as payment for the cruise ticket. While onboard, most lines use a cashless system, wherein all onboard purchases are charged to your boarding pass. If using a prepaid card to settle these purchases:You will need to provide a deposit, usually around $500.
Your daily expenditures will be limited, usually to somewhere between $300-$500 per day.
You will need to settle any outstanding charges on you account before disembarking at the end of the cruise.
Be sure to check with the cruise line to determine the rules regarding onboard purchases before booking.

, Prepaid cards come with account and routing numbers, so you can have your paycheck sent directly to your card, just as you would with a bank account. This is the most effective way to add money to your card. The money will show up on your card the same day, and most prepaid cards do not charge a fee for direct deposits.Some even offer lower monthly fees and other advantages for cardholders who direct deposit above a certain amount every month.

, If you have a bank account, you can usually transfer money to your prepaid card online, via phone, or in person at the bank. Your bank may charge for the transaction, but the prepaid card issuer generally does not.

, With most prepaid cards, adding money via PayPal is free, and the money will show up in your account in 2-3 business days. Here’s how:Sign up with PayPal. You’ll need to enter your email address, home address, and phone number.
Use the account and routing number associated with your card to set it up as a bank account on PayPal.
Click “Transfer to your bank” to transfer money to your card.

, Prepaid cards can be reloaded at many gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, as well as at most check cashing agents and MoneyGram and Western Union agents. In most cases, the cashier will be able to add the money directly to your card. Check with your card issuer for a list of locations where you can use a check or cash to reload your card., With many prepaid cards, you can buy a MoneyPak at retailers with which to add funds to your card. The MoneyPak is a card with a cash value on it and a code number that you use to transfer that value to your prepaid card. In general, the amount you pay for the MoneyPak will be the amount added to your account, though there are sometimes fees involved. After purchasing the MoneyPak, access your prepaid card account online or by phone and use the MoneyPak code to add the money to your card., Prepaid cards issued by banks will often let you add money to the cards at ATMs of the bank, though some will only allow it at particular ATM locations.Reloading at ATMs is usually not possible with cards issued by credit card companies like Visa or American Express, or by major retailers like Walmart.
Check the terms of a card before you purchase it to see if reloading at ATMs is possible.

, It’s important to know what fees are associated with your card in order to use it in a way that keeps costs down. If you don’t, you can pay tens, or even hundreds of dollars a month in fees. You can check here for a break down of fees on some of the most common cards, but be sure to also contact your issuer for an exact list.

, If your card charges you per transaction, you’ll want to use it only in emergencies. Most cards charge a monthly fee instead. Check with your issuer to see if you can avoid this fee in one of these ways:By making a certain number of purchases a month.
By using direct deposit to add money to your account.
By loading a certain amount of money each month.

, If this is the case with your card, you’ll want to try to load large amounts at infrequent intervals in order to keep the fees down. Be aware, though, that some cards have limits as to how much you can add at once. Try to avoid cards that both charge for adding money and have low limits on how much you can add., To avoid them, you’ll usually need to use an ATM within the issuer’s network. Check with your issuer to see which ATMs are free.


Cash back – At many retailers – particularly gas stations, pharmacies, and supermarkets – you can ask for cash back when making a purchase. This cash will be included in the purchase price and will thus come without any fees.

, The amount on your card is insured up to $250,000. If you notify your issuer immediately, they will usually restore your original balance and issue a new card. The faster you act, the less trouble you will have, as whoever now has your card will have less time to rack up charges."

A good first step is to visit the bank or credit union where you have a checking or savings account and ask the staff about the possibility of getting a credit card. Most local financial institutions will be willing to offer credit to responsible, qualified customers.Note, however, that your eligibility for a credit card can be affected by the length (and quality) of your financial history. If, for instance, you're a young adult who's only had a savings account for a few months, you may not meet your bank's standards for a credit card. In this case, you may need to maintain your savings account for some time or settle for a special type of credit card called a secured credit card (see below.);
, A bank isn't the only place you can get a credit card — many credit cards are offered by companies that operate just like any other business. You are probably already familiar with some of these companies, like Mastercard, Discovery, etc. These sorts of companies offer a wide array of credit cards to many different kinds of customers, though, like banks, they will only issue them to customers that they believe are financially responsible enough to pay for them.


If you're in the market for one of these sorts of credit cards, consider consulting a Consumer Reports-style resource for more information — there is lots of reputable information online about which cards are good deals and which are not. Some sites, (like, for instance, Nerdwallet.com) even offer their own credit card ratings., Businesses in a wide variety of industries (including retail, travel, gasoline, and more) issue their own credit cards. Often, they will offer the chance to sign up for these credit cards when you make a purchase. Note, however, that store credit cards can often have high interest rates (the amount of money you need to pay back over time) and low credit limits (the total amount of money you are allowed to spend at once) compared to other types of credit cards.One reason that store credit cards are sometimes attractive to customers is that they come with rewards. These may include a percentage off of a purchase being made, a 0% interest rate for a limited time, and ongoing bonuses based on the use of the card. For example, it's common for credit cards issued by airlines to accumulate ""miles"" with use.Once enough miles have been built up, they can be used for big discounts on plane tickets.

, When you apply for a credit card, the bank or business issuing you the card wants to know that you'll be able to pay back any money you spend. To do this, they will check your credit history, which is made available to them by credit report agencies. This means that your financial history usually determines whether or not you'll be able to get a credit card. Some aspects of your financial history that may be analyzed include:


Loans (including mortgages) — have you paid these off on time, or have you been late or defaulted?
Rent — Have you been consistent about paying your rent on time? Note that only some landlords send your history to credit report companies.Past credit cards — have you used previous cards responsibly and paid off your debt on time?
Major financial events — have you recently declared bankruptcy or been foreclosed on?

, If you're responsible with your money but you don't have much of a credit history, it may be difficult for you to prove that you're a good candidate for a normal credit card. However, it should usually be possible for you to get a special type of credit card known as a secured credit card. These work like ordinary credit cards, except that you must put down a deposit to get one. This makes the institution giving you the card feel much more comfortable about extending credit to you — if you can't pay back what you owe, the bank or business can always take the money out of your deposit.


Secured cards offer a way for people with very little credit history (or a bad credit history) to start building up a good history. After you've shown that you can use your secured card responsibly, you'll probably qualify for a normal credit card (or an unsecured card), which doesn't require a deposit.

, Congratulations — you now have a credit card. You can now start using it to make purchases almost anywhere — simply present it to the cashier at the time of purchase or swipe it like an ordinary debit card. Below are a few very basic tips for using your new card (for more detailed information on using your card responsibly, see the section below.)


You are only allowed to spend up to your card's credit limit (for a secured card, this is usually the amount of money in your deposit). Purchases that put you past this limit may be declined.
Spending with a credit card racks up a balance. After about a month, you'll start to get bills for this balance — you must pay at least the minimum payment designated on the bill (usually about 2% of your balance) or face penalties.
It is in your financial interest to pay your balance off as quickly as possible. Balance that you don't pay one month ""rolls over"" to the next month with interest — a sort of ""fee"" for not paying back your balance as quickly as possible. Your interest rate is a set percentage of your total balance which is agreed upon when you sign up for your card. Note that some cards offer 0% interest payments for a period of time after signing up.

, In general, your strategy with your new credit card should be to make small purchases fairly regularly and pay them off immediately. This shows the institution that gave you the card that you can responsibly pay back your credit balances, which in turn boosts your credit history. Having a strong credit history is important — it can make it much easier to make important financial transactions in the future, including:


Getting a mortgage for a house.
Getting a loan for personal expenses.
Getting good deals on new credit cards.

, It may seem like the best way to build a good credit history is to spend lots of money with your credit card, then pay it all back and repeat this over and over again. In fact, consistently using lots of your available credit is a bad idea and can hurt your credit history. This signals to financial institutions that you have a hard time meeting your expenses with the money that's ordinarily in your bank account, so you have to rely on credit, which is, of course, someone else's money.


Most financial resources recommend spending no more than 70-75% of your available credit, though less than 30% is usually seen as preferable., Just like spending too much money on credit cards can hurt your reputation with lenders, so too can opening lots of credit card accounts at the same time. This makes it look to lenders like you suddenly need lots of money that you can't get from your paycheck, which can make loaning to you seem like a risky idea.


In addition, the total number of credit cards you have (regardless of when you signed up for them) can affect your credit scores. Though many adults responsibly maintain more than one credit card, it's generally considered unwise to have more than about five., Credit cards aren't like debit cards. A number of cards are issued with PIN number technology, but you don't always need the PIN number to use them, often only a signature especially at independent merchants. Some vendors may ask to see an ID when you use a credit card, but many do not. For this reason, if your credit card gets into the wrong hands, someone else may be able to run up purchases and you'll be stuck with the bill. Thus, you'll want to be very careful to keep track of your credit cards (as well as any correspondence that contains information relevant to them, like your credit card number or the password to your online credit card account).


If you need to dispose of your credit card or any vulnerable credit card information, destroy it first. You can cut a credit card into pieces with ordinary scissors and shred or burn paper documents.
Report lost or stolen cards to the issuer immediately. If you're quick, the account may be able to be ""frozen"" before any fraudulent purchases are made.
Note that if a card is used without your permission, you can be held liable for up to $50. However, some cards offer fraud liability as low as $0., While most credit cards are perfectly safe when used responsibly, some can be more trouble (and money) than they're worth. Some cards may carry unfair hidden fees, others may charge outrageous interest rates, and some even use practices so unethical that the companies that issue them are subject to lawsuits.Don't let yourself get roped into a credit card scam. Always read your terms of use carefully and pay special attention to things like your credit limit, your interest rate, your yearly fee, and any other fees associated with the card.


For reference, according to recent data, the average interest rate on credit cards in America in 2012 was about 14-15%., If you have regular expenses like utility bills, student loans, and so on, it's usually possible to set up automatic deductions with a credit card just like with a checking or savings account. Often, this can be done online — consult the website of the agency sending you bills for more information.


Keep in mind, though, that if you have these regular deductions scheduled, you'll need to take extra care to pay off your credit card in a timely fashion to avoid going over your credit limit.

, As noted above, many credit card issuers try to entice potential new users by packaging rewards and signing bonuses with new cards. If you're in the market for a new credit card, consider getting one with an attractive reward package. Rewards can include:


Low or 0% interest for the first month, year, etc.
A percentage off of certain purchases
Reduced (or no) monthly/yearly fees
Credit towards certain rewards with each purchase (e.g., frequent flyer miles)

, If after you've had your credit card for some time you find that you're willing to handle more responsibility, consider asking your card issuer to extend your line of credit. If you're in good standing, you may be approved for higher credit limit — note, however, that this can cause a temporary ""dip"" in your credit scores because it can look like you suddenly need extra money.


Keep in mind that the greater your line of credit, the more important it is to use your credit responsibly. Maxing out a generous line of credit is a serious mistake — the damage to your financial reputation (and the interest you'll start accruing) can be significant.

, If you find that you need to use your credit card to make a single large expense that will put you over your credit limit, contact your card issuer regarding your overdraft options. If you're in good standing and have a history of responsible use, some credit card companies will agree to pay for a purchase that technically causes you to overdraft — spend more money than you are allowed. However, this usually costs extra money in the long run in the form of overdraft fees.In addition, federal law requires credit card issuers to obtain your explicit consent before they consider paying for any overdraft purchasers. This is known as ""opting in."" To be clear, your credit card issuer will not cover overdrafts until you opt in and may not cover all overdrafts after you do opt in."

Many companies and businesses have policies in place in which they are required to provide you with a refund if you are dissatisfied with their product or service, or if you have a negative experience with their company., If the merchant is unable or unwilling to provide you with a refund, you may more easily be able to get a store credit that you can apply toward other products or services at the store., If working with a store clerk or customer service representative does not lead to a solution, you should try talking with a manager or owner. In most cases, merchants will work with you to resolve issues if you take the time to escalate your situation to their boss or to an executive team whose goal is to maintain customer satisfaction., Since credit card chargebacks are costly for most companies and businesses, they will most likely work with you to resolve the issue to avoid a credit card chargeback., Put your complaint in writing. Explain the details of your initial purchase, if you made one, and the reason for requesting the refund. Even if the merchant does not eventually agree and grant you a refund, the letter will provide documentation of your complaint. You will need this documentation to proceed with a chargeback.Be sure to follow the credit card company's requirements to request a chargeback and be sure you comply with any deadlines.

, If a merchant does not work with you to resolve your issue, your next step will be to seek a credit card chargeback through your bank or card company. In general, a chargeback is available for any one of three different reasons:Seek a chargeback if your credit card statement reflects fraudulent charges. If you are charged for products or services you did not purchase or authorize, you will be entitled to use a credit card chargeback.
Seek a chargeback when you do not receive a full refund for an item you returned. In some cases, a merchant may take back the item you purchased, but will not issue you a full refund to your credit card. In this case, you could use the chargeback to challenge the partial return policy.
Use a chargeback if you do not receive a product or service you paid for. For example, if you ordered a product from the Internet and you never received it in the mail, a merchant may dispute the order and refuse to provide you with a refund.

, You have a limited amount of time to resolve your complaint after the transaction date. The time may vary depending on state law, but in general you will have 120 days from the date of the transaction to submit your complaint.The time begins from the date of the transaction. Taking time to try to resolve the problem with the merchant can be valuable as an initial step, but do not lose track of the deadline to file the chargeback complaint.

, You need to notify the bank or credit card company that you have a dispute. Usually, you just need to call the telephone number that is printed on your credit card for Customer Service. Tell the clerk who answers that you are calling to dispute a charge on your card. To proceed further, you will need to provide the details of the dispute. In particular, you will need to give the bank the following information:The date of the initial transaction. If your dispute began with a purchase that you made, you will want to provide the date of that purchase. If, on the other hand, you are disputing a charge that appears on your card statement incorrectly, you will provide the date that appears on that charge.
The amount of money that is in dispute. You will want to provide the bank with the exact amount. If you have a receipt or a copy of your credit card statement, you should be able to find the amount there.
The efforts you have already taken to resolve the issue. Provide the bank with as much detail as you can. This will include the names of any clerks or other store employees you spoke with, the general content of those conversations, and their responses to your requests.

, In most cases, after you report your dispute to your bank over the telephone, you will be issued a credit for that amount. This will be a temporary credit, subject to subsequent validation of your dispute., After you make your initial report to the bank, you will usually be sent a formal report form. You will need to complete this form in writing with the details of your dispute. Fill in the form as completely as you can, providing as much detail as possible.Use your receipt and credit card statement to help complete the form accurately.
Be concise. Provide all the facts necessary to detail your dispute, but limit your responses. If you get wordy, you may just confuse the issue.
Refer to the complaint letter that you sent to the merchant. You should attach a copy of that letter to the completed chargeback report form.

, In most cases, you will be required to present receipts or contracts from the transaction. Make sure that your records are complete, and include everything when you submit your completed report., After reviewing your written report, the bank or credit card company will make a final decision to sustain or reverse the previous temporary chargeback. If the bank finds that your documentation and explanation support your position, then you will receive a report in your favor, and the temporary credit will remain in your account. On the other hand, if the bank does not support your claim, then the temporary credit will be reversed, and the initial charge will apply.

Look for forms.,
Copy the caption.,
Title your motion.,
Write the introductory paragraph.,
Write the body of your motion.,
Request the court dismiss your lawsuit.,
Create a signature block.,
Complete a certificate of service.,
Complete any other necessary forms.,
Sign your motion.,
Make copies of your motion.,
File your motion with the clerk of court.,
Have your motion served on the other parties.,
Wait for a response to your motion.",How to Withdraw a Lawsuit," Many jurisdictions have a form you can use for a motion to dismiss in certain types of cases. You may also be able to find a blank motions form that you can use., Since the caption is the same in every document filed in the case, you can simply copy the caption from a document you filed previously., The title tells the court what kind of document you're filing. In this situation, you commonly would title it ""Motion to Dismiss."", The first paragraph of your motion will state who you are and why you are filing a document with the court.


This paragraph is the introduction, so you don't have to go into any facts or reasons. Simply state who you are, who the other parties in the case are, and that you wish to withdraw your lawsuit against them.

, The body of your motion explains the facts leading up to your request and the reasons you're asking the court to dismiss your lawsuit.


For example, if you and the defendant have come to a compromise and settled the dispute, you might state that and attach a copy of the written settlement agreement as an exhibit to your motion.
Rules in most jurisdictions specify the exact format for motions. Specifically, the body of your motion will list first facts, then reasons for dismissal, in separate, numbered paragraphs.
Make only one statement, fact, or reason per numbered paragraph.The rules in your jurisdiction may specify other formatting instructions, such as the size of paper or color of ink to use. Make sure you review these rules before you finalize your motion., When you ask the court to dismiss your lawsuit, you must decide whether you want the court to dismiss it with or without prejudice.


If you ask the court to dismiss your lawsuit ""with prejudice,"" it means that your lawsuit is dismissed and you can't file any other lawsuits in the future involving the same claim.If you ask the court to dismiss your lawsuit ""without prejudice,"" it means that although this particular lawsuit is dismissed, you still have the right to file another lawsuit involving the same claim in the future.You might choose to have your lawsuit dismissed without prejudice if there was something wrong with the lawsuit that you could easily fix. For example, if you realized after filing the lawsuit that you'd filed in the wrong court, you might file a motion asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice so you could refile your lawsuit in the correct court.

, Write a statement swearing that all information in the motion is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, then leave a blank line or space to sign.


Underneath the space for your signature, type your name and mailing address in a block, just as they would appear on the envelope of a letter. Include your phone number and email address in addition to your mailing address., You typically must include a certificate of service at the end of your motion to let the court know that you will serve your motion on the other parties in the case.Most jurisdictions have a form for the certificate of service, but you must make sure you choose the method of service: either certified mail or hand delivery., Find out from the clerk if you're required to submit any other forms such as a cover sheet with your motion. Each court may have its own local rules., Once you've finished drafting your motion, print it up and sign it.


Some jurisdictions may require you to sign your motion in the presence of a notary. Find out from the clerk before you sign it on your own.

, You should make at least one copy for your own files and one for each other party in the case – the clerk will keep the originals., The clerk will stamp your originals and all your copies, and give the original to the judge for review.


Typically you must pay filing fees to file a motion, unless you've already completed the application to have fees waived in your case. These fees vary among states and among courts within states, but usually the costs will be less than $100 to file a motion., Unless it was a joint motion, you must serve the motion on the other parties to the lawsuit so they know you're withdrawing your claims against them.


You must serve the motion using the same method you chose for the certificate of service.When the motion is served, you must make sure a proof of service is filed with the court so the judge knows the other side knows about your motion.Some jurisdictions require you to mail a copy of the motion to the other parties in your case before you file it, so check with the clerk to see what the correct procedure is., Typically, the person you've sued won't challenge your motion to withdraw the claims against him.


For this reason, the judge usually will simply issue an order dismissing your case without holding a hearing on the matter.
If no hearing is required, the clerk will mail the judge's order back to you once the judge has made his decision."

Negotiate.",How to Win an Accident Settlement," Although getting into a car accident is stressful, try to stay calm. Do not yell at or argue with the other driver, even if you believe that the accident is completely the other driver's fault.Arguing with the other driver or letting your anger get the best of you will not fix your car. It may actually make the other driver angry enough to blame the accident on you or not cooperate with your insurance company.;
, If you or the other driver is injured, help as much as you can until paramedics arrive. You are not typically required by law to give help. But, you may be sued by an injured party for not helping that person if it turns out that the accident is your fault., Call 911 or make sure that the other driver or a witness called the police. Speak with the police and give an honest statement about what happened.Often, insurance adjusters will talk to police officers if there is any question about who's at fault. Not calling the police to the scene could reduce your insurance claim amount.

, You'll need the other driver's name, driver's license number, vehicle type, license plate number, name of his/her insurance company and policy number. Check the insurance policy to make sure it isn't expired.


If the insurance policy is not under the driver’s name, get the insurance policyholder's name and contact information. You'll use this information to contact the other driver's car insurance company and start a car accident claim.

, Take pictures of the scene to show your insurance company later. Take notes. Write down how you believe the accident happened and any other details you remember from the crash.For example, make sure that you write down the road conditions at the time of the accident and exactly what you were doing when the accident occurred (e.g., ""I was stopped at a stop sign when the other car rear-ended me"").

, They can help confirm your story. Ask the witnesses to give a statement to you or the police, and get any witnesses' contact information for later use, if necessary., If you were injured and are having trouble paying your medical expenses or if the settlement offered by the insurance company does not cover all your car repairs, consider hiring a personal injury attorney.The attorney can help you either negotiate with the insurance company or file a lawsuit against the driver who was at fault in your accident.


To find a personal injury lawyer near you: ask family or friends for referrals, search an online phone directory or search engine, or check with your local state bar association for referrals.
If you live in a ""no-fault"" state, you may typically only file suit if your insurance did not fully cover your injury or you suffered a serious injury.
If your insurance company fails to pay a valid claim, you may wish to speak to an attorney about a bad insurance claim against your insurance company.

, Tell the company that you are filing a claim. You'll probably be speaking with a claims adjuster or liability examiner. These employees have the insurance company's best interests in mind, so be careful what information you give.Make sure to ask about your insurance policy's terms. This will give you a better idea of what you're dealing with.

, You don't need to provide details about the accident when you call your insurance company. If the accident wasn't your fault, briefly explain how the other driver caused the accident. Your insurance company will probably want to contact the other driver's insurance company.Simply tell the claims adjuster or liability examiner that you will be filing a claim and will speak to whomever you need to speak with once the investigation into the accident is complete.

, Don't tell your insurance company if you've been injured. Inform the insurance company's representative that you're unsure about the extent of your injuries and that you're going to see your doctor. You have the right to be seen by your doctor, not one that the insurance company chooses.Don’t immediately share your medical records or medical history. An insurance company may want to go through your medical records to try to blame any injuries that you may have on something other than the car accident.

, Keep and file all receipts, reports, estimates, and claim number about the accident. Document other expenses, such as missed work and medical costs. This documentation might include medical records or work excuses from your doctor or supervisor.


Don’t give your insurance company an estimate of what you think the damages from the accident might end up being . If you do, that is essentially the amount of money the insurance company will offer you, regardless of how much your repairs actually cost.

, The claims adjuster will probably want to interview you. Consider writing down your impression of what happened in the accident so you can clearly communicate your views without getting flustered by questions. If the adjuster asks you questions that you do not know the answers to, simply communicate that.Do not speculate about the cause of the accident.

, Get the name and direct number for the person who is assigned to your claim. Try to get to know them and check on the status of your claim. Be polite and friendly to the insurance representative, even if you're stressed or anxious.Angering the person who is handling your insurance claim can slow down the settlement process, and reduce your chances for a large settlement. You want the insurance adjuster to be on your side, or at least to not have a reason to place your claim at the bottom of the pile.

, The insurance company may try to ask questions that force you to admit that the accident was your fault, since no fault has been assigned during the settlement process. If the company tries to do this, simply respond in a way that places the fault on the other driver.If you are responsible in any way for the accident, the evidence will show that. Don’t just assume you may be responsible. This will lower the value of your settlement and increase your insurance costs.
If you live in a no-fault state, this step will likely not apply to your situation. Your insurance company is responsible for covering your claims.

, Focus your answers to questions on the other driver in the accident. This will help you avoid “blaming questions” and will emphasize the other driver’s conduct.For example, don’t say “Driver X and I were in a car accident.” Instead, say “Driver X hit my car when I was stopped at a stop sign at the intersection.”
If you live in a no-fault state, this step will likely not apply to your situation.

, Don’t feel pressured to take the first settlement offer. The insurance company could offer you a settlement quickly in hopes that you don't realize the extent of your possible damages. Instead, wait until you know for sure what all of your costs will be.


Ask the insurance company to send you all offers in writing so you don’t feel pressured to make a split-second decision.Settling quickly may be convenient and save time. But you may end up paying out of pocket if the settlement doesn’t fully cover your medical bills, car repairs or other costs from the accident.

, If the insurance company makes you a settlement offer, you are free to take time to think about the offer. You can ask the company to tell you how it came up with the amount offered. If you think you're entitled to more, you can present documentation to prove your claim.


This documentation would include any medical bills, car repair bills, or documentation of any other expenses you had as a result of the accident.

Consider what a credit card statement is.,
Keep track of your total credit card balance.,
Monitor your available credit.,
Understand how interest works.",How to Understand Credit Card Bills1," In simplest terms, your credit card statement provides a summary of what you’ve done with your card for a specified billing period. Any transactions or changes regarding your account will be included. Note that the specific days of the billing period will always be included. For instance, any purchases or other transaction after the final day of the billing period will be on the following credit card statement., In other words, your credit card statement will help you keep track of your debt. All of the terms, numbers, and percentages on your bill are listed because they all affect your total credit card balance. With each credit card statement, you’ll likely have a new balance. This is true even if you did not make any transactions with your card, as interest is accruing on the money you already owe the credit card company., Your “available credit” is the amount of money you can charge to the card without incurring penalties. This will directly reflect your total credit balance. Your available credit is found by subtracting the amount you already owe from your credit limit., You pay your credit card company for the opportunity to borrow and spend money. The amount you pay is determined by the interest, often referred to as the annual percentage rate. In simplest terms, you pay back the amount you borrow, plus a percentage (your interest rate) of the amount you borrow for each year you carry the debt.Interest is added monthly for each month you maintain a positive credit balance, or each month you owe the credit card company.
For instance, if you borrow $100 on a 20% annual interest rate, you’ll ultimately have to pay the credit card company $120. This includes a return of the amount you borrowed, plus the cost for borrowing it. This cost is determined by the interest rate you agree to when you set up your account. This is an oversimplified scenario that assumes you paid back the full amount in one year, and made monthly payments on time.

Hold onto the credit card.,
Call the number on the back.,
Report the card as lost.Tell the customer service representative the card number and the cardmember’s name.,
Dispose of the card as prompted.",How to Turn in a Lost Credit Card1," If you find the card outside, wipe off any debris so that you can read the card clearly. Pull out your cell phone or walk to the nearest phone. Don’t give the card to someone else.


You shouldn’t give the card to a cashier if you find it in the store. You don’t know if they are trustworthy simply because they work at a business.Don’t call the police, either. They are typically too busy to deal with lost credit cards.
Also don’t try to track down the owner. It’s very easy for an owner to request a new credit card, so you don’t need to waste your time hunting them down.;
, There should be a toll-free number printed on the back of the credit card, which you should call.If the card has become worn or the number is obscured, then go online and find the general number for the credit card issuer.


Avoid delay. Someone else might have found the card before you and written down the number. They could be racking up charges. The sooner you report the card as lost, the sooner the credit card company can freeze the account.

, Also explain where you found the card and when.


Remember to take notes of your conversation. Write down the date and time you called and who you spoke to.

, The credit card issuer should tell you what to do with the card. Typically, they will tell you to cut up the card and throw it away.

Open a merchant account.,
Set up a point of sale (POS) system.,
Set up a mobile credit card processing system.,
Set up an online credit card system for e-commerce.",How to Use a Credit Card System1," A merchant account is a bank account, but it is different from a business checking account. A merchant account communicates with your customers’ credit card issuers. It takes the customer’s credit card information and verifies and approves the sale. Your merchant account communicates with the card issuer to authenticate the user, confirming that the card is not stolen and that the customer has enough of a balance to pay for the sale. If the sale is approved, the merchant account deposits the funds into your business checking account.If you already have a business checking account, you can likely get a merchant account with that bank. You will need to provide financial information about your business, including financial statements and tax returns.;
, A POS system is what you would find in a traditional, physical retail setting where you would accept payment in person. Lease or purchase a credit card terminal and install credit processing software. The system reads the customer’s credit card and processes the credit card payments. It communicates with your merchant account and the customer’s card issuer to authorize the purchase. You can connect the terminal to your router, cable modem or DSL line. Different models come with barcode readers, PIN pads and printers, depending on your needs.The bank through which you obtained your merchant account provides you with this equipment.
Choose a model that is compatible with chip-enabled cards. In the past, credit cards always had a magnetic strip which you would swipe through your credit card terminal. New fraud-protection technology equips credit cards with electronic chips., This type of system allows you to accept credit card payments from multiple locations using your smartphone or tablet. Businesses who might choose this solution include street vendors, delivery services, or repair technicians. Also, a retailers in brick-and-mortar stores might use a mobile system if they want to be able to accept payment in multiple locations in the store.Download a mobile credit card processing app. Using your smartphone or tablet, download an app such as Square, PayPal Here, or Flint. Choose a version of the app that is compatible with your device.
Once you have the app, visit the website of the payment processor’s website. Create an account for your business. You will have to provide your bank account number so payments can be deposited into your account.
Get a card reader. The card reader plugs into the headphone jack on your mobile device. It will be provided to you for free from the payment processor once you sign up. Card readers can also be purchased in drug stores like Walgreens and RiteAid. If you already purchased one, the payment processor company will issue you a credit to reimburse you.

, Obtain shopping cart software and open either a merchant account or a payment gateway account. Shopping cart software consists of many components that connect with a web host, provide tools for setting up your product pages, add a shopping cart, calculate shipping, and taxes and process payments. A merchant account or payment gateway account communicates with your shopping cart software, the customer’s credit card issuer, and your bank account.Hosted shopping cart software is user-friendly and doesn’t require much technical expertise. You have to pay for a monthly subscription, but it is the most cost-effective solution for small businesses. Popular providers include Shopify and Bigcommerce.Self-hosted open source shopping carts are best for big companies who need to customize their e-commerce platform. You have to install them and get web hosting services separately. The programs are usually free, but it can be expensive to pay for the services of someone with the technical expertise to use them. Popular providers include Magento and OpenCart.If you already have a brick-and-mortar store and are setting up an online shopping site, you likely already have a merchant account. Work with your merchant account to set up online credit card payment processing.
If you don’t already have a merchant account, sign up for an online payment gateway. An online payment gateway processes your customers’ credit card authorizations. Popular payment gateway providers include PayPal, Authorize.net, and Stripe."

There are no guarantees that an attorney will be able to win your case. If you choose an experienced attorney, however, they will be able to help you do three thing: assess the strengths and weakness of your case, prepare your case for trial, and give you a much better chance for a successful outcome than if you brought the case yourself.;
, Most often, attorneys specialize in particular areas of the law. In order to identify the appropriate attorney to handle your case, you must first identify what type of legally recognized injury or damages that you suffered. The following are common types of civil lawsuits:


Breach of contract. If you were party to a contract and one or all of the other parties failed to live up to their obligations under the contract then you may have grounds for a breach of contract case. For this type of case, should look for an attorney that specializes in civil litigation and contract disputes. If your business is involved in a contract dispute, look for an attorney that specializes in business law and contract litigation.
Employee lawsuits. If your case stems from an issue with your employer, such as wrongful termination or harassment, you should consider hiring an attorney that specializes in employment law.
Personal injury. If you were injured because of someone else’s negligence, and that negligence caused you to suffer damages, you may have the grounds for a civil case. You should contact an attorney that specializes in personal injury lawsuits.Common types of personal injury cases include injuries sustained from a car accident, medical malpractice, or assault.If your injury occurred while you were at work, the personal injury attorney may refer you to a worker’s compensation attorney or handle the case jointly with them.
General practice attorney. Contact an experienced general practice attorney if you are unsure of what kind of attorney you need. General practice attorneys handle a variety legal cases. This attorney may agree to handle the case herself or refer your case to an attorney that specializes in your type of case., Once you have identified the type of attorney you need, your next step is to find an experienced and reputable attorney that can help you with your case. You can locate attorneys in a number of ways, including:


Referral from friend or family member. If someone you know used an attorney for a civil case, you can ask them whether they would recommend that attorney. A recommendation from a trusted person who has personal experience with an attorney is a good place to start.
Local or state legal bar associations. Local and state bar associations often provide referral services to attorneys in your area. Through state bar associations, you can check whether any complaints were filed against your prospective attorney. The American Bar Association has compiled a list of state-by-state resources that can direct you to attorney referral sites, such as contact information for state bar associations. The ABA provides this information at http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/home.cfm


, Once you have located an attorney, set up an appointment to meet with them in person. For most personal injury cases, attorneys provide free consultations to discuss the specifics of your case. For your initial meeting with the attorney, you should do the following:


Bring copies of any documents, including medical records, that you have and are relevant to your case.
Ask for an explanation of the fees and costs associated with a lawsuit.
Ask the attorney about their experience bringing these types of lawsuits.
Ask the attorney about the litigation process and an estimate on how long the legal process will take.
Ask the attorney who will keep you informed about the case and how best to contact them with questions.
Be open and honest about all of the facts that are relevant to your case.
Take notes during the meeting.
If you choose to hire the lawyer, read any retainer agreement very closely and ask them to explain the document to you in detail. , Your participation is an important part of winning your case. Your attorneys may request that you meet with them to discuss your case, sign medical releases, and prepare for depositions and trial. It is crucial that you attend these meetings so that your case can move forward quickly.

, Depending on the type of case, your attorneys may ask that you get examined by a medical specialist or meet with an expert witness. These specialists are there to provide expert opinions about the damages and injuries that you sustained. Medical evidence and/or expert testimony are important parts of cases involving injury, employment lawsuits and disability claims., After a lawsuit is filed, the case moves into the “discovery” phase. Attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant will send formal, written questions and requests for documents. Your attorney will meet with you to respond to these requests and you may have to sign a verification swearing that you answered the questions truthfully. Your attorney may challenge some of the questions as overboard or burdensome but if a judge rules that you need to respond then you must comply with the ruling., After written discovery is completed, the opposing side of the lawsuit may call for your deposition, which is where you answer questions under oath and in front of a court reporter. Depositions typically take place in a conference room at an attorney’s office. Your attorney will also be present. Before your deposition, your attorney will meet with you to prepare you for the deposition. The purpose of a deposition is so that parties can identify what a witness will say at trial., Often parties will engage in a settlement discussions before trial starts. If your attorney requests your presence at a settlement conference, you should attend. Settlement negotiations, especially negotiations involving a neutral mediator or a judge, give both parties in the lawsuit a chance to get an outside opinion on the strength of the case and how much it is worth. These negotiations can be daylong or multi-day affairs but can result in a guaranteed money settlement. Settlement negotiations can take place before trial, during trial, and up until the moment that a verdict is reached in your case., Many civil cases rely on expert testimony to help prove their case to the jury. When choosing an expert, you want someone who is well credentialed but also persuasive. It could be damaging to your case if you choose someone who can’t speak to the jury, falters over his/her testimony, or seems unsure of himself/herself. Choosing a highly qualified and persuasive expert can provide you with an edge that can tip the jury in your favor., Professional trial consultants provide attorneys with psychological and sociological advice on how best to present your case to a jury. This advice may include the most effective way to present evidence or the best ways to get jurors to relate and sympathize with you. Trial consultants may run mock trials with paid individuals who provide feedback on how attorneys presented a case, what was persuasive and what failed to catch their attention. This feedback allows attorneys to construct the most persuasive case before they enter the courtroom giving them a better chance at winning., Choosing the right jury can greatly impact the outcome of your case. It is important to note that opposing attorneys can agree on a jury member, but their only really power is to strike jurors that they think will hurt their case. For instance, in a medical malpractice case, injured parties don’t want medical personnel on their jury because they want their expert explaining the medical condition.When choosing a jury think about the following:


You want to strike the juror that opposing counsel wants the most.
You want to seem disinterested in the jurors that you want the most so that opposing counsel doesn’t strike them.Be wary of individuals who seem to really want to get on the jury. It is impossible to understand their motivations and therefore more difficult to predict whether they will be good jurors.Speak to the jury in a conversational manner.
Try to relate to them on a personal level.
Appear calm in front of the jury because this is the first impression that the jury will have of your case., During cross-examination, your lawyer will have the chance to question opposing witnesses. Juries are responsible for judging the believability of witnesses so it can be an advantage to your case if you can make opposing witness seem biased or unreliable.When cross-examining witness, it is important to remember the following:


Ask direct and leading questions so that a witness has little opportunity to explain his or her answers.
Do not appear to “badger” the witness or it may make the jury more sympathetic to the opposing side.
If a witness changes their testimony, use their deposition testimony to show that they are providing inconsistent testimony. This may make the jury consider the witness unreliable.
If the witness is hostile to your case, then you must highlight their bias so that the jury understands that their testimony may not be completely reliable., An arbitration is a binding but private judicial determination on the merits of your case. Typically, the parties agree to retain a neutral third party (often a former judge) to hear the evidence and make a judgment. One of the reasons to choose an arbitration is to avoid the expense of trial but still have the opportunity to put on witnesses and present your case for a binding judgment. Some reasons to consider arbitration:


If you are concerned that a jury may not understand the facts of your case or may not like you or your case this may be a good option.
You have an equal say in choosing the arbitrator, which means you may be able to have an arbitrator who is sympathetic to your case or has a greater understanding of the subject matter.
Arbitrators are more likely to allow you to present all relevant evidence, even evidence that may not have been admissible in court. This could provide you with a significant advantage if you know that a judge may keep out evidence important to your case.
Arbitration can be kept confidential, which may induce a party to submit to arbitration who otherwise would try to drag out the trial process.
You can reach a high-low agreement. A high-low agreement allows the parties to choose an amount of money that is the highest possible award a defendant would have to pay as well the lowest amount a plaintiff could receive. If your concerned that you may not be awarded damages or that your case may not be successful, setting a high-low agreement means that even if you lose, you still get some amount of money. It also means that if you win, the defendant will never pay an amount higher than what was agreed on.

, Most often, the plaintiff (the person filing the lawsuit) will choose to have their case decided by a jury. Occasionally, plaintiffs will opt instead for a bench trial, which is when a judge provides the final ruling in the case. A plaintiff may strategically opt for a bench trial if their case is too complicated for a jury to understand., As the trial approaches, your attorneys will meet with you if they intend to call you as a witness in your case. Your attorney will review the questions that they will ask you and also prepare you for cross-examination, which is when the opposing counsel has the opportunity to question you during trial. When testifying at trial, follow your attorneys’ advice and also consider the following:


Listen carefully to opposing counsel’s questions and only answer the question that they ask.
Stop speaking immediately if the judge interrupts you.
Answer the questions truthfully and if you cannot recall something being asked of you, you can answer “I cannot recall.”
Respond verbally to questions being asked.
Try not to lose your temper while testifying.
Do not discuss your testimony with other witnesses., When appearing in court you want to dress in a professional manner. If you are a man, consider wearing a collared shirt and a tie. If you are a woman, considering wearing dress pants, a nice blouse or a dress. Ask your attorney if you have any questions about what type of clothes that you should wear for court. Most attorneys will discuss this with you as part of your trial preparation.

, Most often, your attorneys will want you to be present for the whole trial. Remember, jury members will be watching you throughout the trial and therefore you must appear interested in what is being said but also try not to let yourself get too upset or angry. Civil cases can be extremely emotional events and testimony can often be upsetting. You must do your best to present yourself in a calm manner., During the trial, the attorneys for both parties may engage in settlement negotiations. If your case appears strong to opposing counsel, they may be concerned that a jury decision could go against them and therefore they may want to settle the case. Your attorney will engage in these negotiations, discuss any settlement offers with you, and help you decide, if and when, it is in your best interest to settle your case., If the jury makes a decision in your favor, most often they will indicate the amount of damages to be awarded. If the jury finds in favor of the defendant, no damages are awarded. An attorney may ask that the jury be “polled,” which means that each juror is asked to specify how they voted in the case. Attorneys will do this if they want to know whether a decision was unanimous or if the jurors disagreed. Once the verdict is rendered, the trial is over., If you lost your case, but your attorney believes that there was an error in law, they may choose to file an appeal on your behalf. Most cases are not appealed. If you attorney chooses to file an appeal, an appellate court will only review the mistake raised by your attorney. If the court grants your appeal, the court could rule for a new trial, adjust a judgment or reconsider the facts. If your appeal is denied, you have the opportunity to appeal to a higher court but if your appeal is denied again then the verdict stands."

Locate the summary of account activity.,
Check your payment information closely.,
Note any change in your interest rate.,
Review the transaction data.,
Re-check fees and interest rates.",How to Understand Credit Card Bills2," This portion of your statement will show the totals for the charges, fees, and other transactions made during the billing period covered. Here, you’ll see the totals of the payments you made to the credit card company, credits your account received, and purchases you made with the card. You will also see the totals of balance transfers and cash advances to or from the account.As the name of the section implies, this is a summary of the rest of the information included in the statement. There are separate sections that will list each specific thing that happened to your account, such as each purchase (or type of purchase) you made.

, Your payment information includes the total amount of money you owe (your balance), the minimum payment, and the date your payment is due. The minimum payment will tell you the least amount of money you need to pay by the payment due date.A “late payment warning” will also be included. Here, you’ll find information about the additional fees and change in interest rate that may apply if you miss a payment deadline.

, Changes in your interest rate are extremely important, as they will affect the amount you pay in interest on the money you borrow with your card. Penalty rates will apply if you pay the bill after the due date or if you spent more than your credit limit.Your credit card may also simply change your base interest rate – though they must tell you before they do so. You will have at least 45 days’ notice before a non-penalty rate change.
Note other changes as well. The credit card company may also raise the amount of certain fees or make other changes that could affect your account. If they do so, this information will also be included on a statement 45 days before the changes go into effect.

, You are much less likely to be held responsible for unauthorized charges on your account if you report them quickly. Upon receiving your statement, look at the transactions section of the statement. Ensure that there are no unauthorized or potentially fraudulent charges on the statement. If there are, report them to your credit card company as soon as you are able to do so.The transactions section will also include each cash advance or balance transfer to or from your account. Transactions may be grouped by type, or they may simply be listed in chronological order.
If you and another family member each have a card associated with the same account, the specific cards used for each transaction will be noted.

, The amount of money you can wind up owing your credit card company can add up surprisingly quickly. Refer to the statement's small print to ensure that you are not caught by surprise. The different specific interests and fees associated with your account will also be included in your statement.You’re likely paying different amounts of interest on each type of transaction. Identify which types of transactions lead to the highest interest charges and try to minimize these sorts of transactions.
If there’s a particular fee you keep paying, focus on changing your credit behavior to reduce the money you have to give your credit card company.

Pay your bills on time.,
Do not exceed your credit limit.,
Pay more than the minimum payment.,
Pay down credit card debt before investing.,
Avoid carrying a balance if possible.",How to Understand Credit Card Bills3," Some of the fees most commonly incurred by credit card users are late payment fees. Avoid fees by always making payments before the day they are due. Technically, payments are due at the end of the business day on the bill’s due date.You can likely make payments online. Contact your credit company for the specifics on how to do so.
If you choose to mail in your payments, send in your check a few days before the payment is due to ensure it gets to the credit card company on time.
Aside from late payment penalties, the interest rate you will be charged on the money you borrowed will be higher if your payment is late.
Set a delivery date earlier than the due date for checks sent by your financial institution to avoid late charges resulting from delayed processing by the credit card company.

, Exceeding your credit limit will also lead to an increase in your interest rate. It is important to recognize that the amount you already owe the credit company counts against your credit limit. If, for instance, your credit limit is $10,000, but you already owe $5,000. This means that your “available balance” is $5,000, and you will exceed your credit limit if you charge more than $5,000 more to the card., You statement will include a minimum payment amount. Paying this amount would allow you to pay off your current account balance, plus interest, in three years. This amount assumes that no more charges others than interest are added to the account balance. However, the longer a balance is outstanding, the more you will pay in interest on the money you borrowed. Accordingly, pay more than the minimum amount whenever you are able.Paying $10 more than your minimum payment each month can save you thousands of dollars and shorten the amount of time it takes to pay of your loan by several years.Aim to pay twice the monthly minimum payment each month. This will drastically diminish the amount you pay in total interest.

, Some people are tempted to borrow money on credit and make investments with it. Almost always, however, the interest you’re paying on your credit card balance will negate any potential gains. This is partly because you’re likely paying a relatively high interest on your credit card debt. Investing money instead of using it to pay off your credit card balance is considered to be an almost guaranteed loss of money overall.For example, you might be paying 18 percent on credit card balances, but earning 2 percent on a savings account. This means your credit card balance would drastically offset any gains you make by placing money in savings.
Similarly, don’t try to grow a saving account when you have outstanding credit card balance. Pay off your credit card debt and then start building your savings!
If it helps, think of paying off your debt as an guaranteed investment! Since you’re being charged interest, you can immediately eliminate an increase in the amount of money you owe by paying it off now!

, You know better than paying your minimum balance every month. Even just a bit more than you minimum will help immensely. Of course, it’s best to minimize the amount you borrow and plan ahead to avoid incurring debt altogether.Lots of people maintain financially responsible credit card accounts. The most important thing to remember is that you can minimize the cost of borrowing money by paying it back as quickly as possible.

Create an inventory of the wallet’s contents.,
Avoid turning in the wallet to a business.,
Don’t go searching for the owner.,
Turn over the wallet to the police.",How to Turn in a Lost Credit Card2," If you find an empty wallet, the owner can always claim there was money inside it. Although you can’t completely protect yourself from that accusation, you’ll help yourself if you write down everything that is in the wallet. Type up a list in your smart phone. This will show you were careful about what you found.


Write down the amount of cash in the card and the denomination of the bills. For example, “$46. Two twenties, one five, one one.”
Write down the credit cards.
Note other contents such as the driver’s license, insurance card, etc.

, All you’re doing is turning the wallet over to a different stranger. There’s no reason to think that a store employee won’t steal from someone, so hold onto the wallet yourself.It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t want the wallet in your possession for too long. In that situation, you can ask a store manager if you can use the phone to call the police.

, If you see a wallet drop out of someone’s jacket or pocket, you can pick it up and give it to them. However, if you don’t know who dropped it, you shouldn’t spend time searching for the owner, even if the wallet has a driver’s license in it.


You also shouldn’t mail the wallet back to them. You have no idea if the wallet will even reach the true owner.
Trying to find the owner yourself could also get you in legal trouble. A woman in Wyoming was arrested for not turning the wallet over to the police but instead searching for the owner herself., Your best bet is to hand over the wallet to the police, where it will be kept safely.Also, if there’s no identifying information in the wallet, the police are better equipped to find the owner. Drive to the police station and report that you found a missing wallet.


You might have to fill out some paperwork. At a minimum, you’ll have to give the police your name and address.

Obtain the customer’s credit card information.,
Wait for authorization.,
Access your funds.",How to Use a Credit Card System2," The first step is to read the customer’s information from the credit card. Credit cards either have a magnetic stripe or embedded microchips. These store the customer’s name, account number, the card’s expiration date, and the country.Whatever system you use, you need a method of obtaining this information from the customer’s credit card.


With a POS system, you manually enter the product information into the system or swipe a barcode. The register totals the sale calculates tax. You then swipe the magnetic stripe or scan the microchip with the card reader on your terminal.
With a mobile system, you open up your app and select the products from your products page that the customer is purchasing. The app totals up the cost of the sale including tax. Then, you read the customer’s card with the card reader that plugs into the headphone jack on your smartphone or tablet.
For online purchases, customers visit your website and browse the product pages. They select the items they want to purchase and add them to your shopping cart. When the customer is ready to check out, the software totals up the cost of the merchandise, tax, and shipping. Your shopping cart software provides an interface where customers can manually enter their name, credit card number, expiration date, and billing address.

, Once you have read the customer’s credit card, your payment processing system and merchant account begin the process of authorizing the sale. The payment processing system communicates the customer’s credit card information to your merchant account. The merchant account then communicates with the card issuer to approve or decline the sale. The approval or denial is sent from the card issuer to the merchant account and then back to you at the terminal., At the end of the business day, bundle all of your approvals and send them to your merchant account. Your merchant account holder will deposit the funds into your bank account. Your funds should be in your account within two or three business days.The customer’s card issuer pays the merchant bank for the customer’s purchases. Then, the card issuer bills the customer for the purchase plus any interest.

Compare fees from merchant accounts or payment gateways.,
Compare pricing models.,
Get the lowest rates.",How to Use a Credit Card System3," You will pay fees for accepting credit cards to either your merchant account or your payment gateway provider. The fees include base fees and markups. Base fees are the fees the credit card companies charge for accepting their cards. These are non-negotiable and are the same no matter what merchant account or payment gateway you use. The markup fees vary and may be negotiable.Base fees include interchange fees, which are paid to the card-issuing banks, and assessments, which are transaction fees paid to Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
Markup fees are the fees you should compare when shopping for a merchant account and credit card payment processor. They include transaction fees and flat fees. You pay transaction fees every time you complete a transaction. Flat fees include terminal lease fees, payment gateway fees, compliance fees, annual membership fees, monthly customer service fees, reporting fees, minimum fees, and early termination fees., The pricing model is the method the merchant account or payment gateway uses to pass along the cost of the base fees and the markup fees to you. They will use one of two models. The first is called “interchange plus pricing.” The second is known as “tiered” or “bundled.”The interchange plus pricing model is also known as interchange pass through pricing. This is a simple and transparent model. The base fees are clearly separated from the markup fees. They are itemized for you on your monthly statements.
The tiered or bundled model categorizes credit card transactions into three tiers known as qualified, mid-qualified, and non-qualified. The fees you pay depend on which tier your transactions fall into. Qualified transactions are charged the lowest rates, and non-qualified transactions are charged the highest rates. The problem with the tiered model is that there is no consistency that regulates how transactions are routed into the different tiers. That makes it very difficult to understand your monthly statements and to compare different merchant accounts.

, Try to find a merchant account or payment gateway account that uses the interchange plus pricing model. Since base fees are non-negotiable, look for the lowest overall markup fees. However, expect to pay higher fees for simpler services. While simpler pricing models are easier to understand, the more complicated models are generally more competitive."

Make sure you're safe.,
Organize your documents and evidence.,
File a police report.,
Follow up on your report.,
Contact the district attorney's office.",How to Take Action for Violation of an Injunction1," Before you take action for violation of an injunction, take care that the incident is over and the threat to your safety or the safety of others has ended. If you fear for the immediate safety of yourself or your loved ones, call 911.If you call 911, make sure you have a copy of the order when police arrive. You should keep a copy of the injunction on your person at all times.
Show the police the order and describe what happened. The officers who arrive on the scene will compile a report and give you information about who to contact to follow up.
There are a number of shelters that may be available to help you if you don't feel safe staying where you are. The officers who arrive on the scene should have information on how to contact those organizations.;
, You will need a copy of the injunction or restraining order so the police can review its conditions and the identity of the restrained person. You also should present any evidence you have that the person violated the injunction.For example, if you have a letter from the restrained person, or an email or voicemail message, you should keep it. Resist your natural impulse to delete such evidence or to throw it away.
Particularly with email or other online message on social media or the like, you can print it out or take a screen capture image to show police immediately, but don't delete or destroy the original message after doing so. The original message contains additional information that investigators can use.
If the person physically harmed you, take pictures immediately. Bruises or abrasions can heal relatively quickly, and the photos will serve as evidence of the harm.
If you've suffered significant physical harm, go to the hospital. Doctors and nurses also can serve as witnesses.

, Ideally, you want to go to the police station in person to file your report. This way you can speak to an officer in person, and provide them with a copy of the injunction and any other documents or evidence you have.When you arrive, tell the first officer that you want to file a report for violation of an injunction. That officer may take your statement, or delegate your report to another officer.
The officer who takes your statement will interview you and may question you extensively. Try to answer the questions as openly and completely as you can, even if they involve sensitive topics.
Keep in mind that the more information you can provide to the officer, the more likely the police will arrest the restrained person and bring them to justice.
When the officer has written up your report, they should give you a copy of the report for your records. Keep this in a safe place, and make note of information such as the officer's name and the report number. You'll need this information to follow up on your report.
You don't need to appear in person to file a report if police appeared on the scene. However, if you have additional information you can go to the police station to update the report.

, Although an officer may contact you with status updates on your report, you shouldn't expect it. Call regularly to ensure progress is being made and find out if the restrained person has been arrested.When you call, ask for a status update on your report and provide the officer who answers the phone with the reference number listed on your copy of the report.
If you have any additional information you want to add to the report, let them know that you need to update your report.
If another incident has occurred in the meantime and the person has violated the injunction again, police may want you to file an additional report. The officer will tell you what you need to do.
In most states, police are required by law to investigate the situation and arrest the restrained person for violation of the order. Once the person is arrested, you typically will be notified and told what you need to do next.

, After an arrest is made, the district attorney's office will be in charge of prosecuting the case. If you aren't contacted directly, you can call the district attorney's office to find out which prosecutor has been assigned to the case and what its status is.Keep in mind that in most states you have no discretion to decline to file charges for violation of an injunction. Once the person is arrested, the district attorney will file the appropriate criminal complaint with the courts.
Typically the district attorney assigned to the case will talk to you about your report and the incident that occurred. Give the district attorney as much information or evidence as you have, including a copy of the injunction.
Once criminal charges are filed, the district attorney may ask you to be a witness at trial, if the restrained person intends to defend themselves against the charges.

Go to trial.",How to Take Action Against Partnership Agreement Violations," Before you can take action against a partner, you need to identify what the partner has done to warrant a response. In particular, you need to identify whether the violation was sufficiently serious to warrant expulsion. Common reasons for expelling a partner include:the partner has filed for bankruptcy
the partner has broken the partnership agreement
the partner has committed professional misconduct
the partner has been charged and/or convicted of a crime;
, Your partnership agreement should state whether the partner can be expelled and the grounds for expulsion. Find your partnership agreement and read it. The partnership agreement should also state whether you can expel someone with a majority vote or whether the vote must be unanimous (excluding the partner to be expelled).If you fail to follow the rules in your partnership agreement, then you could be sued for a breach. Accordingly, it is very important to fully understand your partnership agreement before acting to expel the partner.

, You might not have a partnership agreement. Nevertheless, you might still be able to expel the partner. Each state has adopted partnership rules which govern your partnership in the absence of an agreement. For example, many state laws allow you to expel a partner for the following reasons:it becomes unlawful to continue doing business with the partner
the partner transfers substantially all of their partnership interest
a partnership that serves as a partner dissolves
a corporation that serves as a partner stops being in good standing

, Only a qualified lawyer can advise you about whether you can expel a partner. If your partnership doesn’t have a lawyer, then you can find one by asking another partnership if they would recommend their lawyer. You could also contact your bar association and ask for a referral.When you meet with the lawyer, discuss the following:


Does your partnership agreement allow you to expel the partner?
Can the partner be expelled for the particular violation he or she has committed?
If you don’t have a partnership agreement, does your state law allow you to expel the partner?
If you expel the partner, must you dissolve the partnership or can you continue to carry on business?
Could the partner turn around and sue you for a bad faith expulsion?

, If you don’t think the violation was serious, then you should instead talk to the partner. Review whether or not the partner wants to remain in the partnership and think about ways to make the partnership work more effectively.

, The vote might have to be unanimous, or a majority could be sufficient. Check your partnership agreement. If it is silent, then read your state’s partnership law.


Hold a meeting and keep detailed records of the meeting.

, Your partnership agreement should tell you how to give the partner notice. It probably also gives you a deadline for informing the partner. For example, you might have to provide written notice to the partner within 10 days of the vote.


The partnership agreement might also require that you briefly state the grounds for the expulsion., Historically, a partnership had to dissolve once a partner was expelled. However, the law has changed. Generally, you can continue the partnership if the partnership agreement allows you to do so.Read your partnership agreement. There might be a clause that gives the remaining partners the right to continue the partnership after dissolution. The agreement will describe the process. For example, you may have to vote to continue the partnership.If you don’t have a partnership agreement, then you should read your state’s Uniform Partnership Act or check with an attorney. In some states, you can continue on with the partnership in the absence of a written agreement. In other states, you will have to dissolve.

, Once a partner leaves, he or she is entitled to being paid for his or her share of the partnership.Your partnership agreement should explain how to value the partnership’s assets in order to arrive at the value of the partner’s share.If you don’t have a partnership agreement, then your state’s Uniform Partnership Act should spell out the process for valuing the partnership’s assets.

, Your state law might require that you dissolve the partnership if a partner is expelled. However, you can elect to form a new partnership with the remaining members. If you choose not to, then you will need to wind up your business.You should complete any partnership work in progress and then draft a partnership dissolution agreement. Your lawyer can help you draft a comprehensive agreement.
Depending on your state, you may have to file a Statement of Dissolution with your state’s Secretary of State or equivalent office.The partnership will also need to pay its debts by selling some or all of its assets. Partners will get paid for their partnership shares only after debts have been paid.
See Wind Up a Company for more information on the steps you must take.

, In most states, the partnership as a group or an individual partner can seek a court order expelling a partner. Your state law should provide the reasons you can seek an expulsion. Generally, you can seek expulsion for the following reasons:the partner broke the partnership agreement in a material and willful manner
the partner’s wrongful conduct affected the partnership’s business in an adverse and meaningful manner
it’s not practicable to continue to carry on business with the partner

, You will start your lawsuit by filing a “complaint” in court. This document will identify the partner as the “defendant” and the partnership (or individual partner) as the “plaintiff.” This document will also explain the background of the dispute and make a request that the partner be removed.You should hire a lawyer to represent you in the case. A partnership dispute can be very complicated and you should treat all lawsuits seriously.
You will have to pay a fee to file the complaint, which will differ by court. Your lawyer will invoice you for the fee.

, After filing a lawsuit, you need to give the other side notice so that they can respond to your allegations. You will provide this notice by serving a copy of your complaint and a summons, which you can get from the court clerk.Your lawyer should handle service. Generally, you can hire someone to hand deliver a copy on the partner.

, The partner has a certain amount of time to respond to your complaint. Typically, the partner will probably file an “answer” in response. In this document, the partner responds to each allegation that you have made., If you can’t settle the dispute outside of court, then you’ll need to prepare for your trial. The pre-trial period is often quite long. You will request helpful documents from the other side and attend many pre-trial hearings. You should stay in close contact with your attorney.


The most critical aspect of preparing for trial is gathering sufficient evidence to prove that the partner should be removed from the partnership. For example, you might be arguing that the partner’s wrongful conduct harmed the partnership in an adverse and meaningful manner. You will need proof that the partner’s conduct rose to this standard.
For example, you need to gather financial records that show the financial harm done to the partnership because of the partner’s conduct.
You might also need the partner to admit that he or she knew that the actions they took would damage the partnership. Your lawyer can ask the partner questions in a deposition., Because you are asking the judge for an “equitable” remedy, the judge will probably hear your lawsuit instead of a jury. The typical elements of a trial will include the following:Opening statements. Each lawyer will provide a roadmap of the evidence they will present.

Witness testimony. You get to go first. Your lawyer will need to present sufficient witness testimony and documentary evidence that shows the partner should be expelled for one of the reasons identified in your state law.

Cross-examination. The partner will present witnesses second and your lawyer can ask them questions.

Closing arguments. Each lawyer summarizes the evidence and argues that it supports their position. As the person bringing the lawsuit, you bear the burden of proof that the partner should be expelled.

Participate in mediation.",How to Sue for Sexual Harassment," Before you report sexual harassment at any level, you need to have documentation that it's occurring and that it is interfering with your ability to do your job.Two types of sexual harassment are recognized by anti-discrimination laws: quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environments. The type of evidence you need will differ depending on which type of harassment you're experiencing.
Consider keeping a journal or diary in which you write down each instance of harassment as soon as possible after it happens. Include details such as the date, time, location, and context of the incident, as well as the names of your harassers and any witnesses. This sort of log is especially helpful in hostile work environment cases.
Quid pro quo harassment occurs when a supervisor or other employee with some measure of authority over you threatens your job in some way unless you're willing to perform sexual favors for him or her, or acquiesce to sexual acts.
Keep in mind that sexual harassment can occur regardless of your past relationship with someone.
For example, if you used to date one of your co-workers but then the two of you broke up, if he continues to make sexual advances or lewd sexual comments to you at work, that behavior could be construed as sexual harassment.;
, Before you take the next step and file a charge with the EEOC, give your employer notice of the problems you're having and the opportunity to correct the situation.Read your employee handbook and find out what your company's policy is for reporting sexual harassment. If someone is designated to take complaints, address your notice to that person.
However, don't hesitate to go to someone else if the designated person is the one harassing you, or if you don't feel comfortable talking to him or her about the situation.
Submit your complaint in writing so you have proof that you provided your employer with notice of the situation in the event nothing is done or the harassment continues.
Provide thorough details in your complaint, including dates, times, locations, and the names of all employees present when the harassment occurred, as well as a description of what transpired.
State that you consider the behavior sexual harassment in violation of state and federal laws, and if it doesn't cease you will be taking further action to protect yourself and enforce your rights to a safe and harassment-free workplace.
Keep in mind that under federal law you only have 180 days from the date of the most recent incident of harassment to file a charge with the EEOC if you want to preserve your right to sue. Don't lose sight of this deadline so you can go ahead and file a charge if your employer is slow to respond to your complaint.

, To preserve your right to sue for sexual harassment, you must first file a charge with a state or federal administrative agency.You can use the EEOC's online assessment tool at https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/ to quickly and easily determine if you're eligible to file a federal charge.
Federal law only covers businesses with at least 15 employees who have worked at least 20 calendar weeks in the past year. However, your state law applies to businesses with fewer employees, so if you aren't protected by federal law you may still be able to file a state charge.

, The EEOC's intake questionnaire asks for basic information about you, your employer, and the sexual harassment you're experiencing in your workplace.If your employer isn't covered by federal law, contact your nearest state fair employment agency to learn the process for filing a charge there.
To start the federal charge process, download the EEOC's questionnaire at https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/uniformintakequestionnaire09.pdf. You can take all the time you need to fill it out at home, then print it up to submit.
You also can pick up a print questionnaire from the nearest EEOC field office and fill it out by hand if you prefer.
If you're eligible to file state and federal charges and want to file both, find out if your state has a dual-filing procedure in which the state agency will file your federal charge on your behalf, so you don't duplicate your efforts.

, Generally you must take your questionnaire to the nearest EEOC field office once you've finished filling it out.If you're filing a state claim, you'll need to follow the procedures of your state's fair employment agency.
If your employer is subject to both state and federal law, you typically can dual-file a charge with both agencies by filing with your state agency, which will file a duplicate charge with the EEOC on your behalf.
To file a charge directly with the EEOC, you must submit your questionnaire to the nearest EEOC field office – you cannot submit questionnaires electronically. The EEOC has a map available at http://www.eeoc.gov/field/index.cfm so you can find the closest location.
Given that there are only 53 EEOC field office, the nearest one to you may still be too far for you to travel. If this is the case, call the office where you need to submit your questionnaire and talk to an agent before you mail your questionnaire. The agent will ensure it gets to the right place and that you don't miss the deadline.

, The EEOC will assign your charge to an agent, who will contact you with any additional questions so he or she can begin investigating your charge.One benefit of taking your questionnaire to the field office in person is that usually you can complete your interview with an EEOC agent the same day.
If you mail your questionnaire, the agent assigned to your charge will either call you or mail you a list of additional questions to complete and return.

, The EEOC will send a copy of your charge to your employer within 10 days of your interview, along with instructions on what actions the EEOC is requesting your employer to take.If the EEOC finds no violation, you will receive a right-to-sue notice.
If the EEOC does find a violation of federal law, it either will send you and your employer to mediation, or assign an investigator. If an investigator is assigned, your employer will be required to submit a written response to your charge.
You will receive a right-to-sue notice if you are unable to reach a settlement through mediation, or if the investigator forwards your charge to the EEOC's legal team and they decline to file a lawsuit on your behalf.
The EEOC is allowed 180 days under the law to investigate your charge. If that period is drawing to a close and the investigation is not yet complete, you can request a right-to-sue notice. You generally will be given one if the EEOC determines the investigation won't be completed by the 180-day deadline.

, If the problem remains and the EEOC has issued you a right-to-sue letter, an experienced employment discrimination attorney can help you navigate your next steps to enforce your rights.Employment discrimination attorneys often will work on contingency – especially if you have a strong case – meaning you won't have to pay any attorney's fees or court costs out of pocket while your case is being litigated.
An attorney working on contingency will take a percentage of your settlement or award as fees, as well as deducting all costs such as filing fees that accrued, before writing you a check for the remainder.
To find an attorney, you might want to begin your search on your state or local bar association's website. Typically there is a searchable directory of members, and there also may be a referral service that will provide you with names of attorneys who take cases like yours based on your answers to a few questions or your brief description of your case.
Try to interview at least three attorneys before you make your final selection so you can compare and contrast to find the best attorney for you. Pick someone who has significant experience in litigating sexual harassment lawsuits similar to yours.

, Once you've chosen an attorney, he or she will need all the information you have about the harassment you've experienced to craft a complaint and proceed with litigating your case.A good place to start is by providing your attorney with copies of everything you submitted to the EEOC or your state agency when you filed your charge.
If you have additional information, such as a diary or journal you've kept detailing each incident of harassment, you should also give this to your attorney.
Your attorney also will need information about the injuries or losses you've suffered so he or she can calculate the amount of money to ask for in damages. This potentially would include lost wages, if you missed work directly or indirectly because of the harassment.
Mental suffering can be hard to quantify, but if you have the names of people who can speak to the mental distress you suffered as a result of the harassment, or if you've been seeing a psychological professional, that can help your attorney calculate your damages.

, You must take your complaint and any other required documents to the clerk of the court that will hear your case to initiate your lawsuit.Generally, if you're filing for a violation of federal law, you'll need to file your lawsuit in federal court. If your employer isn't subject to federal law, you will need to use your state courts.
Your attorney will go over the complaint with you before it's filed. Generally, the document provides your name and address, your employer's name and address, defines the court's jurisdiction, and sets forth the allegations that state a claim of sexual harassment in violation of state or federal laws, along with the amounts you're claiming in damages.
When your complaint is filed, the clerk will assign it to a judge and give it a case number which will be used to identify your case in all subsequent filings.
Filing a complaint requires payment of a filing fee of several hundred dollars. Assuming your attorney is working on contingency, he or she will pay this amount and add it to the costs of your lawsuit to be deducted from any settlement or award.

, From the date you filed your complaint, you have 120 days to deliver it to your employer through the proper legal process.Typically a complaint must be hand-delivered, or served, to the defendant. U.S. Marshals take on this duty in federal courts, while in state court a complaint would be served by a sheriff's deputy in the county where the employer is located.

, Once your employer has received your complaint, he or she has 21 days to file an answer or other motion in response.If the deadline passes and your employer doesn't file any response to your lawsuit, you may be eligible to win by default – but given that your employer has fought your claim so far, don't expect this to happen.
Most likely, your employer will file an answer in which he or she denies most if not all of the allegations in your complaint and includes several defenses.
Your employer also may file a motion to dismiss. If this happens, you can expect a court hearing where you must prove to the judge's satisfaction that your claims are meritorious and should be allowed to proceed.

, Through the discovery process, you and your employer will exchange information in an effort to build your respective cases and prepare for trial.One of the most important discovery methods in a sexual harassment case is the deposition. Through depositions, parties and witnesses are interviewed under oath about the allegations in the case. A court reporter records the questions and answers and creates a transcript for later reference.
You have the ability to depose your employer, supervisors, and other employees who have witnessed the harassment you experienced. Many of these witnesses may offer strong testimony that makes your case more compelling.
Written discovery in the form of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production also can be beneficial to your case. These generally are documents with questions or requests that call for written answers under oath.
For example, through requests for production you can ask your employer for copies of personnel records, company sexual harassment policies, and written documents or correspondence among managers or supervisors related to your sexual harassment claim.

, Throughout the pretrial period, your employer typically will make offers to settle the case out of court rather than continue with a public trial.If your employer offers to settle the case, your attorney must present the offer to you. He or she may advise you on whether to accept the settlement, reject it, or make a counter-offer, but the ultimate decision on what to do is yours alone.
Keep in mind that most sexual harassment cases settle before trial. Employers prefer this because a settlement doesn't involve any admission of fault, and the confidential nature of a settlement's terms keeps the matter out of the public eye.
It may be to your advantage to take a settlement offer, even if the amount is significantly lower than what you've asked for in your complaint, because of the time, effort, and expense of taking a case to trial. Additionally, you should keep in mind that there's no guarantee you will win, or that you will win as much as what you've asked for in your complaint.

, The judge likely will hold hearings on motions filed by either you or your employer, as well as calling periodic conferences.The judge likely will hold a number of scheduling conferences, depending on how long the litigation lasts. Scheduling conferences typically are only attended by the judge and the attorneys, and set deadlines for various pretrial phases to ensure the case stays on track and neither party is unreasonably dragging things out.
Closer to the time of the trial itself, the judge likely will call a final conference to lay out the order in which the trial will proceed and the evidence that will be presented.

, Many courts require litigants to at least attempt to resolve their dispute through mediation before a trial will be scheduled.The court typically will either assign a mediator or allow the parties to choose from a list of court-approved mediators. These professionals are trained in dispute resolution and will facilitate a discussion between you and your employer aimed at reaching a mutually agreeable settlement.
Even if you tried mediation earlier with the EEOC and failed to reach a settlement, you should keep in mind that negotiations may be significantly different at this point, especially considering the amount of information that has been revealed through discovery.
If you come to an agreement through mediation, the mediator typically will write it up for the attorneys to review before it is signed. Some courts may require your settlement agreement to be approved by the judge.
If you reach an impasse at mediation and are unable to settle, you and your attorney will have to work together to develop your trial strategy and prepare your evidence and witnesses for trial.

Go to the clerk's office.,
Consider hiring an attorney.,
Gather your evidence.,
Outline the incident.,
Sign your affidavit.,
Submit your affidavit.,
Follow up on your case.",How to Take Action for Violation of an Injunction2," If no arrest has been made, many states allow you to swear out an affidavit attesting to the injunction violation. An affidavit can be valuable where you have no hard evidence to prove the violation. The clerk of the court that issued the injunction will have the appropriate paperwork.You may want to call the clerk's office before you go there in person to find out what sort of documents you will need to bring with you. Typically you will at least have to bring a copy of the injunction.
If the violation occurred in a different county than the county where the court that issued the injunction was located, you should go to the clerk of the court with jurisdiction over the county where the violation occurred.
The clerk will assist you in preparing your affidavit, but keep in mind they cannot provide you with legal advice, only instruct you on the procedural requirements for completing your affidavit.
The clerk also can let you know what the proper procedures are for enforcing an injunction in that court.
Keep in mind that if you have an injunction from another state, there may be additional documents that must be filed before you can have the injunction enforced in the state courts where the violation occurred.

, An attorney can help you navigate the court system and enforce your injunction effectively. In many states you may be entitled to an award of attorney's fees from the restrained person if they ultimately are convicted of violating the injunction.Although you typically are not entitled to a court-appointed attorney, there are numerous nonprofit organizations that may connect you with a volunteer attorney to help you.
You also may be able to get assistance from your local legal services office.
If criminal charges are filed, the prosecution of the case will be taken over by a district attorney at no charge to you. However, if you end up having to file a civil action you may need legal assistance.

, Any documentation or other proof you have of the injunction violation, such as a voicemail message, should be mentioned in your affidavit. Paper documents such as a letter from the restrained person typically can be attached to your affidavit.Take care to preserve any evidence of the violation, even though your first impulse may be to destroy it. To be used as evidence in court, it must be preserved in its original, unaltered state.
For example, if the restrained person sends you an email, don't delete the email even if you print it out. A print-out of an email doesn't contain all the same information that the email itself does, and that information can be used to authenticate that the email did indeed come from the restrained person.
At a minimum, you'll need a copy of the injunction, which you typically must attach to your affidavit.

, Your affidavit should describe the conditions of the injunction and provide a clear factual account of the encounter that constituted a violation of those conditions. You also should describe your actions after the incident occurred.Make note of the specific conditions of the injunction that the restrained person violated through their actions.
Include as many details as possible, including the date, time, and location of the incident.
Describe the incident in chronological order, and stick to the facts as much as possible.
You can state how the incident made you feel, particularly if the person instilled fear, but avoid making opinionated remarks or speculating on the restrained person's motivation or intent.
At the same time, keep in mind that in most cases criminal sanctions are only available for intentional violations, not accidental or coincidental violations. If you have any evidence or factual knowledge that the restrained person acted with knowledge that their actions were in violation of the injunction, you should include this in your affidavit.

, Typically an affidavit must be signed in the presence of a notary public. The notary verifies your identity and serves as a witness to the signing of the affidavit, but they don't have to read the affidavit or know any of the details of your situation.A notary public typically is available at the courthouse for a small fee. You also may be able to find a notary public at your bank, since they often offer notary services free of charge to their customers.
In some courts, you may sign your affidavit in front of the clerk rather than seeking out an independent notary public.
After you've signed your affidavit and had it notarized, make at least one copy of it for your records.
Depending on the court's rules, the clerk may want additional copies from you. The clerk can make copies, but typically you'll be charged a fee per page.

, Once your affidavit is completed and signed, you must take it back to the clerk's office so it can be properly filed with the court and law enforcement. Typically it will be turned over to the district attorney's office or the local police department so charges can be filed against the restrained person.Typically there are no fees associated with filing an affidavit in support of a violation of an injunction.
Once you submit your violation to the clerk of the court, the information regarding the violation will be forwarded to the district attorney's office. A district attorney will take charge over your case at that point.

, A police officer or district attorney may want to meet with you to discuss the contents of your affidavit. If the restrained person is arrested, you also may be called upon to serve as a witness at trial.If your affidavit and information about the violation is forwarded to the district attorney, they typically will contact you first for additional information.
You typically can call the clerk to check on the status of your case or get information about what's being done regarding the violation.
If no criminal actions are taken, you may have to file a civil contempt action to enforce your injunction. The clerk will let you know if you need to go that route.

"
Get the appropriate forms.,
Consider consulting an attorney.,
Complete your forms.,
Submit your forms to the clerk.,
Have the restrained person served.,
Organize your evidence.,
Attend the hearing.",How to Take Action for Violation of an Injunction3," Since an injunction is a court order, you also can file a contempt complaint or motion to have the person held in contempt for the violation. The specific documents you'll need vary greatly among jurisdictions, so your best course of action is to contact the clerk of the court that issued the injunction.You also can get civil contempt forms by contacting the clerk of the court located in the county where the violation occurred.
However, keep in mind that if your injunction was issued in a different county or state than where the violation occurred, you may have to complete additional paperwork to register your injunction before it can be informed by that court.
Whether you use a complaint or motion depends on the court in which you are filing your contempt action. If you're filing a contempt action in the same court that issued the injunction, typically you will file a motion using the same case number that was listed on your original injunction.
The clerk will let you know what documents must be completed and filed and the court's procedure that you must follow to enforce your injunction. However, the clerk will be unable to give you any legal advice concerning your case.
If you're seeking to enforce a restraining order or other domestic protection order, you should file a civil contempt action only as a last resort. Violation of these injunctions is a criminal offense and typically should be addressed by the criminal justice system through the district attorney.
For other types of injunctions, filing a civil contempt action is your only method of enforcement.

, An attorney can ensure you're filling out the forms and filing them correctly, as well as represent you at the hearing. Having an attorney speak on your behalf can be especially beneficial if you know you will be threatened or intimidated by the presence of the restrained person in the courtroom.Additionally, keep in mind that since a contempt charge could result in jail time, the restrained person may have the right to a court-appointed attorney if they can't afford to hire someone.
For this reason, it's worthwhile to have an attorney on your side.
If you question your ability to afford attorney's fees, contact your local legal services office. There also are a number of nonprofit organizations dedicating to assisting victims of domestic violence in particular that may be able to assist you.

, Either on your own or with your attorney, you'll need to draft a complaint or motion outlining the violation of the injunction and the reason you're requesting the restrained person be held in contempt for these violations.At a minimum, your complaint or motion must contain factual allegations that describe the incident you assert constitutes a violation of the injunction.
If you're filing a motion, you may not need to go into detail about the injunction since the motion is filed under the same case number and that information is readily available to the court.
However, if you are filing a complaint, you may need to begin by providing details about the injunction, including information about when and where the order was issued and the specific conditions of the injunction that you allege were violated.
Include as many factual details as possible, including the date, time, and location of the incident that constituted a violation of the injunction.
You also may want to include references to any evidence you have of the violation, or the names and contact information of witnesses.

, Once all the required court documents have been completed and signed, you must take the originals and at least two copies to the clerk of the court that issued the original restraining order.You may want to contact the clerk ahead of time and find out how many copies are required and whether you must pay a fee to file the documents. In most states there are no court fees associated with enforcing an injunction related to a protective order or restraining order.
For other types of injunctions, you typically must pay a small fee, usually under $100, to file a motion to enforce the injunction.
The clerk will stamp your originals and copies ""filed"" with the date you submitted them. You'll get the two copies back, one of which is for your own records and the other of which must be delivered to the person you want to enforce the injunction against.

, Before the restrained person can be held in contempt, they must have sufficient legal notice of the allegations of contempt and an opportunity to defend themselves in court.The service process for a civil contempt action will be the same as the process you followed to get the original injunction.
Typically you will have the restrained person served by providing a copy of the court documents to the sheriff's department in the county where the person lives. A sheriff's deputy will hand-deliver the documents to the person and complete the proof of service document once that action is completed.
You also can use a private process serving company. Private process servers can be particularly beneficial if the person is attempting to evade service or if they have done so in the past.
In some states you also may have the option of serving the person by sending the documents using certified mail with returned receipt requested. This option may be easier, however it may not be the most efficient, particularly if the person has a history of evading service.

, For the restrained person to be held in contempt, you will have to be able to prove in court that they violated the judge's injunction. Any documents or other physical evidence will make a stronger case than if you have to rely solely on your own testimony.In terms of documents, you typically must have the originals to present as evidence with the court. There are authentication procedures that must be followed, which you can learn by reading the court's rules of evidence if you don't have an attorney.
If there were witnesses to the incident, make a list of their names and contact information. You may want them to appear in court to testify on your behalf, in which case you may need to work with the clerk to have a subpoena issued.
Make sure you talk to any witnesses you plan to call before the date of the hearing so you can go over questions they'll be asked and gain an understanding of what they will say.

, If you want the restrained person to be held in contempt for violation of an injunction, you must appear in court on the day the hearing is scheduled and argue your case before a judge.Keep in mind that the restrained person will be in the courtroom at the hearing. If you don't have an attorney, you may want to consider bringing along a friend or family member for moral support.
If the restrained person does not show up at the hearing, they automatically will be held in contempt and a bench warrant will be issued for their arrest.

Consider next steps.",How to Sue a Parolee for Assault," You will need evidence if you want to bring a lawsuit for assault. One important piece of evidence is the police report, if there is one. You may have been given a copy of the police report after talking to the police. Alternately, you might need to contact the police station.See Obtain a Police Report for more information.;
, You should try to identify witnesses who observed the assault. The police report should identify any witnesses if you didn’t know anyone personally.You want to talk to them because they could serve as witnesses in your lawsuit.


Ask what they saw. Ideally, they saw the defendant make a threatening gesture towards you.
Get their names and also a written statement, if possible.
Also find personal contact information, such as a phone number or email address. You will want to stay in contact with them as the trial approaches.

, You are also an important witness to the assault. In particular, only you can testify that you felt you were in danger of being struck. As soon as possible, sit down and write down the circumstances surrounding the encounter.


Also explain if you felt startled. Technically, you don’t need to experience any particular reaction in order to sue for assault. However, your case will be stronger if you were shocked or experienced some other intense emotion, like fear.

, You can be compensated for any physical injury.If the defendant actually struck you, then you can sue for “assault and battery.” Medical records are good proof of the injury you suffered.


You should also take color photographs of any bruises, cuts, nicks, scrapes, or stitches.

, You might also be able to get compensated for emotional distress caused by the assault.You can document your emotional distress by keeping a journal in which you write down daily how you are feeling.


If you were prescribed medication to take, then you should also save those orange bottles. You can be compensated for any medicine you buy. Prescription drugs also serve as proof of injury.

, You can also get compensated for lost income if you are unable to continue working as a result of the assault.You should find the following, which will help show how much money you have lost:


paystubs
W-2 form
proof of self-employed income
tax returns

, You will probably benefit from consulting with a lawyer about your lawsuit. A lawyer can help you think through what evidence you will need to bring a successful lawsuit. A lawyer can also analyze your situation and tell you whether you have a strong case.


To Choose a Personal Injury Lawyer, start by asking your family and friends for recommendations. Lawyers rely on their clients to refer others, so this is a great way to find trustworthy lawyers.
You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the lawyer and ask to schedule a consultation. Also ask how much the consultation will cost.

, Each state has a “statute of limitations,” which is the maximum amount of time you get to bring a lawsuit. The amount of time will differ by state. It is incredibly important to recognize the time constraints and file before the statute of limitations expires. In your situation, because you are suing a parolee, you may be cutting it really close. In some circumstances, the statute of limitations may be tolled (i.e., suspended) for a period of time.

For example, in California, the statute of limitations might be tolled when a defendant is in prison. When the offender gets out of prison, the statute of limitations will begin to run again.
Therefore, in a state like California, you may get longer than the normal two years to file your personal injury suit against the offender., Before suing, you should confirm that you actually have a legal case for assault. Assault is defined as someone intentionally creating a reasonable apprehension that you will suffer harmful or offensive contact.If someone raised their fist to strike you, then they probably have committed an assault—provided you saw them make the action and felt in immediate danger of being punched.


The defendant doesn’t need to actually touch you in order to assault you. It is the belief that you are about to be harmed that is the injury.
However, assault cannot consist of only threatening words.Someone has not assaulted you by sending a Tweet that states “I am going to punch you” or by shouting at you that they want to hurt you.
Also consider your injury. You can sue for assault, even where you haven’t suffered physical injury or emotional distress. However, you won’t recover much money, which could make the entire lawsuit a waste of time.

, In order to collect money damages in a suit against a parolee for injuries caused by them, you must have suffered some quantifiable harm. Work with your lawyer to determine how much this might be. In general, the court will award damages for economic harm and non-economic harm.

Economic damages are verifiable losses for things like medical expenses, property damages, and lost earnings. These damages can usually be determined by using receipts and bills.
Non-economic damages are more subjective losses for things like pain and suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment. These damages are usually calculated by multiplying your economic damages by a number between 1.5 and 5 depending on the severity of the harm., Punitive damages are meant to punish.Usually, they are awarded for intentional, highly-offensive conduct. Because assault is intentional, you might qualify for punitive damages.


Not every state allows punitive damages, so you should specifically ask your lawyer if your state does.

, You should also report the assault to the parolee’s officer, since they need to know whether the parolee has violated the law. You can find a parole officer by calling the probation department in your county.


The police should also bring the assault to the attention of the prosecutor. If not, you should report the assault to the police if you haven’t already done so.

, Restitution is a court ordered penalty requiring the offender to pay you an amount of money that begins to cover your losses stemming from a crime. Restitution will generally cover medical and dental costs, mental health counseling, funeral costs, income loss, relocation expenses, security system expenses, attorney fees, and potential future losses.

Restitution is set, by a judge, at the time the offender is sentenced., As soon as you can, contact the district attorney and ask whether restitution is available in your particular case. Chances are, if you suffered a financial harm as a direct result of the offender's assault, you will be eligible. DAs may even proactively send you restitution forms to fill out.

The DA often has a very short window to present your restitution case to the judge. Therefore, it is very important that you fill out forms and/or talk to the DA as soon as possible after the offender is charged., The DA, during sentencing, will be asked to provide evidence of your injuries so a definite restitution amount can be determined by the court. Therefore, it is important that you hand over all the evidence you have about the injuries you sustained and the financial harm it cost you. This paperwork will be the same type of paperwork that you have been collecting for your civil case. For example, you should gather and hand over the following types of documents:Bills (hospital, dental, funeral, etc.)
Receipts
Expenses
Insurance information

, Once the judge imposes restitution on the offender, your state's department of corrections, and potentially other agencies, will help you collect. While the offender is in prison, money will be taken out of their trust account as it comes in. Generally, the corrections department will be able to take up to 50% of the money offenders receive. That money will then be transferred to you.

Once the offender leaves prison, your information is automatically forwarded to your state's taxing agency. That agency will work to collect on your behalf through the use of wage garnishments, bank liens, and payment plans.
If you are not getting paid, you can file a civil lawsuit and, as a part of your larger case, ask the court to submit a court order requiring the offender to pay.
Restitution orders will never expire, even if the offender files for bankruptcy, so you can continue to collect until you have been paid in full., You can’t just sue someone anywhere. Instead, you can typically sue them in the county where they live. This may be the same county that you live in.


If the parolee lives in a distant county or in another state, then you need to consider this fact as part of your calculation as to whether you should sue. Talk about it with your lawyer.
Also think about whether you want to sue in small claims court. These courts are set up so that people can bring lawsuits without a lawyer’s help. Generally, there is a maximum amount you can sue for in small claims court.Check with the court clerk.

, You start a lawsuit by filing a “complaint” in court. This document identifies you as the person suing (the “plaintiff”) and the person who assaulted you as the “defendant.” In many courts, there are printed, “fill in the blank” complaint forms you can use. Check the court’s website or with the clerk. Your complaint should contain the following:


A description of the factual circumstances surrounding the assault.Make sure to mention the elements of assault—that the defendant’s action was intended to create a reasonable apprehension of harmful or offensive contact.A claim that the assault injured you in some way. The apprehension of offensive or harmful contact is itself an injury, but mention all injuries, including emotional distress.
A request for money compensation, including punitive damages if they are available.
Whether you want a jury (available in some small claims courts).
Your signature.

, When you finish the complaint, make a copy for your records. Then take the completed complaint and your copies to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. Depending on your court, you may need to file copies as well.


You probably have to pay a filing fee. Ask the clerk for the amount and what methods of payment are acceptable.
If you can’t afford the filing fee, ask for a fee waiver.

, You have to give the defendant a chance to respond to your complaint. For this reason, you need to send them a copy of your complaint and a “summons,” which you can get from the court clerk.You generally can make service in one of the following ways:


Pay the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery on the defendant.
Hire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers listed in your phone book or online.
Have someone 18 or older make hand delivery, provided they are not a party to the lawsuit.
Mail the complaint certified mail, return receipt requested. You can often mail the complaint if you sue in small claims court.

, The defendant will probably file an “answer.” In this document, they will respond to each allegation that you made in your complaint.You should read the answer closely.


The defendant might file a “motion to dismiss” instead. This document is a little different from an answer. Usually, a defendant will bring a motion to dismiss if you sued in the wrong court or didn’t allege all of the elements of assault. There may be other reasons.If you receive a motion to dismiss and don’t understand it, meet quickly with your attorney.

, The defendant might not even respond to the lawsuit or might respond after the deadline. In either situation, you might be able to get a default judgment.Once you have a default judgment, you can try to get compensated for your injury.


See File a Motion for Default Judgment for additional information.

, If you receive a response from the parolee, they will likely be contesting your petition. At this stage of the action, you will take part in discovery, which allows both sides to collect and exchange information in order to prepare for trial. During discovery you will collect facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other side is going to say, and figure out how strong your case is. In order to achieve these things, you will be able to use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal, in person interviews with parties and witnesses conducted under oath. The answers given can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are formal questions, posed in writing, that parties and witnesses are required to answer. The answers given can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are written requests asking the other party to give you certain documents. You might ask for things like text messages, email exchanges, and pictures.
Requests for admission, which are written statements the other party is required to admit or deny. These statements help narrow the focus of litigation and determine what the true issues are.

, When discovery concludes, the defendant is likely going to try and end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. If successful, the judge will stop the case and immediately rule in the defendant's favor. To succeed, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge will rule in the defendant's favor, if, even if the judge makes every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose.

You can defend against this motion by filing a response. Your response will include specific affidavits and pieces of evidence that tend to prove that factual disputes do exist. If you succeed, the litigation will continue., If you successfully defend yourself at the summary judgment stage, you should discuss a settlement with the defendant. Trials are incredibly expensive and time consuming and settling is a great way to avoid that. Ask the defendant to sit down with your lawyer and discuss a way to come to an agreement. If informal discussion fail, you might need to take part in some other alternative dispute resolution program.

For example, you might ask the defendant to take part in mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the defendant to discuss unique ways to settle the case. The mediator will not take sides and will not inject their own opinions.
If mediation fails, try non-binding arbitration. During arbitration, a judge-like third party will hear both sides of the case. After evidence has been presented, the arbitrator will draft a written opinion stating who they think should win, and how much they should be awarded.

, As you approach trial, you should pull your evidence together. Identify the witnesses who you want to call, if any. Also get copies of documents you want to introduce. For example, if you have medical records, then you will want to introduce those into evidence.


Your witnesses must have personal knowledge of what they are testifying about.For example, a witness who saw the defendant throw a punch at you can testify as to what they saw. However, the witness can’t testify to gossip.
You will likely have to turn over a copy of all documents you intend to use as exhibits. You can make an exhibit by attaching an exhibit sticker to a corner of the document.

, It is perfectly normal to be nervous about what will happen at trial. Ideally, you can prepare by sitting in on one. Check the court’s calendar to see when a trial is being held. Make note of where the parties sit and how they talk to witnesses and the judge.

, Right before the trial begins, you will be required to attend one final pretrial conference with the judge and defendant. During this conference, the judge will set the trial schedule, which includes what matters can be heard. It is your responsibility to tell the judge everything you plan on saying during trial. If you fail to do so, the judge may leave an important issue off of the trial schedule, which means you may not be able to bring it up., If you requested a jury, then you will pick the jury first. Then you will present your evidence to show that the defendant assaulted you. You can call your witnesses and testify on your own behalf.The defendant will get a chance to cross-examine all of your witnesses.
As you testify on cross-examination, remember to listen closely to the question asked and request clarification if necessary. Always remember to tell the truth., The defendant gets to present evidence second. Typically, you can ask every witness questions on cross-examination if you think it would be helpful.See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.

, If you had a jury, the judge will read the jury its instructions and then let them retire to deliberate.If you don’t have a jury, then the judge should deliver a verdict from the bench.

, Your work doesn’t end with the verdict. If you win the lawsuit, you face the task of recovering monetary compensation from the defendant. Ideally, the defendant will just pay up. However, if they don’t, then you might need to take other actions.


If you lost the lawsuit, you might want to consider filing an appeal.You start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. You typically don’t get much time—usually 30 days or less after the verdict becomes final. You should talk with a lawyer about whether it is worthwhile to take an appeal.

Chase offers many different types of credit cards.

, After you have browsed the different cards available, you should narrow your choices down to a few good options.


If this is your first time applying for a card, you should start with a very basic one. For example, cards with no annual fees (such as the Chase Freedom card) tend to be a good option, but they typically come with very few frills.
One thing to consider is how you will use the card. If you plan to use the card for small purchases, and to pay the balance in full each month then the interest rate of the card is not so important. However, if you plan to use the card for a big purchase, which will require you to pay the balance slowly over time, make sure you look for the lowest interest rate.Also consider your credit history when choosing your card.If you don’t have a good credit history, or you have fewer than five years of history, your options will be limited to the most basic cards with small credit limits.

, Be sure to thoroughly read and understand the fine print associated with your choices. Not only is it important to understand what you are getting in to when getting a credit card, it can also be helpful for finding the perfect card for you.

When you and your partner have created a joint venture corporation together, you have taken serious steps in your partnership. Just as corporations can be complex to form and maintain, they can also be difficult to dissolve (i.e., permanently end). Therefore, you should only dissolve the corporation when joint venture agreement violations are so egregious that you cannot work with your partner anymore.


For example, dissolution might be warranted if your partner continually fails to inject promised capital into the joint venture, if your partner goes bankrupt, or if your partner is using confidential information in a way that hurts your other business. In these examples, continuing to run a joint venture corporation may hurt your ability to run and maintain your other business. If this is the case, you should consider dissolving the joint venture corporation.;
, If you have assessed the violation and determined it is egregious enough to warrant dissolution, you will have to follow the dissolution guidelines established in your articles of incorporation. While every corporation will draft their guidelines differently, articles of incorporation generally require a vote to dissolve the corporation. Your guidelines may dictate that a dissolution vote can be taken by incorporators (i.e., you and your partner), elected board members, and/or shareholders.Depending on how your corporation and joint venture was set up, it may be difficult to obtain the required votes to dissolve because your partner will be responsible for up to 1/2 of the corporation. In anticipation of this problem, your articles of incorporation should include a provision allowing one partner to unilaterally dissolve when ""egregious violations"" occur. To ensure this provision is not used improperly, you should explicitly define every ""egregious violation"" that would allow this provision to become operational.
Once you have voted to dissolve in accordance with your articles of incorporation, you need to document this decision in a written agreement., Once you have officially voted to dissolve, you should hire experts to help you through the process. The dissolution process can be incredibly complex, especially if you have a lot of debt, assets, employees, and tax liabilities. It will be important to hire lawyers, accountants, business brokers, auctioneers, and tax experts.To hire these experts, first talk with your partner about the process. If the experts will be paid with corporate funds, you and your partner might need to agree no who to hire and how much to spend.
Start by talking with a mutually agreeable lawyer. If he or she is a qualified business lawyer, he or she will probably know other experts to reach out to.

, If you fail to file dissolution documents with the secretary of state where your business was incorporated, you will continue to be liable for corporate taxes and annual filings.The process for filing dissolution documents will vary from state to state. For example, some states require you to file articles of dissolution (a.k.a., a certificate of dissolution) before notifying creditors while others require you to file after. In addition, some states will require ""tax clearance"" (i.e., pay owed taxes) before you can file your dissolution papers.


You can usually find the required dissolution forms online. For example, in California, you can find the required filings on the secretary of state's website.Contact your secretary of state's office to determine the process where you incorporated., If you were required to obtain any permits or licenses in order to run your corporation, you will need to cancel those to avoid any further financial liability.To cancel existing licenses and permits, gather all of the valid ones and contact the agencies that issued them. All of your licenses and permits are usually required to be kept on hand, so they should be relatively easy to find.


For example, in California, most businesses need a business license, zoning approval, and a doing business as statement, to name a few. Most of these permits are issued by the particular city and county you are located in., If you have employees working for the joint venture corporation, you will need to pay them their final paychecks and provide them with adequate notice. Federal and state law will dictate when you have to notify employees and how they must be paid. For example, if you have 100 or more employees, you may have to provide at least 60 days notice before closing. In addition, you may have to pay employees for any unused vacation or leave time they have accumulated.Make sure you check with your lawyer and business experts to ensure you are complying with the law.

, You will need to file final tax returns with both the federal government and your state government. When you file your taxes, make sure you check the boxes stating they are your final returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and your state tax agency will likely have a checklist available for you to follow. Apart from corporate tax filings, you may also have to make payroll tax filings if you have employees.


In addition, if you have an employer identification number (EIN), you need to cancel it with the IRS. Doing so will notify the IRS that you no longer plan on using it., Once your taxes have been paid, you need to notify lenders and creditors that you are dissolving your business. You should send a letter to each one explaining that you are dissolving your business, that claims need to be mailed to you within a certain period of time (usually 120 days), and that if you do not receive a timely claim it will be barred.Once the time period has ended, you need to review each claim and pay out any money owed.


If you do not have enough assets to pay every creditor, you may have to file for bankruptcy., In addition to paying out existing debts, you also need to collect any money that is owed to your business. Once your corporation is closed, you may be unable to retrieve it. Therefore, you need to draft request letters and send them to every person or entity that owes you money., Once all debts have been paid out and all money owed has been paid in, you can distribute the corporation's assets in accordance with your joint venture agreement. If all of the assets have been liquidated, you will be left with a pot of money to be distributed between you and your joint venture partner.


For example, assume that after all debts and taxes have been paid, the joint venture corporation is left with $500,000. In your joint venture agreement, you agreed that it would be split 60/40 between you and your partner. In this scenario, you would walk away with $300,000 and your partner would get $200,000.
Remember that distributions must be reported to the IRS on your personal tax returns., Even after your business closes, you may be required to keep certain documents for years. For example, tax and employment records may need to be kept for up to seven years after your business is dissolved.Make sure you check with the appropriate authorities and keep your business records for the required time period.

In situations where you believe the person is subject to continual danger, do what you can to get hi or her out of the nursing home and into a protected environment before you take legal action.
Keep in mind that complaints and lawsuits can take months to be resolved, so you need to do what you can to make sure that person is protected in the meantime. Your loved one's life is worth more than any monetary damages you might receive for a successful lawsuit.;
, Nursing homes that accept Medicare or Medicaid are required by federal regulations to create and implement a standard grievance procedure.There should be information about the facility's grievance procedure in the information you or your loved one received when he or she was admitted to the facility.
If you can't find any written description of the official procedure, send a letter to the facility in writing. Stick to the facts, and be as detailed as possible, including as many names and dates as you know.
Make a copy of your letter before you send it to the nursing home, so you have it for your records.
Typically you will be contacted by a nursing home representative soon after your letter is received. You also may receive a written notification outlining the facility's official grievance procedure.
Cooperate with the nursing home investigation and do whatever you can to facilitate a successful resolution of the problem that will ensure your loved one is protected.

, Every state has an Adult Protective Services (APS) agency that investigates and responds to complaints of elder abuse.APS agencies have different procedures in each state, and each agency has a different scope and level of power to investigate and correct problems. Call your state's agency ahead of time and ask about the grievance procedure and what the possible outcomes might be.
Since nursing homes must be licensed, your state's licensing board also may have a complaint or grievance procedure you can use.
Typically you can fill out a form to report the abuse. Include any relevant medical information about your loved one, especially if he or she is suffering from dementia.
Once you file your report, a caseworker will talk to you and begin an investigation of the facility. You may be contacted for further information as the investigation progresses.
Keep in mind the caseworker can't do much without permission from the patient, so keep in contact with your loved one throughout the process to make sure he or she understands what is happening and is on board with it.

, Because liability can be difficult to prove in nursing home abuse cases, an attorney may best be able to protect your interests and the safety and well-being of your loved one.Most elder law attorneys, particularly in personal injury or medical malpractice claims, will take your case on contingency. This means you won't have any out-of-pocket expenses as a result of hiring an attorney. Rather, his or her fees as well as any legal costs will be taken out of any settlement or award you receive.
Keep in mind that the statute of limitations for many nursing home abuse lawsuits is fairly short. You typically have only one or two years from the date of the last incident to file a lawsuit, so you must act fast to find and choose an attorney.
Try to interview at least three attorneys before you make your final selection. Look for someone who specializes in elder law and has extensive experience with nursing home abuse cases.
If your loved one has particular medical conditions or is suffering from dementia, you may want to look for an attorney who has particular experience dealing with other elderly adults who have similar issues.

, To file a complaint in court, you and your attorney will need information about the nursing home and the injuries your loved one has suffered or is suffering.The type of lawsuit you pursue will depend to a large extent on the evidence you have and the type of abuse your loved one is suffering. Typically you will file a personal injury lawsuit on your loved one's behalf, although you may also be eligible for damages to compensate you for your own pain and suffering.
Since patients or their guardians typically sign a contract upon admission to a nursing home, you may have a breach of contract claim. Gather the documents you signed or received when your loved one was admitted to see what promises or guarantees the nursing home made.
Some contracts include a binding arbitration or mediation clause, so read the contract carefully before you file a lawsuit to make sure you haven't signed away the right to do so.
In some cases your attorney also may advise you to file a medical malpractice claim, particularly if the type of abuse your loved one is suffering is depriving him or her of needed medication or medical treatment.

, Your complaint will include information about you, your loved one, and the nursing home, as well as your allegations of abuse against the nursing home.Even if you have several different legal claims or theories – such as, for example, suing the nursing home based on breach of contract and based on negligence – you typically will only file one complaint. Your allegations must provide a sufficient basis for each legal claim you assert.
The first part of your complaint will be a list of factual allegations, presented in numbered paragraphs. Then it will list the legal theory or theories upon which you're basing your claim that you are entitled to monetary damages.
The last part of your complaint will provide a specific amount of damages to which you claim the nursing home owes you and your loved one as a result of the abuse.

, To initiate your lawsuit, you must file your complaint with the clerk of the court where your case will be heard.Typically you'll file a nursing home abuse lawsuit in state court – usually the court in the county where the nursing home is located.
You must pay a filing fee to file your complaint with the clerk, typically several hundred dollars. If you have an attorney working on contingency, he or she will pay this fee and add it to the legal costs that to be deducted from any settlement or award you receive.
The clerk will then stamp your documents ""filed"" with the date, assign your case to a particular judge (usually at random), and generate a case number. This number will be included on all subsequent documents filed with the court in your case.

, After you've filed your complaint, it must be delivered to the nursing home's registered agent along with a summons so the facility's managers know about your lawsuit and have a chance to respond.Technically, a lawsuit can be served by any person over the age of 18 who isn't involved in the case. However, attorneys typically use a sheriff's deputy or a private process serving company to fulfill this duty.
Once service is complete, the process server must fill out a proof of service form and file it with the court.
You also may have the option of serving the complaint using certified mail with returned receipt requested, although most courts require hand delivery for an initial complaint.

, Within 20-30 days of the date the nursing home was served, it must file an answer or other motions in response to your complaint.Typically, the nursing home will file an answer in which it denies most, if not all, of your allegations. This simply means you'll have to provide evidence at trial showing each of them more likely than not happened.
The nursing home also may file a motion to dismiss. If it does, you must file a response and attend a hearing to defeat the motion so your case can go forward.
If the deadline to respond lapses and the nursing home has not filed an answer or motion in response to your lawsuit, you may be eligible to win a default judgment. However, you can generally plan on the fact that the nursing home will respond to your suit.

, At any time after you've filed your complaint, the nursing home may offer an amount of money or the promise of other actions to make your lawsuit go away.If the nursing home filed a motion to dismiss, you can expect a settlement offer soon after the hearing if the judge rules in your favor and allows your case to proceed.
Your attorney will let you know whenever the nursing home makes an offer, and give you advice on whether he or she believes it would be in your best interest to accept, reject, or make a counter-offer.
Especially as it gets closer to trial, the nursing home probably will become more anxious to settle. The prospect of a public nursing home abuse trial won't do anything for the nursing home's reputation or the opinions of the families who have loved ones in their care.

, Through the discovery process, you and the nursing home will exchange information relevant to your claim. You can use this information to further develop and strengthen your case against the nursing home.Because nursing home abuse allegations can be difficult to prove, discovery will be essential to your case. Through requests for production, you can get records from the nursing home, including staff personnel and disciplinary records, or any records of grievances filed by other patients.
Another key component of discovery for you will be depositions. In a deposition, your attorney interviews nursing home employees or witnesses under oath about your allegations. These interviews are recorded by a court reporter, who creates a transcript for later use.
Your attorney, or the nursing home, also may want to depose any doctors or other medical professionals who have seen signs of abuse, or who have talked to your loved one regarding his or her treatment at the nursing home.

, Throughout litigation, the judge may hold hearings to decide various pretrial motions filed by either you or the nursing home.As litigation progresses, either you or the nursing home may file various motions asking the court to rule on issues before trial or order the other party to do something. For example, if the nursing home isn't responding to your written discovery requests, you might file a motion to compel. If the judge rules in your favor, he or she will order the nursing home to respond to your requests.
The judge also may hold scheduling conferences, which typically only involve the judge and the parties' attorneys. In these conferences, deadlines are set for the completion of each phase of pre-trial litigation leading up to the trial itself.
Typically a few weeks before the trial date, the judge will hold a final scheduling conference in which the trial itself is mapped out so everyone has a good idea of how long the process will take.

, Some courts require civil litigants to at least attempt mediation before a trial will be scheduled. However, even if mediation isn't mandated, it's something you should consider to efficiently resolve the dispute.Through mediation, a neutral third party who is trained in dispute resolution sits down with you and the nursing home (and your attorneys) and facilitates a discussion designed to lead toward a mutually agreeable compromise and settlement.
If the court requires mediation, you typically will be assigned a mediator or provided a short list of court-approved mediators from which to choose.
The mediator will write up the terms of any agreement you and the nursing home reach through mediation. Once signed, it becomes a legally enforceable contract.
Your mediated settlement may need to be approved by the judge, particularly if the court mandates the parties participate in mediation.
If you are unable to reach an agreement through mediation, the court will schedule a trial and you will work with your attorney to develop a trial strategy and prepare for trial.

Pay attention to the terms and conditions before applying.,

, Representatives on campus usually offer paper applications, which they allow you to fill out in person. You can also visit a credit card company's website to apply, which may offer you a faster response than a paper application.

, While the typical student credit card has a high interest rate, it should not be outrageous. Research the current rates on most cards before you apply, and ask your parents or friends what an acceptable rate is.

, If so, you may get a lower interest rate, but the downside is that the cosigner's credit will be affected by any late payments that you make.

, Some credit cards allow you to not only build credit in college, but also reap other benefits. Cash back, frequent flyer miles and reward points are all popular offerings. A good student credit card should have at least one of these benefits.

, You will probably use the card for years, and will have to change the address during the summer in order to get the statement sent to the correct location.

, The typical application for credit asks this question. You will not need to put the account numbers, but most companies just want to know that you have at least one type of bank account so that you can make the monthly payments.

, You will be asked for these for security reasons, so be sure they are accurate.

, Note that you will have the card for a few years until it expires, so select a design that you can look at for a while.

Documenting a violation may be more difficult if the person has violated a clause regarding the use of the equipment, but do your best to substantiate these allegations before sending a letter.
For example, suppose a business owner leased a machine from you and agreed to maintain it according to the standards set forth in the agreement. However, a representative of the company that services the machine told you they haven't performed routine maintenance on the machine since it was leased.
In that case, a written statement from the company representative would serve to substantiate that claim, but company records might be better.
You also may want to make a copy of the equipment lease, or at least the page containing the clause the other party has violated, that you can include with your letter.;
, You can draft your letter yourself, but a letter from an attorney may lend greater authority and cause the other party to treat the situation more seriously than they would if the letter came directly from you alone.If you hired an attorney to draw up the lease, you might want to contact them about the lease violation.
Since they drafted the document, they may be in the best position to send the other party notice of a violation.
If you've had additional problems with the other party in the past, or anticipate that you may end up having to go to court, it also may be in your best interest to go ahead and involve an attorney at this stage.

, Your letter should state up front that it is intended as notice of a breach of the equipment lease, and describe specifically the action or inaction on the part of the other party that constituted a breach of the agreement.Your equipment lease may specify that the other party be given notice of a default and a specific period of time to cure that default before additional actions are taken.
If your lease includes a clause that specifies the form and substance of a breach notice letter, make sure you follow those requirements.
Failure to comply with the notice requirements on your lease may mean additional options to recover damages are restricted or foreclosed.
Include what you want to happen as a result of the breach, and give the other party a deadline to respond or to cure the default you noted in your letter.
Typically you'll use the period defined in your equipment lease. However, if your lease doesn't specify a notice period, a week to 10 days from receipt of the letter should suffice.

, Once you've completed your letter, print it off and sign it. Make a copy of the signed letter for your own records and then mail it to the other party using certified mail with returned receipt requested.By using certified mail, you know when the other party has received the letter and can calculate the exact date of the deadline.
Certified mail also gives you proof of delivery if you later need to show a court that steps were taken to resolve the dispute before filing a lawsuit, or that you complied with any notice of breach requirements set forth in the lease.

, When you get the green card back letting you know that your letter was successfully delivered, mark the deadline you gave the other party to respond on your calendar. Expect them to respond using the method required by the equipment lease.If your lease doesn't require a specific method of response, you may receive a phone call or a return letter.
Be as flexible as possible with the other party in attempting to negotiate a resolution to the problem. Keep in mind the time and money required to take other action such as filing a lawsuit.
There's no need to escalate the situation unless the other party does not respond to your letter at all or refuses to negotiate a resolution with you.
If you are able to reach a compromise, make sure any new promises or agreements are put into writing and signed by both parties. Since the original lease was in writing, its terms cannot be legally altered or amended except through a written agreement.

, Your equipment lease may include a provision requiring a certain form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as a method for resolving any disputes under the agreement.The two most common forms of ADR are arbitration and mediation. Arbitration is similar to a court trial, in which both parties present their sides of the story and an arbitrator or panel of arbitrators decides who's right and the remedies to which that party is entitled.
Mediation, on the other hand, is a more relaxed, non-adversarial process through which a neutral third party facilitates a mutually beneficial resolution.
If your lease agreement requires binding arbitration, it may preclude your ability to file a lawsuit. Binding arbitration decisions may be appealable to a different arbitrator or panel, but typically cannot be fought in court.

, Follow any notice requirements provided in the ADR clause of your equipment lease. If no notice is required (or the agreement doesn't include an ADR clause), give the other party a week to 10 days notice that you intend to use ADR.If your equipment lease doesn't include an ADR provision, you can still suggest it as an alternative to a lawsuit if you and the other party are unable to resolve the dispute through direct negotiations.
ADR proceedings have the benefit of being less expensive and time-consuming than a lawsuit, and also are confidential.
Keep in mind that most ADR providers require both parties to sign off on the choice and agree to proceed before a hearing or session will be scheduled.

, Unless your equipment lease specifies a particular company to use for ADR, you must choose an arbitration or mediation service that can handle your dispute. Typically both parties must approve of the chosen provider.Check with your state or local bar association, or with the clerk of the local county court, to find out what arbitration or mediation services they recommend or have approved.
Some state and local bar associations have links to approved ADR services on their websites.
If either your lease or the service provider requires the approval of both parties, you'll have to send the other side another letter indicating who you've chosen. The ADR provider may have a form letter you can use.

, Your strategies and level of preparation will vary depending on whether you're using mediation or arbitration, but you still must gather similar evidence and prepare a statement of your claim against the other party.If you're using binding arbitration, you may want to have an attorney represent you at the proceeding.
Although the rules of evidence and procedure typically are simplified compared to a traditional courtroom setting, the binding nature of the decision may justify the expense of hiring an attorney.
The more relaxed style and setting of mediation means you typically can handle things on your own, but you may want to talk to an attorney if you have questions or concerns about how various clauses of your equipment lease operate.
Gather any evidence you have of the lease violation, as well as a copy of the equipment lease. Your ADR provider may require a copy of the lease be sent before your appointment.

, On the day of your appointment, show up at the location at least a half hour early so you have time to arrange your documents and information and get settled before the session begins.For arbitration, each party will be expected to make an opening statement, after which you will each have the opportunity to introduce evidence and call witnesses on your behalf.
Mediation, on the other hand, typically begins with everyone in the same room. The mediator will introduce him- or herself and explain the procedure, then give each of you an opportunity to explain your side of the story.
After these opening remarks, the mediator will move you to separate rooms and go back and forth between you presenting offers and discussing the case until you either arrive at a compromise or reach an impasse.
While the mediation process itself is voluntary, any settlement reached will be put into writing and will become legally binding when signed by both parties.

, While you don't necessarily need to present evidence to substantiate the allegations in your initial complaint, you will need a copy of the equipment lease as well as other documents that demonstrate any efforts you made to resolve the dispute before heading to court.Any attorney you hire likely will want these documents as well, along with any information or evidence you have that supports your claims that the other party has violated the equipment lease.

, If the situation has progressed to the point that you've decided to file a lawsuit, find an experienced business litigation attorney to represent you. There typically is too much at stake to attempt to handle it on your own.Even if you're not sure whether you want to hire an attorney, it can be worth your while to interview a few experienced business litigation attorneys and get their take on your case.
Most attorneys provide a free initial consultation, so you don't have anything to lose on this score, regardless of whether you ultimately decide to hire anyone.

, The equipment lease may specify a particular court that must be used if you're filing a lawsuit for breach of that agreement. Otherwise, you must file your lawsuit in a court that has jurisdiction over breach of contract claims against the person you're suing.Although you may be able to use small claims court (which would mean you wouldn't have to hire an attorney), keep in mind that small claims courts typically cannot order anything other than money damages.
If you have any other demands, such as a return of the leased property, you'll have to sue in state or federal civil court.
Your attorney will work with you to choose the correct court given the location of the party you want to sue and the damages at stake in the lawsuit.

, To initiate your lawsuit, you must draft a complaint that names the person you're suing, describes the agreement between you, and lists factual allegations that constitute a breach of that agreement and entitle you to sue for damages.Your attorney will work with you to compile the factual allegations and determine the amount and type of damages to demand.
Make sure you understand everything in the complaint before you proceed, and ask your attorney if there's something you have trouble with or don't think can be proven.

, When the complaint and all other required documents are complete, your attorney will take them to the clerk of the court that will hear your lawsuit and file them, marking the start of your litigation.The court charges a filing fee to initiate a lawsuit, typically several hundred dollars. If you paid your attorney a retainer, these fees usually will be deducted from that. You also may make arrangements to pay the filing fee separately.
The original complaint and other documents will be filed with the court. You'll get a file-stamped copy for your records, and another copy will be served on the person you're suing.
Service typically is accomplished by having a sheriff's deputy or private process serving company hand-deliver the court documents to the other party. Once this is done, they will complete a proof of service form for the court.

, After the other party receives your summons and complaint, they have 30 days or less to file a written answer or other response, such as a motion to dismiss. If the deadline lapses and nothing is filed, you may be eligible to win by default.At this point, you probably have gone multiple rounds with the other party over these equipment lease violations, so don't expect them to simply ignore your lawsuit.
Usually you'll get an answer, served on your attorney, that denies most (if not all) of your allegations and includes a number of defenses and perhaps even counterclaims against you.
Your attorney will let you know if there are counterclaims to which you must respond.

, Once the complaint and the answer – known as the ""pleadings"" – are complete and filed with the court, the next stage of pretrial litigation begins with discovery, through which you and the other party can exchange information and documents related to your claims.Be prepared to receive a settlement offer at any time during pretrial litigation. The discovery phase in particular can take several months, and can be incredibly expensive.
As litigation begins to take its toll, the other party may be more open to settling the case so they can carry on with their business.

Activate the card.",How to Choose Your First Credit Card," Your credit score is a number from 350 to 850 that represents your creditworthiness.


You can check your credit score by requesting a free copy of your score from one of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Since this is your first credit card, you may not have much of a credit history or you may not have any credit history at all.
If you have a higher credit score, you may be eligible for better offers with lower interest rates and higher credit limits.;
, Credit cards are a great way to build credit history, but if you don’t have any credit history, it is more difficult to be approved for a credit card. There are a few different ways to build credit that can make it easier to be approved for your first card.


Apply for a secured credit card. These cards require a cash deposit and people with no or little credit history can apply and be approved more easily.
Use a co-signer on your credit card application. A co-signer essentially vouches for your ability to pay back your credit card debt. If you misuse your credit card and build up debt, this can negatively effect the credit score of your co-signer.
Become an authorized user of someone else’s credit card. , When used properly, there are benefits to opening your first credit card. However, first time users are at risk of abusing them and piling up credit card debt.


In 2015, the average American household had over $15,000 in credit card debt.
Having high amounts of debt can limit your ability to get approved for loans, to own a home, and is a financial burden on yourself and your family.When you receive your first credit card, it’s important to establish good financial habits and to avoid accumulating unnecessary debt. Setting and following a budget is a great habit to establish.

, Credit cards are useful because they allow you to purchase items on credit, rather than immediately taking money out of your account, but it is important to follow a budget.


Know how much you can afford to spend each month. You will need to pay at least 2% of the balance in every billing period. It is highly recommended that you pay your entire balance off each month so you do not accrue interest.
Know the benefits of having a credit card. A credit card is a good way to build your credit, which can help you to qualify for lower insurance premiums, loan rates, and to help you be approved for an apartment., There are dozens of different types of credit cards out there so it is important to consider your options when deciding on your first card.


Credit cards are issued through financial institutions, retailers, banks and other lenders.
If you have a debit card now and are happy with the services you receive from that bank, you can consider applying for a credit card through them.
Many of us receive “pre-approved” offers from credit card issuers that target first-time credit card users. While they may be tempting, you still need to do your research to see if it is the best option for you.

, The length of time you have credit built is an important factor in your credit score and qualifying for future credit, but it is harder to get a credit card when you’re younger and have less credit history. Credit issuers are more hesitant to issue credit cards to people under the age of 21, but you can work around this.
If you are under 21, you will need to demonstrate that you have a full time source of income. If you do not work full time, you will need a parent or another adult to co-sign with you on your application.
Credit card restrictions loosen after you turn 21 but you will still need to provide documentation that you work either full or part time and have a steady source of income.

, There are two main types of credit cards, secured and unsecured, so it is important to know which type you qualify for.


Secured credit cards are backed by a cash deposit, which is usually the amount of the card’s credit limit. This means that if you receive a card with a $1000 limit, you will need to put down $1000 as collateral to remove the risk of nonpayment for the card issuer. Secured credit cards are usually offered to people without extensive credit histories, or who have poor credit.
Unsecured credit cards do not have a cash deposit. You will get a credit limit based on your income level and your credit history. , Some cards expect a payment every two weeks while others use a 30-day cycle. Ask if there is a penalty for not using your card.
Write the billing date down! You will need to pay your bill on time to avoid accruing interest or late payment charges.
Many cards offer a grace period. When you use the card for the first time, the bank loans you money to make that purchase. The credit card company will give you a grace period, usually 20-30 days to pay off that purchase without accruing interest., Different card issuers offer different types of benefits when you open a card. These may be promotional benefits that last for a set period or they may be used throughout the lifetime of the card!


Some cards offer 1% or 2% cash back on all purchases, no annual fee, credit points toward purchases, or promotional interest rates.
Benefits should not be the main reason you choose a certain card, think of them as icing on the cake!
If you are a student, you may qualify for special offers and promotions. , Remember, the interest rate is dependent upon your credit history, so the rates you are offered may change over time. That being said, if this is your first credit card and you have little credit history, you will most likely be approved for a card with a high interest rate.


The interest rate will be applied to the remaining balance on your bill if you do not pay it off each month. You should always try to pay your balance in full so you avoid incurring additional interest charges. Know your interest type. Some cards charge interest from the date of purchase, while others charge interest from the billing date. If you are offered a promotional interest rate, find out the terms of payment and when the rate will expire. Most cards apply payments to lowest interest charges first, leaving your higher interest charges to collect interest until the entire amount is paid off.
A high interest rate for your first card is not unusual, especially if you have little or no credit history. As you use your first card responsibly, you may qualify for better rates.

, There can be a variety of different fees that may be applied to your card, which could make some cards better options than others.


There may be an annual fee, an application fee, an account service charge, an over-limit fee, a late-payment fee, a cash advance fee, and other miscellaneous fees.
Compare these fees to other cards, along with their interest rates and other benefits to make sure you find the best card for you.

, There are typically three ways to apply for a credit card: through the mail, over the phone and on the Internet.


Once you have decided on the right first card for you, you will need to apply for it with the card issuer. They will either accept or deny your application for credit.
While a lot of this decision is based on credit history, credit issuers realize that first time card applicants will have very different credit histories than more established credit card users. Card issuers will usually ask about your current income and the current balance in your accounts. They use this information to decide what sort of credit line to assign you, and will commonly ask for proof of income as part of the approval process.You do not have to have a bank account to open a credit card, but you do need to prove that you have a source of income so the card issuer knows you will pay back your purchases.

, Activating your card usually involves calling in to the credit issuer to confirm that you have received it.


Sign the back of your card before you begin using it, this adds an additional layer of security.
You can use the credit card wherever they are accepted, online or in person.
If your card is ever lost or stolen, contact the credit card issuer immediately. If your card has been used fraudulently, freeze the credit card immediately with your issuer. "

Read the agreement carefully.,
Initiate dispute resolution proceedings.,
Attempt a negotiated resolution.,
Submit to mediation.,
Allow for an expert determination.,
Take part in arbitration.",How to Take Action Against Joint Venture Agreement Violations2," If you did not create a separate entity to run your joint venture, or if the violation is not egregious enough to warrant dissolution, you may have to comply with the dispute resolution proceedings laid out in your joint venture agreement. If you think a violation has occurred, read the joint venture agreement to see if it contemplates the type of action that should be taken. If it does, follow the required procedures in order to resolve the dispute.


For example, assume your partner does not feel like he or she needs to share a specific piece of intellectual property with the joint venture, but you feel like they do. When you hear about this possible violation (i.e., not sharing intellectual property), you read the joint venture agreement and determine that he or she should share it. However, your partner still refuses. When you go back to the joint venture agreement, it states that intellectual property disputes require you to take part in mediation and expert determinations.

, Most dispute resolution provisions in a joint venture agreement will lay out a series of steps that both parties must abide by if violations are alleged. The proceedings will usually start with less formal negotiations and work their way up to binding arbitration. In addition to the proceedings, there is usually a provision in joint venture agreements that dictates how the proceeding can be initiated. For example, some agreements require one party to send written notice to their partner.In other agreements, you may be able to file for mediation immediately upon hearing about an alleged violation.


Whatever your initiation provision calls for, make sure you follow those directions so the decision cannot be challenged later.

, If your dispute resolution provision requires good faith negotiations, you will need to engage the other party in an attempt to resolve the dispute amicably. During negotiations, you and the other party will need to get together and discuss the alleged violation. Each party will present their side of the story and you will try to find common ground. If a resolution can be reached, create a written agreement laying out the resolution.


If your agreement lays out a structured set of proceedings, it will likely put a time limit on your negotiations. For example, in some agreements, if a resolution cannot be reached within 14 days of negotiations, the parties can move forward to remaining clauses in the dispute resolution section. If this happens, the next step is usually mediation., If negotiations did not lead to a resolution, you might need to submit to mediation. Mediation is an informal process where a neutral third party (i.e., a mediator) assists you and your partner in reaching a settlement. The mediator will listen to both parties and try to find common ground based on your interests. Mediators cannot impose binding decisions and are only there to help move the conversation forward.


If mediation is successful, you and your partner will draft and execute a settlement agreement that will become binding.If mediation is not successful, you and your partner will have to continue through your joint venture agreement's dispute resolution process. In most cases, this will either be an expert determination or arbitration.

, Expert determinations are used a lot in joint venture agreements when partners have disputes about technical matters (e.g., patent questions and valuation questions). If you are required to submit to an expert determination, it will usually only be for certain specific disputes. For example, if you and your partner disagree as to the value of a product, you might submit it to a panel of business experts who will place a value on the product for you.


To initiate an expert determination, you and your partner will usually submit a technical question to one or more experts, chosen beforehand, who will make a final determination on the issue. Your joint venture agreement should dictate whether the expert's determination is binding or not., The last resort in most dispute resolution sections of joint venture agreements is arbitration. Arbitration is a procedure in which you submit your dispute to one or more decision makers (i.e., arbitrators) who will review the dispute and make a final, often binding, decision based on both parties rights and obligations under the joint venture agreement.Most arbitration clauses will set out exactly what disputes can be taken to arbitration, how arbitrators will be chosen, what rules will be followed, where the hearings will take place, what laws will apply, and who will pay."

Hire a lawyer.,
Draft your complaint.,
File your complaint.,
Serve the defendant.,
Await an answer.,
Take part in discovery.,
Defend against a motion for summary judgment.,
Attempt to settle.,
Go to trial.",How to Take Action Against Joint Venture Agreement Violations3," If a resolution cannot be reached by complying with the joint venture agreement, or if some disputes need to be handled outside of the contract's terms, you might need to file a lawsuit to resolve the alleged violation. If you are planning on filing a lawsuit, understand that you will be suing your joint venture partner, which will likely permanently alter your relationship and ability to do business together. However, in some situations, it may be your only option. Before you bring a lawsuit, you need to hire a qualified lawyer to help you.


To hire a qualified contracts lawyer, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After you answer a few questions, you will be put in contact with various qualified contract lawyers in your area.
make sure your lawyer has a good understanding of both business and contract law. When you litigate a case based on the violation of a joint venture agreement, your case will likely deal with business issues (e.g., intellectual property, distributions, stocks) as well as contractual issues (e.g., material breaches, objective manifestations, fraud). Therefore, it is important to hire a lawyer who is knowledgeable about everything that might come up.
Before you hire a lawyer, be sure you discuss their fee arrangements. If you agree to hire a lawyer, make sure you get the representation agreement, including the fee arrangement, in writing.

, A complaint is the formal legal document that initiates a lawsuit. Your complaint will need to be drafted in accordance with the local rules of the court you will be filing in. Depending on the specifics of your case (i.e., where each party is from and how much you are looking to recoup in damages), you might file in either state or federal court. Talk to your attorney to determine where you should sue. Regardless, every complaint will need to contain at least the following information:A caption, which will include the name of the court you are filing in and the parties to the lawsuit.
A jury demand if you want your case heard by a jury.
A statement of jurisdiction, which will tell the court why they have the ability to hear your case. If you are in state court, you might simply have to state that you are suing another party for breach of contract under a specific legal theory. If you are in federal court, you might have to state that you meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction (i.e., you and your partner are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000).
A statement of facts, which is a brief description of the events that led to the lawsuit.
The remedy sought, which will describe what you want the judge to do if you win. In most cases, this will be an amount of money (called damages).

, After your complaint has been drafted, you will take it to the courthouse and file it with the clerk of courts. You will usually need to file your original plus at least two copies. At the time of filing, you will also need to pay a filing fee (usually around $350) or ask for a fee waiver. Once the filing fee is paid or waived your complaint will be stamped as ""filed"" and you will be handed an official civil cover sheet and summons.


The civil cover sheet should be filled out and handed back to the clerk. The civil cover sheet provides the court with background information about your case so they know how to handle it (e.g., what judge to give it to, how to schedule it, what case number to assign it).
The summons will already be filled out and will contain the court's signature and seal. The summons is a form that tells the defendant they have been sued and requests a response within a certain period of time (usually between 21 and 30 days)., Once your lawsuit has been formally filed, you will need to notify the defendant that they are being sued. To do this, you need to serve them with a copy of your complaint and summons. This needs to be done within 120 days of filing your lawsuit. To effectively serve the defendant, you need to have someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case complete the service. For a small fee, you can usually hire the sheriff's office or the US Marshals to complete service for you.


Once you hire someone to serve the defendant, they will have to give the defendant a copy of your complaint and summons in accordance with the law. Usually the server will be able to either personally hand a copy, or leave a copy, with the defendant. If the defendant cannot be found, the server may be able to mail a copy to them.
Once service is complete, the server will have to complete the back of the summons, which is called the proof of service. The proof of service must be returned to you and you must file it with the court., The defendant will have around 21 days to respond to your lawsuit after they are served. Most defendant's will respond by filing an answer, which is a formal response to all of the allegations in your complaint. Within the answer, the defendant will admit or deny all of your allegations and will raise any defenses they may have. In addition, a defendant might file counterclaims if he or she believes you have breached the joint venture contract.


When you are served with the defendant's answer, read it carefully and make sure your lawyer sees it. The answer will give you great insight into how the defendant plans to attack your lawsuit. If you know what the defendant is planning on doing, you will be better able to defend against it., One of the most important parts of litigation (discovery) occurs soon after the complaint and answer are exchanged. During discovery, you and the defendant will have an opportunity to exchange information in order to prepare for trial. You will be able to talk with witnesses, gain access to documents, see what the defendant plans on saying at trial, and see how strong your case is. In order to effectively take part in discovery, you will be able to use the following tools:Informal discovery, which will likely involve interviewing witnesses, obtaining publicly available documents, and taking pictures.
Depositions, which are formal in-person interviews with witnesses and parties. The interviews are conducted under oath and the answers can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are formal written questions posed to witnesses and parties. Their answers must be written under oath and the answers can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are formal requests for documents that are not publicly available. Examples might include internal memos, emails, text message, and phone records.
Requests for admissions, which are requests asking the defendant to admit or deny the existence of a specific fact or document.

, As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant will likely file a motion for summary judgment. In order to succeed, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that there are no genuine issues of material fact and they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant will have to persuade the court that, even if it made every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose the case.


You can defend against this motion by presenting affidavits and evidence tending to persuade the court that genuine factual disputes do exist that need to be handled at trial. If you succeed, the litigation will continue., If you have made it past the summary judgment phase of litigation, you are getting close to a trial and you might want to consider settling. Trials are expensive and time consuming endeavors and even if you win, you might not get enough money to recoup the costs of litigation. Therefore, try negotiating with your partner in order to try and resolve the dispute amicably. If informal negotiations don't work, you might try mediation or arbitration.

, When a settlement cannot be reached at this stage of the litigation, a trial is almost inevitable. After a trial schedule is set by your judge, you will choose a jury (if you invoked your right to one) through a process called ""voire dire."" After a jury is empaneled, you will start the trial by making an opening statement. The purpose of your opening statement is to tell the court a story that gives some context to the trial. After both parties have made opening statements, you will present your case.


When you present your case, you will offer up evidence through witness testimony and physical exhibits. Your evidence should prove all of the elements of your breach of contract case, which will vary depending on your legal theory.
Once you present your case, the defendant will have an opportunity to do the same. After he or she questions each witness, you will have an opportunity to cross-examine them in order to poke holes in the defendant's case.
Once both parties have presented their cases, you will be able to make a closing argument. Your closing argument should summarize the evidence and make it clear why you have won.
When the trial is over, the court will deliberate and make a decision. The court's decision, called a verdict, will be announced in open court. If you win, you will be awarded damages for the joint venture violation caused by the defendant."

Reinforce good money management practices.",How to Get a Visa Credit Card for Your Kid1," Getting a credit card is just like shopping for anything else. You want the best deal.


Start by looking for cards with the lowest interest rate. The interest rate is effectively the ""price"" of the money that your child will be borrowing. The lower, the better.
Also consider credit limit. It may be the case that a credit card with a low-interest rate also has an unacceptably low credit limit. Look for a card that strikes the right balance.
Keep in mind that some banks might require your child to have an account with the bank before offering a credit card. Decide on whether you think it's worth it for your child to open an account just to get a Visa card.;
, If you have excellent credit, you might give your child a good shot at getting a Visa card by co-signing for it. Of course, you'll be responsible if your child doesn't pay the amount that's due every month.

, If the card is approved, remind your child about the importance of maintaining a good credit history if he or she ever wants to buy a house or a new car. Let your child know that it's important to pay credit card bills on time all the time.

Apply for a special student credit card.,
Apply for a store-sponsored credit card.",How to Get a Visa or Mastercard With No Credit History1," Before you can get any kind of credit card, you will need to have a job and be earning money.

You cannot report income that you get as gifts or loans from parents or other family members., Several credit card companies offer special cards to students. If you are a student with limited or no credit history, you may want to consider one of these offers. Contact your own bank, if you have one, or search online for “student visa card” or “student mastercard” to find offers. Be careful to research these offers carefully, so you understand what you are getting.Credit cards are not offered directly from the name Visa or Mastercard. The credit account is offered by a bank or credit company, that in turn works with Visa or Mastercard. Each bank or credit company can offer its own interest rates, rewards program and other services as part of the credit card offer.
When you are researching offers for student credit cards, be careful to check repayment requirements and interest rates. Some companies may make getting a card easier but then add fees or higher interest, so the card ends up costing you more.

, Retail stores (Sears, Staples, Target, and many others) offer credit cards to their customers. Because the stores want your business, they are going to be more generous in granting approval, even if you have little or no credit history built up.

In many cases, you may even be able to apply directly through the website. Alternatively, you may want to visit the store’s customer service desk to apply for a credit card.Research any store credit offers carefully. As with student cards, store cards may allow you easier access to get credit, but then the requirements can be strict to keep up with your payments.
Find out about the interest rates that apply to balances that you carry. Store card interest rates are often higher than for other credit cards. If you have a card with a high interest rate, the best recommendation is to pay off your balance monthly.

There are usually age limitations to these types of arrangements, so check with your parent or guardian’s bank to get the details.Keep in mind that as an authorized user you will not be building your own credit history because you will be using your parent or guardian’s account.

, You cannot become an authorized user of your parent or guardian’s account without his or her consent, so you will have to ask first. Before you talk to your parent or guardian, think about your reasons for wanting to be made an authorized user.


Try saying something like, “I was hoping we could talk about the possibility of adding me as an authorized user to your account. I think it would be a good idea because _______. What do you think?”
If you parent or guardian says no, you may need to consider a different method to get a credit card. But if they say no but seem open to the idea, try to continue the conversation by explaining your reasons for making this request.

, If your parent or guardian agrees to add you as an authorized user on his or her bank card, you will need to go to the bank together to complete an additional signer form.

Open your secured credit card account.,
Work with the bank to transition to an unsecured credit card.",How to Get a Visa or Mastercard With No Credit History2," The difference between a secured credit card and a more traditional credit card is that when you open a secured credit card account, you make a cash deposit first. That cash deposit established the credit that you are allowed. You then use the credit card as you would use an unsecured credit card. Stores and other vendors do not know the difference, and you build up a positive credit history as you use it., As with traditional cards, secured credit cards come with different sets of rules, incentives and interest rates. You will want to shop around and find the package that best suits your needs and your ability to keep up with payments.A good place to start looking for a secured credit card offer is with your own local bank or credit union. Secured credit cards may not be advertised as much as unsecured credit accounts, but if you ask, you may find a good offer.
You can find numerous offers by searching for “secured credit card” on the Internet.

, Because a secured credit card is based on the deposit that you make before using it, some companies treat your payments differently. You want to find a credit company that will report your on-time payments to the three main credit reporting agencies, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. Making payments, but not having them get reported, does not help you build a credit history.Many secured credit card offers will make a point of saying that they “report to credit bureaus” or that they “build credit.” For example, at the advertising site CompareCards.com, you can see a list of ten different MasterCard and Visa offers. Some of these report that they “Report to Credit Bureaus” or “Build Credit When Used Responsibly,” while others do not. If you do not see such a reference, contact the customer service number and ask., Getting your foot in the door and obtaining approval for a secured credit card is fine, but you still want to get a good deal. As with unsecured credit cards, secured credit cards vary in the interest rates they charge on balances and the administrative fees that they charge for their services. Some will charge an annual fee just for having the account. Some companies may charge a fee for making credit reports, while others do this for no charge., Even though you are just starting out and may need to resort to a secured credit card, you may still qualify for certain incentive awards. Some secured credit cards offer cash back incentives on purchases that you make. If you will be using the card regularly, these incentives can add up to make a measurable difference., After you have shopped around and selected a bank or credit agency for your secured credit card, you will need to complete their application process. This generally consists of providing information about yourself, your employment, and whatever credit history you do have. You will select a credit limit, based on whatever the bank offers. Typically you will then need to open a savings account with that bank and deposit an amount equal to the credit line that you select. This money stays in the account. As part of your application, you sign an agreement giving the bank the authority to collect from that account if you ever fail to pay your credit bill. As long as you pay your credit bill on time, the money will just stay in the account.Most banks allow minimum security deposits of around $300 to $500 dollars. Your credit limit will either be equal to that amount or could be slightly higher, if the bank allows.

, You should be sure to pay your monthly bills on time consistently. If you do so, you may be able to talk to the bank about moving from a secured credit account to an unsecured account. The average time for making this change, assuming that you are a good customer, is about a year."

Speak with someone you trust and who trusts you.,
Check with the card issuer about your credit limit.,
Find out if you can remove yourself from the account.,
Monitor your credit report regularly.,
Manage the account to build your positive credit history.",How to Get a Visa or Mastercard With No Credit History3," Becoming an authorized user on a credit card can be a quick way for you to get access to credit. However, you, as the authorized user, and the primary user whose account it is, must be able to trust each other completely. By failing to make any payments, each person has the ability to damage the other one’s credit rating.The most common authorized user arrangements are between parents and their children. The parent will obtain the credit card, or use one that already exists, and add the child to the account as an authorized user.

, The card issuer can establish a credit limit for the authorized user, which is separate from the credit limit that the primary account holder has for the whole account. When considering this arrangement, discuss with the primary account holder and the card issuer what limit you believe you will need and can manage., An arrangement as an authorized user is generally intended to be temporary. Your objective, most likely, is to use this account to build your own positive credit until you can apply for your own credit card. Before you begin the arrangement, find out if and how you will be able to remove yourself from the account in the future. Also ask how your payments are credited to your own credit report., As an authorized user, you do not have control over the payments that the primary account holder makes. You will want to review your credit report regularly to ensure that the account is getting paid on time and that payments are reported positively to your credit report. If you see a problem, you will want to discuss it with the primary account holder as soon as possible., When you become an authorized user on someone else's credit card account, the credit reporting agencies see you as an equal credit holder. Between yourself and the primary account holder, you may be only an ""authorized user,"" but to the vendors you use and to the credit reporting agencies, you are just another borrower. As long as the account is used responsibly and the payments are made on time, your credit history will be enhanced."

Control the number of applications you submit.,
Use your credit to show activity.,
Keep your credit balance reasonable.,
Pay your bills on time.,
Pay more than the minimum amount due.,
Keep an eye on your credit score and credit report.",How to Get a Visa or Mastercard With No Credit History4," It may be tempting, when you are trying to establish a credit history, to apply for several credit cards from several different lenders. Doing this, however, can harm your credit rating. Credit reporting agencies and lenders who view your credit history will look with suspicion on an “explosion” of activity. Consider starting with one or two accounts that you can easily manage, and then expand if you have the need., Having open credit accounts, but not using them, does nothing to help build a positive credit history. If you have one or more dormant accounts, you should purchase at least one item periodically, so the card shows up in your credit report. Then pay off that purchase as soon as you get the bill, so your payment history will be 100% positive., Pushing your credit up to the maximum limit will harm your overall credit score. As a general rule of thumb, you should keep your balance to 50% of the available credit limit, or less. A low credit balance will show that you can use the credit cards but handle having some debt without letting it get out of control., The worst thing you can do is fail to pay your bills on time. Make notes in your calendars so you are aware when your bills are due. Make payments on or before the due dates, so they will be processed without being late. If you develop bad habits of paying your credit bills late, this will result in a low credit score, which can interfere with your efforts to get additional credit cards in the future., When you receive your monthly credit card bill, it will tell you the total outstanding balance as well as the minimum monthly payment. If possible, you should pay off your balance each month, so you do not incur additional interest or fees. However, if you cannot pay the full amount, you should at least pay more than the minimum.The minimum payment reflected on your bill is an amount that will allow you to avoid paying penalties. However, if you pay only the minimum, you will develop other problems. After a few months of making only minimum payments, your credit score is likely to drop. Also, you will see that the amount of the monthly minimum will begin to increase. After a few months, you may begin having difficulty even paying off the minimum., In the United States, there are three primary credit reporting agencies--Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. When you are trying to build up a positive credit history, you will want to review all three of these credit reports regularly. When you get a copy of each credit report, you should review it for timely payments, open accounts, and any inquiries into your credit that may be questionable. Anytime you see activity on your credit report that you do not recognize, you should contact the credit reporting agency immediately to investigate.You can learn more about each of the three main credit reporting agencies as follows:

Your FICO score (the term refers to the company that created the formula for determining the score) shows lenders how much of a credit risk you are. The score goes from 350 to 850, and the higher your score is, the better. If you live in the United States, you are entitled by law to one free credit report per year from each of the three major credit monitoring companies, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.Check your credit score using any of the free credit score monitoring sites, such as CreditKarma and Credit Sesame.
Applying for too many credit cards at once can hurt your credit.Therefore, do research ahead of time to determine which cards may be out of reach for you.
If you have poor credit, consider a secured credit card. These cards usually require a security deposit, but they can be a good way to rebuild your credit after a devastating event like foreclosure or bankruptcy. They are also good for people with no credit history.;
, If you need to use your card for one or more big purchases after which you’ll be unlikely to pay off the balance right away, you may be better off choosing a card with a low interest rate. If you need to carry a balance, choosing a card with a lower rate will help you avoid that balance becoming too large over time.


Cards with lower interest rates tend not to have good rewards programs. But cards with good rewards also tend to have much higher rates, and are best for people who pay off their balances in full every month. Consider transferring to a card with a better rewards program after you’ve paid off your balance in full.

, If you currently have multiple cards that you don’t want, you may be able to transfer those balances to a balance transfer credit card.These cards usually come with a very low interest rate and are good for people who want to wipe out multiple existing card balances.


Balance transfer cards are generally restricted to people with high credit scores.

, Charge cards different from credit cards mainly in the fact that their balances must be paid off in full each month. In other words, there is no option to carry a balance to the next month by paying an amount between the minimum payment and card balance. Charge cards have no credit limit, meaning that they can be used by those who would only qualify for a small credit card credit limit and those who do not qualify for a credit card at all. In this way, they are useful for rebuilding your credit.

However, the fact that they have no credit limit can be dangerous if you cannot control your spending.
Any unpaid balance usually comes with a large penalty around 36 percent annualized., Some cards offer frequent-flier miles with certain airlines based on how much you spend. These cards can offer excellent value, especially for international travel. But they are generally only worth it to people who travel frequently.


Some cards may offer mile conversion for only one airline. These cards usually also come with added benefits when you fly with that airline, such as a free checked bag.
Beware of frequent-flier cards that offer miles redeemable on any airline. These cards often come with restrictions that make upgrading to business class or first class for international travel extremely difficult., Some cards offer points as rewards. Most of these cards give you points on every purchase you make. But points cards often vary in terms of how many points you’ll get per purchase. That variation depends on factors like the time of year, where you shop, and what you buy.


Points cards often give you the choice of redeeming your points as cash, gift cards for different businesses, or as merchandise. Take stock of how those points are redeemed to find the right card for your preferences.
Some cards place limits on the number of points you can earn at any one time. Others set expiration dates on points. Be sure to redeem your points frequently if you sign up for one of these cards.

, Some cards offer cash back every month (the best you can typically do is around 2% of every purchase). These cards don’t offer rewards other than cash, but if you don’t have the patience or time to deal with redeeming points, cash back cards can be extremely lucrative.


Credit card companies only make money on cash back cards through late fees. Therefore these cards tend to come with especially high interest rates. You should only sign up for a cash back card if you plan on paying the statement balance in full each month., Some major department stores offer unsecured cards with different discounts. These cards are often easy to get. But because the discounts are typically tied to the store, you should only apply for one if you shop at that store a lot.


Store credit cards often carry high interest rates. If you sign up for one, avoid carrying a balance on it., If you have a good credit score (over about 700), you may qualify for credit cards with an introductory zero-interest period. This means that you can use the card for a set period of time while carrying a balance and not paying any interest, provided you pay off the balance within the period. This period may last between one and two years, depending on the card's terms.

For example, you might use the card to pay for dental services or another large purchase. If you pay off the balance within the zero-interest period, you will have effectively financed your purchase interest-free.
However, if you don't pay off your balance in time or skip a payment, you will start to earn interest and may even be responsible for accrued interest on your balance that you avoided paying during the zero-interest period., Some cards come with recurring annual fees, which can range from $45 to nearly $100 per year. Many people refuse to sign up for these cards due to the large number of fee-free cards on the market. But these cards often come with generous rewards programs. If you use one of these cards exclusively (or nearly so), you can often accumulate rewards in excess of the annual fee.Because the credit card business is so competitive, many companies will waive the annual fee for the first year as an incentive.

, There are so many different credit cards out there that picking the right one can seem overwhelming. But there are also several websites, such as CreditCards.com, NerdWallet.com, and CompareCards.com, that can help you compare different card offers based on your finances. You should also factor in promotional offers you may receive in the mail. , Many card companies will offer lucrative sign-up bonuses, especially to people with good credit. One of these bonuses may be enough to offset negative factors like a high annual fee or interest rate.Sign-up bonuses typically involve the bank giving you lots of extra points or miles after you spend a certain amount of money in the first few months of using the card.

, Having multiple lines of credit open can be good for your credit score, since it can decrease your ratio of debt to credit. But having more lines of credit open than you’re using can hurt your credit score. This is especially true if you open too many lines of credit too quickly. Doing so makes it look like you need fast cash. Don’t sign up for more credit cards than you absolutely need., Most cards will offer interest based on APR, which stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It refers to the rate your bank will charge you on your outstanding balance at the end of each month.But card companies may calculate APR differently based on your spending habits or other factors. Do careful research to determine which rate works best for you.


In some cases it’s better to know what the daily interest rate is for a particular card. Doing so can give you a better idea of how much your bank will charge month-to-month., Only sign up for a new credit card once you’re certain that it’s the right one for you. Repeatedly opening and closing multiple cards every year can cause serious damage to your credit score. Always remember that in the end, you want to build a stable credit history using only as many lines of credit as you need.

Decide on a type of travel-rewards program.,
Analyze the value of each card’s points or miles.,
Look for cards that offer a sign-up bonus.,
Look for a card with flexible redemption opportunities.,
Consider a card’s customer-service responsiveness.",How to Choose a Credit Card for Travel Rewards1," There are two types of travel credit cards: general and co-branded. General travel-rewards cards are offered through a credit card company and return rewards (such as miles) on every purchase. These do not limit the airlines you can fly or hotels you can stay at. Co-branded travel cards are offered through a specific airline. Co-branded cards only reward you with miles for that airline, as well as multiple airline-related perks.Many hotels also offer co-branded credit cards. These cards will not generate airline miles, but will build up points at the hotel chain that may be used for free hotel rooms or amenities.;
, All travel-rewards cards do not distribute equally valued points. Most cards have a basic rewards rate of one point (or mile) for every dollar spent. However, the redemption rates can differ drastically between cards. Compare a few travel credit cards against one another to determine which has the best point-value system.For example, if two cards both offer two miles for every dollar spent, but the first card requires 20,000 miles for a flight and the second requires 40,000 miles, the first card is the better option.

, Many travel cards will immediately give you a large number of bonus points or miles simply for signing up. Cards present this as a “reward” for applying. The initial bonus may even provide enough miles or points to cover one (or more) free flights.If you’re applying for a cobranded travel card, the airline or hotel may offer a lucrative sign-up bonus to individuals already staying at the hotel or flying on the airline.


Think about joining a frequent-flier club or a hotel-rewards program prior to applying for a cobranded credit card. These type of airline- and hotel-based programs may offer special perks to their members for signing up for a cobranded credit card, or may lower the annual fees or minimum spending amount.
Most cards will only apply the initial sign-up bonus after you meet the required spending minimum on the card. For example, the Capital One Venture Rewards card will reward you with 10,000 miles if you spend $1,000 in the first three months after receiving the card., Certain travel cards restrict the user’s opportunities to redeem points and miles. You should select a card that has few restrictions, and allows you to redeem points, miles, and other benefits as liberally as possible. Some cards have extensive blackout dates that prohibit travel, or—if they’re general travel cards—restrict the airlines and hotels you can purchase from.Avoid these cards if possible.


Investigating a card’s travel blackout days is a good way to start checking up on the card’s flexibility.
For example, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card has no blackout dates, and doesn’t restrict which website you purchase tickets and hotel reservations through. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Also has no blackout dates or other restrictions., A final aspect of a travel card to consider is its customer service. In addition to the usual customer-service concerns (friendliness, convenience, ease of settling credit disputes), keep in mind that you may need to call your card’s customer service while overseas or in a drastically different time zone. Many top-tier travel cards (including those from Chase Bank and Capital One) will offer 24/7 customer service.When considering service alone, consider applying for a travel card with top-rated customer service, including: American Express, Chase Bank, USAA, or U.S. Bank."

Choose a card with low annual fees.,
Find a card with a low spending minimum.,
Ask about foreign transaction fees.",How to Choose a Credit Card for Travel Rewards2," The “catch” to many travel credit cards is the mandatory annual fee, which can range from $50–100.The card company will charge you this fee regardless of how much money you charge to the card, and whether or not you take advantage of the travel-rewards benefits. In order to minimize your expenditure, look for a card with low fees.


If you plan to travel, fly, and stay in hotels a substantial amount annually, you may decide that the annual fee is worth the financial setback.

, All travel cards will require that a minimum amount of charges be made to the card every month, in order for the card to remain open and for the user to redeem their travel rewards. If you’re applying for a travel card for the first time, look for one with a low spending minimum; avoid cards that require you to spend more than $1,000 a month.If you’re an experienced travel-card user, you may want to look into cards with higher spending minimums. These cards sometimes offset the higher minimum with more substantial rewards programs.
Rather than changing your spending habits, look for ways that you can meet the card’s minimum spending requirements through everyday shopping, such as buying groceries and gas for your car.

, If you plan to travel internationally, your travel card may add on an extra transaction fee; 3% is the most common amount. While credit cards usually provide a good exchange rate overseas, a transaction fee can quickly add up on top of your regular travel expenses.Some travel cards dispense with foreign transaction fees altogether. Consider one of these (such as the Capital One Venture Card) if you plan to travel internationally. These cards may also remove other aspects of the rewards program, though, so don’t assume that all travel cards function alike.

Check your credit score.,
Evaluate the risk of signing up for multiple travel-rewards cards.,
Find out the best time to apply for the card.,
Think about your current financial situation.,
Look into a cash-back credit card as well.",How to Choose a Credit Card for Travel Rewards3," Before you start applying for credit cards, you’ll need to know your credit score, as this will directly influence your likelihood of acceptance for more high-level cards. You can obtain a free credit report at the AnnualCreditReport website.Credit scores range from 300 to 850, and a higher score reflects a better credit rating. Scores higher than 690 are considered “Good,” while scores from 630–689 are considered “Fair.”If you have a low credit score (630 or below), you will likely be declined from many of the credit cards that offer substantial credit rewards. In this case, you should wait to apply again for a credit card until you have raised your credit score.
To raise your credit score, pay off all outstanding bills (including credit card bills), avoid accumulating more debt, and develop the habit of fully paying off your credit card balance each month.

, Some individuals may decide to simultaneously open several travel-rewards cards, in hopes of amassing a large number of miles and points quickly. While this plan has obvious benefits—it’ll allow you to travel extensively more quickly—there are also several drawbacks. Multiple cards will dramatically increase the annual fees you pay, and will also multiply the minimum purchase you must make.To determine if you should apply for multiple travel cards, calculate the total spending minimums and annual fees for the cards, and weigh this figure against the potential dollar amount of travel awards you will receive.
For example, if you apply for three cards and the fees total $300, plus a minimum of $3,000 in spending fees (assuming that you wouldn’t be spending all $3,000 anyway), and the trip that the travel rewards will fund only costs $2,500, you’ll be losing money by opening multiple cards.

, In order to pique interest among potential applicants, many travel credit card companies offer additional sign-up bonuses at different times of the year. For example, cards may throw in free miles or extra points for new applicants. Cobranded airline cards and general travel cards often increase sign-up bonuses in November, while cobranded hotel cards often add sign-up rewards in August.Find out the best time to apply for your card of choice by reviewing its sign-up agreement or website information.

, No matter how lucrative the deals offered by credit card companies may be, you’re still going to have to spend money in order to use the card and receive the rewards. Take stock of your current situation before opening any new credit card; if you’re in debt—including student debt—or in a low-income job that will not allow you to increase your spending patterns in order to earn travel rewards, you may be better off waiting to apply for a travel card.


Of course, if you already have credit-card debt, avoid opening any new credit cards. Focus on paying off the credit-card debt you already have before opening a new card.

, If you are not committed to using a specific airline or hotel chain, consider applying for a credit card which offers a cash-back program. Although cash-back does not directly apply to travel benefits, cash-back cards are versatile and impose no restrictions on where or how you apply the refund money towards travel.Cards including the Chase Sapphire Preferred and the Capital One Venture Rewards allow travel miles to be redeemed for cash.
Discover credit cards often offer a 5% cashback return on all purchases made, although the store types switch bi-monthly. None of the cashback rewards are travel-centered.

For this reason, they will ask about your income. Be sure that you're including all of the right people when you count your income.


Although applicants can no longer count their ""household income"" when applying for a credit card, if you are married, you are allowed to count you and your spouse's joint incomes (as long as their income is available to help you make payments). Just remember, more people usually means more income, and the more income you have, the more easily you will qualify for a card.;
, If you make more money, you seem like less of a credit risk, because you have more of it to repay your debts. A lot of people work gigs and side jobs throughout the year to make a little extra money. You are entitled to include all of your income, and not just your primary source of income, when you are applying for a credit card. Whether that is a musical gig at the local bar or mowing your neighbors' grass, if it brings in money, it counts.


Also remember to include alimony, government benefits, investments, and child support., The fewer standing expenses you have, the more money you have to pay for your credit card. If you have a car payment, consider trading in for a less expensive model. If you rent furniture and appliances, purchase them instead, even if you have to buy your furnishings one by one rather than in sets. Consider refinancing your home to reduce your mortgage payment, or relocating to a less expensive property if you rent.

, If you already have credit cards, consider transferring some of the balance of higher interest cards to lower interest ones, saving you money on interest. The less you spend on interest, the more money you have, which makes you seem like less of a credit risk. While it's best to split your balances among different credit cards, you can still minimize the interest you're paying.Make sure your debt to limit ratio is low on every card. If you have $500 of debt on your American Express card with a $1,000 limit, your AmEx card has a debt to limit ratio of 1:2. If you have $300 of debt on a Visa card with a $4,000 limit, your Visa card has a debt to limit ratio of about 1:13. You don't want to appear to be maxed out on any one card, so if you find yourself in a situation like this, you should move $400 of debt on your AmEX card over to your Visa card so that your new ratios are 1:10 and about 1:5., Your potential creditor wants to know that you have a viable way of paying the bill, and without a checking account, that's very difficult to do. The credit card application will ask you if you have one or both, and having both is really good; it makes them think that you must have money leftover, tucked away in case of emergency.

, Before applying for any type of credit card, you need to know what your prospective creditors will know. The most important factors for obtaining credit cards, are your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, along with certain information in your credit report.

, Your credit score is a numerical value derived from the information contained in your credit report.A credit score can fall anywhere from 850-300, with 850 being the best credit risk and 300 being the worst. Any score over 700 is considered very good, but nearly 20% of US consumers have scores above 800. Since different cards are targeted towards consumers in different credit ranges, it is important to know your score before you apply for a credit card. The different factors determining your credit score are weighted as follows:Payment history: 35%. Whether or not you paid credit bills on time is the single most important factor in determining your score. Credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans (like car payments), finance company accounts, and mortgage loans are the type of credit account that factor into payment history. Late payments, wage garnishments, foreclosures, and liens all negatively affect this component of your credit score.Amounts owed: 30%. This includes total amount owed, and the amount owed on different accounts. Generally, it's better to have a small balance than none at all.Length of credit history: 15%. The longer the better.
Types of credit: 10%.
Number of new accounts: 10%. Opening up many new credit accounts at once can be a red flag, so its best to avoid it if you can.

, You can use either Experian (888-397-3742), Trans Union (800-916-8800), or Equifax (1-800-685-1111). You can also take advantage of http://www.annualcreditreport.com to obtain your free yearly report.


Check the report for inaccuracies. A 2013 study by the Federal Trade Commission found that one out of four consumers have errors on their credit reports that affect their scores, and one in twenty had a serious error on their report.Therefore, taking this step is crucial.
If you have a low credit score, there are things you can do (or avoid) to improve your score.

, If you do find an inaccurate item on your credit report, you do have some recourse. First, write a letter disputing the item with the credit reporting agency, forwarding any supporting documents along with your dispute letter. The credit reporting agency will investigate, contacting whatever agency is listing the negative item. Many times, this will resolve any issues. If it does not, then follow the same procedure directly with the agency listing the negative item.To ensure that your dispute letter arrives where it should, it is best to send your dispute letters by certified mail.
If, after filing dispute letters with both the credit reporter and the company or agency listing the negative item, you still cannot have the item removed, you may pay the credit agency to add the dispute plus the supporting documents to your credit report. , Your debt-to-income ratio is calculated by adding up all of your monthly debt payments, and then dividing them by your gross monthly income. It's what tells a potential creditor how much money you have to pay any debt you incur with them. The lower your debt-to-income ratio, the more willing a creditor will be to extend credit.So, if your mortgage was $1000, your student loan payment $500, and your car payment $500, you would have $2000 in monthly debt payments. If you made $4000 a month, then your debt-to-income ratio is 50%.

, Now that you know your credit score, your debt-to-income-ratio, and have an accurate credit report, you have the information you need to apply for the right type of card. There are many creditors who service the low income market. Consumers in the US can find a sample listing here, and Australian consumers can find a comprehensive list here.

, A partially secured credit card can sometimes be the best option for low income earners. With a partially secured card, the applicant pays a deposit (less than the credit limit) to the card company, thereby securing the debt. Then, the cardholder uses the card like normal, and pays the card off like normal. When you close the account, you get back the deposit., If you don't qualify for a partially secured card, consider a fully secured one. The credit limit will be equal to the deposit, but the fees and interest rates are usually better on a fully secured card than a partially secured card. As long as you make sure to get a secured card that reports to the credit reporting agencies, then you will be building credit at little to no risk for the lender., A cosigner agrees to pay any outstanding debt you cannot pay, which can make you more appealing to the card company and help you build up better credit. Be aware that you are risking your friend or family member's credit score when they cosign, so make sure you are responsible with your spending and your payments.Talk to the person you want to cosign on your credit card and discuss ground rules for their participation.Set up email and text alerts to remind you to pay on time, or agree that you will not spend more than 30% of the monthly limit."

Vendors will see your credit card as a “regular” card and won’t know that it is secured.You may be able to find a bank that will grant you a credit limit that is a bit higher than the amount that you deposit. However, in most cases, your ""credit"" will be limited by the amount that you have in the account. That way, the bank will be assured that they will get paid.;
, Even though the credit card is secured, you still need to do some research and pick a good offer. Secured cards have rules and interest rates that make some offers better than others. You should do some research and find the offer that best fits your needs.Check with your own bank first. The local bank that you already use for savings or checking may offer a secured credit card plan that can help you.

Not all secured cards will do this. When you apply, check the contract to find out. If the contract does not say, ask the lending manager.The three major credit reporting agencies in the U.S. are Equifax, TransUnion and Experian.
